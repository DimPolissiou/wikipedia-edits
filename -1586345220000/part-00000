He and the abbot reached an agreement over which of the abbey's own peasants could move to the new town. The von Klingen family granted extensive lands around the city to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] between 1251 and 1268. The knights owned so much property that in 1268 they moved their order house from Leuggern to Klingnau. They were given a separate gate in the city walls.  Walther of Klingen sold the city and surroundings to his cousin the [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of [[Bishop of Constance|Constance]] Eberhard von Waldburg in 1269.  The new owner then appointed a [[bailiff]] in the town.  Klingnau became the seat of an outer district that included [[Koblenz]], [[Siglistorf]], [[Mellstorf]], [[D\u00f6ttingen, Switzerland|D\u00f6ttingen]] and [[Zurzach]]. In 1314, Klingnau was granted [[town privileges]].  Every year at [[midsummer]] the citizens were allowed to elect their lower and upper town council and a municipal court.  In 1416, the Knights' order house moved back to Leuggern. Until 1800, an administrator managed the Knights' property.  From 1415 until 1798, Klingnau was one of the three external districts of the [[county of Baden]] during the reign of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\nIn the 17th century, some [[History of the Jews in Switzerland|Jewish]] families occasionally lived in Klingnau, and operated the cattle trade for the town. The last bailiff, Joseph Haefelin, lost his post in 1798. As a replacement for the bailiffs, the citizens choose a five-member council. In March 1803, the council was removed by the municipality and replaced with a single [[Landammann|Amtmann]].\n\nThe growth of the municipal economy was repeatedly interrupted by disasters like the great fire of 1586 in which 84 houses were destroyed, or the [[Black Death|plague]] of 1611 and 1635. The plague of 1611 killed 226 people, about one third of the population.  The [[typhoid]] epidemic of 1813\u201314 killed about 3,000 people in and around the town, especially soldiers of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|allies]] against [[Napoleon]], who were passing through.  They were buried in a mass grave at the Imperial Cemetery north of the town.\n\nThe course of the Aare was correct between 1885\u20131904 in order to combat the devastating floods.  Between 1931 and 1935, the Klingnau power plant was built for Aarewerke AG, by [[dam]]ming the river.  The lake (''Klingnauer Stausee'') has developed into a resting place for migratory birds and became a cantonal sanctuary in 1989.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nAt the time of city foundation, the area was part of the [[parish]] of Zurzach. In 1256 Walter of Klingen granted rights to [[tithe]]s in the town to the ''kilchen ze Clingnow''. In 1265 the [[collegiate church]] of Zurzach posted a permanent [[curate]] to Klingnau.  In 1360 the parish of Klingnau included the city, the Chapel of Koblenz and the churches in D\u00f6ttingen and W\u00fcrenlingen.  In this year the Bishop of Constance, Heinrich von Brandis, granted the [[parish church]] to the monastery Zurzach.  In 1864 the selection of the parish priest went to the parish, and about two years later the rights and obligations of the congregation to the church at Zurzach were abolished.  The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] parish church of St. Catherine was built in 1491 and was renovated in 1968\u201369.  The Loreto Chapel on the ''Achenberg'' dates from 1660\u201362 while the [[Swiss Reformed Church|Reformed]] church was built in 1935.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe construction of the castle, originally the seat of the Klingen family, was started in 1240. Until 1269 a [[manor house]] stood on the grounds. After 1331 the outer walls were added.  In the second half of the 14th Century the Bishop of Constance was often a resident in the castle. He ordered further improvements and expansions.  In the late 16th Century, the castle, which was the seat of the Governor from Constance, in such bad condition that the Confederates demanded a renovation from the bishop.  In 1804 the castle went to the newly formed Canton of Aargau, who auctioned it off in 1817.  As a result, it has been used by various industries, until the 20th Century when it was taken over by a foundation.<ref name=HDS/>\n[[File:Wasserkraftwerk Klingnau.JPG|thumb|The hydroelectric plant and reservoir at Klingnau]]\nIn 1250 the provost of the monastery of St. Blaise moved his headquarters from D\u00f6ttingen to Klingnau.  The [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] buildings of the Provost's house, the third such structure in the same place, was built by Johann Caspar Bagnato in 1746\u201353.  The building was sold in 1812.  It now serves as a school.\n\nEast of the town, on the main road is the only monastery of the [[Hermits of Saint William]] in Switzerland.  The monastery was founded in 1269 and was incorporated in 1725 into the monastery of St. Blaise.\n\nThe major sources of income for the inhabitants of the city were agriculture, handicrafts and [[viticulture]].  Already in the 13th and 14th Centuries the ''Klingnauer'' [[wine]] was sold in large quantities.  In 1780 there were about {{convert|115|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s recorded about 115 hectares of vineyards.  The spread of [[phylloxera]] after 1900 led to a sharp decline, from which the wine industry did not recover until after 1930.  The first industrial enterprises ([[raw silk]] production, weaving, [[straw plaiting]] and veneer factories) emerged around 1840.  The construction of the railway line Turgi-Koblenz in 1859 gave the regional economic development further boosts and attracted a shoe factory ([[Bally Shoe]]s), a cigar box factory and a baby carriage factory.  From the turn of the century until the 1980s, most of the companies in the Swiss wood and furniture industry were in and around Klingnau.  In 1975 there were 496 employees in 14 factories of the Swiss wood and furniture industry.  By 1985 the number of employees had risen to 648 but there were only eight factories.  While the largest companies remained, between 1960 and 1989, at least 20 medium and small companies went under.  During that same time, many of the old wood and metal-working companies were replaced with high-tech and engineering companies.  In 2000, the industrial sector still accounts for almost half of the jobs in the community.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n==Geography==\nKlingnau has an area, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, of {{convert|6.71|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.

He and the abbot reached an agreement over which of the abbey's own peasants could move to the new town. The von Klingen family granted extensive lands around the city to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] between 1251 and 1268. The knights owned so much property that in 1268 they moved their order house from Leuggern to Klingnau. They were given a separate gate in the city walls.  Walther of Klingen sold the city and surroundings to his cousin the [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of [[Bishop of Constance|Constance]] Eberhard von Waldburg in 1269.  The new owner then appointed a [[bailiff]] in the town.  Klingnau became the seat of an outer district that included [[Koblenz]], [[Siglistorf]], [[Mellstorf]], [[D\u00f6ttingen, Switzerland|D\u00f6ttingen]] and [[Zurzach]]. In 1314, Klingnau was granted [[town privileges]].  Every year at [[midsummer]] the citizens were allowed to elect their lower and upper town council and a municipal court.  In 1416, the Knights' order house moved back to Leuggern. Until 1800, an administrator managed the Knights' property.  From 1415 until 1798, Klingnau was one of the three external districts of the [[county of Baden]] during the reign of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\nIn the 17th century, some [[History of the Jews in Switzerland|Jewish]] families occasionally lived in Klingnau, and operated the cattle trade for the town. The last bailiff, Joseph Haefelin, lost his post in 1798. As a replacement for the bailiffs, the citizens choose a five-member council. In March 1803, the council was removed by the municipality and replaced with a single [[Landammann|Amtmann]].\n\nThe growth of the municipal economy was repeatedly interrupted by disasters like the great fire of 1586 in which 84 houses were destroyed, or the [[Black Death|plague]] of 1611 and 1635. The plague of 1611 killed 226 people, about one third of the population.  The [[typhoid]] epidemic of 1813\u201314 killed about 3,000 people in and around the town, especially soldiers of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|allies]] against [[Napoleon]], who were passing through.  They were buried in a mass grave at the Imperial Cemetery north of the town.\n\nThe course of the Aare was correct between 1885\u20131904 in order to combat the devastating floods.  Between 1931 and 1935, the Klingnau power plant was built for Aarewerke AG, by [[dam]]ming the river.  The lake (''Klingnauer Stausee'') has developed into a resting place for migratory birds and became a cantonal sanctuary in 1989.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nAt the time of city foundation, the area was part of the [[parish]] of Zurzach. In 1256 Walter of Klingen granted rights to [[tithe]]s in the town to the ''kilchen ze Clingnow''. In 1265 the [[collegiate church]] of Zurzach posted a permanent [[curate]] to Klingnau.  In 1360 the parish of Klingnau included the city, the Chapel of Koblenz and the churches in D\u00f6ttingen and W\u00fcrenlingen.  In this year the Bishop of Constance, Heinrich von Brandis, granted the [[parish church]] to the monastery Zurzach.  In 1864 the selection of the parish priest went to the parish, and about two years later the rights and obligations of the congregation to the church at Zurzach were abolished.  The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] parish church of St. Catherine was built in 1491 and was renovated in 1968\u201369.  The Loreto Chapel on the ''Achenberg'' dates from 1660\u201362 while the [[Swiss Reformed Church|Reformed]] church was built in 1935.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe construction of the castle, originally the seat of the Klingen family, was started in 1240. Until 1269 a [[manor house]] stood on the grounds. After 1331 the outer walls were added.  In the second half of the 14th Century the Bishop of Constance was often a resident in the castle. He ordered further improvements and expansions.  In the late 16th Century, the castle, which was the seat of the Governor from Constance, in such bad condition that the Confederates demanded a renovation from the bishop.  In 1804 the castle went to the newly formed Canton of Aargau, who auctioned it off in 1817.  As a result, it has been used by various industries, until the 20th Century when it was taken over by a foundation.<ref name=HDS/>\n[[File:Wasserkraftwerk Klingnau.JPG|thumb|The hydroelectric plant and reservoir at Klingnau]]\nIn 1250 the provost of the monastery of St. Blaise moved his headquarters from D\u00f6ttingen to Klingnau.  The [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] buildings of the Provost's house, the third such structure in the same place, was built by Johann Caspar Bagnato in 1746\u201353.  The building was sold in 1812.  It now serves as a school.\n\nEast of the town, on the main road is the only monastery of the [[Hermits of Saint William]] in Switzerland.  The monastery was founded in 1269 and was incorporated in 1725 into the monastery of St. Blaise.\n\nThe major sources of income for the inhabitants of the city were agriculture, handicrafts and [[viticulture]].  Already in the 13th and 14th Centuries the ''Klingnauer'' [[wine]] was sold in large quantities.  In 1780 there were about {{convert|115|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s recorded about 115 hectares of vineyards.  The spread of [[phylloxera]] after 1900 led to a sharp decline, from which the wine industry did not recover until after 1930.  The first industrial enterprises ([[raw silk]] production, weaving, [[straw plaiting]] and veneer factories) emerged around 1840.  The construction of the railway line Turgi-Koblenz in 1859 gave the regional economic development further boosts and attracted a shoe factory ([[Bally Shoe]]s), a cigar box factory and a baby carriage factory.  From the turn of the century until the 1980s, most of the companies in the Swiss wood and furniture industry were in and around Klingnau.  In 1975 there were 496 employees in 14 factories of the Swiss wood and furniture industry.  By 1985 the number of employees had risen to 648 but there were only eight factories.  While the largest companies remained, between 1960 and 1989, at least 20 medium and small companies went under.  During that same time, many of the old wood and metal-working companies were replaced with high-tech and engineering companies.  In 2000, the industrial sector still accounts for almost half of the jobs in the community.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n==Geography==\nKlingnau has an area, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, of {{convert|6.71|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.

Instead, the machines were re-purposed to create [[military chocolate (United States)]] D ration bars for the soldiers in World War II. According to military historians, these chocolate D rations served two purposes: as a morale boost, and as a high-energy, pocket-sized emergency ration.  The ingredients of these four ounce bars were a blend of chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk powder and oat flour containing 600 calories.  The specification for the D ration chocolate bars was that it had to \u201ca little better than a boiled potato\u201d so troops would only use them for emergencies.<ref>https://www.interesly.com/military-chocolate-bar-boiled-potato/</ref>  By the end of World War II, Hershey's had produced more than 3 billion D ration chocolate bars.<ref>https://www.history.com/news/hersheys-chocolate-allied-d-day-rations-wwii</ref>\n\n==Popularity==\nKisses are one of the most popular brands of candies in the US.

This idea was the suggestion of John Figi, owner of Figi's \u201cGifts in Good Taste\u201d - a mail order food gifts company based in Marshfield, Wisconsin. The green and red colored wrapped chocolates were featured for the first time in the Figi's Christmas catalog.  \nIn 1968, pastel blue, pink, and green wrappers were introduced for [[Easter]], and in 1986, [[Valentine's Day]]-themed wrappers of red and silver were introduced. Xs and Os have also appeared on pink and red wrappers as well as little red hearts on silver wrappers for Valentine's Day. \"Fall Harvest\" colors were introduced in 1991. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] has silver with red stripes and blue-starred wrappers. Pink wrappers with \"ribbons\" on them to support breast cancer research have also appeared. Camouflage wrappers are also available, primarily on military bases. Kisses Dark Chocolates come in a deep purple wrapper.  The [[Halloween]] themed Kisses Candy Corn candies come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color of a [[candy corn]] with yellow, white and orange stripes swirling around the candy. In 2016 four limited Holiday wrapper varieties were released: Santa hats, Kissmas sweaters that resemble knit Christmas sweaters, Kissmas Trees with plumes that read Fa La La, and Kissmas Presents with plumes that read from me to you. The Christmas themed Kisses Candy Cane candies also come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color pattern (red stripes and white chocolate). The original silver (for regular) and gold (for almonds) wrappers are available year-round.\n\nHershey is introducing new pastel-colored wrappers with white polka dots for the upcoming Easter season. This created controversy within the organization because many workers and environmentalists have requested a more environmentally-friendly packaging, which would have eliminated the aluminum wrapping and replaced it with biodegradable materials. This was supposed to be rolled out on April 1, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Paper plume==\n[[File:Hershey's-Kiss-Wrapped-in-Foil-with-Plume-Sticking-Out.jpg|thumb|The \"KISSES\" paper strip is called a plume and together with silver aluminum foil are the traditional packaging for the Hershey's Milk Chocolate Kiss]].<ref>https://www.hersheys.com/en_us/promotions/kisses/about-hersheys-kisses.html</ref>  All Hershey's KISSES wrappers have the paper strip plume as an identification tag sticking from the top of the foil wrapper.

The Company has also added special variety plumes (such as \"cheesecake\")and special messages have been available for various occasions, including:\n\n=== Seasonal ===\n<!-- Please respect alphabetical order -->\n*Friends all the time\n*Happy Halloween\n*Embrace the Memories\n*Peace train\n*Happy Holidays\n*Double Dip It\n*Hugs forever\n*Love is in the air\n*Rise and Grind\n*Love you to the moon and back\n*Cherish the Memories\n*Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\n*We're all in this together\n*Hippity Hoppity\n\n==Packaging varieties==\n\n* Chinese New Year Gift Box - contains gold and red wrapped Kisses\n\n==Advertising==\n\"[[Christmas Bells (advertisement)|Christmas Bells]]\" is a commercial in which Hershey's Kisses, fashioned as a [[handbell choir]], perform the Christmas [[Carol (music)|carol]] \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\".

This idea was the suggestion of John Figi, owner of Figi's \u201cGifts in Good Taste\u201d - a mail order food gifts company based in Marshfield, Wisconsin. The green and red colored wrapped chocolates were featured for the first time in the Figi's Christmas catalog.  \nIn 1968, pastel blue, pink, and green wrappers were introduced for [[Easter]], and in 1986, [[Valentine's Day]]-themed wrappers of red and silver were introduced. Xs and Os have also appeared on pink and red wrappers as well as little red hearts on silver wrappers for Valentine's Day. \"Fall Harvest\" colors were introduced in 1991. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] has silver with red stripes and blue-starred wrappers. Pink wrappers with \"ribbons\" on them to support breast cancer research have also appeared. Camouflage wrappers are also available, primarily on military bases. Kisses Dark Chocolates come in a deep purple wrapper.  The [[Halloween]] themed Kisses Candy Corn candies come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color of a [[candy corn]] with yellow, white and orange stripes swirling around the candy. In 2016 four limited Holiday wrapper varieties were released: Santa hats, Kissmas sweaters that resemble knit Christmas sweaters, Kissmas Trees with plumes that read Fa La La, and Kissmas Presents with plumes that read from me to you. The Christmas themed Kisses Candy Cane candies also come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color pattern (red stripes and white chocolate). The original silver (for regular) and gold (for almonds) wrappers are available year-round.\n\nHershey is introducing new pastel-colored wrappers with white polka dots for the upcoming Easter season. This created controversy within the organization because many workers and environmentalists have requested a more environmentally-friendly packaging, which would have eliminated the aluminum wrapping and replaced it with biodegradable materials. This was supposed to be rolled out on April 1, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Paper plume==\n[[File:Hershey's-Kiss-Wrapped-in-Foil-with-Plume-Sticking-Out.jpg|thumb|The \"KISSES\" labeled plume and silver aluminum foil are the traditional packaging for the Hershey's Milk Chocolate Kiss]]Hershey's KISSES wrappers have a paper strip called a plume sticking from the top of the foil wrapper.  When the paper plume was added to the KISSES wrapper in 1921, originally it was a flag for the \"Hershey's\" brand, distinguishing Hershey's KISSES from its competitors.<ref>https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/01/priority-hersheys-kisses-got-name-machine-makes-makes-kissing-sounds-appears-kiss-conveyor-belt-onto-chocolate-dispensed/</ref> a few years later in 1924, Hershey received a registered US trademark for its wrapper design, consisting of the conical foil wrapper plus the paper plume.\n\nLater \"Kisses\u00ae\" was printed on the paper plume, as well as other KISSES flavors.  The Company has also added special variety plumes (such as \"cheesecake\")and special messages have been available for various occasions, including:\n\n=== Seasonal ===\n<!-- Please respect alphabetical order -->\n*Friends all the time\n*Happy Halloween\n*Embrace the Memories\n*Peace train\n*Happy Holidays\n*Double Dip It\n*Hugs forever\n*Love is in the air\n*Rise and Grind\n*Love you to the moon and back\n*Cherish the Memories\n*Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\n*We're all in this together\n*Hippity Hoppity\n\n==Packaging varieties==\n\n* Chinese New Year Gift Box - contains gold and red wrapped Kisses\n\n==Advertising==\n\"[[Christmas Bells (advertisement)|Christmas Bells]]\" is a commercial in which Hershey's Kisses, fashioned as a [[handbell choir]], perform the Christmas [[Carol (music)|carol]] \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\".

By 1868 the population of Worthington had grown large enough that Kortenkamp had decided the time had come for a new parish to be established in Worthington.  Construction of a brick building was soon begun and the new parish was dedicated to [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]. The cornerstone of this first building had the inscription, ''\"Romisch Catholische, St. Paulus Kirche, Gebaut 1 Nov. 1868.\"'' The new church took about four years to complete.\n\nAt first the new parish did not have a resident pastor.  Fr. Kortenkamp would come to Worthington once a month to say Mass.

Baumann]]. He began building a new parish school, and also established societies for parishioners. By 1878 the population had grown to the extent that it was necessary to build an extension onto the church. He also built a new rectory, which would serve the pastors until the current rectory was built in 1921. Fr. Baumann left when he was appointed a professor at Columbia College (known today as [[Loras College]]).\n\nBaumann was followed by [[George W. Heer]]. The present church structure began construction in 1883, during Heer's tenure, and dedicated December 3, 1889. This new 54x110-foot building had a spire that stretched {{convert|140|ft|m}} into the air. A statue of St. Paul was placed over the entryway; this statue was a gift from Fr. Baumann. The cost of erecting this building was about $12,000, with the inside unfinished. Heer also had a new 60x60-foot school with nine classrooms built near the church.\n\nHeer was followed by [[James Zigrang]] in December 1889. During Zigrang's tenure as priest, the interior of the church was [[fresco]]ed and new [[Stations of the Cross]] were placed in the church.  After Zigrang returned from the [[Holy Land]] in 1907, he provided the church with a new [[pipe organ]], which continues to serve this church today. He would serve until his death in 1913, having given the last 24 years of his life to St. Paul's parish. Fr. Zigrang was buried in the parish cemetery.\n\n[[J.H. Schilmoeller]] was assigned as pastor of St. Paul's in August 1913. He would be another long-term priest of the parish, who served 39 years at St. Paul's. During his tenure the church was enlarged. He also directed the construction of a Sisters' Home in 1914. This particular convent was the first one in Iowa in which every nun had her own private room.  This 54x44-foot building had 29 rooms.\n\n===Postwar years===\nIn 1956, because of its great size and beauty, Pope Pius XII proclaimed St. Francis Xavier Church a Basilica (among only nine other Basilicas in the USA at that time, and still the only Basilica in a rural area).<ref name=\"anton\" />\n\n==School==\nThere was previously a parish school, St. Paul's School.

The cost of erecting this building was about $12,000, with the inside unfinished. Heer also had a new 60x60-foot school with nine classrooms built near the church.\n\nHeer was followed by [[James Zigrang]] in December 1889. During Zigrang's tenure as priest, the interior of the church was [[fresco]]ed and new [[Stations of the Cross]] were placed in the church.  After Zigrang returned from the [[Holy Land]] in 1907, he provided the church with a new [[pipe organ]], which continues to serve this church today. He would serve until his death in 1913, having given the last 24 years of his life to St. Paul's parish. Fr. Zigrang was buried in the parish cemetery.\n\n[[J.H. Schilmoeller]] was assigned as pastor of St. Paul's in August 1913. He would be another long-term priest of the parish, who served 39 years at St. Paul's. During his tenure the church was enlarged. He also directed the construction of a Sisters' Home in 1914. This particular convent was the first one in Iowa in which every nun had her own private room.  This 54x44-foot building had 29 rooms.\n\n===Postwar years===\nIn 1956, because of its great size and beauty, Pope Pius XII proclaimed St. Francis Xavier Church a Basilica (among only nine other Basilicas in the USA at that time, and still the only Basilica in a rural area).<ref name=\"anton\" />\n\n==School==\nThere was previously a parish school, St. Paul's School. It started circa 1874<!--2015 - 141 = 1884 -->. In 2015 it had 26 students, and closed that year. By 2016 the Worthington city council was considering whether to buy the building so it could be converted into a factory.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wiedemann, Katie|url=https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Worthington-considers-turning-old-school-into-a-small-factory-405085125.html|title=Worthington considers turning old school into a small factory|work=[[KCRG]]|date=2016-12-06|accessdate=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{webarchive|url=http://web.archive.org/*/http://sites.google.com/site/stpaulschoolfamily|title=Saint Paul's Catholic School (sites.google.com/site/stpaulschoolfamily)}} - Hosted on [[Google Sites]]<!--The school seems to be the only component of the church which had a website as https://web.archive.org/web/20110809054112/http://www.arch.pvt.k12.ia.us/Parishes/parishes157-303pz.html shows the school's website in place of the church's-->\n* {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/*/http://www.aea1.k12.ia.us/st-paul/stpaul.html|title=St. Paul's Catholic School (aea1.k12.ia.us/st-paul/stpaul.html)}}<!--Not all dates work but https://web.archive.org/web/20010424205312/http://www.aea1.k12.ia.us/st-paul/stpaul.html works //  Listed at http://web.archive.org/web/20030202120139/http://www.aea1.k12.ia.us/AreaSchools.html -->\n{{Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Paul's Catholic Church, Worthington, Iowa}}\n[[Category:Churches in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque]]\n[[Category:Churches in Dubuque County, Iowa]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Iowa]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1889]]\n[[Category:19th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United States]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in 1868]]\n[[Category:Catholic congregations established in the 19th century]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toKCRG(link changed toKCRG-TV) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul%27s_Catholic_Church_(Worthington,_Iowa)"}
