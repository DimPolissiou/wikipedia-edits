It is among a cluster of stations in the market owned by [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]].  Its transmitter is located blocks from the [[Oklahoma State Capitol]], and studios are located at the [[50 Penn Place]] building on the Northwest side.\n\n==KGCB/KOCY==\n1340 started as KGCB, a church-owned station. It was purchased in the late 1930s by Matthew Bonebrake - a former OPUBCO and WKY radio sales manager - who changed the call letters to KOCY.\n\nIt was a Mutual affiliate during the 1940s and early 1950s. It became Oklahoma City's first full-time Top-40 station in the mid-1950s. It was also the first radio station in the country to offer \"News Every Hour - On the Hour\".\n\nAfter [[WKY]] and KOMA went Top-40, KOCY had a \"funeral\" for their format, by giving away records in a coffin before switching to a MOR format.\n\n==Changes over the airwaves==\nIn the mid-1990s KGHM aired an [[Urban Contemporary]] format in the evenings and overnights as \"The Groove 1340\".\n\nIn 2000, [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] went into an agreement with [[Perry Publishing and Broadcasting|Perry Broadcasting]] to broadcast KVSP/1140 and its Urban format (See [[KRMP]]) on KEBC from 7 pm\u22127 am as \"The Power Jammin' Network after AM 1140 signed off at sunset. Between 7am-7pm KGHM aired Spanish programming.\n\nThe agreement between Clear Channel and Perry Broadcasting discontinued when Perry purchased KRPT-103.5 out of [[Anadarko, Oklahoma]] (See [[KVSP]]) and upgraded the station to target Oklahoma City, then moved KVSP's Urban format to the FM dial. The Spanish format was also dropped as well for Talk format.\n\n==\"Keeping Everybody Country\"==\nKEBC's call letters were previously used for 94.7 KEBC, later a property also owned by Clear Channel. The station's slogan, \"Keeping Everybody Country.\"  Ironically, KEBC's competitor at the time, [[KXXY-FM]], simulcasted their FM signal at 1340 AM.\n\nThe call letters KEBC stood for Electronic Broadcasting Company which was the original ownership of 94.7 KEBC. (Ronnie Tutor- Engineering and Gene Wingate- GM among others)  KEBC originally studioed and transmitted from \"Rambling Ranchstyle studios\" in SE OKC before moving to 31st and Western to studio space owned by Ralph Tyler.\n\nMounting debt to Tyler for rent and other financial obligation created a situation where Tyler became controlling owner of KEBC radio.  After Ralph Tyler's controlling ownership of KEBC, the slogan Keep Everybody Country was formed on a suggestion from a friend of Ralph's.\n\n==Programming==\nKGHM had simulcast some programming of sister station [[KTOK]] along with their own line-up since 2005. In January, 2007, Clear Channel flipped the station to Fox Sports Radio 1340 then later 1340 the game, making it the fourth all-sports station in Oklahoma City. Former Dallas Cowboys play-by-play broadcaster David Garrett was KGHM's sports director, Garrett had worked as sports director for sister station KTOK-AM in the late 1980s before moving on to the NFL. Garrett also hosted an afternoon sports talk show on KGHM from January 2007 to early 2008 and returned to hosting in late spring/early summer of 2008. Garrett was also did play-by-play for some on the Oklahoma City High School Football games that aired on KGHM as well. In early 2013 Garrett was relieved of his duties as Sports director and show host as station owner Clear Channel Radio (Oklahoma City.) was going through some personnel changes at that time. As of Spring 2013-present, KGHM-AM & [[KTOK-AM]]'s current sports director is Randy Renner, a former reporter for Oklahoma City CBS affiliate [[KWTV-TV]].\n\nIn mid March 2003, it was announced that then KEBC-AM would carry the [[Oklahoma City Blazers (1992\u20132009)|Oklahoma City Blazers]] hockey games for the remainder of the 2002-2003 [[Central Hockey League]] season and playoffs following the sale of KEBC-AM & KTOK-AM's then sister station [[WKY-AM]] (Owned by [[Oklahoma Publishing Co]], operated under Clear Channel via a Lease Management Agreement.) to main radio rival [[Citadel Communication corporation]]. KEBC-AM also aired the Blazers radio talk show \"Strictly Hockey Blazers Style\", a weekly show that aired live every Monday night through out the Blazers season from 7:00 PM CST to 8:00 PM CST from the location of an Oklahoma City Restaurant, featured interviews with players, coach's, trainers, team staff etc. KEBC-AM would air the Blazers again for the 2003-2004 season with the Blazers unable to find another station to air their games. The Blazers would return to 1340-AM (Along with the [[Oklahoma City RedHawks]] baseball team having already returned in the spring 2006.) for the 2006-2007 season following a two year stint on [[WKY-AM]] (Now under the ownership of Citadel.) after that station flipped from News/Talk to Spanish. The Blazers would remain on 1340-AM for the remainder of the teams existence until they folded in the Summer of 2009 after 17 seasons. KGHM-AM would also air selected games of the [[Oklahoma City Barons]] (The successor to the Blazers.) Hockey games from 2010-2011 thru the 2014-2015 seasons (When the team folded in the Spring of 2015 after 5 seasons.) whenever there were scheduling or programming conflicts with sister station and primary radio home of the Barons [[KXXY-AM]] (Which also carried Oklahoma State Cowboy football and Men's Basketball games). NOTE: then KOCY-AM was also the station that carried the games of the original Oklahoma City Blazers Hockey Franchise (In the original [[Central Hockey League]].) from around the late 1960s and throughout the mid to late 1970s.                        \n\nKGHM's other programming line up also includes, in addition to national sports, programming from Fox Sports Radio. Local sports talk shows are simulcasted with [[KREF|KREF-AM]] 1400 (Another Fox Sports Radio affiliate) in [[Norman Oklahoma]] with KREF-KGHM on air personalities, coverage and broadcasts of local and national sports, local high school and collage Sports.

Minor League [[Triple-A baseball]] team, the [[Pacific Coast League]] affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]). Starting with the 2015 [[Major League Baseball]] season, the station began carrying select [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] games as part of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] radio network, alongside sister station [[KTOK]]-AM, on days when the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]] are not playing or at the conclusion of the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]] [[Triple-A baseball]], [[Pacific Coast League]] season, the remaining parent club [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] games move to KGHM for the rest of the [[Major League Baseball]] regular season and playoffs.

Traveling to the Byers' home to apologize, he becomes involved in Nancy and Jonathan's fight against the Demogorgon, which they defeat. At the conclusion of the season, Nancy buys Jonathan a new camera and Steve continues his relationship with Nancy.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 2)}}\nSteve's relationship with Nancy is stressed, and he breaks up with her after she will not say she loves him. He calls her out after her drunken tirade at a party where she calls their relationship fake. Steve also finds himself at odds with [[List of Stranger Things characters#Billy Hargrove|Billy Hargrove]], a new student at the school who seeks to become its tough guy. Steve becomes involved with [[Mike Wheeler (Stranger Things)|Mike Wheeler]] and his friends after [[Dustin Henderson|Dustin]] asks him to help find his \"pet\" D'Artagnan, unaware it is a Demogorgon. Steve and Dustin bond over how to talk to girls, and soon Steve takes Mike, Lucas, and Billy's stepsister [[List of Stranger Things characters#Max Mayfield|Max]] under his wing. Steve protects the children as Demodogs start ravaging across Hawkins, giving time for [[Eleven (Stranger Things)|Eleven]] and [[Jim Hopper (Stranger Things)|Jim Hopper]] to close the gate to the Upside Down, and for Will Byers to have the Mind Flayer exorcised from his body.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 3)}}\nNow graduated from high school, Steve works at the Scoops Ahoy! ice cream parlor at Starcourt Mall with Robin Buckley ([[Maya Hawke]]), a former classmate who teases him frequently. Dustin, having returned from science camp and set up a [[ham radio]] tower to talk with his new girlfriend Suzie in Utah, gets Steve's help to translate a Russian radio message he overheard. Robin helps with the translation, indicating a site at the mall, and Lucas' sister Erica (Priah Ferguson) is recruited to sneak into the site in exchange for free ice cream. Steve, Robin, Dustin, and Erica find a secret Russian base under the mall that is attempting to open a portal to the Upside Down. Though Steve and Robin are captured and drugged, Dustin and Erica help save them and return to the surface to warn the others. Whilst coming down off the drugs, Steve admits he is attracted to Robin and learns that Robin is a lesbian, yet accepts her sexuality. In the following battle with the Mind Flayer, Steve helps to stop the possessed Billy from ramming the car that the others are using to escort Eleven away, and joins the rest in distracting the Mind Flayer with fireworks as the gate in the Russian base is shut down. With the mall's destruction from the battle, Steve and Robin lose their jobs at Scoops Ahoy! and get work at the local [[Family Video]].\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe character appears in ''[[Dead by Daylight]]'' as a DLC character along with [[Nancy Wheeler]] as a fellow survivor being hunted by the Demogorgon throughout the Hawkins Lab.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/19/20812070/stranger-things-dead-by-daylight-nancy-wheeler-steve-harrington-demogorgon-chapter |title= ''Stranger Things'' is coming to ''Dead by Daylight'' in a new update |date=2019-08-19 |website=Polygon |language=en |access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe character development of Steve Harrington in the [[Stranger Things 2|second season of the show]] has been met with acclaim and has led to Steve becoming a fan-favorite character and critical darling on the show, and Joe Keery received critical acclaim for his performance.

His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian apologists from many denominations.\n\nIn 1956, Lewis married American writer [[Joy Davidman]]; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis died on 22 November 1963 from kidney failure, one week before his 65th birthday.

He and his brother Warnie created the world of [[Boxen (C. S. Lewis)|Boxen]], inhabited and run by animals.

His father then sent him to live and study at [[Wynyard School]] in [[Watford]], Hertfordshire. Lewis's brother had enrolled there three years previously. The school was closed not long afterward due to a lack of pupils; the headmaster Robert \"Oldie\" Capron was soon after committed to a psychiatric hospital. Lewis then attended [[Campbell College]] in the east of Belfast about a mile from his home, but left after a few months due to respiratory problems. He was then sent to the health-resort town of [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], Worcestershire, where he attended the preparatory school Cherbourg House, which Lewis calls \"Chartres\" in his autobiography. It was during this time that Lewis abandoned his childhood Christian faith and became an atheist, becoming interested in mythology and the occult.{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=56}} In September 1913, Lewis enrolled at [[Malvern College]], where he remained until the following June.

He also grew to love nature; its beauty reminded him of the stories of the North, and the stories of the North reminded him of the beauties of nature. His teenage writings moved away from the tales of Boxen, and he began using different art forms, such as [[epic poetry]] and opera, to try to capture his new-found interest in [[Norse mythology]] and the natural world. Studying with Kirkpatrick (\"The Great Knock\", as Lewis afterward called him) instilled in him a love of [[Greek literature]] and mythology and sharpened his debate and reasoning skills.

Describing an encounter with a fellow Irishman, he wrote: \"Like all Irish people who meet in England, we ended by criticisms on the invincible flippancy and dullness of the Anglo-Saxon race. After all, there is no doubt, ''ami'', that the Irish are the only people: with all their faults, I would not gladly live or die among another folk.\"{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p= 310}} Throughout his life, he sought out the company of other Irish people living in England{{sfn|Clare|2010|pp=21\u201322}} and visited Northern Ireland regularly.

Maureen Moore, Paddy's sister, said that the two made a mutual pact{{sfn|Edwards|2007|p=133}} that if either died during the war, the survivor would take care of both of their families. Paddy was killed in action in 1918 and Lewis kept his promise. Paddy had earlier introduced Lewis to his mother, Jane King Moore, and a friendship quickly sprang up between Lewis, who was 18 when they met, and Jane, who was 45. The friendship with Moore was particularly important to Lewis while he was recovering from his wounds in hospital, as his father did not visit him.\n\nLewis lived with and cared for Moore until she was hospitalised in the late 1940s. He routinely introduced her as his mother, referred to her as such in letters, and developed a deeply affectionate friendship with her. Lewis's own mother had died when he was a child, and his father was distant, demanding, and eccentric.\n\nSpeculation regarding their relationship resurfaced with the 1990 publication of [[A. N. Wilson]]'s biography of Lewis. Wilson (who never met Lewis) attempted to make a case for their having been lovers for a time. Wilson's biography was not the first to address the question of Lewis's relationship with Moore. [[George Sayer]] knew Lewis for 29 years, and he had sought to shed light on the relationship during the period of 14 years prior to Lewis's conversion to Christianity. In his biography ''Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis'', he wrote:\n{{quote |Were they lovers? Owen Barfield, who knew Jack well in the 1920s, once said that he thought the likelihood was \"fifty-fifty\". Although she was twenty-six years older than Jack, she was still a handsome woman, and he was certainly infatuated with her. But it seems very odd, if they were lovers, that he would call her \"mother\". We know, too, that they did not share the same bedroom. It seems most likely that he was bound to her by the promise he had given to Paddy and that his promise was reinforced by his love for her as his second mother.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Jack: A Life of C.

In the introduction to the 1997 edition of his biography of Lewis he wrote:\n{{quote |I have had to alter my opinion of Lewis's relationship with Mrs. Moore.

The Kilns was a house in the district of [[Headington Quarry]] on the outskirts of Oxford, now part of the suburb of [[Risinghurst]]. They all contributed financially to the purchase of the house, which passed to Maureen, who by then was [[Maureen Dunbar|Dame Maureen Dunbar]], when Warren died in 1973.\n\nJane Moore suffered from [[dementia]] in her later years and was eventually moved into a nursing home, where she died in 1951. Lewis visited her every day in this home until her death.\n\n===Return to Christianity===\nLewis was raised in a religious family that attended the [[Church of Ireland]]. He became an atheist at age 15, though he later described his young self as being paradoxically \"very angry with God for not existing\" and \"equally angry with him for creating a world\".{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=115}} His early separation from Christianity began when he started to view his religion as a chore and a duty; around this time, he also gained an interest in the occult, as his studies expanded to include such topics.<ref>''The Critic'', Volume 32, Thomas More Association, 1973. Original from the [[University of Michigan]].</ref> Lewis quoted [[Lucretius]] (''De rerum natura'', 5.198\u20139) as having one of the [[Argument from poor design|strongest arguments]] for atheism:{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=65}}\n\n:{{lang|lt|Nequaquam nobis divinitus esse paratam}}\n:{{lang|lt|Naturam rerum; tanta stat praedita culpa}}\n\nwhich he translated poetically as follows:\n\n:Had God designed the world, it would not be\n:A world so frail and faulty as we see.\n\n(This is a highly poetic, rather than a literal translation.  A more literal translation, by William Ellery Leonard,{{sfn|Lucretius|1916}} reads: \"That in no wise the nature of all things / For us was fashioned by a power divine \u2013 / So great the faults it stands encumbered with.\")\n\nLewis's interest in the works of [[George MacDonald]] was part of what turned him from atheism. This can be seen particularly well through this passage in Lewis's ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', chapter nine, when the semi-autobiographical [[Protagonist|main character]] meets MacDonald in [[Heaven]]:\n{{quote |...&nbsp;I tried, trembling, to tell this man all that his writings had done for me. I tried to tell how a certain frosty afternoon at Leatherhead Station when I had first bought a copy of ''[[Phantastes]]'' (being then about sixteen years old) had been to me what the first sight of Beatrice had been to Dante: ''Here begins the new life''. I started to confess how long that Life had delayed in the region of imagination merely: how slowly and reluctantly I had come to admit that his Christendom had more than an accidental connexion with it, how hard I had tried not to see the true name of the quality which first met me in his books is Holiness.{{sfn|Lewis|2002b|pp=66\u201367}}}}\n\nHe eventually returned to Christianity, having been influenced by arguments with his Oxford colleague and Christian friend [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], whom he seems to have met for the first time on 11 May 1926, and the book ''[[The Everlasting Man]]'' by [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Lewis vigorously resisted conversion, noting that he was brought into Christianity like a prodigal, \"kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance to escape\".{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=229}} He described his last struggle in ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'':\n\n{{quote |You must picture me alone in that room in Magdalen [College, Oxford], night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|pp=228, 229}}}}\n\nAfter his conversion to [[theism]] in 1929, Lewis converted to Christianity in 1931, following a long discussion during a late-night walk along [[Addison's Walk]] with his close friends Tolkien and [[Hugo Dyson]]. He records making a specific commitment to Christian belief while on his way to the zoo with his brother. He became a member of the [[Church of England]]&nbsp;\u2013 somewhat to the disappointment of Tolkien, who had hoped that he would join the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Carpenter|2006}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=March 2012}}{{incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}\n\nLewis was a committed [[Church of England|Anglican]] who upheld a largely orthodox Anglican theology, though in his [[apologetics|apologetic]] writings, he made an effort to avoid espousing any one denomination. In his later writings, some believe that he proposed ideas such as purification of [[venial sin]]s after death in [[purgatory]] (''[[The Great Divorce]]'' and ''[[Letters to Malcolm]]'') and [[mortal sin]] (''[[The Screwtape Letters]]''), which are generally considered to be Roman Catholic teachings, although they are also widely held in Anglicanism (particularly in [[high church]] [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] circles). Regardless, Lewis considered himself an entirely orthodox Anglican to the end of his life, reflecting that he had initially attended church only to receive communion and had been repelled by the hymns and the poor quality of the sermons. He later came to consider himself honoured by worshipping with men of faith who came in shabby clothes and work boots and who sang all the verses to all the hymns.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=147}} In 1935, Lewis and his brother Warren donated a stained glass window in memory of their parents to their childhood church of St. Mark's, Dundela, Belfast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cslewisireland.wordpress.com/2016/05/12/st-marks-dundela/|title=St. Mark's Dundela|last=Cslewisireland|date=12 May 2016|website=C S Lewis's Ireland|access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, the Lewises took child evacuees from London and other cities into [[The Kilns]].<ref name=\"tst\">{{Cite book |title=C.

Earlier that year, the couple took a brief holiday in Greece and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]; Lewis was fond of walking but not of travel, and this marked his only crossing of the English Channel after 1918. Lewis's book ''[[A Grief Observed]]'' describes his experience of bereavement in such a raw and personal fashion that he originally released it under the pseudonym N. W. Clerk to keep readers from associating the book with him. Ironically, many friends recommended the book to Lewis as a method for dealing with his own grief.

His health continued to improve and, according to his friend George Sayer, Lewis was fully himself by early 1963. On 15 July that year, he fell ill and was admitted to the hospital; he suffered a heart attack at 5:00&nbsp;pm the next day and lapsed into a coma, unexpectedly waking the following day at 2:00&nbsp;pm.

The story can be seen as an account of what might have happened if the terrestrial Adam had defeated the serpent and avoided the [[Fall of Man]], with Ransom intervening in the novel to \"ransom\" the new Adam and Eve from the deceptions of the enemy.

One of these, ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', is a short novella in which a few residents of Hell take a bus ride to Heaven, where they are met by people who dwell there. The proposition is that they can stay if they choose, in which case they can call the place where they had come from \"[[Purgatory]]\", instead of \"Hell\", but many find it not to their taste. The title is a reference to [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', a concept that Lewis found a \"disastrous error\". This work deliberately echoes two other more famous works with a similar theme: the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of [[Dante Alighieri]], and Bunyan's ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''.\n\nAnother short work, ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'', consists of letters of advice from senior [[demon]] Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood on the best ways to tempt a particular human and secure his [[Damnation#Religious|damnation]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Screwtape-Letters |title=The Screwtape Letters {{!}} novel by Lewis |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=14 November 2019}}</ref> Lewis's last novel was ''[[Till We Have Faces]]'', which he thought of as his most mature and masterly work of fiction but which was never a popular success. It is a retelling of the myth of [[Cupid and Psyche]] from the unusual perspective of Psyche's sister. It is deeply concerned with religious ideas, but the setting is entirely [[paganism|pagan]], and the connections with specific Christian beliefs are left implicit.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Till-We-Have-Faces |title=Till We Have Faces {{!}} novel by Lewis |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=14 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nBefore Lewis's conversion to Christianity, he published two books: ''[[Spirits in Bondage]]'', a collection of poems, and ''[[Dymer (poem)|Dymer]]'', a single [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]]. Both were published under the pen name Clive Hamilton. Other narrative poems have since been published posthumously, including ''Launcelot'', ''The Nameless Isle'', and ''[[The Queen of Drum]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Narrative Poems. |last=Lewis |first=C.

''Mere Christianity'', ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'', and ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' were all concerned, to one degree or another, with refuting popular objections to Christianity, such as the question, \"How could a good God allow pain to exist in the world?\" He also became a popular lecturer and broadcaster, and some of his writing originated as scripts for radio talks or lectures (including much of ''Mere Christianity'').{{sfn|Lewis|1997|page=}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2012}}\n\nAccording to George Sayer, losing a 1948 debate with [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]], also a Christian, led Lewis to re-evaluate his role as an apologist, and his future works concentrated on devotional literature and children's books.<ref name=\"rilstone-refuted\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aslan.demon.co.uk/cslfaq.htm#_Toc5085891 |title=Were Lewis's proofs of the existence of God from 'Miracles' refuted by Elizabeth Anscombe? |last=Rilstone |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Rilstone |website=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Alt.books.cs-lewis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021202084439/http://www.aslan.demon.co.uk/cslfaq.htm#_Toc5085891 |archive-date=2 December 2002}}</ref> Anscombe had a completely different recollection of the debate's outcome and its emotional effect on Lewis.<ref name=rilstone-refuted /> Victor Reppert also disputes Sayer, listing some of Lewis's post-1948 apologetic publications, including the second and revised edition of his ''Miracles'' in 1960, in which Lewis addressed Anscombe's criticism.<ref name=\"Reppert 2005 https://books.google.com/books?id=hn1gaNlri1cC&pg=PA266 266\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/chroniclesofnarn00bass/page/ |title=The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy: The Lion, the Witch, and the Worldview |last=Reppert |first=Victor |publisher=[[Open Court Publishing Company]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8126-9588-5 |editor-last=Gregory Bassham and Jerry L.

Certainly, Anscombe herself believed that Lewis's argument, though flawed, was getting at something very important; she thought that this came out more in the improved version of it that Lewis presented in a subsequent edition of ''Miracles''&nbsp;\u2013 though that version also had 'much to criticize in it'.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Philosophy of Elizabeth Anscombe |last=Teichman |first=Roger |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0199299331 |page=3}}</ref>\n\nLewis wrote an autobiography titled ''Surprised by Joy'', which places special emphasis on his own conversion.<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> He also wrote many essays and public speeches on Christian belief, many of which were collected in ''[[God in the Dock]]'' and ''[[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/God_in_the_Dock.html?id=loE7BAAAQBAJ |title=God in the Dock |last=Lewis |first=C.

Lewis, an expert on the subject of allegory, maintained that the books were not allegory, and preferred to call the Christian aspects of them \"[[supposition]]al\". As Lewis wrote in a letter to a Mrs. Hook in December 1958:\n{{quote|\nIf Aslan represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair <nowiki>[</nowiki>a character in ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''<nowiki>]</nowiki> represents despair, he would be an allegorical figure. In reality, he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, 'What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?' This is not allegory at all.{{sfn|Martindale|Root|1990|pp=}}\n}}\n\n====\"Trilemma\"====\n{{Main|Lewis's trilemma}}\nIn a much-cited passage from ''Mere Christianity'', Lewis challenged the view that Jesus was a great moral teacher but not God. He argued that Jesus made several implicit claims to divinity, which would logically exclude that claim:\n\n{{quote|I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic&nbsp;\u2013 on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg&nbsp;\u2013 or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=43}}}}\n\nAlthough this argument is sometimes called \"Lewis's trilemma\", Lewis did not invent it but rather developed and popularised it. It has also been used by Christian apologist [[Josh McDowell]] in his book ''More Than a Carpenter''.<ref>{{Harvard citation|McDowell|2001}}</ref> It has been widely repeated in Christian apologetic literature, but largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The incarnation: an interdisciplinary symposium on the incarnation of the Son of God |last=Davis |first=Stephen T. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-927577-9 |editor-last=Stephen T.

In the first five chapters of ''Mere Christianity'', Lewis discusses the idea that people have a standard of behaviour to which they expect people to adhere. Lewis claims that people all over the earth know what this law is and when they break it. He goes on to claim that there must be someone or something behind such a universal set of principles.{{sfn|Lindskoog|2001|p=144}}\n{{quote|\nThese then are the two points that I wanted to make. First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=21}}\n}}\nLewis also portrays Universal Morality in his works of fiction. In ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' he describes Universal Morality as the \"deep magic\" which everyone knew.{{sfn|Lindskoog|2001|p=146}}\n\nIn the second chapter of ''Mere Christianity'', Lewis recognises that \"many people find it difficult to understand what this Law of Human Nature&nbsp;... is.\" And he responds first to the idea \"that the Moral Law is simply our herd instinct\" and second to the idea \"that the Moral Law is simply a social convention\". In responding to the second idea Lewis notes that people often complain that one set of moral ideas is better than another, but that this actually argues for there existing some \"Real Morality\" to which they are comparing other moralities. Finally, he notes that sometimes differences in moral codes are exaggerated by people who confuse differences in beliefs about morality with differences in beliefs about facts:\n\n{{quote |I have met people who exaggerate the differences, because they have not distinguished between differences of morality and differences of belief about facts. For example, one man said to me, \"Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death. Was that what you call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct?\" But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did&nbsp;\u2013 if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy [[quisling]]s did. There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are there. You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=26}}}}\n\nLewis also had fairly progressive views on the topic of \"animal morality\", in particular the suffering of animals, as is evidenced by several of his essays: most notably, ''On Vivisection''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.irishantivivisection.org/cslewis.html |title=Vivisection by CS<!--sic--> Lewis |last=Lewis |first=C.

He is best known for his works of fiction, especially ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', and ''[[The Space Trilogy]]'', and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'', and ''[[The Problem of Pain]]''.\n\nLewis and fellow novelist [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] were close friends. They both served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the [[Inklings]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Inklings: C. S. Lewis, J. R.

Lewis returned to [[Anglicanism]] at the age of 32, owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, and he became an \"ordinary layman of the Church of England\".{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=6}} Lewis's faith profoundly affected his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.\n\nLewis wrote more than 30 books<ref>Richard B. Cunningham, ''C. S. Lewis: Defender of the Faith'', Wipf and Stock Publishers (2008), p. 14</ref> which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' have sold the most and have been popularised on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian apologists from many denominations.\n\nIn 1956, Lewis married American writer [[Joy Davidman]]; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis died on 22 November 1963 from kidney failure, one week before his 65th birthday. In 2013, on the 50th anniversary of his death, Lewis was honoured with a memorial in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Little Lea.JPG|thumb|Little Lea, home of the Lewis family from 1905 to 1930]]\nClive Staples Lewis was born in [[Belfast]], Ireland<!-- not \"Northern Ireland, because Northern Ireland did not exist at the time -->, on 29 November 1898.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=34512|title=Lewis, Clive Staples (1898\u20131963)|origyear=2004|year=2008|last=Bennett|first=Jack Arthur Walter|last2=Plaskitt|first2=Emma Lisa}}</ref> His father was Albert James Lewis (1863\u20131929), a solicitor whose father Richard had come to Ireland from Wales during the mid-19th century.

He and his brother Warnie created the world of [[Boxen (C. S. Lewis)|Boxen]], inhabited and run by animals. Lewis loved to read; his father's house was filled with books, and he felt that finding a book to read was as easy as walking into a field and \"finding a new blade of grass\".{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=10}}\n{{Quote box|align=right|quote=<poem>\nThe New House is almost a major character in my story.\nI am the product of long corridors, empty sunlit rooms,\nupstair indoor silences, attics explored in solitude,\ndistant noises of gurgling cisterns and pipes,\nand the noise of wind under the tiles.

His father then sent him to live and study at [[Wynyard School]] in [[Watford]], Hertfordshire. Lewis's brother had enrolled there three years previously. The school was closed not long afterward due to a lack of pupils; the headmaster Robert \"Oldie\" Capron was soon after committed to a psychiatric hospital. Lewis then attended [[Campbell College]] in the east of Belfast about a mile from his home, but left after a few months due to respiratory problems. He was then sent to the health-resort town of [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], Worcestershire, where he attended the preparatory school Cherbourg House, which Lewis calls \"Chartres\" in his autobiography. It was during this time that Lewis abandoned his childhood Christian faith and became an atheist, becoming interested in mythology and the occult.{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=56}} In September 1913, Lewis enrolled at [[Malvern College]], where he remained until the following June. He found the school socially competitive.{{sfn|Lewis|1966a|p=107}} After leaving Malvern, he studied privately with [[William T.

He also grew to love nature; its beauty reminded him of the stories of the North, and the stories of the North reminded him of the beauties of nature. His teenage writings moved away from the tales of Boxen, and he began using different art forms, such as [[epic poetry]] and opera, to try to capture his new-found interest in [[Norse mythology]] and the natural world. Studying with Kirkpatrick (\"The Great Knock\", as Lewis afterward called him) instilled in him a love of [[Greek literature]] and mythology and sharpened his debate and reasoning skills. In 1916, Lewis was awarded a scholarship at [[University College, Oxford]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cslewis.com/us/about-cs-lewis |title=About C.S.

He developed a particular fondness for [[W. B. Yeats]], in part because of Yeats's use of Ireland's Celtic heritage in poetry.

After all, there is no doubt, ''ami'', that the Irish are the only people: with all their faults, I would not gladly live or die among another folk.\"{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p= 310}} Throughout his life, he sought out the company of other Irish people living in England{{sfn|Clare|2010|pp=21\u201322}} and visited Northern Ireland regularly. In 1958 he spent his honeymoon there at the Old Inn, [[Crawfordsburn]],{{sfn|The Old Inn|2007|p=}} which he called \"my Irish life\".{{sfn|Lewis|1993|p=93}}\n\nVarious critics have suggested that it was Lewis's dismay over the sectarian conflict in his native Belfast which led him to eventually adopt such an [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] brand of Christianity.{{sfn|Wilson|1991|p=xi}} As one critic has said, Lewis \"repeatedly extolled the virtues of all branches of the Christian faith, emphasising a need for unity among Christians around what the Catholic writer {{nowrap|G.

Maureen Moore, Paddy's sister, said that the two made a mutual pact{{sfn|Edwards|2007|p=133}} that if either died during the war, the survivor would take care of both of their families. Paddy was killed in action in 1918 and Lewis kept his promise. Paddy had earlier introduced Lewis to his mother, Jane King Moore, and a friendship quickly sprang up between Lewis, who was 18 when they met, and Jane, who was 45. The friendship with Moore was particularly important to Lewis while he was recovering from his wounds in hospital, as his father did not visit him.\n\nLewis lived with and cared for Moore until she was hospitalised in the late 1940s. He routinely introduced her as his mother, referred to her as such in letters, and developed a deeply affectionate friendship with her. Lewis's own mother had died when he was a child, and his father was distant, demanding, and eccentric.\n\nSpeculation regarding their relationship resurfaced with the 1990 publication of [[A. N. Wilson]]'s biography of Lewis. Wilson (who never met Lewis) attempted to make a case for their having been lovers for a time. Wilson's biography was not the first to address the question of Lewis's relationship with Moore. [[George Sayer]] knew Lewis for 29 years, and he had sought to shed light on the relationship during the period of 14 years prior to Lewis's conversion to Christianity. In his biography ''Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis'', he wrote:\n{{quote |Were they lovers? Owen Barfield, who knew Jack well in the 1920s, once said that he thought the likelihood was \"fifty-fifty\". Although she was twenty-six years older than Jack, she was still a handsome woman, and he was certainly infatuated with her. But it seems very odd, if they were lovers, that he would call her \"mother\". We know, too, that they did not share the same bedroom. It seems most likely that he was bound to her by the promise he had given to Paddy and that his promise was reinforced by his love for her as his second mother.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis |last=Sayer |first=George |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |year=1997 |isbn=978-0340690680 |location=London |page=154}}</ref>}}\n\nLater Sayer changed his mind. In the introduction to the 1997 edition of his biography of Lewis he wrote:\n{{quote |I have had to alter my opinion of Lewis's relationship with Mrs. Moore. In chapter eight of this book I wrote that I was uncertain about whether they were lovers.  Now after conversations with Mrs. Moore's daughter, Maureen, and a consideration of the way in which their bedrooms were arranged at The Kilns, I am quite certain that they were.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.impalapublications.com/blog/index.php?/archives/5185-C.S.-Lewis-and-Mrs-Janie-Moore,-by-James-OFee.html |title=C.S.

The Kilns was a house in the district of [[Headington Quarry]] on the outskirts of Oxford, now part of the suburb of [[Risinghurst]]. They all contributed financially to the purchase of the house, which passed to Maureen, who by then was [[Maureen Dunbar|Dame Maureen Dunbar]], when Warren died in 1973.\n\nJane Moore suffered from [[dementia]] in her later years and was eventually moved into a nursing home, where she died in 1951. Lewis visited her every day in this home until her death.\n\n===Return to Christianity===\nLewis was raised in a religious family that attended the [[Church of Ireland]]. He became an atheist at age 15, though he later described his young self as being paradoxically \"very angry with God for not existing\" and \"equally angry with him for creating a world\".{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=115}} His early separation from Christianity began when he started to view his religion as a chore and a duty; around this time, he also gained an interest in the occult, as his studies expanded to include such topics.<ref>''The Critic'', Volume 32, Thomas More Association, 1973. Original from the [[University of Michigan]].</ref> Lewis quoted [[Lucretius]] (''De rerum natura'', 5.198\u20139) as having one of the [[Argument from poor design|strongest arguments]] for atheism:{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=65}}\n\n:{{lang|lt|Nequaquam nobis divinitus esse paratam}}\n:{{lang|lt|Naturam rerum; tanta stat praedita culpa}}\n\nwhich he translated poetically as follows:\n\n:Had God designed the world, it would not be\n:A world so frail and faulty as we see.\n\n(This is a highly poetic, rather than a literal translation.  A more literal translation, by William Ellery Leonard,{{sfn|Lucretius|1916}} reads: \"That in no wise the nature of all things / For us was fashioned by a power divine \u2013 / So great the faults it stands encumbered with.\")\n\nLewis's interest in the works of [[George MacDonald]] was part of what turned him from atheism. This can be seen particularly well through this passage in Lewis's ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', chapter nine, when the semi-autobiographical [[Protagonist|main character]] meets MacDonald in [[Heaven]]:\n{{quote |...&nbsp;I tried, trembling, to tell this man all that his writings had done for me. I tried to tell how a certain frosty afternoon at Leatherhead Station when I had first bought a copy of ''[[Phantastes]]'' (being then about sixteen years old) had been to me what the first sight of Beatrice had been to Dante: ''Here begins the new life''. I started to confess how long that Life had delayed in the region of imagination merely: how slowly and reluctantly I had come to admit that his Christendom had more than an accidental connexion with it, how hard I had tried not to see the true name of the quality which first met me in his books is Holiness.{{sfn|Lewis|2002b|pp=66\u201367}}}}\n\nHe eventually returned to Christianity, having been influenced by arguments with his Oxford colleague and Christian friend [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], whom he seems to have met for the first time on 11 May 1926, and the book ''[[The Everlasting Man]]'' by [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Lewis vigorously resisted conversion, noting that he was brought into Christianity like a prodigal, \"kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance to escape\".{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=229}} He described his last struggle in ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'':\n\n{{quote |You must picture me alone in that room in Magdalen [College, Oxford], night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|pp=228, 229}}}}\n\nAfter his conversion to [[theism]] in 1929, Lewis converted to Christianity in 1931, following a long discussion during a late-night walk along [[Addison's Walk]] with his close friends Tolkien and [[Hugo Dyson]]. He records making a specific commitment to Christian belief while on his way to the zoo with his brother. He became a member of the [[Church of England]]&nbsp;\u2013 somewhat to the disappointment of Tolkien, who had hoped that he would join the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Carpenter|2006}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=March 2012}}{{incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}\n\nLewis was a committed [[Church of England|Anglican]] who upheld a largely orthodox Anglican theology, though in his [[apologetics|apologetic]] writings, he made an effort to avoid espousing any one denomination. In his later writings, some believe that he proposed ideas such as purification of [[venial sin]]s after death in [[purgatory]] (''[[The Great Divorce]]'' and ''[[Letters to Malcolm]]'') and [[mortal sin]] (''[[The Screwtape Letters]]''), which are generally considered to be Roman Catholic teachings, although they are also widely held in Anglicanism (particularly in [[high church]] [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] circles). Regardless, Lewis considered himself an entirely orthodox Anglican to the end of his life, reflecting that he had initially attended church only to receive communion and had been repelled by the hymns and the poor quality of the sermons. He later came to consider himself honoured by worshipping with men of faith who came in shabby clothes and work boots and who sang all the verses to all the hymns.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=147}} In 1935, Lewis and his brother Warren donated a stained glass window in memory of their parents to their childhood church of St. Mark's, Dundela, Belfast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cslewisireland.wordpress.com/2016/05/12/st-marks-dundela/|title=St. Mark's Dundela|last=Cslewisireland|date=12 May 2016|website=C S Lewis's Ireland|access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, the Lewises took child evacuees from London and other cities into [[The Kilns]].<ref name=\"tst\">{{Cite book |title=C.

Earlier that year, the couple took a brief holiday in Greece and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]; Lewis was fond of walking but not of travel, and this marked his only crossing of the English Channel after 1918. Lewis's book ''[[A Grief Observed]]'' describes his experience of bereavement in such a raw and personal fashion that he originally released it under the pseudonym N. W. Clerk to keep readers from associating the book with him. Ironically, many friends recommended the book to Lewis as a method for dealing with his own grief.

The book was poorly received by critics at the time,<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> although David [[Martyn Lloyd-Jones]], one of Lewis's contemporaries at Oxford, gave him much-valued encouragement.

Lewis agreed to write a \"space travel\" story and Tolkien a \"time travel\" one, but Tolkien never completed \"[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|The Lost Road]]\", linking his [[Middle-earth]] to the modern world.

One of these, ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', is a short novella in which a few residents of Hell take a bus ride to Heaven, where they are met by people who dwell there. The proposition is that they can stay if they choose, in which case they can call the place where they had come from \"[[Purgatory]]\", instead of \"Hell\", but many find it not to their taste. The title is a reference to [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', a concept that Lewis found a \"disastrous error\".

It is a retelling of the myth of [[Cupid and Psyche]] from the unusual perspective of Psyche's sister. It is deeply concerned with religious ideas, but the setting is entirely [[paganism|pagan]], and the connections with specific Christian beliefs are left implicit.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Till-We-Have-Faces |title=Till We Have Faces {{!}} novel by Lewis |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=14 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nBefore Lewis's conversion to Christianity, he published two books: ''[[Spirits in Bondage]]'', a collection of poems, and ''[[Dymer (poem)|Dymer]]'', a single [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]].

''Mere Christianity'', ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'', and ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' were all concerned, to one degree or another, with refuting popular objections to Christianity, such as the question, \"How could a good God allow pain to exist in the world?\" He also became a popular lecturer and broadcaster, and some of his writing originated as scripts for radio talks or lectures (including much of ''Mere Christianity'').{{sfn|Lewis|1997|page=}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2012}}\n\nAccording to George Sayer, losing a 1948 debate with [[G.

Lewis, an expert on the subject of allegory, maintained that the books were not allegory, and preferred to call the Christian aspects of them \"[[supposition]]al\". As Lewis wrote in a letter to a Mrs. Hook in December 1958:\n{{quote|\nIf Aslan represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair <nowiki>[</nowiki>a character in ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''<nowiki>]</nowiki> represents despair, he would be an allegorical figure. In reality, he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, 'What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?' This is not allegory at all.{{sfn|Martindale|Root|1990|pp=}}\n}}\n\n====\"Trilemma\"====\n{{Main|Lewis's trilemma}}\nIn a much-cited passage from ''Mere Christianity'', Lewis challenged the view that Jesus was a great moral teacher but not God. He argued that Jesus made several implicit claims to divinity, which would logically exclude that claim:\n\n{{quote|I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic&nbsp;\u2013 on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg&nbsp;\u2013 or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=43}}}}\n\nAlthough this argument is sometimes called \"Lewis's trilemma\", Lewis did not invent it but rather developed and popularised it. It has also been used by Christian apologist [[Josh McDowell]] in his book ''More Than a Carpenter''.<ref>{{Harvard citation|McDowell|2001}}</ref> It has been widely repeated in Christian apologetic literature, but largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The incarnation: an interdisciplinary symposium on the incarnation of the Son of God |last=Davis |first=Stephen T. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-927577-9 |editor-last=Stephen T.

In the first five chapters of ''Mere Christianity'', Lewis discusses the idea that people have a standard of behaviour to which they expect people to adhere. Lewis claims that people all over the earth know what this law is and when they break it. He goes on to claim that there must be someone or something behind such a universal set of principles.{{sfn|Lindskoog|2001|p=144}}\n{{quote|\nThese then are the two points that I wanted to make. First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=21}}\n}}\nLewis also portrays Universal Morality in his works of fiction. In ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' he describes Universal Morality as the \"deep magic\" which everyone knew.{{sfn|Lindskoog|2001|p=146}}\n\nIn the second chapter of ''Mere Christianity'', Lewis recognises that \"many people find it difficult to understand what this Law of Human Nature&nbsp;... is.\" And he responds first to the idea \"that the Moral Law is simply our herd instinct\" and second to the idea \"that the Moral Law is simply a social convention\". In responding to the second idea Lewis notes that people often complain that one set of moral ideas is better than another, but that this actually argues for there existing some \"Real Morality\" to which they are comparing other moralities. Finally, he notes that sometimes differences in moral codes are exaggerated by people who confuse differences in beliefs about morality with differences in beliefs about facts:\n\n{{quote |I have met people who exaggerate the differences, because they have not distinguished between differences of morality and differences of belief about facts. For example, one man said to me, \"Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death. Was that what you call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct?\" But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did&nbsp;\u2013 if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy [[quisling]]s did. There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are there. You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=26}}}}\n\nLewis also had fairly progressive views on the topic of \"animal morality\", in particular the suffering of animals, as is evidenced by several of his essays: most notably, ''On Vivisection''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.irishantivivisection.org/cslewis.html |title=Vivisection by CS<!--sic--> Lewis |last=Lewis |first=C.

It ensued after South Carolina declared that the federal [[Tariff of 1828|Tariffs of 1828]] and [[Tariff of 1832|1832]] were unconstitutional and therefore null and void within the sovereign boundaries of the state.\n\nThe U.S. suffered an economic downturn throughout the 1820s, and South Carolina was particularly affected. Many politicians of South Carolina blamed the change in fortunes on the national tariff policy that developed after the [[War of 1812]] to promote American manufacturing over its European competition.<ref>Freehling, ''The Road to Disunion'', p. 255. Craven p. 60. Ellis p. 7.</ref> The controversial and highly protective [[Tariff of 1828]] was enacted into law during the presidency of [[John Quincy Adams]]. The tariff was strongly opposed in the South, since it was perceived to put an unfair tax burden on the Southern agrarian states that imported most manufactured goods. By 1828, South Carolina state politics increasingly organized around the tariff issue. \n\nThe tariff's opponents expected that Jackson's election as President would result in a significant reduction of it.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v2, pp. 136\u2013137. Niven, pp. 135\u2013137. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', p. 143.</ref> When the Jackson administration failed to take any action to address their concerns, the state's most radical faction began to advocate that the state declare the tariff null and void within South Carolina. In Washington, an open split on the issue occurred between Jackson and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C. Calhoun]], a native South Carolinian and the most effective proponent of the [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|constitutional theory of state nullification]], the legal theory that if a state believed a federal law unconstitutional, it could declare the law null and void in the state.<ref>Craven, p. 65. Niven, pp. 135\u2013137. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', p. 143.</ref>\n\nOn July 14, 1832, before Calhoun had resigned the vice presidency to run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]], where he could more effectively defend nullification,<ref>Niven p. 192. Calhoun replaced Robert Y. Hayne as senator so that Hayne could follow James Hamilton as governor. Niven writes, \"There is no doubt that these moves were part of a well-thought-out plan whereby Hayne would restrain the hotheads in the state legislature and Calhoun would defend his brainchild, nullification, in Washington against administration stalwarts and the likes of Daniel Webster, the new apostle of northern nationalism.\"</ref> Jackson signed into law the Tariff of 1832. This compromise tariff received the support of most Northerners and half the Southerners in Congress.<ref>Howe p. 410. In the Senate, only Virginia and South Carolina voted against the 1832 tariff. Howe writes, \"Most southerners saw the measure as a significant amelioration of their grievance and were now content to back Jackson for reelection rather than pursue the more drastic remedy such as the one South Carolina was touting.\"</ref> But it did not satisfy South Carolina, and on November 24, 1832, a state convention adopted the [[Ordinance of Nullification]], which declared that the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional and unenforceable in South Carolina after February 1, 1833.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/300 |title=South Carolina Legislature Passes the Ordinance of Nullification |website=History Engine |publisher=[[University of Richmond]] |df=mdy-all |access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> South Carolina initiated military preparations to resist anticipated federal enforcement,<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'' pp. 1\u20133. Freehling writes, \"In Charleston Governor Robert Y. Hayne ... tried to form an army which could hope to challenge the forces of 'Old Hickory'. Hayne recruited a brigade of mounted minutemen, 2,000 strong, which could swoop down on Charleston the moment fighting broke out, and a volunteer army of 25,000 men, which could march on foot to save the beleaguered city. In the North, Governor Hayne's agents bought over $100,000 worth of arms; in Charleston, Hamilton readied his volunteers for an assault on the federal forts.\"</ref> but on March 1, 1833, Congress passed both the [[Force Bill]]\u2014authorizing the President to use military forces against South Carolina\u2014and a new negotiated tariff, the [[Tariff of 1833|Compromise Tariff of 1833]], which was satisfactory to South Carolina. The South Carolina convention reconvened and repealed its Nullification Ordinance on March 15, 1833, but three days later, nullified the Force Bill as a symbolic gesture of principle.\n\nThe crisis was over, and both sides found reasons to claim victory. The tariff rates were reduced and stayed low to the satisfaction of the South, but the [[states' rights]] doctrine of nullification remained controversial. The states' rights issue, which was not fully resolved in the crisis, intensified in the following decades and culminated in the [[American Civil War]].\n\n==Background (1787\u20131816)==\nThe historian Richard E. Ellis wrote:\n\n{{quote| By creating a national government with the authority to act directly upon individuals, by denying to the state many of the prerogatives that they formerly had, and by leaving open to the central government the possibility of claiming for itself many powers not explicitly assigned to it, the Constitution and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as finally ratified substantially increased the strength of the central government at the expense of the states.<ref>Ellis, pg. 4.</ref>}}\n\nThe extent of this change and the problem of the actual distribution of powers between state and the federal governments would be a matter of political and ideological discussion up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and beyond.<ref>McDonald pg. vii. McDonald wrote, \"Of all the problems that beset the United States during the century from the Declaration of Independence to the end of Reconstruction, the most pervasive concerned disagreements about the nature of the Union and the line to be drawn between the authority of the general government and that of the several states. At times the issue bubbled silently and unseen between the surface of public consciousness; at times it exploded: now and again the balance between general and local authority seemed to be settled in one direction or another, only to be upset anew and to move back toward the opposite position, but the contention never went away.\"</ref> In the early 1790's the debate centered on [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s nationalistic financial program versus Jefferson's democratic and agrarian program, a conflict that led to the formation of two opposing national political parties. Later in the decade the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] led to the [[states' rights]] position being articulated in the ''[[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]]''.<ref>Ellis pp. 1-2.</ref> The Kentucky Resolutions, written by [[Thomas Jefferson]], contained the following, which has often been cited as a justification for both nullification and [[Secession in the United States|secession]]:\n\n{{quote|... that in cases of an abuse of the delegated powers, the members of the general government, being chosen by the people, a change by the people would be the constitutional remedy; but, where powers are assumed which have not been delegated, a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy: that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact, (casus non f\u0153deris) to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits: that without this right, they would be under the dominion, absolute and unlimited, of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them: that nevertheless, this commonwealth, from motives of regard and respect for its co-States, has wished to communicate with them on the subject: that with them alone it is proper to communicate, they alone being parties to the compact, and solely authorized to judge in the last resort of the powers exercised under it ...<ref>For full text of the resolutions, see [[s:Kentucky Resolutions of 1798|Kentucky Resolutions of 1798]] and [[s:Kentucky Resolutions of 1799|Kentucky Resolutions of 1799]].</ref>}}\n\nThe Virginia Resolutions, written by [[James Madison]], hold a similar argument:\n\n{{quote|The resolutions, having taken this view of the Federal compact, proceed to infer that, in cases of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the States, who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound to interpose to arrest the evil, and for maintaining, within their respective limits, the authorities, rights, and liberties appertaining to them. ... The Constitution of the United States was formed by the sanction of the States, given by each in its sovereign capacity. It adds to the stability and dignity, as well as to the authority of the Constitution, that it rests on this solid foundation. The States, then, being parties to the constitutional compact, and in their sovereign capacity, it follows of necessity that there can be no tribunal above their authority to decide, in the last resort, whether the compact made by them be violated; and, consequently, as parties to it, they must themselves decide, in the last resort, such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition.<ref>James Madison, [[s:Virginia Resolutions of 1798|Virginia Resolutions of 1798]]</ref>}}\n\nHistorians differ over the extent to which either resolution advocated the doctrine of nullification. Historian [[Lance Banning]] wrote, \"The legislators of Kentucky (or more likely, [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], the Kentucky legislator who sponsored the resolution) deleted Jefferson's suggestion that the rightful remedy for federal usurpation was a \"nullification\" of such acts by each state acting on its own to prevent their operation within its respective borders. Rather than suggesting individual, although concerted, measures of this sort, Kentucky was content to ask its sisters to unite in declarations that the acts were \"void and of no force\", and in \"requesting their appeal\" at the succeeding session of the Congress.\"<ref>Banning pg. 388.</ref> The key sentence, and the word \"nullification\" was used in supplementary Resolutions passed by Kentucky in 1799.<ref>Brant, pg. 297, 629.</ref>\n\nMadison's judgment is clearer. He was chairman of a committee of the Virginia Legislature, which issued a book-length [[Report of 1800|''Report on the Resolutions of 1798'']], published in 1800 after they had been decried by several states. This asserted that the state did not claim legal force. \"The declarations in such cases are expressions of opinion, unaccompanied by other effect than what they may produce upon opinion, by exciting reflection. The opinions of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into immediate effect by force.\" If the states collectively agreed in their declarations, there were several methods by which it might prevail, from persuading Congress to repeal the unconstitutional law, to calling a constitutional convention, as two-thirds of the states may.<ref>Brant, pp. 298.</ref> When, at the time of the nullification crisis, he was presented with the Kentucky resolutions of 1799, he argued that the resolutions themselves were not Jefferson's words, and that Jefferson meant this not as a constitutional, but as a revolutionary right.<ref>Brant, pg. 629.</ref>\n\nMadison biographer Ralph Ketcham wrote:\n\n{{quote|Though Madison agreed entirely with the specific condemnation of the Alien and Sedition Acts, with the concept of the limited delegated power of the general government, and even with the proposition that laws contrary to the Constitution were illegal, he drew back from the declaration that each state legislature had the power to act within its borders against the authority of the general government to oppose laws the legislature deemed unconstitutional.\"<ref>Ketcham pg. 396.</ref>}}\n\nHistorian [[Sean Wilentz]] explains the widespread opposition to these resolutions:\n\n{{quote|Several states followed [[Maryland House of Delegates|Maryland's House of Delegates]] in rejecting the idea that any state could, by legislative action, even claim that a federal law was unconstitutional, and suggested that any effort to do so was treasonous. A few northern states, including Massachusetts, denied the powers claimed by Kentucky and Virginia and insisted that the Sedition law was perfectly constitutional . ... Ten state legislatures with heavy Federalist majorities from around the country censured Kentucky and Virginia for usurping powers that supposedly belonged to the federal judiciary. Northern Republicans supported the resolutions' objections to the alien and sedition acts, but opposed the idea of state review of federal laws. Southern Republicans outside Virginia and Kentucky were eloquently silent about the matter, and no southern legislature heeded the call to battle.<ref>Wilentz, pg. 80.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Thomas Jefferson]] by [[Rembrandt Peale]], 1800]]\nThe [[election of 1800]] was a turning point in national politics, as the Federalists were replaced by the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] led by Jefferson, but the four presidential terms spanning the period from 1800 to 1817 \"did little to advance the cause of states' rights and much to weaken it.\" Over Jefferson's opposition, the power of the federal judiciary, led by Federalist Chief Justice [[John Marshall]], increased. Jefferson expanded federal powers with the acquisition of the [[Louisiana Territory]] and his use of a [[Embargo Act of 1807|national embargo]] designed to prevent involvement in a European war. Madison in 1809 used national troops to enforce a Supreme Court decision in Pennsylvania, appointed an \"extreme nationalist\" in [[Joseph Story]] to the Supreme Court, signed the bill creating the [[Second Bank of the United States]], and called for a constitutional amendment to promote [[internal improvements]].<ref>Ellis, pg. 5. Madison called for the constitutional amendment because he believed much of the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]] was unconstitutional. Historian Richard Buel Jr. notes that in preparing for the worst from the [[Hartford Convention]], the Madison administration made preparation to intervene militarily in case of New England secession. Troops from the Canada\u2013US border were moved near Albany so that they could move into either Massachusetts or Connecticut if necessary. [[New England]] troops were also returned to their recruitment areas in order to serve as a focus for loyalists. Buel, pp. 220-221.</ref>\n\nOpposition to the [[War of 1812]] was centered in New England. Delegates to a convention in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], met in December 1814 to consider a New England response to Madison's war policy. The debate allowed many radicals to argue the cause of states' rights and state sovereignty. In the end, moderate voices dominated and the final product was not secession or nullification, but a series of proposed constitutional amendments.<ref>McDonald, pp. 69-70.</ref> Identifying the South's domination of the government as the cause of much of their problems, the proposed amendments included \"the repeal of the [[Three-fifths compromise|three-fifths clause]], a requirement that two-thirds of both houses of Congress agree before any new state could be admitted to the Union, limits on the length of embargoes, and the outlawing of the election of a president from the same state to successive terms, clearly aimed at the Virginians.\"<ref>Wilentz pg. 166.</ref> The war was over before the proposals were submitted to President Madison.\n\n[[File:Jm4.gif|right|thumb|[[James Madison]]]]\n\nAfter the conclusion of the War of 1812 [[Sean Wilentz]] notes:\n\n{{quote|Madison's speech [his 1815 annual message to Congress] affirmed that the war had reinforced the evolution of mainstream Republicanism, moving it further away from its original and localist assumptions. The war's immense strain on the treasury led to new calls from nationalist Republicans for a national bank. The difficulties in moving and supplying troops exposed the wretchedness of the country's transportation links, and the need for extensive new roads and canals. A boom in American manufacturing during the prolonged cessation of trade with Britain created an entirely new class of enterprisers, most of them tied politically to the Republicans, who might not survive without tariff protection. More broadly, the war reinforced feelings of national identity and connection.<ref>Wilentz, pg. 181.</ref>}}\n\nThis spirit of nationalism was linked to the tremendous growth and economic prosperity of this postwar era. However in 1819, the nation suffered its [[Panic of 1819|first financial panic]] and the 1820s turned out to be a decade of political turmoil that again led to fierce debates over competing views of the exact nature of American federalism. The \"extreme democratic and agrarian rhetoric\" that had been so effective in 1798 led to renewed attacks on the \"numerous market-oriented enterprises, particularly banks, corporations, creditors, and absentee landholders\".<ref>Ellis, pg. 6. Wilentz, pg. 182.</ref>\n\n==Tariffs (1816\u20131828)==\nThe [[Tariff of 1816]] had some protective features, and it received support throughout the nation, including that of John C. Calhoun and fellow South Carolinian [[William Lowndes (congressman)|William Lowndes]].<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 92-93.</ref> The first explicitly protective tariff linked to a specific program of internal improvements was the [[Tariff of 1824]].<ref>Wilentz pg. 243. Economic historian [[Frank Taussig]] notes \"The act of 1816, which is generally said to mark the beginning of a distinctly protective policy in this country, belongs rather to the earlier series of acts, beginning with that of 1789, than to the group of acts of 1824, 1828, and 1832. Its highest permanent rate of duty was twenty per cent., an increase over the previous rates, which is chiefly accounted for by the heavy interest charge on the debt incurred during the war. But after the crash of 1819, a movement in favor of protection set in, which was backed by a strong popular feeling such as had been absent in the earlier years.\" [http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1136 The Tariff History of the United States (Part I)] ''Teaching American History''</ref> Sponsored by [[Henry Clay]], this tariff provided a general level of protection at 35% [[ad valorem tax|ad valorem]] (compared to 25% with the 1816 act) and hiked duties on iron, woolens, cotton, hemp, and wool and cotton bagging. The bill barely passed the federal [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by a vote of 107 to 102. The Middle states and Northwest supported the bill, the South and Southwest opposed it, and New England split its vote with a majority opposing it. In the Senate, the bill, with the support of [[Tennessee]] Senator [[Andrew Jackson]], passed by four votes, and President [[James Monroe]], the Virginia heir to the Jefferson-Madison control of the [[White House]], signed the bill on March 25, 1824.<ref>Remini, ''Henry Clay'', pg. 232. Freehling, ''The Road to Disunion'', pg. 257.</ref> [[Daniel Webster]] of [[Massachusetts]] led the New England opposition to this tariff.<ref>McDonald, pg. 95.</ref>\n\nProtest against the prospect and the constitutionality of higher tariffs began in 1826 and 1827 with [[William Branch Giles]], who had the Virginia legislature pass resolutions denying the power of Congress to pass protective tariffs, citing the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 and James Madison's 1800 defense of them. Madison denied both the appeal to nullification and the unconstitutionality; he had always held that the power to regulate commerce included protection. Jefferson had, at the end of his life, written against protective tariffs.<ref>Brant, p. 622.</ref> \n[[File:MVan Buren-portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of Martin Van Buren]]\n\nThe Tariff of 1828 was largely the work of [[Martin Van Buren]] (although [[Silas Wright Jr.]] of New York prepared the main provisions) and was partly a political ploy to elect Andrew Jackson President. Van Buren calculated that the South would vote for Jackson regardless of the issues, so he ignored their interests in drafting the bill. New England, he thought, was just as likely to support the incumbent John Quincy Adams, so the bill levied heavy taxes on raw materials consumed by New England such as hemp, flax, molasses, iron, and sail duck. With an additional tariff on iron to satisfy Pennsylvania interests, Van Buren expected the tariff to help deliver [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Missouri]], [[Ohio]], and Kentucky to Jackson. Over opposition from the South and some from New England, the tariff was passed with the full support of many Jackson supporters in Congress and signed by President Adams in early 1828.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v2, pp. 136-137. McDonald presents a slightly different rationale. He stated that the bill would \"adversely affect New England woolen manufacturers, ship builders, and shipowners\" and Van Buren calculated that New England and the South would unite to defeat the bill, allowing Jacksonians to have it both ways\u2014in the North they could claim they tried but failed to pass a needed tariff and in the South they could claim that they had thwarted an effort to increase import duties. McDonald, pp. 94-95.</ref>\n\nAs expected, Jackson and his running mate John Calhoun carried the entire South with overwhelming numbers in every state but Louisiana, where Adams drew 47% of the vote in a losing effort. But many Southerners became dissatisfied as Jackson, in his first two annual messages to Congress, failed to launch a strong attack on the tariff. Historian [[William J. Cooper Jr.]] writes:\n\n{{quote|The most doctrinaire ideologues of the Old Republican group [supporters of the Jefferson and Madison position in the late 1790s] first found Jackson wanting. These purists identified the tariff of 1828, the hated Tariff of Abominations, as the most heinous manifestation of the nationalist policy they abhorred. That protective tariff violated their constitutional theory, for, as they interpreted the document, it gave no permission for a protective tariff. Moreover, they saw protection as benefiting the North and hurting the South.<ref>Cooper, pp. 11-12.</ref>}}\n\n==South Carolina background (1819\u20131828)==\n[[File:Sket-Calhoun.jpg|thumb|left|210px|John C. Calhoun]]\n\nSouth Carolina had been adversely affected by the national economic decline of the 1820s. During this decade, the population decreased by 56,000 whites and 30,000 slaves, out of a total free and slave population of 580,000. The whites left for better places; they took slaves with them or sold them to traders moving slaves to the Deep South for sale.<ref>Freehling, ''The Road to Disunion'', pg. 255. Historian [[Avery Craven]] wrote, \"Historians have generally ignored the fact that the South Carolina statesmen, in the so-called Nullification controversy, were struggling against a practical situation. They have conjured up a great struggle between nationalism and States\" rights and described these men as theorists reveling in constitutional refinements for the mere sake of logic. Yet here was a clear case of commercial and agricultural depression. Craven, pg. 60.</ref>\n\nHistorian Richard E. Ellis describes the situation:\n\n{{quote|Throughout the colonial and early national periods, South Carolina had sustained substantial economic growth and prosperity. This had created an extremely wealthy and extravagant low country aristocracy whose fortunes were based first on the cultivation of rice and indigo, and then on cotton. Then the state was devastated by the [[Panic of 1819]]. The depression that followed was more severe than in almost any other state of the Union. Moreover, competition from the newer cotton producing areas along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], blessed with fertile lands that produced a higher crop-yield per acre, made recovery painfully slow. To make matters worse, in large areas of South Carolina slaves vastly outnumbered whites, and there existed both considerable fear of slave rebellion and a growing sensitivity to even the smallest criticism of \"the peculiar institution.\"<ref>Ellis, pg. 7. Freehling notes that divisions over nullification in the state generally corresponded to the extent that the section suffered economically. The exception was the \"Low country rice and luxury cotton planters\" who supported nullification despite their ability to survive the economic depression. This section had the highest percentage of slave population. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pg. 25.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:George-McDuffie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|George McDuffie]]\n\nState leaders, led by states' rights advocates such as [[William Smith (South Carolina senator)|William Smith]] and [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]], blamed most of the state's economic problems on the Tariff of 1816 and national internal improvement projects. [[Soil erosion]] and competition from the [[New Southwest]] were also very significant reasons for the state's declining fortunes.<ref>Cauthen pg. 1.</ref> [[George McDuffie]] was a particularly effective speaker for the anti-tariff forces, and he popularized the Forty Bale theory. McDuffie argued that the 40% tariff on cotton finished goods meant that \"the manufacturer actually invades your barns, and plunders you of 40 out of every 100 bales that you produce.\" Mathematically incorrect, this argument still struck a nerve with his constituency. Nationalists such as Calhoun were forced by the increasing power of such leaders to retreat from their previous positions and adopt, in the words of Ellis, \"an even more extreme version of the states' rights doctrine\" in order to maintain political significance within South Carolina.<ref>Ellis, pg. 7.

Its planters believed that free black sailors had assisted [[Denmark Vesey]] in his planned slave rebellion. South Carolina passed a [[Negro Seamen Act]], which required that all black foreign seamen be imprisoned while their ships were docked in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. The UK strongly objected, especially as it was recruiting more Africans as sailors. What was worse, if the captains did not pay the fees to cover the cost of jailing, South Carolina would sell the sailors into [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. Other Southern states also passed laws against free black sailors.<ref name=\"horne\">Gerald Horne, ''Negro Comrades of the Crown: African Americans and the British Empire Fight the U.S. Before Emancipation'', New York University (NYU) Press, 2012, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XTLFKrmJPgcC&pg=PA97 pp. 97-98]</ref>\n\nSupreme Court Justice [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]], in his capacity as a circuit judge, declared the South Carolina law as unconstitutional, since it violated the United States' treaties with the UK.

The state's leaders were not united and the sides were roughly equal. The western part of the state and a faction in Charleston, led by [[Joel Roberts Poinsett|Joel Poinsett]], remained loyal to the Union. Only in small part was the conflict between \"a National North against a States'-right South\".<ref>Craven, pg. 65.</ref>\n\nAfter the final vote on the Tariff of 1828, South Carolina's congressional delegation held two caucuses, the second at the home of Senator [[Robert Y. Hayne]]. They were rebuffed in their efforts to coordinate a united Southern response and focused on how their state representatives would react. While many agreed with McDuffie that tariff policy could lead to secession, they all agreed that, as much as possible, the issue should be kept out of the upcoming presidential election. Calhoun, while not at this meeting, served as a moderating influence. He felt that the first step in reducing the tariff was to defeat Adams and his supporters in the upcoming election. [[William C. Preston]], on behalf of the South Carolina legislature, asked Calhoun to prepare a report on the tariff situation. Calhoun readily accepted and in a few weeks had a 35,000-word draft of what would become his \"[[South Carolina Exposition and Protest|Exposition and Protest]]\".<ref>Niven, pp. 135-137. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pg. 143.</ref>\n\nCalhoun's \"Exposition\" was completed late in 1828. He argued that the tariff of 1828 was unconstitutional because it favored manufacturing over commerce and agriculture. He believed the tariff power could be used only to generate revenue, not to provide protection from foreign competition for American industries, and that the people of a state or several states, acting in a democratically elected convention, had the power to veto any act of the federal government that violated the Constitution. This veto, the core of the doctrine of nullification, was explained by Calhoun in the Exposition:\n\n{{quote|If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.<ref>[[s:South Carolina Exposition and Protest|South Carolina Exposition and Protest]]</ref>}}\n\nThe report also detailed the specific southern grievances over the tariff that led to the current dissatisfaction.<ref>Niven, pp. 158-162.</ref> Fearful that \"hotheads\" such as McDuffie might force the legislature into taking drastic action against the federal government, historian [[John Niven]] describes Calhoun's political purpose in the document:\n\n{{quote|All through that hot and humid summer, emotions among the vociferous planter population had been worked up to a near-frenzy of excitement. The whole tenor of the argument built up in the \"Exposition\" was aimed to present the case in a cool, considered manner that would dampen any drastic moves yet would set in motion the machinery for repeal of the tariff act. It would also warn other sections of the Union against any future legislation that an increasingly self-conscious South might consider punitive, especially on the subject of slavery.<ref>Niven, pg. 161.</ref>}}\n\nThe report was submitted to the state legislature, which had 5,000 copies printed and distributed. Calhoun, who still had designs on succeeding Jackson as president, was not identified as the author, but word on this soon leaked out. The legislature took no action on the report at that time.<ref>Niven, pp. 163-164.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1828, [[Robert Rhett|Robert Barnwell Rhett]], soon to be considered the most radical of the South Carolinians, entered the fray over the tariff. As a state representative, Rhett called for the governor to convene a special session of the legislature. An outstanding orator, Rhett appealed to his constituents to resist the majority in Congress. He addressed the danger of doing nothing:\n\n{{quote|But if you are doubtful of yourselves\u2014if you are not prepared to follow up your principles wherever they may lead, to their very last consequence\u2014if you love life better than honor,\u2014prefer ease to perilous liberty and glory; awake not! Stir not!\u2014Impotent resistance will add vengeance to your ruin. Live in smiling peace with your insatiable Oppressors, and die with the noble consolation that your submissive patience will survive triumphant your beggary and despair.<ref>Walther, pg. 123. Craven, pp. 63-64.</ref>}}\n\nRhett's rhetoric about revolution and war was too radical in the summer of 1828 but, with the election of Jackson assured, [[James Hamilton Jr.]] on October 28 in the [[Colleton County Courthouse]] in [[Walterboro, South Carolina|Walterborough]] \"launched the formal nullification campaign.\"<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pg. 149.</ref> Renouncing his former nationalism, Hamilton warned the people that \"Your task-master must soon become a tyrant, from the very abuses and corruption of the system, without the bowels of compassion, or a jot of human sympathy.\" He called for implementation of Jefferson's \"rightful remedy\" of nullification. Hamilton sent a copy of the speech directly to President-elect Jackson. But despite a statewide campaign by Hamilton and McDuffie, a proposal to call a nullification convention in 1829 was defeated by the South Carolina legislature meeting at the end of 1828. State leaders such as Calhoun, Hayne, Smith, and [[William Drayton]] all remained publicly noncommittal or opposed to nullification for the next couple of years.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 152-155, 173-175. A two-thirds vote of each house of the legislature was required to convene a state convention.</ref>\n\nThe division in the state between radicals and conservatives continued through 1829 and 1830. After the failure of a state project to arrange financing of a railroad within the state to promote internal trade, the state petitioned Congress to invest $250,000 in the company trying to build it. After Congress tabled the measure, debate in South Carolina resumed between those who wanted state investment and those who wanted to work to get Congress's support. The debate demonstrated that a significant minority of the state did have an interest in Clay's [[American System (economic plan)|American System]]. The effect of the [[Webster\u2013Hayne debate]] was to energize the radicals, and some moderates started to move in their direction.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 177-186.</ref>\n\nThe state election campaign of 1830 focused on the tariff issue and the need for a state convention. On the defensive, radicals underplayed the intent of the convention as pro-nullification. When voters were presented with races where an unpledged convention was the issue, the radicals generally won. When conservatives effectively characterized the race as being about nullification, the radicals lost. The October election was narrowly carried by the radicals, although the blurring of the issues left them without any specific mandate.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 205-213.</ref> In South Carolina, the governor was selected by the legislature, which chose James Hamilton, the leader of the radical movement, and fellow radical [[Henry L. Pinckney]] as speaker of the South Carolina House. For the open Senate seat, the legislature chose the more radical [[Stephen Decatur Miller]] over William Smith.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 213-218.</ref>\n\nWith radicals in leading positions, in 1831 they began to capture momentum. State politics became sharply divided along [[Nullifier Party|Nullifier]] and Unionist lines. Still, the margin in the legislature fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for a convention. Many of the radicals felt that convincing Calhoun of the futility of his plans for the presidency would lead him into their ranks. Calhoun, meanwhile, had concluded that Van Buren was establishing himself as Jackson's heir apparent. At Hamilton's prompting, McDuffie made a three-hour speech in Charleston demanding nullification of the tariff at any cost. In the state, the success of McDuffie's speech seemed to open up the possibilities of both military confrontation with the federal government and civil war within the state. With silence no longer an acceptable alternative, Calhoun looked for the opportunity to take control of the antitariff faction in the state; by June he was preparing what would be known as his Fort Hill Address.<ref>Peterson, pp. 189-192. Niven, pp. 174-181. Calhoun wrote of McDuffie's speech, \"I think it every way imprudent and have so written Hamilton ... I see clearly it brings matters to a crisis, and that I must meet it promptly and manfully.\" Freehling in his works frequently refers to the radicals as \"Calhounites\" even before 1831. This is because the radicals, rallying around Calhoun's \"Exposition,\" were linked ideologically, if not yet practically, with Calhoun.</ref>\n\nPublished on July 26, 1831, the address repeated and expanded the positions Calhoun had made in the \"Exposition\". While the logic of much of the speech was consistent with the states' rights position of most Jacksonians, and even Daniel Webster remarked that it \"was the ablest and most plausible, and therefore the most dangerous vindication of that particular form of Revolution\", the speech still placed Calhoun clearly in a nullified camp. Within South Carolina, his gestures at moderation in the speech were drowned out as planters received word of the [[Nat Turner]] insurrection in Virginia. Calhoun was not alone in finding a connection between the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition movement]] and the sectional aspects of the tariff issue.<ref>Niven, pp. 181-184.</ref> It confirmed for Calhoun what he had written in a September 11, 1830, letter:\n\n<blockquote>I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the [[Peculiar institution|peculiar domestick {{sic}} institution]] of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness.<ref>Ellis pg. 193. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pg. 257.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFrom this point, the nullifiers accelerated their organization and rhetoric. In July 1831, the States Rights and Free Trade Association was formed in Charleston and expanded throughout the state. Unlike state political organizations in the past, which were led by the South Carolina planter aristocracy, this group appealed to all segments of the population, including non-slaveholder farmers, small slaveholders, and the Charleston non-agricultural class. Governor Hamilton was instrumental in seeing that the association, which was both a political and a social organization, expanded throughout the state. In the winter of 1831 and spring of 1832, Hamilton held conventions and rallies throughout the state to mobilize the nullification movement. The conservatives were unable to match the radicals in organization or leadership.<ref>Freehling, pp. 224-239.</ref>\n\nThe state elections of 1832 were \"charged with tension and bespattered with violence,\" and \"polite debates often degenerated into frontier brawls.\" Unlike the previous year's election, the choice was clear between nullifiers and unionists. The nullifiers won and on October 20, 1832, Hamilton called the legislature into a special session to consider a convention. The legislative vote was 96-25 in the House and 31-13 in the Senate<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 252-260.</ref>\n\nIn November 1832, the Nullification Convention met. The convention declared the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and unenforceable within the state of South Carolina after February 1, 1833. It was asserted that attempts to use force to collect the taxes would lead to the state's secession. Robert Hayne, who succeeded Hamilton as governor in 1833, established a 2,000-man group of mounted [[minutemen]] and 25,000 infantry who would march to Charleston in the event of a military conflict. These troops were to be armed with $100,000 in arms purchased in the North.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 1-3.</ref>\n\nThe enabling legislation passed by the legislature was carefully constructed to avoid clashes if at all possible and create an aura of legality in the process. To avoid conflicts with Unionists, it allowed importers to pay the tariff if they desired. Other merchants could pay the tariff by obtaining a paper tariff bond from the customs officer. They would then refuse to pay the bond when due, and if the customs official seized the goods, the merchant would file for a writ of [[replevin]] to recover the goods in state court. Customs officials who refused to return the goods (by placing them under the protection of federal troops) would be civilly liable for twice the value of the goods. To ensure that state officials and judges supported the law, a \"test oath\" would be required for all new state officials, binding them to support the ordinance of nullification.<ref>Ellis, pp. 97-98.</ref>\n\nGovernor Hayne in his inaugural address announced South Carolina's position:\n\n{{quote|If the sacred soil of Carolina should be polluted by the footsteps of an invader, or be stained with the blood of her citizens, shed in defense, I trust in Almighty God that no son of hers ... who has been nourished at her bosom ... will be found raising a parricidal arm against our common mother. And even should she stand ALONE in this great struggle for constitutional liberty ... that there will not be found, in the wider limits of the state, one recreant son who will not fly to the rescue, and be ready to lay down his life in her defense.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 3, pg. 14.</ref>}}\n\n==Washington, D.C. (1828\u20131832)==\n[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Official [[White House]] portrait of Andrew Jackson]]\n\nWhen President Jackson took office in March 1829, he was well aware of the turmoil created by the \"Tariff of Abominations\". While he may have abandoned some of his earlier beliefs that had allowed him to vote for the Tariff of 1824, he still felt protectionism was justified for products essential to military preparedness and did not believe that the current tariff should be reduced until the [[national debt]] was fully paid off. He addressed the issue in his inaugural address and his first three messages to Congress, but offered no specific relief. In December 1831, with the proponents of nullification in South Carolina gaining momentum, Jackson recommended \"the exercise of that spirit of concession and conciliation which has distinguished the friends of our Union in all great emergencies.\"<ref>Ellis, pp. 41-43.</ref> But on the constitutional issue of nullification, despite his strong beliefs in states' rights, Jackson did not waver.\n\nCalhoun's \"Exposition and Protest\" started a national debate on the doctrine of nullification. The leading proponents<ref>Ellis, pg. 9.</ref> of the nationalistic view included Daniel Webster, Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph Story]], Judge [[William Alexander Duer]], John Quincy Adams, [[Nathaniel Chipman]], and [[Nathan Dane]]. They rejected the [[compact theory]] advanced by Calhoun, claiming that the Constitution was the product of the people, not the states. According to the nationalist position, the Supreme Court had the final say on legislation's constitutionality, and the national union was perpetual and had supreme authority over individual states.<ref>Ellis pg. 9.</ref> The nullifiers, on the other hand, asserted that the central government was not the ultimate arbiter of its own power, and that the states, as the contracting entities, could judge for themselves what was constitutional. While Calhoun's \"Exposition\" claimed that nullification was based on the reasoning behind the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, an aging James Madison in an August 28, 1830, letter to [[Edward Everett]], intended for publication, disagreed. Madison wrote, denying that any individual state could alter the compact:<ref>Brant, pg. 627.</ref>\n\n{{quote| Can more be necessary to demonstrate the inadmissibility of such a doctrine than that it puts it in the power of the smallest fraction over 1/4 of the U. S.\u2014that is, of 7 States out of 24\u2014to give the law and even the Constn. to 17 States, each of the 17 having as parties to the Constn. an equal right with each of the 7 to expound it & to insist on the exposition. That the 7 might, in particular instances be right and the 17 wrong, is more than possible. But to establish a positive & permanent rule giving such a power to such a minority over such a majority, would overturn the first principle of free Govt. and in practice necessarily overturn the Govt. itself.<ref>Ellis pg. 10. Ellis wrote, \"But the nullifiers' attempt to legitimize their controversial doctrine by claiming it was a logical extension of the principles embodied in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions upset him. In a private letter he deliberately wrote for publication, Madison denied many of the assertions of the nullifiers and lashed out in particular at South Carolina's claim that if a state nullified an act of the federal government it could only be overruled by an amendment to the Constitution.\" Full text of the letter is available at http://www.constitution.org/jm/18300828_everett.htm.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Webster's Reply to Hayne.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Webster Replying to Hayne'' by George P.A. Healy]]\n\nPart of the South's strategy to force repeal of the tariff was to arrange an alliance with the West. Under the plan, the South would support the West's demand for free lands in the public domain if the West supported repeal of the tariff. With this purpose, Robert Hayne took the floor on the Senate in early 1830, beginning \"the most celebrated debate in the Senate's history.\" Daniel Webster's response shifted the debate, subsequently styled the Webster-Hayne debates, from the specific issue of western lands to a general debate on the very nature of the United States. Webster's position differed from Madison's: Webster asserted that the people of the United States acted as one aggregate body, while Madison held that the people of the several states acted collectively. [[John Rowan (politician)|John Rowan]] spoke against Webster on that issue, and Madison wrote, congratulating Webster, but explaining his own position.<ref>Brant, pp. 626-7. Webster never asserted the consolidating position again.</ref> The debate presented the fullest articulation of the differences over nullification, and 40,000 copies of Webster's response, which concluded with \"liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable\", were distributed nationwide.<ref>McDonald, pp. 105-106.</ref>\n\nMany people expected Jackson to side with Hayne, but once the debate shifted to secession and nullification, he sided with Webster. On April 13, 1830, at the traditional Democratic Party celebration honoring Jefferson's birthday, Jackson chose to make his position clear. In a battle of toasts, Hayne proposed, \"The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States.\" Jackson's response, when his turn came, was, \"Our Federal Union: It must be preserved.\" To those attending, the effect was dramatic. Calhoun responded with his own toast, in a play on Webster's closing remarks in the earlier debate, \"The Union. Next to our liberty, the most dear.\" Finally, Van Buren offered, \"Mutual forbearance and reciprocal concession. Through their agency the Union was established. The patriotic spirit from which they emanated will forever sustain it.\"\n\nVan Buren wrote in his autobiography of Jackson's toast, \"The veil was rent\u2014the incantations of the night were exposed to the light of day.\" Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], in his memoirs, wrote that the toast \"electrified the country.\"<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2, pp. 233-235.</ref> Jackson had the final word a few days later, when a visitor from South Carolina asked if Jackson had any message he wanted relayed to his friends back in the state. Jackson's reply was:\n\n{{quote|Yes I have; please give my compliments to my friends in your State and say to them, that if a single drop of blood shall be shed there in opposition to the laws of the United States, I will hang the first man I can lay my hand on engaged in such treasonable conduct, upon the first tree I can reach.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson',' v. 2, pp. 233-237.</ref>}}\n\nOther issues than the tariff were still being decided. In May 1830, Jackson vetoed the [[Maysville Road veto|Maysville Road Bill]], an important internal-improvements program (especially to Kentucky and Henry Clay), and then followed this with additional vetoes of other such projects shortly before Congress adjourned at the end of May. Clay used these vetoes to launch his presidential campaign.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2, pp. 255-256. Peterson, pp. 196-197.</ref> In 1831, the rechartering of the Bank of the United States, with Clay and Jackson on opposite sides, reopened a long-simmering problem. This issue was featured at the December 1831 National Republican convention in [[Baltimore]], which nominated Clay for president, and the proposal to recharter was formally introduced into Congress on January 6, 1832.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2, pp. 343-348.</ref> The Calhoun-Jackson split entered the center stage when Calhoun, as Vice President presiding over the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to deny Van Buren the post of minister to [[England]]. Van Buren was subsequently selected as Jackson's running mate at the [[1832 Democratic National Convention]] held in May.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2 pp. 347-355.</ref>\n\n[[File:Henry Clay.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of Henry Clay]]\n\nIn February 1832, Clay, back in the Senate after a two-decade absence, made a three-day speech calling for a new tariff schedule and an expansion of his American System. In an effort to reach out to Calhoun and other Southerners, Clay's proposal provided for a $10 million revenue reduction based on the budget surplus he anticipated for the coming year. Significant protection was still part of the plan, as the reduction primarily came on imports not in competition with domestic producers. Jackson proposed an alternative that reduced overall tariffs to 28%. John Quincy Adams, now in the House of Representatives, used his Committee of Manufacturers to produce a compromise bill that, in its final form, reduced revenues by $5 million, lowered duties on noncompetitive products, and retained high tariffs on woolens, iron, and cotton products. During the political maneuvering, McDuffie's [[Ways and Means Committee]], the normal originator of such bills, prepared a bill with drastic reduction across the board, but it went nowhere. Jackson signed the Tariff of 1832 on July 14, 1832, a few days after vetoing the Bank of the United States recharter bill. Congress adjourned after failing to override Jackson's veto.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2 pp. 358-373. Peterson, pp. 203-212.</ref>\n\nWith Congress adjourned, Jackson anxiously watched events in South Carolina. The nullifiers found no significant compromise in the Tariff of 1832 and acted accordingly. Jackson heard rumors of efforts to subvert members of the army and navy in Charleston and ordered the secretaries of the army and navy to begin rotating troops and officers based on their loyalty. He ordered General [[Winfield Scott]] to prepare for military operations and ordered a naval squadron in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] to prepare to go to Charleston. Jackson kept lines of communication open with unionists such as [[Joel Roberts Poinsett|Joel Poinsett]], [[William Drayton]], and [[James L. Petigru]] and sent George Breathitt, brother of [[John Breathitt|the Kentucky governor]], to independently obtain political and military intelligence. After their defeat at the polls in October, Petigru advised Jackson to \"Be prepared to hear very shortly of a State Convention and an act of Nullification.\"\n\nOn October 19, 1832 Jackson wrote to his [[Secretary of War]]:\n\n{{quote|The attempt will be made to surprise the Forts and garrisons by the militia, and must be guarded against with vestal vigilance and any attempt by force repelled with prompt and exemplary punishment.}}\n\nBy mid-November, Jackson's reelection was assured.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2, pp. 382-389.</ref> On December 3, 1832, Jackson sent his fourth annual message to Congress. The message \"was stridently states' rights and agrarian in its tone and thrust\" and disavowed protection as anything other than a temporary expedient.<ref>Ellis pg. 82.</ref> His intent regarding nullification, as communicated to Van Buren, was \"to pass it barely in review, as a mere buble {{sic}}, view the existing laws as competent to check and put it down.\" He hoped to create a \"moral force\" that would transcend political parties and sections. The paragraph in the message that addressed nullification was:\n\n{{quote|It is my painful duty to state that in one quarter of the United States opposition to the revenue laws has arisen to a height which threatens to thwart their execution, if not to endanger the integrity of the Union. What ever obstructions may be thrown in the way of the judicial authorities of the General Government, it is hoped they will be able peaceably to overcome them by the prudence of their own officers and the patriotism of the people. But should this reasonable reliance on the moderation and good sense of all portions of our fellow citizens be disappointed, it is believed that the laws themselves are fully adequate to the suppression of such attempts as may be immediately made. Should the exigency arise rendering the execution of the existing laws impracticable from any cause what ever, prompt notice of it will be given to Congress, with a suggestion of such views and measures as may be deemed necessary to meet it.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 3 pp. 9-11. Full text of his message available at http://www.thisnation.com/library/sotu/1832aj.html</ref>}}\n\nOn December 10, Jackson issued the [[Proclamation to the People of South Carolina]], in which he characterized the positions of the nullifiers as \"impractical absurdity\" and \"a metaphysical subtlety, in pursuit of an impractical theory.\" He provided this concise statement of his belief:\n\n{{quote|I consider, then, the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.<ref>Ellis pg 83-84.

A group of Democrats, led by Van Buren and Thomas Hart Benton, among others, saw the only solution to the crisis in a substantial reduction of the tariff.\n\n==Negotiation and confrontation (1833)==\nIn apparent contradiction of his previous claim that the tariff could be enforced with existing laws, on January 16 Jackson sent his Force Bill Message to Congress. Custom houses in [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]] and [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]] would be closed and replaced by ships at each port. In Charleston, the custom house would be moved to either [[Castle Pinckney]] or [[Fort Moultrie]] in Charleston Harbor. Direct payment rather than bonds would be required, and federal jails would be established for violators the state refused to arrest and all cases arising under the state's nullification act could be removed to the [[United States Circuit Court]]. In the most controversial part, the militia acts of 1795 and 1807 would be revised to permit the enforcement of the customs laws by both the militia and the regular United States military. Attempts were made in South Carolina to shift the debate away from nullification by focusing instead on the proposed enforcement.<ref>Ellis, po. 93-95.</ref>\n\nThe Force bill went to the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Pennsylvania protectionist [[William Wilkins (U.S. politician)|William Wilkins]] and supported by members Daniel Webster and [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]] of New Jersey; it gave Jackson everything he asked. On January 28, the Senate defeated a motion by a vote of 30 to 15 to postpone debate on the bill. All but two of the votes to delay were from the lower South and only three from this section voted against the motion. This did not signal any increased support for nullification, but did signify doubts about enforcement. To draw more votes, proposals were made to limit the duration of the coercive powers and restrict the use of force to suppressing, rather than preventing, civil disorder. In the House, the Judiciary Committee voted 4-3 to reject Jackson's request to use force. By the time Calhoun made a major speech on February 15 strongly opposing it, the Force Bill was temporarily stalled.<ref>Ellis, pp. 160-165. Peterson, pp. 222-224. Peterson differs with Ellis in arguing that passage of the Force Bill \"was never in doubt.\"</ref>\n\nOn the tariff issue, the drafting of a compromise tariff was assigned in December to the House Ways and Means Committee, now headed by [[Gulian Crommelin Verplanck|Gulian C. Verplanck]]. Debate on the committee's product on the House floor began in January 1833. The Verplanck tariff proposed reductions back to 1816 levels over the next two years while maintaining the basic principle of [[protectionism]]. The anti-Jackson protectionists saw this as an economic disaster that did not even allow the Tariff of 1832 to be tested and \"an undignified truckling to the menaces and blustering of South Carolina.\" Northern Democrats did not oppose it in principle, but still demanded protection for the varying interests of their own constituents. Those sympathetic to the nullifiers wanted a specific abandonment of the principle of protectionism and were willing to offer a longer transition period as a bargaining point. The Verplanck tariff was clearly not going to be implemented.<ref>Ellis, pp. 99-100. Peterson, pg. 217.</ref>\n\nIn South Carolina, efforts were being made to avoid an unnecessary confrontation. Governor Hayne ordered the 25,000 troops he had created to train at home rather than gather in Charleston. At a mass meeting in Charleston on January 21, they decided to postpone the February 1 deadline for implementing nullification, while Congress worked on a compromise tariff. At the same time, a commissioner from Virginia, [[Benjamin W. Leigh]], arrived in Charleston bearing resolutions that criticized both Jackson and the nullifiers and offering his state as a mediator.<ref>Wilentz, pp. 384-385.</ref>\n\nClay had not taken his defeat in the presidential election well and was unsure what position he could take in the tariff negotiations. His long-term concern was that Jackson was determined to kill protectionism along with the American Plan. In February, after consulting with manufacturers and sugar interests in Louisiana, who favored protection for the sugar industry, Clay started to work on a specific compromise plan. As a starting point, he accepted the nullifiers' offer of a transition period, but extended it from seven and a half years to nine years with a final target of a 20% ''ad valorem'' rate. After first securing the support of his protectionist base, Clay, through an intermediary, broached the subject with Calhoun. Calhoun was receptive, and after a private meeting with Clay at Clay's boardinghouse, negotiations proceeded.<ref>Peterson, pp. 217-226.</ref>\n\nClay introduced the negotiated tariff bill on February 12, and it was immediately referred to a select committee consisting of Clay as chairman, [[Felix Grundy]] of Tennessee, [[George M. Dallas]] of Pennsylvania, [[William Cabell Rives]] of Virginia, Webster, [[John M. Clayton]] of Delaware, and Calhoun. On February 21, the committee reported a bill to the floor of the Senate that was largely Clay's original bill. The Tariff of 1832 would continue except that reduction of all rates above 20% would be reduced by one tenth every two years, with the final reductions back to 20% coming in 1842. Protectionism as a principle was not abandoned and provisions were made for raising the tariff if national interests demanded it.<ref>Peterson, pp. 226-228.</ref>\n\nAlthough not specifically linked by any negotiated agreement, it became clear that the Force Bill and [[Tariff of 1833|Compromise Tariff of 1833]] were inexorably linked. In his February 25 speech ending the debate on the tariff, Clay captured the spirit of the voices for compromise by condemning Jackson's Proclamation to South Carolina as inflammatory, admitting the same problem with the Force Bill, but indicating its necessity, and praising the Compromise Tariff as the final measure to restore balance, promote the rule of law, and avoid the \"sacked cities\", \"desolated fields\", and \"smoking ruins\" he said the failure to reach a final accord would produce. The House passed the Compromise Tariff, 119-85, and the Force Bill, 149-48. In the Senate, the tariff passed 29-16 and the Force bill 32-1, with many opponents of it walking out rather than voting.<ref>Peterson pp. 229-232.</ref>\n\nCalhoun rushed to Charleston with the news of the final compromises. The Nullification Convention met again on March 11. It repealed the November Nullification Ordinance and also, \"in a purely symbolic gesture\", nullified the Force Bill. While the nullifiers claimed victory on the tariff issue, even though they had made concessions, the verdict was very different on nullification. The majority had in the end ruled and this boded ill for the South and its minority's hold on slavery.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 295-297.</ref> Rhett summed this up at the convention on March 13. Warning that \"A people, owning slaves, are mad, or worse than mad, who do not hold their destinies in their own hands,\" he continued:\n\n{{quote|Every stride of this Government, over your rights, brings it nearer and nearer to your peculiar policy. ... The whole world are in arms against your institutions ... Let Gentlemen not be deceived. It is not the Tariff\u2014not Internal Improvement\u2014nor yet the Force bill, which constitutes the great evil against which we are contending. ... These are but the forms in which the despotic nature of the government is evinced\u2014but it is the despotism which constitutes the evil: and until this Government is made a limited Government ... there is no liberty\u2014no security for the South.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pg. 297. Willentz pg. 388.</ref>}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nPeople reflected on the meaning of the nullification crisis and its outcome for the country. On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote, \"the tariff was only a pretext, and [[Secession in the United States|disunion]] and [[Confederate States of America|Southern confederacy]] the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] question.\"<ref>[[Jon Meacham]] (2009), ''[[American Lion (book)|American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House]]'', New York: Random House, p. 247; ''Correspondence of Andrew Jackson'', Vol. V, p. 72.</ref>\n\nThe final resolution of the crisis and Jackson's leadership had appeal throughout the North and South. [[Robert V. Remini]], the historian and Jackson biographer, described the opposition that nullification drew from traditionally states' rights Southern states:\n\n{{quote|The Alabama legislature, for example, pronounced the doctrine \"unsound in theory and dangerous in practice.\" Georgia said it was \"mischievous,\" \"rash and revolutionary.\" Mississippi lawmakers chided the South Carolinians for acting with \"reckless precipitancy.\"<ref>Remini, Andrew Jackson, v3. pg. 42.</ref>}}\n \nThe historian [[Forrest McDonald]], describing the split over nullification among proponents of states' rights, wrote, \"The doctrine of states' rights, as embraced by most Americans, was not concerned exclusively, or even primarily, with state resistance to federal authority.\"<ref>McDonald, pg. 110.</ref> But by the end of the nullification crisis, many Southerners questioned whether Jacksonian Democrats still represented Southern interests. The historian [[William J. Cooper Jr.]] notes, \"Numerous Southerners had begun to perceive it [the [[Jacksonian Democracy|Jacksonian Democratic]] Party] as a spear aimed at the South rather than a shield defending the South.\"<ref name=\"Cooper pp. 53-65\">Cooper, pp. 53\u201365.</ref>\n\nIn the political vacuum created by this alienation, the Southern wing of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] was formed. The party was a coalition of interests united by the common thread of opposition to Jackson, and more specifically to his \"definition of [[Federal power|federal]] and executive power.\" The party included former National Republicans with an \"urban, commercial, and nationalist outlook\", as well as former nullifiers. Emphasizing that \"they were more southern than the Democrats,\" the party grew within the South by going \"after the abolition issue with unabashed vigor and glee.\" With both parties arguing who could best defend Southern institutions, the nuances of the differences between [[free soil]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], which became an issue in the late 1840s with the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]] and territorial expansion, never became part of the political dialogue. This failure increased the slavery issue's volatility.<ref name=\"Cooper pp. 53-65\"/>\n\nRichard Ellis argues that the end of the crisis signified the beginning of a new era. Within the states' rights movement, the traditional desire for \"a weak, inactive, and frugal government\" was challenged. Ellis writes, \"in the years leading up to the Civil War the nullifiers and their proslavery allies used the doctrine of states' rights and state sovereignty in such a way as to try to expand the powers of the federal government so that it could more effectively protect the peculiar institution.\" By the 1850s, states' rights had become a call for state equality under the Constitution.<ref>Ellis, pg. 198.</ref>\n\nMadison reacted to this incipient tendency by writing two paragraphs of \"Advice to My Country,\" found among his papers. It said that the Union \"should be cherished and perpetuated. Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her [[Pandora's box|box]] opened; and the disguised one, as the Serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into paradise.\" [[Richard Rush]] published this \"Advice\" in 1850, by which time Southern spirit was so high that it was denounced as a forgery.<ref>Brant p. 646; Rush produced a copy in Mrs. Madison's hand; the original also survives. The contemporary letter to [[Edward Coles]] (Brant, p. 639) makes plain that the enemy in question is the nullifier.</ref>\n\nThe first test for the South over slavery began during the final congressional session of 1835. In what became known as the [[Gag Rule]] Debates, abolitionists flooded the Congress with anti-slavery petitions to end slavery and the slave trade in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was reopened each session as Southerners, led by South Carolinians Henry Pinckney and John Hammond, prevented the petitions from even being officially received by Congress. Led by John Quincy Adams, the slavery debate remained on the national stage until late 1844, when Congress lifted all restrictions on processing the petitions.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 346-356. McDonald (pp. 121\u2013122) saw states' rights in the period from 1833\u20131847 as almost totally successful in creating a \"virtually nonfunctional\" federal government. This did not insure political harmony, as \"the national political arena became the center of heated controversy concerning the newly raised issue of slavery, a controversy that reached the flash point during the debates about the annexation of the Republic of Texas.\"</ref>\n\nDescribing the legacy of the crisis, Sean Wilentz writes:\n\n{{quote|The battle between Jacksonian democratic nationalists, northern and southern, and nullifier sectionalists would resound through the politics of slavery and antislavery for decades to come. Jackson's victory, ironically, would help accelerate the emergence of southern pro-slavery as a coherent and articulate political force, which would help solidify northern antislavery opinion, inside as well as outside Jackson's party. Those developments would accelerate the emergence of two fundamentally incompatible democracies, one in the slave South, the other in the free North.<ref name=\"Wilentz pg. 388\">Wilentz, p. 388.</ref>}}\n\nFor South Carolina, the legacy of the crisis involved both the divisions within the state during the crisis and the apparent isolation of the state as the crisis was resolved. By 1860, when it became the first state to secede, it was more internally united than any other Southern state. Historian Charles Edward Cauthen writes:\n\n{{quote|Probably to a greater extent than in any other Southern state South Carolina had been prepared by her leaders over a period of thirty years for the issues of 1860. Indoctrination in the principles of state sovereignty, education in the necessity of maintaining Southern institutions, warnings of the dangers of control of the federal government by a section hostile to its interests\u2014in a word, the education of the masses in the principles and necessity of secession under certain circumstances\u2014had been carried on with a skill and success hardly inferior to the masterly propaganda of the abolitionists themselves. It was this education, this propaganda, by South Carolina leaders which made secession the almost spontaneous movement that it was.<ref>Cauthen, pg. 32.</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Origins of the American Civil War]]\n*[[American System (economic plan)]]\n*[[American School (economics)]]\n*[[Alexander Hamilton]]\n*[[Friedrich List]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Brant, Irving: ''The Fourth President: A Life of James Madison'' Bobbs Merrill, 1970.\n* Buel, Richard Jr. ''America on the Brink: How the Political Struggle Over the War of 1812 Almost Destroyed the Young Republic'' (2005) {{ISBN|1-4039-6238-3}}\n* Cauthen, Charles Edward.

It ensued after South Carolina declared that the federal [[Tariff of 1828|Tariffs of 1828]] and [[Tariff of 1832|1832]] were unconstitutional and therefore null and void within the sovereign boundaries of the state.\n\nThe U.S. suffered an economic downturn throughout the 1820s, and South Carolina was particularly affected. Many politicians of South Carolina blamed the change in fortunes on the national tariff policy that developed after the [[War of 1812]] to promote American manufacturing over its European competition.<ref>Freehling, ''The Road to Disunion'', p. 255. Craven p. 60. Ellis p. 7.</ref> The controversial and highly protective [[Tariff of 1828]] was enacted into law during the presidency of [[John Quincy Adams]]. The tariff was strongly opposed in the South, since it was perceived to put an unfair tax burden on the Southern agrarian states that imported most manufactured goods. By 1828, South Carolina state politics increasingly organized around the tariff issue. \n\nThe tariff's opponents expected that Jackson's election as President would result in a significant reduction of it.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v2, pp. 136\u2013137. Niven, pp. 135\u2013137. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', p. 143.</ref> When the Jackson administration failed to take any action to address their concerns, the state's most radical faction began to advocate that the state declare the tariff null and void within South Carolina. In Washington, an open split on the issue occurred between Jackson and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C. Calhoun]], a native South Carolinian and the most effective proponent of the [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|constitutional theory of state nullification]], the legal theory that if a state believed a federal law unconstitutional, it could declare the law null and void in the state.<ref>Craven, p. 65. Niven, pp. 135\u2013137. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', p. 143.</ref>\n\nOn July 14, 1832, before Calhoun had resigned the vice presidency to run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]], where he could more effectively defend nullification,<ref>Niven p. 192. Calhoun replaced Robert Y. Hayne as senator so that Hayne could follow James Hamilton as governor. Niven writes, \"There is no doubt that these moves were part of a well-thought-out plan whereby Hayne would restrain the hotheads in the state legislature and Calhoun would defend his brainchild, nullification, in Washington against administration stalwarts and the likes of Daniel Webster, the new apostle of northern nationalism.\"</ref> Jackson signed into law the Tariff of 1832. This compromise tariff received the support of most Northerners and half the Southerners in Congress.<ref>Howe p. 410. In the Senate, only Virginia and South Carolina voted against the 1832 tariff. Howe writes, \"Most southerners saw the measure as a significant amelioration of their grievance and were now content to back Jackson for reelection rather than pursue the more drastic remedy such as the one South Carolina was touting.\"</ref> But it did not satisfy South Carolina, and on November 24, 1832, a state convention adopted the [[Ordinance of Nullification]], which declared that the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional and unenforceable in South Carolina after February 1, 1833.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/300 |title=South Carolina Legislature Passes the Ordinance of Nullification |website=History Engine |publisher=[[University of Richmond]] |df=mdy-all |access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> South Carolina initiated military preparations to resist anticipated federal enforcement,<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'' pp. 1\u20133. Freehling writes, \"In Charleston Governor Robert Y. Hayne ... tried to form an army which could hope to challenge the forces of 'Old Hickory'. Hayne recruited a brigade of mounted minutemen, 2,000 strong, which could swoop down on Charleston the moment fighting broke out, and a volunteer army of 25,000 men, which could march on foot to save the beleaguered city. In the North, Governor Hayne's agents bought over $100,000 worth of arms; in Charleston, Hamilton readied his volunteers for an assault on the federal forts.\"</ref> but on March 1, 1833, Congress passed both the [[Force Bill]]\u2014authorizing the President to use military forces against South Carolina\u2014and a new negotiated tariff, the [[Tariff of 1833|Compromise Tariff of 1833]], which was satisfactory to South Carolina. The South Carolina convention reconvened and repealed its Nullification Ordinance on March 15, 1833, but three days later, nullified the Force Bill as a symbolic gesture of principle.\n\nThe crisis was over, and both sides found reasons to claim victory. The tariff rates were reduced and stayed low to the satisfaction of the South, but the [[states' rights]] doctrine of nullification remained controversial. The states' rights issue, which was not fully resolved in the crisis, intensified in the following decades and culminated in the [[American Civil War]].\n\n==Background (1787\u20131816)==\nThe historian Richard E. Ellis wrote:\n\n{{quote| By creating a national government with the authority to act directly upon individuals, by denying to the state many of the prerogatives that they formerly had, and by leaving open to the central government the possibility of claiming for itself many powers not explicitly assigned to it, the Constitution and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as finally ratified substantially increased the strength of the central government at the expense of the states.<ref>Ellis, pg. 4.</ref>}}\n\nThe extent of this change and the problem of the actual distribution of powers between state and the federal governments would be a matter of political and ideological discussion up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and beyond.<ref>McDonald pg. vii. McDonald wrote, \"Of all the problems that beset the United States during the century from the Declaration of Independence to the end of Reconstruction, the most pervasive concerned disagreements about the nature of the Union and the line to be drawn between the authority of the general government and that of the several states. At times the issue bubbled silently and unseen between the surface of public consciousness; at times it exploded: now and again the balance between general and local authority seemed to be settled in one direction or another, only to be upset anew and to move back toward the opposite position, but the contention never went away.\"</ref> In the early 1790's the debate centered on [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s nationalistic financial program versus Jefferson's democratic and agrarian program, a conflict that led to the formation of two opposing national political parties. Later in the decade the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] led to the [[states' rights]] position being articulated in the ''[[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]]''.<ref>Ellis pp. 1-2.</ref> The Kentucky Resolutions, written by [[Thomas Jefferson]], contained the following, which has often been cited as a justification for both nullification and [[Secession in the United States|secession]]:\n\n{{quote|... that in cases of an abuse of the delegated powers, the members of the general government, being chosen by the people, a change by the people would be the constitutional remedy; but, where powers are assumed which have not been delegated, a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy: that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact, (casus non f\u0153deris) to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits: that without this right, they would be under the dominion, absolute and unlimited, of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them: that nevertheless, this commonwealth, from motives of regard and respect for its co-States, has wished to communicate with them on the subject: that with them alone it is proper to communicate, they alone being parties to the compact, and solely authorized to judge in the last resort of the powers exercised under it ...<ref>For full text of the resolutions, see [[s:Kentucky Resolutions of 1798|Kentucky Resolutions of 1798]] and [[s:Kentucky Resolutions of 1799|Kentucky Resolutions of 1799]].</ref>}}\n\nThe Virginia Resolutions, written by [[James Madison]], hold a similar argument:\n\n{{quote|The resolutions, having taken this view of the Federal compact, proceed to infer that, in cases of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the States, who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound to interpose to arrest the evil, and for maintaining, within their respective limits, the authorities, rights, and liberties appertaining to them. ... The Constitution of the United States was formed by the sanction of the States, given by each in its sovereign capacity. It adds to the stability and dignity, as well as to the authority of the Constitution, that it rests on this solid foundation. The States, then, being parties to the constitutional compact, and in their sovereign capacity, it follows of necessity that there can be no tribunal above their authority to decide, in the last resort, whether the compact made by them be violated; and, consequently, as parties to it, they must themselves decide, in the last resort, such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition.<ref>James Madison, [[s:Virginia Resolutions of 1798|Virginia Resolutions of 1798]]</ref>}}\n\nHistorians differ over the extent to which either resolution advocated the doctrine of nullification. Historian [[Lance Banning]] wrote, \"The legislators of Kentucky (or more likely, [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], the Kentucky legislator who sponsored the resolution) deleted Jefferson's suggestion that the rightful remedy for federal usurpation was a \"nullification\" of such acts by each state acting on its own to prevent their operation within its respective borders. Rather than suggesting individual, although concerted, measures of this sort, Kentucky was content to ask its sisters to unite in declarations that the acts were \"void and of no force\", and in \"requesting their appeal\" at the succeeding session of the Congress.\"<ref>Banning pg. 388.</ref> The key sentence, and the word \"nullification\" was used in supplementary Resolutions passed by Kentucky in 1799.<ref>Brant, pg. 297, 629.</ref>\n\nMadison's judgment is clearer. He was chairman of a committee of the Virginia Legislature, which issued a book-length [[Report of 1800|''Report on the Resolutions of 1798'']], published in 1800 after they had been decried by several states. This asserted that the state did not claim legal force. \"The declarations in such cases are expressions of opinion, unaccompanied by other effect than what they may produce upon opinion, by exciting reflection. The opinions of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into immediate effect by force.\" If the states collectively agreed in their declarations, there were several methods by which it might prevail, from persuading Congress to repeal the unconstitutional law, to calling a constitutional convention, as two-thirds of the states may.<ref>Brant, pp. 298.</ref> When, at the time of the nullification crisis, he was presented with the Kentucky resolutions of 1799, he argued that the resolutions themselves were not Jefferson's words, and that Jefferson meant this not as a constitutional, but as a revolutionary right.<ref>Brant, pg. 629.</ref>\n\nMadison biographer Ralph Ketcham wrote:\n\n{{quote|Though Madison agreed entirely with the specific condemnation of the Alien and Sedition Acts, with the concept of the limited delegated power of the general government, and even with the proposition that laws contrary to the Constitution were illegal, he drew back from the declaration that each state legislature had the power to act within its borders against the authority of the general government to oppose laws the legislature deemed unconstitutional.\"<ref>Ketcham pg. 396.</ref>}}\n\nHistorian [[Sean Wilentz]] explains the widespread opposition to these resolutions:\n\n{{quote|Several states followed [[Maryland House of Delegates|Maryland's House of Delegates]] in rejecting the idea that any state could, by legislative action, even claim that a federal law was unconstitutional, and suggested that any effort to do so was treasonous. A few northern states, including Massachusetts, denied the powers claimed by Kentucky and Virginia and insisted that the Sedition law was perfectly constitutional . ... Ten state legislatures with heavy Federalist majorities from around the country censured Kentucky and Virginia for usurping powers that supposedly belonged to the federal judiciary. Northern Republicans supported the resolutions' objections to the alien and sedition acts, but opposed the idea of state review of federal laws. Southern Republicans outside Virginia and Kentucky were eloquently silent about the matter, and no southern legislature heeded the call to battle.<ref>Wilentz, pg. 80.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Thomas Jefferson]] by [[Rembrandt Peale]], 1800]]\nThe [[election of 1800]] was a turning point in national politics, as the Federalists were replaced by the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] led by Jefferson, but the four presidential terms spanning the period from 1800 to 1817 \"did little to advance the cause of states' rights and much to weaken it.\" Over Jefferson's opposition, the power of the federal judiciary, led by Federalist Chief Justice [[John Marshall]], increased. Jefferson expanded federal powers with the acquisition of the [[Louisiana Territory]] and his use of a [[Embargo Act of 1807|national embargo]] designed to prevent involvement in a European war. Madison in 1809 used national troops to enforce a Supreme Court decision in Pennsylvania, appointed an \"extreme nationalist\" in [[Joseph Story]] to the Supreme Court, signed the bill creating the [[Second Bank of the United States]], and called for a constitutional amendment to promote [[internal improvements]].<ref>Ellis, pg. 5. Madison called for the constitutional amendment because he believed much of the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]] was unconstitutional. Historian Richard Buel Jr. notes that in preparing for the worst from the [[Hartford Convention]], the Madison administration made preparation to intervene militarily in case of New England secession. Troops from the Canada\u2013US border were moved near Albany so that they could move into either Massachusetts or Connecticut if necessary. [[New England]] troops were also returned to their recruitment areas in order to serve as a focus for loyalists. Buel, pp. 220-221.</ref>\n\nOpposition to the [[War of 1812]] was centered in New England. Delegates to a convention in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], met in December 1814 to consider a New England response to Madison's war policy. The debate allowed many radicals to argue the cause of states' rights and state sovereignty. In the end, moderate voices dominated and the final product was not secession or nullification, but a series of proposed constitutional amendments.<ref>McDonald, pp. 69-70.</ref> Identifying the South's domination of the government as the cause of much of their problems, the proposed amendments included \"the repeal of the [[Three-fifths compromise|three-fifths clause]], a requirement that two-thirds of both houses of Congress agree before any new state could be admitted to the Union, limits on the length of embargoes, and the outlawing of the election of a president from the same state to successive terms, clearly aimed at the Virginians.\"<ref>Wilentz pg. 166.</ref> The war was over before the proposals were submitted to President Madison.\n\n[[File:Jm4.gif|right|thumb|[[James Madison]]]]\n\nAfter the conclusion of the War of 1812 [[Sean Wilentz]] notes:\n\n{{quote|Madison's speech [his 1815 annual message to Congress] affirmed that the war had reinforced the evolution of mainstream Republicanism, moving it further away from its original and localist assumptions. The war's immense strain on the treasury led to new calls from nationalist Republicans for a national bank. The difficulties in moving and supplying troops exposed the wretchedness of the country's transportation links, and the need for extensive new roads and canals. A boom in American manufacturing during the prolonged cessation of trade with Britain created an entirely new class of enterprisers, most of them tied politically to the Republicans, who might not survive without tariff protection. More broadly, the war reinforced feelings of national identity and connection.<ref>Wilentz, pg. 181.</ref>}}\n\nThis spirit of nationalism was linked to the tremendous growth and economic prosperity of this postwar era. However in 1819, the nation suffered its [[Panic of 1819|first financial panic]] and the 1820s turned out to be a decade of political turmoil that again led to fierce debates over competing views of the exact nature of American federalism. The \"extreme democratic and agrarian rhetoric\" that had been so effective in 1798 led to renewed attacks on the \"numerous market-oriented enterprises, particularly banks, corporations, creditors, and absentee landholders\".<ref>Ellis, pg. 6. Wilentz, pg. 182.</ref>\n\n==Tariffs (1816\u20131828)==\nThe [[Tariff of 1816]] had some protective features, and it received support throughout the nation, including that of John C. Calhoun and fellow South Carolinian [[William Lowndes (congressman)|William Lowndes]].<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 92-93.</ref> The first explicitly protective tariff linked to a specific program of internal improvements was the [[Tariff of 1824]].<ref>Wilentz pg. 243. Economic historian [[Frank Taussig]] notes \"The act of 1816, which is generally said to mark the beginning of a distinctly protective policy in this country, belongs rather to the earlier series of acts, beginning with that of 1789, than to the group of acts of 1824, 1828, and 1832. Its highest permanent rate of duty was twenty per cent., an increase over the previous rates, which is chiefly accounted for by the heavy interest charge on the debt incurred during the war. But after the crash of 1819, a movement in favor of protection set in, which was backed by a strong popular feeling such as had been absent in the earlier years.\" [http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1136 The Tariff History of the United States (Part I)] ''Teaching American History''</ref> Sponsored by [[Henry Clay]], this tariff provided a general level of protection at 35% [[ad valorem tax|ad valorem]] (compared to 25% with the 1816 act) and hiked duties on iron, woolens, cotton, hemp, and wool and cotton bagging. The bill barely passed the federal [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by a vote of 107 to 102. The Middle states and Northwest supported the bill, the South and Southwest opposed it, and New England split its vote with a majority opposing it. In the Senate, the bill, with the support of [[Tennessee]] Senator [[Andrew Jackson]], passed by four votes, and President [[James Monroe]], the Virginia heir to the Jefferson-Madison control of the [[White House]], signed the bill on March 25, 1824.<ref>Remini, ''Henry Clay'', pg. 232. Freehling, ''The Road to Disunion'', pg. 257.</ref> [[Daniel Webster]] of [[Massachusetts]] led the New England opposition to this tariff.<ref>McDonald, pg. 95.</ref>\n\nProtest against the prospect and the constitutionality of higher tariffs began in 1826 and 1827 with [[William Branch Giles]], who had the Virginia legislature pass resolutions denying the power of Congress to pass protective tariffs, citing the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 and James Madison's 1800 defense of them. Madison denied both the appeal to nullification and the unconstitutionality; he had always held that the power to regulate commerce included protection. Jefferson had, at the end of his life, written against protective tariffs.<ref>Brant, p. 622.</ref> \n[[File:MVan Buren-portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of Martin Van Buren]]\n\nThe Tariff of 1828 was largely the work of [[Martin Van Buren]] (although [[Silas Wright Jr.]] of New York prepared the main provisions) and was partly a political ploy to elect Andrew Jackson President. Van Buren calculated that the South would vote for Jackson regardless of the issues, so he ignored their interests in drafting the bill. New England, he thought, was just as likely to support the incumbent John Quincy Adams, so the bill levied heavy taxes on raw materials consumed by New England such as hemp, flax, molasses, iron, and sail duck. With an additional tariff on iron to satisfy Pennsylvania interests, Van Buren expected the tariff to help deliver [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Missouri]], [[Ohio]], and Kentucky to Jackson. Over opposition from the South and some from New England, the tariff was passed with the full support of many Jackson supporters in Congress and signed by President Adams in early 1828.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v2, pp. 136-137. McDonald presents a slightly different rationale. He stated that the bill would \"adversely affect New England woolen manufacturers, ship builders, and shipowners\" and Van Buren calculated that New England and the South would unite to defeat the bill, allowing Jacksonians to have it both ways\u2014in the North they could claim they tried but failed to pass a needed tariff and in the South they could claim that they had thwarted an effort to increase import duties. McDonald, pp. 94-95.</ref>\n\nAs expected, Jackson and his running mate John Calhoun carried the entire South with overwhelming numbers in every state but Louisiana, where Adams drew 47% of the vote in a losing effort. But many Southerners became dissatisfied as Jackson, in his first two annual messages to Congress, failed to launch a strong attack on the tariff. Historian [[William J. Cooper Jr.]] writes:\n\n{{quote|The most doctrinaire ideologues of the Old Republican group [supporters of the Jefferson and Madison position in the late 1790s] first found Jackson wanting. These purists identified the tariff of 1828, the hated Tariff of Abominations, as the most heinous manifestation of the nationalist policy they abhorred. That protective tariff violated their constitutional theory, for, as they interpreted the document, it gave no permission for a protective tariff. Moreover, they saw protection as benefiting the North and hurting the South.<ref>Cooper, pp. 11-12.</ref>}}\n\n==South Carolina background (1819\u20131828)==\n[[File:Sket-Calhoun.jpg|thumb|left|210px|John C. Calhoun]]\n\nSouth Carolina had been adversely affected by the national economic decline of the 1820s. During this decade, the population decreased by 56,000 whites and 30,000 slaves, out of a total free and slave population of 580,000. The whites left for better places; they took slaves with them or sold them to traders moving slaves to the Deep South for sale.<ref>Freehling, ''The Road to Disunion'', pg. 255. Historian [[Avery Craven]] wrote, \"Historians have generally ignored the fact that the South Carolina statesmen, in the so-called Nullification controversy, were struggling against a practical situation. They have conjured up a great struggle between nationalism and States\" rights and described these men as theorists reveling in constitutional refinements for the mere sake of logic. Yet here was a clear case of commercial and agricultural depression. Craven, pg. 60.</ref>\n\nHistorian Richard E. Ellis describes the situation:\n\n{{quote|Throughout the colonial and early national periods, South Carolina had sustained substantial economic growth and prosperity. This had created an extremely wealthy and extravagant low country aristocracy whose fortunes were based first on the cultivation of rice and indigo, and then on cotton. Then the state was devastated by the [[Panic of 1819]]. The depression that followed was more severe than in almost any other state of the Union. Moreover, competition from the newer cotton producing areas along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], blessed with fertile lands that produced a higher crop-yield per acre, made recovery painfully slow. To make matters worse, in large areas of South Carolina slaves vastly outnumbered whites, and there existed both considerable fear of slave rebellion and a growing sensitivity to even the smallest criticism of \"the peculiar institution.\"<ref>Ellis, pg. 7. Freehling notes that divisions over nullification in the state generally corresponded to the extent that the section suffered economically. The exception was the \"Low country rice and luxury cotton planters\" who supported nullification despite their ability to survive the economic depression. This section had the highest percentage of slave population. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pg. 25.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:George-McDuffie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|George McDuffie]]\n\nState leaders, led by states' rights advocates such as [[William Smith (South Carolina senator)|William Smith]] and [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]], blamed most of the state's economic problems on the Tariff of 1816 and national internal improvement projects. [[Soil erosion]] and competition from the [[New Southwest]] were also very significant reasons for the state's declining fortunes.<ref>Cauthen pg. 1.</ref> [[George McDuffie]] was a particularly effective speaker for the anti-tariff forces, and he popularized the Forty Bale theory. McDuffie argued that the 40% tariff on cotton finished goods meant that \"the manufacturer actually invades your barns, and plunders you of 40 out of every 100 bales that you produce.\" Mathematically incorrect, this argument still struck a nerve with his constituency. Nationalists such as Calhoun were forced by the increasing power of such leaders to retreat from their previous positions and adopt, in the words of Ellis, \"an even more extreme version of the states' rights doctrine\" in order to maintain political significance within South Carolina.<ref>Ellis, pg. 7. Freehling, ''Road to Disunion'', pg. 256.</ref>\n\n[[File:Thomas Bee's House.jpg|thumb|left|Thomas Bee's House, Charleston, ''circa'' 1730: The Nullification Movement that split the nation started here in 1832.

Its planters believed that free black sailors had assisted [[Denmark Vesey]] in his planned slave rebellion. South Carolina passed a [[Negro Seamen Act]], which required that all black foreign seamen be imprisoned while their ships were docked in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. The UK strongly objected, especially as it was recruiting more Africans as sailors. What was worse, if the captains did not pay the fees to cover the cost of jailing, South Carolina would sell the sailors into [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. Other Southern states also passed laws against free black sailors.<ref name=\"horne\">Gerald Horne, ''Negro Comrades of the Crown: African Americans and the British Empire Fight the U.S. Before Emancipation'', New York University (NYU) Press, 2012, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XTLFKrmJPgcC&pg=PA97 pp. 97-98]</ref>\n\nSupreme Court Justice [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]], in his capacity as a circuit judge, declared the South Carolina law as unconstitutional, since it violated the United States' treaties with the UK.

The state's leaders were not united and the sides were roughly equal. The western part of the state and a faction in Charleston, led by [[Joel Roberts Poinsett|Joel Poinsett]], remained loyal to the Union. Only in small part was the conflict between \"a National North against a States'-right South\".<ref>Craven, pg. 65.</ref>\n\nAfter the final vote on the Tariff of 1828, South Carolina's congressional delegation held two caucuses, the second at the home of Senator [[Robert Y. Hayne]]. They were rebuffed in their efforts to coordinate a united Southern response and focused on how their state representatives would react. While many agreed with McDuffie that tariff policy could lead to secession, they all agreed that, as much as possible, the issue should be kept out of the upcoming presidential election. Calhoun, while not at this meeting, served as a moderating influence. He felt that the first step in reducing the tariff was to defeat Adams and his supporters in the upcoming election. [[William C. Preston]], on behalf of the South Carolina legislature, asked Calhoun to prepare a report on the tariff situation. Calhoun readily accepted and in a few weeks had a 35,000-word draft of what would become his \"[[South Carolina Exposition and Protest|Exposition and Protest]]\".<ref>Niven, pp. 135-137. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pg. 143.</ref>\n\nCalhoun's \"Exposition\" was completed late in 1828. He argued that the tariff of 1828 was unconstitutional because it favored manufacturing over commerce and agriculture. He believed the tariff power could be used only to generate revenue, not to provide protection from foreign competition for American industries, and that the people of a state or several states, acting in a democratically elected convention, had the power to veto any act of the federal government that violated the Constitution. This veto, the core of the doctrine of nullification, was explained by Calhoun in the Exposition:\n\n{{quote|If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.<ref>[[s:South Carolina Exposition and Protest|South Carolina Exposition and Protest]]</ref>}}\n\nThe report also detailed the specific southern grievances over the tariff that led to the current dissatisfaction.<ref>Niven, pp. 158-162.</ref> Fearful that \"hotheads\" such as McDuffie might force the legislature into taking drastic action against the federal government, historian [[John Niven]] describes Calhoun's political purpose in the document:\n\n{{quote|All through that hot and humid summer, emotions among the vociferous planter population had been worked up to a near-frenzy of excitement. The whole tenor of the argument built up in the \"Exposition\" was aimed to present the case in a cool, considered manner that would dampen any drastic moves yet would set in motion the machinery for repeal of the tariff act. It would also warn other sections of the Union against any future legislation that an increasingly self-conscious South might consider punitive, especially on the subject of slavery.<ref>Niven, pg. 161.</ref>}}\n\nThe report was submitted to the state legislature, which had 5,000 copies printed and distributed. Calhoun, who still had designs on succeeding Jackson as president, was not identified as the author, but word on this soon leaked out. The legislature took no action on the report at that time.<ref>Niven, pp. 163-164.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1828, [[Robert Rhett|Robert Barnwell Rhett]], soon to be considered the most radical of the South Carolinians, entered the fray over the tariff. As a state representative, Rhett called for the governor to convene a special session of the legislature. An outstanding orator, Rhett appealed to his constituents to resist the majority in Congress. He addressed the danger of doing nothing:\n\n{{quote|But if you are doubtful of yourselves\u2014if you are not prepared to follow up your principles wherever they may lead, to their very last consequence\u2014if you love life better than honor,\u2014prefer ease to perilous liberty and glory; awake not! Stir not!\u2014Impotent resistance will add vengeance to your ruin. Live in smiling peace with your insatiable Oppressors, and die with the noble consolation that your submissive patience will survive triumphant your beggary and despair.<ref>Walther, pg. 123. Craven, pp. 63-64.</ref>}}\n\nRhett's rhetoric about revolution and war was too radical in the summer of 1828 but, with the election of Jackson assured, [[James Hamilton Jr.]] on October 28 in the [[Colleton County Courthouse]] in [[Walterboro, South Carolina|Walterborough]] \"launched the formal nullification campaign.\"<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pg. 149.</ref> Renouncing his former nationalism, Hamilton warned the people that \"Your task-master must soon become a tyrant, from the very abuses and corruption of the system, without the bowels of compassion, or a jot of human sympathy.\" He called for implementation of Jefferson's \"rightful remedy\" of nullification. Hamilton sent a copy of the speech directly to President-elect Jackson. But despite a statewide campaign by Hamilton and McDuffie, a proposal to call a nullification convention in 1829 was defeated by the South Carolina legislature meeting at the end of 1828. State leaders such as Calhoun, Hayne, Smith, and [[William Drayton]] all remained publicly noncommittal or opposed to nullification for the next couple of years.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 152-155, 173-175. A two-thirds vote of each house of the legislature was required to convene a state convention.</ref>\n\nThe division in the state between radicals and conservatives continued through 1829 and 1830. After the failure of a state project to arrange financing of a railroad within the state to promote internal trade, the state petitioned Congress to invest $250,000 in the company trying to build it. After Congress tabled the measure, debate in South Carolina resumed between those who wanted state investment and those who wanted to work to get Congress's support. The debate demonstrated that a significant minority of the state did have an interest in Clay's [[American System (economic plan)|American System]]. The effect of the [[Webster\u2013Hayne debate]] was to energize the radicals, and some moderates started to move in their direction.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 177-186.</ref>\n\nThe state election campaign of 1830 focused on the tariff issue and the need for a state convention. On the defensive, radicals underplayed the intent of the convention as pro-nullification. When voters were presented with races where an unpledged convention was the issue, the radicals generally won. When conservatives effectively characterized the race as being about nullification, the radicals lost. The October election was narrowly carried by the radicals, although the blurring of the issues left them without any specific mandate.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 205-213.</ref> In South Carolina, the governor was selected by the legislature, which chose James Hamilton, the leader of the radical movement, and fellow radical [[Henry L. Pinckney]] as speaker of the South Carolina House. For the open Senate seat, the legislature chose the more radical [[Stephen Decatur Miller]] over William Smith.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 213-218.</ref>\n\nWith radicals in leading positions, in 1831 they began to capture momentum. State politics became sharply divided along [[Nullifier Party|Nullifier]] and Unionist lines. Still, the margin in the legislature fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for a convention. Many of the radicals felt that convincing Calhoun of the futility of his plans for the presidency would lead him into their ranks. Calhoun, meanwhile, had concluded that Van Buren was establishing himself as Jackson's heir apparent. At Hamilton's prompting, McDuffie made a three-hour speech in Charleston demanding nullification of the tariff at any cost. In the state, the success of McDuffie's speech seemed to open up the possibilities of both military confrontation with the federal government and civil war within the state. With silence no longer an acceptable alternative, Calhoun looked for the opportunity to take control of the antitariff faction in the state; by June he was preparing what would be known as his Fort Hill Address.<ref>Peterson, pp. 189-192. Niven, pp. 174-181. Calhoun wrote of McDuffie's speech, \"I think it every way imprudent and have so written Hamilton ... I see clearly it brings matters to a crisis, and that I must meet it promptly and manfully.\" Freehling in his works frequently refers to the radicals as \"Calhounites\" even before 1831. This is because the radicals, rallying around Calhoun's \"Exposition,\" were linked ideologically, if not yet practically, with Calhoun.</ref>\n\nPublished on July 26, 1831, the address repeated and expanded the positions Calhoun had made in the \"Exposition\". While the logic of much of the speech was consistent with the states' rights position of most Jacksonians, and even Daniel Webster remarked that it \"was the ablest and most plausible, and therefore the most dangerous vindication of that particular form of Revolution\", the speech still placed Calhoun clearly in a nullified camp. Within South Carolina, his gestures at moderation in the speech were drowned out as planters received word of the [[Nat Turner]] insurrection in Virginia. Calhoun was not alone in finding a connection between the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition movement]] and the sectional aspects of the tariff issue.<ref>Niven, pp. 181-184.</ref> It confirmed for Calhoun what he had written in a September 11, 1830, letter:\n\n<blockquote>I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the [[Peculiar institution|peculiar domestick {{sic}} institution]] of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness.<ref>Ellis pg. 193. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pg. 257.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFrom this point, the nullifiers accelerated their organization and rhetoric. In July 1831, the States Rights and Free Trade Association was formed in Charleston and expanded throughout the state. Unlike state political organizations in the past, which were led by the South Carolina planter aristocracy, this group appealed to all segments of the population, including non-slaveholder farmers, small slaveholders, and the Charleston non-agricultural class. Governor Hamilton was instrumental in seeing that the association, which was both a political and a social organization, expanded throughout the state. In the winter of 1831 and spring of 1832, Hamilton held conventions and rallies throughout the state to mobilize the nullification movement. The conservatives were unable to match the radicals in organization or leadership.<ref>Freehling, pp. 224-239.</ref>\n\nThe state elections of 1832 were \"charged with tension and bespattered with violence,\" and \"polite debates often degenerated into frontier brawls.\" Unlike the previous year's election, the choice was clear between nullifiers and unionists. The nullifiers won and on October 20, 1832, Hamilton called the legislature into a special session to consider a convention. The legislative vote was 96-25 in the House and 31-13 in the Senate<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 252-260.</ref>\n\nIn November 1832, the Nullification Convention met. The convention declared the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and unenforceable within the state of South Carolina after February 1, 1833. It was asserted that attempts to use force to collect the taxes would lead to the state's secession. Robert Hayne, who succeeded Hamilton as governor in 1833, established a 2,000-man group of mounted [[minutemen]] and 25,000 infantry who would march to Charleston in the event of a military conflict. These troops were to be armed with $100,000 in arms purchased in the North.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 1-3.</ref>\n\nThe enabling legislation passed by the legislature was carefully constructed to avoid clashes if at all possible and create an aura of legality in the process. To avoid conflicts with Unionists, it allowed importers to pay the tariff if they desired. Other merchants could pay the tariff by obtaining a paper tariff bond from the customs officer. They would then refuse to pay the bond when due, and if the customs official seized the goods, the merchant would file for a writ of [[replevin]] to recover the goods in state court. Customs officials who refused to return the goods (by placing them under the protection of federal troops) would be civilly liable for twice the value of the goods. To ensure that state officials and judges supported the law, a \"test oath\" would be required for all new state officials, binding them to support the ordinance of nullification.<ref>Ellis, pp. 97-98.</ref>\n\nGovernor Hayne in his inaugural address announced South Carolina's position:\n\n{{quote|If the sacred soil of Carolina should be polluted by the footsteps of an invader, or be stained with the blood of her citizens, shed in defense, I trust in Almighty God that no son of hers ... who has been nourished at her bosom ... will be found raising a parricidal arm against our common mother. And even should she stand ALONE in this great struggle for constitutional liberty ... that there will not be found, in the wider limits of the state, one recreant son who will not fly to the rescue, and be ready to lay down his life in her defense.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 3, pg. 14.</ref>}}\n\n==Washington, D.C. (1828\u20131832)==\n[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Official [[White House]] portrait of Andrew Jackson]]\n\nWhen President Jackson took office in March 1829, he was well aware of the turmoil created by the \"Tariff of Abominations\". While he may have abandoned some of his earlier beliefs that had allowed him to vote for the Tariff of 1824, he still felt protectionism was justified for products essential to military preparedness and did not believe that the current tariff should be reduced until the [[national debt]] was fully paid off. He addressed the issue in his inaugural address and his first three messages to Congress, but offered no specific relief. In December 1831, with the proponents of nullification in South Carolina gaining momentum, Jackson recommended \"the exercise of that spirit of concession and conciliation which has distinguished the friends of our Union in all great emergencies.\"<ref>Ellis, pp. 41-43.</ref> But on the constitutional issue of nullification, despite his strong beliefs in states' rights, Jackson did not waver.\n\nCalhoun's \"Exposition and Protest\" started a national debate on the doctrine of nullification. The leading proponents<ref>Ellis, pg. 9.</ref> of the nationalistic view included Daniel Webster, Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph Story]], Judge [[William Alexander Duer]], John Quincy Adams, [[Nathaniel Chipman]], and [[Nathan Dane]]. They rejected the [[compact theory]] advanced by Calhoun, claiming that the Constitution was the product of the people, not the states. According to the nationalist position, the Supreme Court had the final say on legislation's constitutionality, and the national union was perpetual and had supreme authority over individual states.<ref>Ellis pg. 9.</ref> The nullifiers, on the other hand, asserted that the central government was not the ultimate arbiter of its own power, and that the states, as the contracting entities, could judge for themselves what was constitutional. While Calhoun's \"Exposition\" claimed that nullification was based on the reasoning behind the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, an aging James Madison in an August 28, 1830, letter to [[Edward Everett]], intended for publication, disagreed. Madison wrote, denying that any individual state could alter the compact:<ref>Brant, pg. 627.</ref>\n\n{{quote| Can more be necessary to demonstrate the inadmissibility of such a doctrine than that it puts it in the power of the smallest fraction over 1/4 of the U. S.\u2014that is, of 7 States out of 24\u2014to give the law and even the Constn. to 17 States, each of the 17 having as parties to the Constn. an equal right with each of the 7 to expound it & to insist on the exposition. That the 7 might, in particular instances be right and the 17 wrong, is more than possible. But to establish a positive & permanent rule giving such a power to such a minority over such a majority, would overturn the first principle of free Govt. and in practice necessarily overturn the Govt. itself.<ref>Ellis pg. 10. Ellis wrote, \"But the nullifiers' attempt to legitimize their controversial doctrine by claiming it was a logical extension of the principles embodied in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions upset him. In a private letter he deliberately wrote for publication, Madison denied many of the assertions of the nullifiers and lashed out in particular at South Carolina's claim that if a state nullified an act of the federal government it could only be overruled by an amendment to the Constitution.\" Full text of the letter is available at http://www.constitution.org/jm/18300828_everett.htm.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Webster's Reply to Hayne.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Webster Replying to Hayne'' by George P.A. Healy]]\n\nPart of the South's strategy to force repeal of the tariff was to arrange an alliance with the West. Under the plan, the South would support the West's demand for free lands in the public domain if the West supported repeal of the tariff. With this purpose, Robert Hayne took the floor on the Senate in early 1830, beginning \"the most celebrated debate in the Senate's history.\" Daniel Webster's response shifted the debate, subsequently styled the Webster-Hayne debates, from the specific issue of western lands to a general debate on the very nature of the United States. Webster's position differed from Madison's: Webster asserted that the people of the United States acted as one aggregate body, while Madison held that the people of the several states acted collectively. [[John Rowan (politician)|John Rowan]] spoke against Webster on that issue, and Madison wrote, congratulating Webster, but explaining his own position.<ref>Brant, pp. 626-7. Webster never asserted the consolidating position again.</ref> The debate presented the fullest articulation of the differences over nullification, and 40,000 copies of Webster's response, which concluded with \"liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable\", were distributed nationwide.<ref>McDonald, pp. 105-106.</ref>\n\nMany people expected Jackson to side with Hayne, but once the debate shifted to secession and nullification, he sided with Webster. On April 13, 1830, at the traditional Democratic Party celebration honoring Jefferson's birthday, Jackson chose to make his position clear. In a battle of toasts, Hayne proposed, \"The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States.\" Jackson's response, when his turn came, was, \"Our Federal Union: It must be preserved.\" To those attending, the effect was dramatic. Calhoun responded with his own toast, in a play on Webster's closing remarks in the earlier debate, \"The Union. Next to our liberty, the most dear.\" Finally, Van Buren offered, \"Mutual forbearance and reciprocal concession. Through their agency the Union was established. The patriotic spirit from which they emanated will forever sustain it.\"\n\nVan Buren wrote in his autobiography of Jackson's toast, \"The veil was rent\u2014the incantations of the night were exposed to the light of day.\" Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], in his memoirs, wrote that the toast \"electrified the country.\"<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2, pp. 233-235.</ref> Jackson had the final word a few days later, when a visitor from South Carolina asked if Jackson had any message he wanted relayed to his friends back in the state. Jackson's reply was:\n\n{{quote|Yes I have; please give my compliments to my friends in your State and say to them, that if a single drop of blood shall be shed there in opposition to the laws of the United States, I will hang the first man I can lay my hand on engaged in such treasonable conduct, upon the first tree I can reach.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson',' v. 2, pp. 233-237.</ref>}}\n\nOther issues than the tariff were still being decided. In May 1830, Jackson vetoed the [[Maysville Road veto|Maysville Road Bill]], an important internal-improvements program (especially to Kentucky and Henry Clay), and then followed this with additional vetoes of other such projects shortly before Congress adjourned at the end of May. Clay used these vetoes to launch his presidential campaign.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2, pp. 255-256. Peterson, pp. 196-197.</ref> In 1831, the rechartering of the Bank of the United States, with Clay and Jackson on opposite sides, reopened a long-simmering problem. This issue was featured at the December 1831 National Republican convention in [[Baltimore]], which nominated Clay for president, and the proposal to recharter was formally introduced into Congress on January 6, 1832.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2, pp. 343-348.</ref> The Calhoun-Jackson split entered the center stage when Calhoun, as Vice President presiding over the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to deny Van Buren the post of minister to [[England]]. Van Buren was subsequently selected as Jackson's running mate at the [[1832 Democratic National Convention]] held in May.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2 pp. 347-355.</ref>\n\n[[File:Henry Clay.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of Henry Clay]]\n\nIn February 1832, Clay, back in the Senate after a two-decade absence, made a three-day speech calling for a new tariff schedule and an expansion of his American System. In an effort to reach out to Calhoun and other Southerners, Clay's proposal provided for a $10 million revenue reduction based on the budget surplus he anticipated for the coming year. Significant protection was still part of the plan, as the reduction primarily came on imports not in competition with domestic producers. Jackson proposed an alternative that reduced overall tariffs to 28%. John Quincy Adams, now in the House of Representatives, used his Committee of Manufacturers to produce a compromise bill that, in its final form, reduced revenues by $5 million, lowered duties on noncompetitive products, and retained high tariffs on woolens, iron, and cotton products. During the political maneuvering, McDuffie's [[Ways and Means Committee]], the normal originator of such bills, prepared a bill with drastic reduction across the board, but it went nowhere. Jackson signed the Tariff of 1832 on July 14, 1832, a few days after vetoing the Bank of the United States recharter bill. Congress adjourned after failing to override Jackson's veto.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2 pp. 358-373. Peterson, pp. 203-212.</ref>\n\nWith Congress adjourned, Jackson anxiously watched events in South Carolina. The nullifiers found no significant compromise in the Tariff of 1832 and acted accordingly. Jackson heard rumors of efforts to subvert members of the army and navy in Charleston and ordered the secretaries of the army and navy to begin rotating troops and officers based on their loyalty. He ordered General [[Winfield Scott]] to prepare for military operations and ordered a naval squadron in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] to prepare to go to Charleston. Jackson kept lines of communication open with unionists such as [[Joel Roberts Poinsett|Joel Poinsett]], [[William Drayton]], and [[James L. Petigru]] and sent George Breathitt, brother of [[John Breathitt|the Kentucky governor]], to independently obtain political and military intelligence. After their defeat at the polls in October, Petigru advised Jackson to \"Be prepared to hear very shortly of a State Convention and an act of Nullification.\"\n\nOn October 19, 1832 Jackson wrote to his [[Secretary of War]]:\n\n{{quote|The attempt will be made to surprise the Forts and garrisons by the militia, and must be guarded against with vestal vigilance and any attempt by force repelled with prompt and exemplary punishment.}}\n\nBy mid-November, Jackson's reelection was assured.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 2, pp. 382-389.</ref> On December 3, 1832, Jackson sent his fourth annual message to Congress. The message \"was stridently states' rights and agrarian in its tone and thrust\" and disavowed protection as anything other than a temporary expedient.<ref>Ellis pg. 82.</ref> His intent regarding nullification, as communicated to Van Buren, was \"to pass it barely in review, as a mere buble {{sic}}, view the existing laws as competent to check and put it down.\" He hoped to create a \"moral force\" that would transcend political parties and sections. The paragraph in the message that addressed nullification was:\n\n{{quote|It is my painful duty to state that in one quarter of the United States opposition to the revenue laws has arisen to a height which threatens to thwart their execution, if not to endanger the integrity of the Union. What ever obstructions may be thrown in the way of the judicial authorities of the General Government, it is hoped they will be able peaceably to overcome them by the prudence of their own officers and the patriotism of the people. But should this reasonable reliance on the moderation and good sense of all portions of our fellow citizens be disappointed, it is believed that the laws themselves are fully adequate to the suppression of such attempts as may be immediately made. Should the exigency arise rendering the execution of the existing laws impracticable from any cause what ever, prompt notice of it will be given to Congress, with a suggestion of such views and measures as may be deemed necessary to meet it.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v. 3 pp. 9-11. Full text of his message available at http://www.thisnation.com/library/sotu/1832aj.html</ref>}}\n\nOn December 10, Jackson issued the [[Proclamation to the People of South Carolina]], in which he characterized the positions of the nullifiers as \"impractical absurdity\" and \"a metaphysical subtlety, in pursuit of an impractical theory.\" He provided this concise statement of his belief:\n\n{{quote|I consider, then, the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.<ref>Ellis pg 83-84.

A group of Democrats, led by Van Buren and Thomas Hart Benton, among others, saw the only solution to the crisis in a substantial reduction of the tariff.\n\n==Negotiation and confrontation (1833)==\nIn apparent contradiction of his previous claim that the tariff could be enforced with existing laws, on January 16 Jackson sent his Force Bill Message to Congress. Custom houses in [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]] and [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]] would be closed and replaced by ships at each port. In Charleston, the custom house would be moved to either [[Castle Pinckney]] or [[Fort Moultrie]] in Charleston Harbor. Direct payment rather than bonds would be required, and federal jails would be established for violators the state refused to arrest and all cases arising under the state's nullification act could be removed to the [[United States Circuit Court]]. In the most controversial part, the militia acts of 1795 and 1807 would be revised to permit the enforcement of the customs laws by both the militia and the regular United States military. Attempts were made in South Carolina to shift the debate away from nullification by focusing instead on the proposed enforcement.<ref>Ellis, po. 93-95.</ref>\n\nThe Force bill went to the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Pennsylvania protectionist [[William Wilkins (U.S. politician)|William Wilkins]] and supported by members Daniel Webster and [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]] of New Jersey; it gave Jackson everything he asked. On January 28, the Senate defeated a motion by a vote of 30 to 15 to postpone debate on the bill. All but two of the votes to delay were from the lower South and only three from this section voted against the motion. This did not signal any increased support for nullification, but did signify doubts about enforcement. To draw more votes, proposals were made to limit the duration of the coercive powers and restrict the use of force to suppressing, rather than preventing, civil disorder. In the House, the Judiciary Committee voted 4-3 to reject Jackson's request to use force. By the time Calhoun made a major speech on February 15 strongly opposing it, the Force Bill was temporarily stalled.<ref>Ellis, pp. 160-165. Peterson, pp. 222-224. Peterson differs with Ellis in arguing that passage of the Force Bill \"was never in doubt.\"</ref>\n\nOn the tariff issue, the drafting of a compromise tariff was assigned in December to the House Ways and Means Committee, now headed by [[Gulian Crommelin Verplanck|Gulian C. Verplanck]]. Debate on the committee's product on the House floor began in January 1833. The Verplanck tariff proposed reductions back to 1816 levels over the next two years while maintaining the basic principle of [[protectionism]]. The anti-Jackson protectionists saw this as an economic disaster that did not even allow the Tariff of 1832 to be tested and \"an undignified truckling to the menaces and blustering of South Carolina.\" Northern Democrats did not oppose it in principle, but still demanded protection for the varying interests of their own constituents. Those sympathetic to the nullifiers wanted a specific abandonment of the principle of protectionism and were willing to offer a longer transition period as a bargaining point. The Verplanck tariff was clearly not going to be implemented.<ref>Ellis, pp. 99-100. Peterson, pg. 217.</ref>\n\nIn South Carolina, efforts were being made to avoid an unnecessary confrontation. Governor Hayne ordered the 25,000 troops he had created to train at home rather than gather in Charleston. At a mass meeting in Charleston on January 21, they decided to postpone the February 1 deadline for implementing nullification, while Congress worked on a compromise tariff. At the same time, a commissioner from Virginia, [[Benjamin W. Leigh]], arrived in Charleston bearing resolutions that criticized both Jackson and the nullifiers and offering his state as a mediator.<ref>Wilentz, pp. 384-385.</ref>\n\nClay had not taken his defeat in the presidential election well and was unsure what position he could take in the tariff negotiations. His long-term concern was that Jackson was determined to kill protectionism along with the American Plan. In February, after consulting with manufacturers and sugar interests in Louisiana, who favored protection for the sugar industry, Clay started to work on a specific compromise plan. As a starting point, he accepted the nullifiers' offer of a transition period, but extended it from seven and a half years to nine years with a final target of a 20% ''ad valorem'' rate. After first securing the support of his protectionist base, Clay, through an intermediary, broached the subject with Calhoun. Calhoun was receptive, and after a private meeting with Clay at Clay's boardinghouse, negotiations proceeded.<ref>Peterson, pp. 217-226.</ref>\n\nClay introduced the negotiated tariff bill on February 12, and it was immediately referred to a select committee consisting of Clay as chairman, [[Felix Grundy]] of Tennessee, [[George M. Dallas]] of Pennsylvania, [[William Cabell Rives]] of Virginia, Webster, [[John M. Clayton]] of Delaware, and Calhoun. On February 21, the committee reported a bill to the floor of the Senate that was largely Clay's original bill. The Tariff of 1832 would continue except that reduction of all rates above 20% would be reduced by one tenth every two years, with the final reductions back to 20% coming in 1842. Protectionism as a principle was not abandoned and provisions were made for raising the tariff if national interests demanded it.<ref>Peterson, pp. 226-228.</ref>\n\nAlthough not specifically linked by any negotiated agreement, it became clear that the Force Bill and [[Tariff of 1833|Compromise Tariff of 1833]] were inexorably linked. In his February 25 speech ending the debate on the tariff, Clay captured the spirit of the voices for compromise by condemning Jackson's Proclamation to South Carolina as inflammatory, admitting the same problem with the Force Bill, but indicating its necessity, and praising the Compromise Tariff as the final measure to restore balance, promote the rule of law, and avoid the \"sacked cities\", \"desolated fields\", and \"smoking ruins\" he said the failure to reach a final accord would produce. The House passed the Compromise Tariff, 119-85, and the Force Bill, 149-48. In the Senate, the tariff passed 29-16 and the Force bill 32-1, with many opponents of it walking out rather than voting.<ref>Peterson pp. 229-232.</ref>\n\nCalhoun rushed to Charleston with the news of the final compromises. The Nullification Convention met again on March 11. It repealed the November Nullification Ordinance and also, \"in a purely symbolic gesture\", nullified the Force Bill. While the nullifiers claimed victory on the tariff issue, even though they had made concessions, the verdict was very different on nullification. The majority had in the end ruled and this boded ill for the South and its minority's hold on slavery.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 295-297.</ref> Rhett summed this up at the convention on March 13. Warning that \"A people, owning slaves, are mad, or worse than mad, who do not hold their destinies in their own hands,\" he continued:\n\n{{quote|Every stride of this Government, over your rights, brings it nearer and nearer to your peculiar policy. ... The whole world are in arms against your institutions ... Let Gentlemen not be deceived. It is not the Tariff\u2014not Internal Improvement\u2014nor yet the Force bill, which constitutes the great evil against which we are contending. ... These are but the forms in which the despotic nature of the government is evinced\u2014but it is the despotism which constitutes the evil: and until this Government is made a limited Government ... there is no liberty\u2014no security for the South.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pg. 297. Willentz pg. 388.</ref>}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nPeople reflected on the meaning of the nullification crisis and its outcome for the country. On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote, \"the tariff was only a pretext, and [[Secession in the United States|disunion]] and [[Confederate States of America|Southern confederacy]] the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] question.\"<ref>[[Jon Meacham]] (2009), ''[[American Lion (book)|American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House]]'', New York: Random House, p. 247; ''Correspondence of Andrew Jackson'', Vol. V, p. 72.</ref>\n\nThe final resolution of the crisis and Jackson's leadership had appeal throughout the North and South. [[Robert V. Remini]], the historian and Jackson biographer, described the opposition that nullification drew from traditionally states' rights Southern states:\n\n{{quote|The Alabama legislature, for example, pronounced the doctrine \"unsound in theory and dangerous in practice.\" Georgia said it was \"mischievous,\" \"rash and revolutionary.\" Mississippi lawmakers chided the South Carolinians for acting with \"reckless precipitancy.\"<ref>Remini, Andrew Jackson, v3. pg. 42.</ref>}}\n \nThe historian [[Forrest McDonald]], describing the split over nullification among proponents of states' rights, wrote, \"The doctrine of states' rights, as embraced by most Americans, was not concerned exclusively, or even primarily, with state resistance to federal authority.\"<ref>McDonald, pg. 110.</ref> But by the end of the nullification crisis, many Southerners questioned whether Jacksonian Democrats still represented Southern interests. The historian [[William J. Cooper Jr.]] notes, \"Numerous Southerners had begun to perceive it [the [[Jacksonian Democracy|Jacksonian Democratic]] Party] as a spear aimed at the South rather than a shield defending the South.\"<ref name=\"Cooper pp. 53-65\">Cooper, pp. 53\u201365.</ref>\n\nIn the political vacuum created by this alienation, the Southern wing of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] was formed. The party was a coalition of interests united by the common thread of opposition to Jackson, and more specifically to his \"definition of [[Federal power|federal]] and executive power.\" The party included former National Republicans with an \"urban, commercial, and nationalist outlook\", as well as former nullifiers. Emphasizing that \"they were more southern than the Democrats,\" the party grew within the South by going \"after the abolition issue with unabashed vigor and glee.\" With both parties arguing who could best defend Southern institutions, the nuances of the differences between [[free soil]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], which became an issue in the late 1840s with the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]] and territorial expansion, never became part of the political dialogue. This failure increased the slavery issue's volatility.<ref name=\"Cooper pp. 53-65\"/>\n\nRichard Ellis argues that the end of the crisis signified the beginning of a new era. Within the states' rights movement, the traditional desire for \"a weak, inactive, and frugal government\" was challenged. Ellis writes, \"in the years leading up to the Civil War the nullifiers and their proslavery allies used the doctrine of states' rights and state sovereignty in such a way as to try to expand the powers of the federal government so that it could more effectively protect the peculiar institution.\" By the 1850s, states' rights had become a call for state equality under the Constitution.<ref>Ellis, pg. 198.</ref>\n\nMadison reacted to this incipient tendency by writing two paragraphs of \"Advice to My Country,\" found among his papers. It said that the Union \"should be cherished and perpetuated. Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her [[Pandora's box|box]] opened; and the disguised one, as the Serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into paradise.\" [[Richard Rush]] published this \"Advice\" in 1850, by which time Southern spirit was so high that it was denounced as a forgery.<ref>Brant p. 646; Rush produced a copy in Mrs. Madison's hand; the original also survives. The contemporary letter to [[Edward Coles]] (Brant, p. 639) makes plain that the enemy in question is the nullifier.</ref>\n\nThe first test for the South over slavery began during the final congressional session of 1835. In what became known as the [[Gag Rule]] Debates, abolitionists flooded the Congress with anti-slavery petitions to end slavery and the slave trade in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was reopened each session as Southerners, led by South Carolinians Henry Pinckney and John Hammond, prevented the petitions from even being officially received by Congress. Led by John Quincy Adams, the slavery debate remained on the national stage until late 1844, when Congress lifted all restrictions on processing the petitions.<ref>Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'', pp. 346-356. McDonald (pp. 121\u2013122) saw states' rights in the period from 1833\u20131847 as almost totally successful in creating a \"virtually nonfunctional\" federal government. This did not insure political harmony, as \"the national political arena became the center of heated controversy concerning the newly raised issue of slavery, a controversy that reached the flash point during the debates about the annexation of the Republic of Texas.\"</ref>\n\nDescribing the legacy of the crisis, Sean Wilentz writes:\n\n{{quote|The battle between Jacksonian democratic nationalists, northern and southern, and nullifier sectionalists would resound through the politics of slavery and antislavery for decades to come. Jackson's victory, ironically, would help accelerate the emergence of southern pro-slavery as a coherent and articulate political force, which would help solidify northern antislavery opinion, inside as well as outside Jackson's party. Those developments would accelerate the emergence of two fundamentally incompatible democracies, one in the slave South, the other in the free North.<ref name=\"Wilentz pg. 388\">Wilentz, p. 388.</ref>}}\n\nFor South Carolina, the legacy of the crisis involved both the divisions within the state during the crisis and the apparent isolation of the state as the crisis was resolved. By 1860, when it became the first state to secede, it was more internally united than any other Southern state. Historian Charles Edward Cauthen writes:\n\n{{quote|Probably to a greater extent than in any other Southern state South Carolina had been prepared by her leaders over a period of thirty years for the issues of 1860. Indoctrination in the principles of state sovereignty, education in the necessity of maintaining Southern institutions, warnings of the dangers of control of the federal government by a section hostile to its interests\u2014in a word, the education of the masses in the principles and necessity of secession under certain circumstances\u2014had been carried on with a skill and success hardly inferior to the masterly propaganda of the abolitionists themselves. It was this education, this propaganda, by South Carolina leaders which made secession the almost spontaneous movement that it was.<ref>Cauthen, pg. 32.</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Origins of the American Civil War]]\n*[[American System (economic plan)]]\n*[[American School (economics)]]\n*[[Alexander Hamilton]]\n*[[Friedrich List]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Brant, Irving: ''The Fourth President: A Life of James Madison'' Bobbs Merrill, 1970.\n* Buel, Richard Jr. ''America on the Brink: How the Political Struggle Over the War of 1812 Almost Destroyed the Young Republic'' (2005) {{ISBN|1-4039-6238-3}}\n* Cauthen, Charles Edward.

This separation was mandated by law, and many shrine-temples were forced to become just shrines, among them famous ones like [[Usa Hachiman-g\u016b]] and [[Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b]].\n\nBecause mixing the two religions was now forbidden, ''jing\u016bji'' had to give away some of their properties or dismantle some of their buildings, thus damaging the integrity of their cultural heritage and decreasing the historical and economic value of their properties.<ref name=\"KOT\">Kamakura Official Textbook for Culture and Tourism</ref> For example, Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b's giant [[Ni\u014d]] (the two wooden wardens usually found at the sides of a temple's entrance), being objects of Buddhist worship and therefore illegal where they were, were sold to [[Jufuku-ji]], where they still are.<ref>Mutsu (1995:172)</ref> The shrine-temple also had to destroy Buddhism-related buildings, for example its ''[[tah\u014dt\u014d]]'', its ''mi[[D\u014d (architecture)|d\u014d]]'', and its [[shichid\u014d garan]]''.<ref name=\"KOT\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===General features===\n[[File:170216 Nishi Honganji Kyoto Japan03s4.jpg|thumb|left|The roof is the dominant feature of a Buddhist temple.]]\nBuddhist architecture in Japan is not native, but imported from China and other Asian cultures over the centuries with such constancy that the building styles of all [[Six Dynasties]] are represented. Its history is, as a consequence, dominated by Chinese and other Asian techniques and styles (present even in [[Ise Shrine]], held to be the quintessence of Japanese architecture) on one side, and by Japanese original variations on those themes on the other.<ref name=\"hozintro\">Hozumi (1996:9-11)</ref>\n\nPartly due also to the variety of climates in Japan and the millennium encompassed between the first cultural import and the last, the result is extremely heterogeneous, but several practically universal features can be found nonetheless. First of all is the choice of materials, always wood in various forms (planks, straw, tree bark, etc.) for almost all structures. Unlike both Western and some Chinese architecture, the use of stone is avoided except for certain specific uses, for example temple [[Podium|podia]] and [[t\u014d|pagoda]] foundations.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/>\n\nThe general structure is almost always the same: [[post and lintel]] support a large and gently curved roof, while the walls are paper-thin, often movable and in any case non-carrying. The post and lintel structure embodies the Axis Mundi of the an iconic form of the Buddha which is typically represented in Pagodas and Indian Stupas. Arches and barrel roofs are completely absent. Gable and eave curves are gentler than in China and columnar [[entasis]] (convexity at the center) limited.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/>\n\nThe roof is the most visually impressive component, often constituting half the size of the whole edifice.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/> The slightly curved [[eaves]] extend far beyond the walls, covering verandas, and their weight must therefore be supported by complex bracket systems called ''[[toky\u014d]]''. These oversize eaves give the interior a characteristic dimness, which contributes to the temple's atmosphere. The interior of the building normally consists of a single room at the center called [[Moya (architecture)|''moya'']], from which sometimes depart other less important spaces, for example corridors called [[Hisashi (architecture)|''hisashi'']].\n\nInner space divisions are fluid, and room size can be modified through the use of screens or movable paper walls. The large, single space offered by the [[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|main hall]] can therefore be altered according to the need.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/> The separation between inside and outside is itself in some measure not absolute as entire walls can be removed, opening the temple to visitors. Verandas appear to be part of the building to an outsider, but part of the external world to those in the temple. Structures are therefore made to a certain extent part of their environment. The use of construction modules keeps proportions between different parts of the edifice constant, preserving its overall harmony.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/>(On the subject of temple proportions, see also the article [[Ken (architecture)|''ken'']]).\n\nEven in cases as that of [[Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b]], where every available space is heavily decorated, ornamentation tends to follow, and therefore emphasize rather than hide, basic structures.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/>\n\nBeing shared by both sacred and profane architecture, these architectonic features made it easy converting a lay building into a temple. This happened for example at H\u014dry\u016b-ji, where a noblewoman's mansion was transformed into a religious building.\n\nBuddhist architecture of the Heian Period consisted of the re-emergence of national tastes. The temple Hojoji represents paradise and the pure land which embodies elements of Pure Land Buddhism. The last formal temple was Motsuji.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMuroji is a temple complex found below the mountain of Mount Muro. The area behind the temple is sacred and is off limits to visitors and pilgrims. The caves of Mount Muro are especially sacred. The famous Dragon Cave is the thought to house the Dragon King who protects the country. This is an example of how natural elements are sacred aspects of Buddhist Temples.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Muroji Rearranging Art and History at a Japanese Buddhist Temple|last=Fowler|first=Sherry D.|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Honolulu|pages=9}}</ref>\n\nThere are four great temples of the seventh century: Askuadera, Kudara Odera, Kawaradera,  and Yakushiji.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Four Great Temples|last=McCallum|first=Donald F.|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8248-3114-1|location=Honolulu|pages=207}}</ref>\n\n=== Four Great Temples of the Seventh Century ===\n\n==== Asuka-Dera ====\nThis great hall had three golden halls and was the first full scale temple.

However, while the particular details may vary, the general themes and styles have strong similarities and common origins.\n\nThe already mentioned H\u014dry\u016b-ji was one of the first Buddhist temples built in Japan. Its primary structures represent the style current in 6th century CE [[Sui dynasty]] China. The [[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|Kond\u014d]] (Golden Hall) is a double-roofed structure, supported by thick, strong pillars, and giving a feeling of boldness and weight.\n\nMost Buddhist temples in Japan belong to one of four main styles:\n\n* [[Way\u014d]] -  A style developed in art and architecture in Japan during the [[Heian period]] by the [[Esoteric Buddhism|esoteric]] sects [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon]] on the basis of contemporary Chinese architecture. So called to distinguish it from imported Chinese styles, in architecture it was characterized by simplicity, refraining from ornamentation, use of natural timber and in general plain materials.\n*[[Daibutsuy\u014d]] - a Japanese religious architectural style which emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century on the basis of contemporary Chinese architecture. Introduced by priest [[Ch\u014dgen]], this grandiose and monumental style was based on [[Song Dynasty]] architecture and was the antithesis of the simple and traditional ''[[way\u014d]]'' style. The Nandaimon at [[T\u014ddai-ji]] and the Amida Hall at J\u014ddo-ji are the only extant examples of this style.<ref  name=\"fletcher-p737\">{{Harvnb|Fletcher|Cruickshank|1996}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gt1jTpXAThwC&pg=PA737#v=onepage&q&f=false p=737]</ref><ref name=\"nishi-p20\">{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oZl_yEJGtUYC&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q&f=false p=20]</ref>\n*[[Zensh\u016by\u014d]] - A style which takes its name from its creators, the Buddhist [[Zen|Zen sect]], and which emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century on the basis of contemporary Chinese architecture. The ''zensh\u016by\u014d'' was originally called {{nihongo|''karay\u014d''|\u5510\u69d8|Chinese style}} but, like the [[Daibutsuy\u014d|Daibutsu style]], was renamed by \u014cta Hirotar\u014d, a 20th-century scholar. Its characteristics are earthen floors, decorative curved pent roofs (''[[mokoshi]]'') and pronouncedly curved main roofs, [[wikt:cusped|cusped]] windows (''[[kat\u014dmado]]'') and paneled doors.<ref name=\"fletcher-p737\"/><ref name=\"fletcher-p738\">{{Harvnb|Fletcher|Cruickshank|1996}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gt1jTpXAThwC&pg=PA738#v=onepage&q&f=false p=738]</ref> Typical of the style is also the main hall (''[[Butsuden]]''), which has just one story but seems to have two because it has a covered pent roof called ''[[mokoshi]]''.\n*[[Setch\u016by\u014d]] - an architectural style born in Japan during the [[Muromachi period]] from the fusion of elements from three preceding styles, the ''way\u014d'',  the ''daibutsuy\u014d'' and ''zen'y\u014d''. It is exemplified by the [[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|main hall]] at [[Kakurin-ji]].<ref name=\"fletcher-p738\"/><ref name=\"young-p44\">{{Harvnb|Young|Young|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ag5WpEKifGEC&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false p=44]</ref> The combination of ''way\u014d'' and ''daibutsuy\u014d'' in particular became so frequent that sometimes it is classed separately by scholars under the name {{nihongo|''[[Shin-way\u014d]]''|\u65b0\u548c\u69d8|new ''way\u014d''}}.<ref name=\"fletcher-p738\"/>\n\n===Layout and geomantic positioning===\n[[File:Toshodaiji Nara Nara pref04s5s4290.jpg|thumb|left|Part of [[T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji]]'s ''garan'' (left to right, the ''kond\u014d'', the ''k\u014dd\u014d'', the ''kor\u014d'' and the ''Rai\u014d'')]]Buddhist temple complexes consist of a number of structures arranged according to certain concepts or guidelines.\n\nThe arrangement of the major buildings ({{nihongo||\u4f3d\u85cd\u914d\u7f6e|''[[shichid\u014d garan|garan]] haichi''|}}) changed over time. An early pattern had a gate, tower, ''[[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|kond\u014d]]'' and ''kod\u014d'' in a straight line from south to north. Corridors extended east and west from the flanks of the gate, then turned north, and finally joined north of the ''k\u014ddo'', forming a cloister around the pagoda and the major halls. This pattern, typified by [[Shitenn\u014d-ji]] in [[Osaka]], came from China via [[Baekje]]; the Chinese style of Buddhist temples, though altered somewhat by China via [[Korean peninsula]], ultimately was based on that of Chinese palaces, and this is evident in many of the basic design features which remain today in the temples of all three countries.\n\nA Buddhist temple complex in Japan generally follows the pattern of a series of sacred spaces encircling a courtyard, and entered via a set of gates. These gates will typically have a pair of large guardian statues, called ''[[Ni\u014d]]''.\n\nIn addition, many of the more important or powerful temples are built in locations which are favorable according to the precepts of Chinese [[geomancy]].  For example, Enryaku-ji, which sits atop [[Mount Hiei]] to the north-east of [[Kyoto]], is said to defend the city from evil spirits by being placed in that direction. The arrangements of mountains and other geographic features in particular directions around the temple play important roles as well. This custom continued for a long time. Eight centuries after the founding of Enryaku-ji, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] established [[Kan'ei-ji]] in a similar direction for the protection of their [[Edo Castle]]. Its mountain-name, Mount T\u014dei (\u6771'''\u53e1'''\u5c71 ''T\u014dei-zan''), takes a character from Mount Hiei (\u6bd4'''\u53e1'''\u5c71 ''Hiei-zan''), and can be interpreted as meaning \"the Mount Hiei of the East.\"\n\n[[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]'s [[Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b]] is now only a [[Shinto shrine]] but, before the {{nihongo|''Shinto and Buddhism Separation Order''|\u795e\u4ecf\u5224\u7136\u4ee4}} of 1868, its name was {{nihongo|Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b-ji|\u9db4\u5ca1\u516b\u5e61\u5bae\u5bfa|Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine Temple}} and it was also a Buddhist temple, one of the oldest of the city.<ref name=\"KOT56\">Kamakura Sh\u014dk\u014d Kaigijo (2008: 56-57)</ref> The temple and the city were built with [[Feng Shui]] in mind.<ref name=\"Onuki80\"/> The present location was carefully chosen as the most propitious after consulting a [[diviner]] because it had a mountain to the north (the {{nihongo|''Hokuzan''|\u5317\u5c71}}), a river to the east (the [[Namerikawa (Kanagawa)|Namerikawa]]) and a great road to the west (the {{nihongo|''Kot\u014d Kaid\u014d''|\u53e4\u6771\u8857\u9053}}), and was open to the south (on [[Sagami Bay]]).<ref name=\"Onuki80\">\u014cnuki (2008:80)</ref> Each direction was protected by a god: [[Black Tortoise|Genbu]] guarded the north, [[Azure Dragon|Seiry\u016b]] the east, [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|Byakko]] the west and [[Vermilion Bird|Suzaku]] the south.<ref name=\"Onuki80\"/> The [[willows]] near the ponds and the [[catalpa]]s next to the Museum of Modern Art represent respectively Seiry\u016b and Byakko.<ref name=\"Onuki80\"/>\n\nGeomancy lost in importance during the Heian period as temple layout was adapted to the natural environment, disregarding fengshui.\n\nIn addition to geomantic considerations, Buddhist temples, like any other religious structures, need to be organized in order to best serve their various purposes. The most important space in any Buddhist temple complex is the sacred space where images of Buddhas and [[bodhisattvas]] are kept, and where important rituals are performed. \n[[File:Zuiryuji Temple 2010-08-29 03.jpg|thumb|right|''Hatt\u014d'' at [[Zuiry\u016b-ji (Toyama)|Zuiry\u016b-ji]]]]\nThese areas are always separated from those accessible to the lay worshipers, though the distance between the two and the manner of their separation is quite varied. In many temples, there is little more than a wooden railing dividing the sacred space with that of the laypeople, but in many others there is a significant distance, perhaps a graveled courtyard, between the two.\n\nAnother structure or space of great importance accommodates the physical day-to-day needs of the clergy. Spaces for eating, sleeping and studying are essential, particularly in those temples that serve as monasteries.\n\nAccording to a 13th-century text,<ref>[[Sh\u014dtoku Taishi]]'s Denkokonmokurokush\u014d (\u8056\u5fb3\u592a\u5b50\u4f1d\u53e4\u4eca\u76ee\u9332\u6284)</ref> \"a garan is a temple with a ''kon-d\u014d'' (main hall), a ''[[t\u014d]]'' ([[pagoda]]), a ''k\u014d-d\u014d'' (lecture hall), a ''sh\u014dr\u014d'' (belfry), a ''jiki-d\u014d'' (refectory), a ''s\u014db\u014d'' (monks' living quarters), and a ''[[ky\u014dz\u014d]]'' (scriptures deposit, library).\"<ref name=\"kosetsu\">K\u014dsetsu Bukky\u014d Daijiten (\u5e83\u8aac\u4ecf\u6559\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178)</ref> These are the seven listed as ''shichid\u014d'' elements of a {{nihongo|[[Buddhism in Japan#Asuka and Nara periods|Nanto Rokush\u016b]]|\u5357\u90fd\u516d\u5b97|Nara six sects}}<ref>The six Buddhist schools {{nihongo2|\u5357\u90fd\u516d\u5b97}}, introduced to Japan during the [[Asuka Period|Asuka]] and [[Nara period]]s</ref> temple.<ref name=\"kojien\">Iwanami [[K\u014djien]]</ref>\n\nA 15th-century text<ref>{{nihongo|Sekiso \u014crai|\u5c3a\u7d20\u5f80\u6765}}</ref> describes how [[Zen]] school temples ([[S\u014dt\u014d]] ({{lang|ja|\u66f9\u6d1e}}), [[Rinzai]] ({{lang|ja|\u81e8\u6e08}}))<ref>The [[\u014cbaku|\u014cbaku School]] ({{lang|ja|\u9ec3\u6a97}}) arrived in Japan in the 17th century.</ref> included a ''[[butsuden]]'' or ''butsu-d\u014d'' (main hall), a ''hatt\u014d'' (lecture hall), a ''kuin'' (kitchen/office), a ''s\u014d-d\u014d'' (building dedicated to [[Zazen]]), a ''[[sanmon]]'' (main gate), a ''t\u014dsu'' (toilet) and a ''yokushitsu'' (bath).\n\n==Common temple features==\n[[File:Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities)-122729.jpg|thumb|Buddhist temple of [[Kinkaku-ji]], declared [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].]]\n*''[[Butsuden]]'' or ''Butsu-d\u014d'' (\u4ecf\u6bbf\u30fb\u4ecf\u5802)&nbsp;\u2013 lit. \"Hall of Buddha\".\n**A ''Zen'' temple's ''main hall''.

This tradition goes back to the times when temples were primarily monasteries purposely built in remote mountainous areas.<ref name=\"die\"/> The founding of a temple is called {{nihongo|''kaisan''|\u958b\u5c71|lit. opening of the mountain}} for this reason.\n\nNo fixed rules for its formation exist, but the ''sang\u014d'' is basically topographical in origin,<ref name=\"die\"/> as in Hieizan Enryaku-ji: these two names together mean \"[[Mount Hiei]]'s [[Enryaku-ji]]\". For this reason it is sometimes used as a personal name, particularly in [[Zen]]. There may be however some other semantic relationship between the ''sang\u014d'' and the ''san'in-jig\u014d'', as for example in the case of Rurik\u014dzan [[Yakushi-ji]]. The ''sang\u014d'' and the ''jig\u014d'' are simply different names of the same god.<ref name=\"die\"/> Sometimes the ''sang\u014d'' and the ''jig\u014d'' are both [[posthumous name]]s, for example of the founder's mother and father.\n\n===''Ing\u014d''===\nThe character {{nihongo|''in''|\u9662}}, which gives the ''ing\u014d'' its name, originally indicated an enclosure or section and therefore, by analogy, it later came to mean a [[cloister]] in a monastery.<ref name=\"die\"/> It is in this sense which it is applied to temples or, more often, subtemples. It can be also found in the name of formerly minor temples risen by chance to great prominence. For example, Kawagoe's [[Kita-in]] used to be one of three subtemples of a temple which no longer exist. Less frequent in an ''ing\u014d'' are {{nihongo|-''an''|\u5eb5|hermitage}} and {{nihongo|-''b\u014d''|\u574a|monk's living quarters}}. {{nihongo|-''[[D\u014d (architecture)|d\u014d]]''|\u5802|hall}} is normally used in the name of particular buildings of a temple's compound, e.g. Kannon-d\u014d, but can be employed as a name of minor or small temples.<ref name=\"die\"/>\n\n===''Jig\u014d''===\nThe only name in common use is however the ''jig\u014d'', (ending in {{Nihongo||\u301c\u5bfa|-ji, -tera, -dera|... temple}}) which can then be considered the main one.<ref name=\"die\"/> The ''sang\u014d'' and ''ing\u014d'' are not, and never were, in common use. The character -''ji'' it contains is sometimes pronounced ''tera'' or ''dera'' as in [[Kiyomizu-dera]], normally when the rest of the name is an indigenous name (''[[kun'yomi]]'').<ref name=\"die\"/>\n\n===Unofficial names===\nTemples are sometimes known by an unofficial but popular name. This is usually topographical in origin, as for example in the case of [[Asakusa]]'s [[Sens\u014d-ji]], also known as Asakusa-dera. A temple can also be named after a special or famous characteristic, as for example in the case [[Kyoto]]'s [[Saih\u014d-ji (Kyoto)|Saih\u014d-ji]], commonly called Koke-dera, or \"moss temple\" because of its famous moss garden.

Like a shrine, a Buddhist temple is not primarily a place of worship: its most important buildings are used for the safekeeping of sacred objects (the ''[[honzon]]'', equivalent to a shrine's ''[[shintai]]''), and are not accessible to worshipers.<ref name=\"Scheid-bauten\"/> Unlike a Christian church, a temple is also a [[monastery]]. There are specialized buildings for certain rites, but these are usually open only to a limited number of participants. Religious mass gatherings do not take place with regularity as with Christian religions, and are in any event not held inside the temple. If many people are involved in a ceremony, it will assume a festive character and will be held outdoors.<ref name=\"Scheid-bauten\"/> The architectural elements of a Buddhist temple are meant to embody themes and teachings of Buddhism.\n\nThe reason for the great structural resemblances between the Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines lies in their common history.

Shrines took from Buddhism its gates ([[Mon (architecture)|Mon]]), the use of a hall for lay worshipers, the use of [[vermilion]]-colored wood and more, while Chinese Buddhist architecture was adapted to Japanese tastes with more asymmetrical layouts, greater use of natural materials, and an adaptation of the monastery to the pre-existing natural environment.<ref name=\"young-p47\">{{Harvnb|Young|Young|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ag5WpEKifGEC&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q&f=false p=47]</ref>\n\nThe clear separation between Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, which today is the norm, emerges only as a result of the ''[[shinbutsu bunri]]'' (\"separation of ''kami'' and Buddhas\") law of 1868. This separation was mandated by law, and many shrine-temples were forced to become just shrines, among them famous ones like [[Usa Hachiman-g\u016b]] and [[Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b]].\n\nBecause mixing the two religions was now forbidden, ''jing\u016bji'' had to give away some of their properties or dismantle some of their buildings, thus damaging the integrity of their cultural heritage and decreasing the historical and economic value of their properties.<ref name=\"KOT\">Kamakura Official Textbook for Culture and Tourism</ref> For example, Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b's giant [[Ni\u014d]] (the two wooden wardens usually found at the sides of a temple's entrance), being objects of Buddhist worship and therefore illegal where they were, were sold to [[Jufuku-ji]], where they still are.<ref>Mutsu (1995:172)</ref> The shrine-temple also had to destroy Buddhism-related buildings, for example its ''[[tah\u014dt\u014d]]'', its ''mi[[D\u014d (architecture)|d\u014d]]'', and its [[shichid\u014d garan]]''.<ref name=\"KOT\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===General features===\n[[File:170216 Nishi Honganji Kyoto Japan03s4.jpg|thumb|left|The roof is the dominant feature of a Buddhist temple.]]\nBuddhist architecture in Japan is not native, but imported from China and other Asian cultures over the centuries with such constancy that the building styles of all [[Six Dynasties]] are represented. Its history is, as a consequence, dominated by Chinese and other Asian techniques and styles (present even in [[Ise Shrine]], held to be the quintessence of Japanese architecture) on one side, and by Japanese original variations on those themes on the other.<ref name=\"hozintro\">Hozumi (1996:9-11)</ref>\n\nPartly due also to the variety of climates in Japan and the millennium encompassed between the first cultural import and the last, the result is extremely heterogeneous, but several practically universal features can be found nonetheless. First of all is the choice of materials, always wood in various forms (planks, straw, tree bark, etc.) for almost all structures. Unlike both Western and some Chinese architecture, the use of stone is avoided except for certain specific uses, for example temple [[Podium|podia]] and [[t\u014d|pagoda]] foundations.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/>\n\nThe general structure is almost always the same: [[post and lintel]] support a large and gently curved roof, while the walls are paper-thin, often movable and in any case non-carrying. The post and lintel structure embodies the Axis Mundi of the an iconic form of the Buddha which is typically represented in Pagodas and Indian Stupas. Arches and barrel roofs are completely absent. Gable and eave curves are gentler than in China and columnar [[entasis]] (convexity at the center) limited.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/>\n\nThe roof is the most visually impressive component, often constituting half the size of the whole edifice.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/> The slightly curved [[eaves]] extend far beyond the walls, covering verandas, and their weight must therefore be supported by complex bracket systems called ''[[toky\u014d]]''. These oversize eaves give the interior a characteristic dimness, which contributes to the temple's atmosphere. The interior of the building normally consists of a single room at the center called [[Moya (architecture)|''moya'']], from which sometimes depart other less important spaces, for example corridors called [[Hisashi (architecture)|''hisashi'']].\n\nInner space divisions are fluid, and room size can be modified through the use of screens or movable paper walls. The large, single space offered by the [[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|main hall]] can therefore be altered according to the need.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/> The separation between inside and outside is itself in some measure not absolute as entire walls can be removed, opening the temple to visitors. Verandas appear to be part of the building to an outsider, but part of the external world to those in the temple. Structures are therefore made to a certain extent part of their environment. The use of construction modules keeps proportions between different parts of the edifice constant, preserving its overall harmony.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/>(On the subject of temple proportions, see also the article [[Ken (architecture)|''ken'']]).\n\nEven in cases as that of [[Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b]], where every available space is heavily decorated, ornamentation tends to follow, and therefore emphasize rather than hide, basic structures.<ref name=\"hozintro\"/>\n\nBeing shared by both sacred and profane architecture, these architectonic features made it easy converting a lay building into a temple. This happened for example at H\u014dry\u016b-ji, where a noblewoman's mansion was transformed into a religious building. \n\nBuddhist architecture of the Heian Period consisted of the re-emergence of national tastes. The temple Hojoji represents paradise and the pure land which embodies elements of Pure Land Buddhism. The last formal temple was Motsuji.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMuroji is a temple complex found below the mountain of Mount Muro. The area behind the temple is sacred and is off limits to visitors and pilgrims. The caves of Mount Muro are especially sacred. The famous Dragon Cave is the thought to house the Dragon King who protects the country. This is an example of how natural elements are sacred aspects of Buddhist Temples.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Muroji Rearranging Art and History at a Japanese Buddhist Temple|last=Fowler|first=Sherry D.|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Honolulu|pages=9}}</ref>\n\nThere are four great temples of the seventh century: Askuadera, Kudara Odera, Kawaradera,  and Yakushiji.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Four Great Temples|last=McCallum|first=Donald F.|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8248-3114-1|location=Honolulu|pages=207}}</ref>\n\n=== Four Great Temples of the Seventh Century ===\n\n==== Asuka-Dera ====\nThis great hall had three golden halls and was the first full scale temple.

However, while the particular details may vary, the general themes and styles have strong similarities and common origins.\n\nThe already mentioned H\u014dry\u016b-ji was one of the first Buddhist temples built in Japan. Its primary structures represent the style current in 6th century CE [[Sui dynasty]] China. The [[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|Kond\u014d]] (Golden Hall) is a double-roofed structure, supported by thick, strong pillars, and giving a feeling of boldness and weight.\n\nMost Buddhist temples in Japan belong to one of four main styles:\n\n* [[Way\u014d]] -  A style developed in art and architecture in Japan during the [[Heian period]] by the [[Esoteric Buddhism|esoteric]] sects [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon]] on the basis of contemporary Chinese architecture. So called to distinguish it from imported Chinese styles, in architecture it was characterized by simplicity, refraining from ornamentation, use of natural timber and in general plain materials.\n*[[Daibutsuy\u014d]] - a Japanese religious architectural style which emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century on the basis of contemporary Chinese architecture. Introduced by priest [[Ch\u014dgen]], this grandiose and monumental style was based on [[Song Dynasty]] architecture and was the antithesis of the simple and traditional ''[[way\u014d]]'' style.

An early pattern had a gate, tower, ''[[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|kond\u014d]]'' and ''kod\u014d'' in a straight line from south to north. Corridors extended east and west from the flanks of the gate, then turned north, and finally joined north of the ''k\u014ddo'', forming a cloister around the pagoda and the major halls. This pattern, typified by [[Shitenn\u014d-ji]] in [[Osaka]], came from China via [[Baekje]]; the Chinese style of Buddhist temples, though altered somewhat by China via [[Korean peninsula]], ultimately was based on that of Chinese palaces, and this is evident in many of the basic design features which remain today in the temples of all three countries.\n\nA Buddhist temple complex in Japan generally follows the pattern of a series of sacred spaces encircling a courtyard, and entered via a set of gates. These gates will typically have a pair of large guardian statues, called ''[[Ni\u014d]]''.\n\nIn addition, many of the more important or powerful temples are built in locations which are favorable according to the precepts of Chinese [[geomancy]].  For example, Enryaku-ji, which sits atop [[Mount Hiei]] to the north-east of [[Kyoto]], is said to defend the city from evil spirits by being placed in that direction. The arrangements of mountains and other geographic features in particular directions around the temple play important roles as well. This custom continued for a long time. Eight centuries after the founding of Enryaku-ji, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] established [[Kan'ei-ji]] in a similar direction for the protection of their [[Edo Castle]]. Its mountain-name, Mount T\u014dei (\u6771'''\u53e1'''\u5c71 ''T\u014dei-zan''), takes a character from Mount Hiei (\u6bd4'''\u53e1'''\u5c71 ''Hiei-zan''), and can be interpreted as meaning \"the Mount Hiei of the East.\"\n\n[[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]'s [[Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b]] is now only a [[Shinto shrine]] but, before the {{nihongo|''Shinto and Buddhism Separation Order''|\u795e\u4ecf\u5224\u7136\u4ee4}} of 1868, its name was {{nihongo|Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b-ji|\u9db4\u5ca1\u516b\u5e61\u5bae\u5bfa|Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine Temple}} and it was also a Buddhist temple, one of the oldest of the city.<ref name=\"KOT56\">Kamakura Sh\u014dk\u014d Kaigijo (2008: 56-57)</ref> The temple and the city were built with [[Feng Shui]] in mind.<ref name=\"Onuki80\"/> The present location was carefully chosen as the most propitious after consulting a [[diviner]] because it had a mountain to the north (the {{nihongo|''Hokuzan''|\u5317\u5c71}}), a river to the east (the [[Namerikawa (Kanagawa)|Namerikawa]]) and a great road to the west (the {{nihongo|''Kot\u014d Kaid\u014d''|\u53e4\u6771\u8857\u9053}}), and was open to the south (on [[Sagami Bay]]).<ref name=\"Onuki80\">\u014cnuki (2008:80)</ref> Each direction was protected by a god: [[Black Tortoise|Genbu]] guarded the north, [[Azure Dragon|Seiry\u016b]] the east, [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|Byakko]] the west and [[Vermilion Bird|Suzaku]] the south.<ref name=\"Onuki80\"/> The [[willows]] near the ponds and the [[catalpa]]s next to the Museum of Modern Art represent respectively Seiry\u016b and Byakko.<ref name=\"Onuki80\"/>\n\nGeomancy lost in importance during the Heian period as temple layout was adapted to the natural environment, disregarding fengshui.\n\nIn addition to geomantic considerations, Buddhist temples, like any other religious structures, need to be organized in order to best serve their various purposes. The most important space in any Buddhist temple complex is the sacred space where images of Buddhas and [[bodhisattvas]] are kept, and where important rituals are performed. \n[[File:Zuiryuji Temple 2010-08-29 03.jpg|thumb|right|''Hatt\u014d'' at [[Zuiry\u016b-ji (Toyama)|Zuiry\u016b-ji]]]]\nThese areas are always separated from those accessible to the lay worshipers, though the distance between the two and the manner of their separation is quite varied. In many temples, there is little more than a wooden railing dividing the sacred space with that of the laypeople, but in many others there is a significant distance, perhaps a graveled courtyard, between the two.\n\nAnother structure or space of great importance accommodates the physical day-to-day needs of the clergy. Spaces for eating, sleeping and studying are essential, particularly in those temples that serve as monasteries.\n\nAccording to a 13th-century text,<ref>[[Sh\u014dtoku Taishi]]'s Denkokonmokurokush\u014d (\u8056\u5fb3\u592a\u5b50\u4f1d\u53e4\u4eca\u76ee\u9332\u6284)</ref> \"a garan is a temple with a ''kon-d\u014d'' (main hall), a ''[[t\u014d]]'' ([[pagoda]]), a ''k\u014d-d\u014d'' (lecture hall), a ''sh\u014dr\u014d'' (belfry), a ''jiki-d\u014d'' (refectory), a ''s\u014db\u014d'' (monks' living quarters), and a ''[[ky\u014dz\u014d]]'' (scriptures deposit, library).\"<ref name=\"kosetsu\">K\u014dsetsu Bukky\u014d Daijiten (\u5e83\u8aac\u4ecf\u6559\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178)</ref> These are the seven listed as ''shichid\u014d'' elements of a {{nihongo|[[Buddhism in Japan#Asuka and Nara periods|Nanto Rokush\u016b]]|\u5357\u90fd\u516d\u5b97|Nara six sects}}<ref>The six Buddhist schools {{nihongo2|\u5357\u90fd\u516d\u5b97}}, introduced to Japan during the [[Asuka Period|Asuka]] and [[Nara period]]s</ref> temple.<ref name=\"kojien\">Iwanami [[K\u014djien]]</ref>\n\nA 15th-century text<ref>{{nihongo|Sekiso \u014crai|\u5c3a\u7d20\u5f80\u6765}}</ref> describes how [[Zen]] school temples ([[S\u014dt\u014d]] ({{lang|ja|\u66f9\u6d1e}}), [[Rinzai]] ({{lang|ja|\u81e8\u6e08}}))<ref>The [[\u014cbaku|\u014cbaku School]] ({{lang|ja|\u9ec3\u6a97}}) arrived in Japan in the 17th century.</ref> included a ''[[butsuden]]'' or ''butsu-d\u014d'' (main hall), a ''hatt\u014d'' (lecture hall), a ''kuin'' (kitchen/office), a ''s\u014d-d\u014d'' (building dedicated to [[Zazen]]), a ''[[sanmon]]'' (main gate), a ''t\u014dsu'' (toilet) and a ''yokushitsu'' (bath).\n\n==Common temple features==\n[[File:Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities)-122729.jpg|thumb|Buddhist temple of [[Kinkaku-ji]], declared [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].]]\n*''[[Butsuden]]'' or ''Butsu-d\u014d'' (\u4ecf\u6bbf\u30fb\u4ecf\u5802)&nbsp;\u2013 lit. \"Hall of Buddha\".\n**A ''Zen'' temple's ''main hall''.

The first is the {{nihongo|''sang\u014d''|\u5c71\u53f7|mountain name}}, the second is the {{nihongo|''ing\u014d''|\u9662\u53f7|cloister name}} and the third is the {{nihongo|san'in-jig\u014d|\u5c71\u9662\u5bfa\u53f7|temple name}}.<ref name=\"die\">{{cite journal|last=Seckel|first=Dietrich|title=Buddhist Temple Names in Japan|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|date=Winter 1985|volume=40, N. 4|pages=359\u2013386|jstor=2384822}}</ref>\n\n===''Sang\u014d''===\nEven though they may be located at the bottom of a valley, temples are metaphorically called mountains and even the numbers used to count them carry the ending {{nihongo|-''san'' or -''zan''|\u5c71}}, hence the name ''sang\u014d''. This tradition goes back to the times when temples were primarily monasteries purposely built in remote mountainous areas.<ref name=\"die\"/> The founding of a temple is called {{nihongo|''kaisan''|\u958b\u5c71|lit. opening of the mountain}} for this reason.\n\nNo fixed rules for its formation exist, but the ''sang\u014d'' is basically topographical in origin,<ref name=\"die\"/> as in Hieizan Enryaku-ji: these two names together mean \"[[Mount Hiei]]'s [[Enryaku-ji]]\". For this reason it is sometimes used as a personal name, particularly in [[Zen]]. There may be however some other semantic relationship between the ''sang\u014d'' and the ''san'in-jig\u014d'', as for example in the case of Rurik\u014dzan [[Yakushi-ji]]. The ''sang\u014d'' and the ''jig\u014d'' are simply different names of the same god.<ref name=\"die\"/> Sometimes the ''sang\u014d'' and the ''jig\u014d'' are both [[posthumous name]]s, for example of the founder's mother and father.\n\n===''Ing\u014d''===\nThe character {{nihongo|''in''|\u9662}}, which gives the ''ing\u014d'' its name, originally indicated an enclosure or section and therefore, by analogy, it later came to mean a [[cloister]] in a monastery.<ref name=\"die\"/> It is in this sense which it is applied to temples or, more often, subtemples. It can be also found in the name of formerly minor temples risen by chance to great prominence. For example, Kawagoe's [[Kita-in]] used to be one of three subtemples of a temple which no longer exist. Less frequent in an ''ing\u014d'' are {{nihongo|-''an''|\u5eb5|hermitage}} and {{nihongo|-''b\u014d''|\u574a|monk's living quarters}}. {{nihongo|-''[[D\u014d (architecture)|d\u014d]]''|\u5802|hall}} is normally used in the name of particular buildings of a temple's compound, e.g. Kannon-d\u014d, but can be employed as a name of minor or small temples.<ref name=\"die\"/>\n\n===''Jig\u014d''===\nThe only name in common use is however the ''jig\u014d'', (ending in {{Nihongo||\u301c\u5bfa|-ji, -tera, -dera|... temple}}) which can then be considered the main one.<ref name=\"die\"/> The ''sang\u014d'' and ''ing\u014d'' are not, and never were, in common use. The character -''ji'' it contains is sometimes pronounced ''tera'' or ''dera'' as in [[Kiyomizu-dera]], normally when the rest of the name is an indigenous name (''[[kun'yomi]]'').<ref name=\"die\"/>\n\n===Unofficial names===\nTemples are sometimes known by an unofficial but popular name. This is usually topographical in origin, as for example in the case of [[Asakusa]]'s [[Sens\u014d-ji]], also known as Asakusa-dera. A temple can also be named after a special or famous characteristic, as for example in the case [[Kyoto]]'s [[Saih\u014d-ji (Kyoto)|Saih\u014d-ji]], commonly called Koke-dera, or \"moss temple\" because of its famous moss garden. Unofficial names can have various other origins.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"130px\">\nFile:Kozanji Temple (Shimonoseki).JPG|[[K\u014dzan-ji (Shimonoseki)|K\u014dzan-ji]]'s ''Butsuden'' in Shimonoseki\nFile:Motoyamaji-Chinjyudou.jpg|[[Motoyama-ji]]'s ''chinj\u016b-d\u014d''\nFile:Chohoji06s3200.jpg|[[Ch\u014dh\u014d-ji (Kainan)|Ch\u014dh\u014d-ji]]'s ''chinj\u016b-d\u014d''\nFile:Horyu-ji03s3200.jpg|''Ch\u016bmon'' at [[H\u014dry\u016b-ji]]\nFile:Kenninji Kyoto06n4272.jpg|[[Kennin-ji]]'s ''hatt\u014d''\nFile:Todaiji_hokkedo.jpg|[[T\u014ddai-ji]]'s ''Hokke-d\u014d''\nFile:Jingoji Kyoto Kyoto14s5s4592.jpg|[[Jingo-ji]]'s ''honb\u014d''\nFile:TofukujiHondo.jpg|[[T\u014dfuku-ji]]'s ''hon-d\u014d''\nFile:Engyoji17s4592.jpg|[[Engy\u014d-ji]]'s ''jiki-d\u014d''\nFile:\u85ac\u5e2b\u5bfa\u56de\u5eca.jpg|[[Yakushi-ji]]'s ''kair\u014d''\nFile:TofukujiKaisando.jpg|T\u014dfuku-ji's ''kaisan-d\u014d''\nFile:Hogonji00bs3872.jpg|[[H\u014dgon-ji]]'s ''karamon''\nFile:Shitennoj honbo garden06s3200.jpg|[[Shitenn\u014d-ji]]'s ''karesansui''\nFile:Katoumado.jpg|A ''kat\u014dmado''\nFile:Tofukuji-Sanmon-M9589.jpg|[[T\u014dfuku-ji]]'s ''sanmon'' is 5 ''ken'' wide.\nFile:Toshodaiji Nara Nara pref05n4320.jpg|''K\u014d-d\u014d'' at [[T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji]]\nFile:Toshodaiji Nara Nara pref01s5s4290.jpg|''Kon-d\u014d'' at T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji\nFile:Komyoji Corridor near Pond Kamakura.jpg|A ''konr\u014d'' <!-- It is ALSO Buddhist architecture now.-->\nFile:Kyoto Toji Mieido C0973.jpg|''Miei-d\u014d'' at [[T\u014d-ji]]\nFile:Horyu-ji02s3200.jpg|''Nandaimon'' at H\u014dry\u016b-ji\nFile:Hasedera Noborirou.jpg|The ''noborir\u014d'' at Nara's ''[[Hase-dera]]''\nFile:Koumyouji5501.JPG|''Nij\u016bmon'' at [[K\u014dmy\u014d-ji (Ayabe)|K\u014dmy\u014d-ji]] in [[Ayabe, Kyoto|Ayabe]].\nFile:Ishiteji 04.JPG|[[Ishite-ji]]'s ''[[ni\u014dmon]]''\nFile:Yakushiji-MF007-0069.jpg|(East) Pagoda at [[Yakushi-ji]] in Nara\nFile:Enjoji Nara14sb3200.jpg|[[Enj\u014d-ji]]'s ''r\u014dmon''\nFile:Stone stairway Kiyomizu-dera.JPG|[[Kiyomizu-dera]]'s ''sand\u014d''\nFile:Chionin35n3200.jpg|A high rank, five-bay ''sanmon'' at [[Chion-in]].

They first appeared in the series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' (1966\u20131969). They have appeared in most subsequent ''Star Trek'' releases, including: ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series|The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard|Picard]]''. They have also appeared in the ''Star Trek'' [[Star Trek (film series)|feature films]] ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' (1989), ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' (1991), ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' (2002) and ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009). They also appear in various other spin-off media, including books, comics, toys and games.\n\nWriter [[Paul Schneider (writer)|Paul Schneider]] created the Romulans for use in the 1966 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode \"[[Balance of Terror]]\". As a basis, he considered what the ancient [[Roman Empire]] might have looked like had it developed to the point of [[spaceflight]]. Physically, the Romulans were presented as [[humanoid]], but the show's make-up department gave them pointed ears to distinguish them from humans. In the series, which is set in the 23rd century, the Romulans were speculated as to having split from another alien species, the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]], in the distant past. In contrast to the Vulcans, who were presented as peaceful and logic-oriented, the Romulans were depicted as militaristic, having founded an interstellar empire. The Romulans were used as antagonists for the series' protagonists, the [[starship]] USS ''Enterprise'', her crew, and their fictional government, the [[United Federation of Planets]].\n\nIn 1987, the writers of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''\u2014set in the 24th century\u2014again used the Romulans as antagonists of the Federation. The show's designers gave the Romulans new costumes and added a V-shaped ridge on the foreheads of most Romulan characters, though with indications that Romulans without the ridges also existed.  In the series, Star Trek: Enterprise, Romulans without ridges are depicted as passing for Vulcans (who do not have ridges either). The 2009 film, ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', depicted the Romulan homeworld, Romulus, being destroyed by a [[supernova]] in the year 2387. This film featured Romulans without the head ridges. The impact of Romulus' destruction forms a plot-theme in the ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'' series. Romulans in that series have included those with and without ridges, and a line about northern Romulans may have been intended to refer to these two groups.\n\n==History==\n\n===Original development===\n\nThe Romulans were devised for the episode \"[[Balance of Terror]]\". In 2014, \"Balance of Terror\" was rated the best episode in the franchise by [[Io9]].<ref name=\"io9st100\">{{Cite web\n|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-top-100-star-trek-episodes-of-all-time-1641565699\n|title=The Top 100 Star Trek Episodes Of All Time!\n|first=Charlie Jane\n|last=Anders\n|date=October 2, 2014\n|publisher=[[io9]]\n|accessdate=May 21, 2019\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Romulans were reused for the second-season episode \"[[The Deadly Years]]\" and the third-season episode \"[[The Enterprise Incident]]\".\n\n===Reintroduction in the 1980s and 1990s===\n\nAfter the launch of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' in 1987, the show's writers introduced the Romulans in the final episode of the first season, \"[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]\", which aired in the U.S. in May 1988.{{sfn|Nemecek|1995|pp=59\u201360}} The episode was written by [[Maurice Hurley]], who later acknowledged rushing it, putting together a script in a day and a half.{{sfn|Nemecek|1995|pp=59\u201360}} In the episode, which is set in the year 2364, the Starfleet ship [[USS Enterprise-D|USS ''Enterprise''-D]]\u2014whose crew are the series' main protagonists\u2014responds to the disappearance of Federation colonies along the Neutral Zone, fearing that it reflects growing Romulan activity in the region. Investigating, the ''Enterprise'' crew encounter a Romulan spaceship; it is stated that this is the first encounter between the two peoples for 53 years.

Among their key appearances have been:\n\n* [[Diane Duane]]'s miniseries ''[[Star Trek: Rihannsu]]'', consisting to-date of five books written between 1984 and 2006, is regarded as one of deepest works focusing on the Romulans.\n* In Dalla Van Hise's ''[[Killing Time (Star Trek novel)|Killing Time]]'' (1985), the Romulans use time travel to alter history, which results in James T. Kirk becoming an ensign and Spock a starship captain.\n* A prototype Romulan warbird is the focus of [[Simon Hawke]]'s novel ''[[Simon Hawke#Star Trek The Next Generation|The Romulan Prize]]'' (1993).\n* Robert Greenberger's ''The Romulan Stratagem'' (1995) involves [[Jean-Luc Picard]] and his crew competing with the Romulan officer [[Sela (Star Trek)|Sela]] to convince a planet to join their respective states.\n* In [[Diane Carey]]'s ''Red Sector'' (1999), Spock and [[Leonard McCoy]] try to cure a virus that has infected the Romulan royal family.\n* [[Josepha Sherman]] and Susan M. Schwartz's ''Vulcan's Heart'' (1999) involved Spock traveling to Romulus to aid the Romulan Commander from \"[[The Enterprise Incident|The ''Enterprise'' Incident]]\".\n* ''[[Captain's Blood]]'' (2003), one of many collaborative works between ''Star Trek'' lead [[William Shatner]] and husband-and-wife team [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]], focused on the involvement of Kirk in preventing a Romulan [[civil war]] in the aftermath of ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''.\n* The Tomed Incident is the focus of David R. George III's novel ''Serpents Among the Ruins'' (2003), which features the crew of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-B)|Enterprise-B]]''.\n* ''Star Trek: Vulcan's Soul'' is a trilogy written by Sherman and Shwartz between 2004 and 2007; set in the aftermath of the [[Dominion War]], it focuses on members of Kirk's original crew becoming involved in a war between the Romulans and a fellow Vulcan offshoot, the Watraii.\n* In ''[[Star Trek: Titan]]'' premier ''Taking Wing'' (2005), the Romulan Star Empire collapses into civil war in the wake of ''Star Trek: Nemesis''.\n* The ''Star Trek: Titan'' novel ''The Red King'' (2005) opens with the disappearance of a Romulan fleet and features Donatra, the Romulan commander featured in ''Star Trek: Nemesis'', working alongside William Riker and his crew.\n* In the novel ''Kobayashi Maru'' (2008) by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels, Admiral Valdore attempts once again to cause conflict in the region approximately one year after the incident involving the Aenar, this time using a \"telecapture\" system, designed to take over and control enemy ships. Using three Klingon vessels, Valdore attacks Coalition of Planets allies hoping to weaken or destroy two enemies of the Romulan Star Empire by provoking a war. Captain Archer is eventually able to provide evidence of this Romulan deception. This is followed by yet another unsuccessful attempt to break apart the alliance which involves using telecaptured Vulcan cruisers against Proxima Centauri (a recent coalition member). In the book, the event that finally sparks the Coalition's declaration of war against the Romulans is the destruction of the Earth freighter ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]''.\n* The sequel to the novel ''Kobayashi Maru'' is titled ''The Romulan War: Beneath the Raptor's Wing'' by Michael A. Martin. It is set between July 22, 2155 and July 22, 2156, and details the war between the Coalition of Planets and the Romulan Star Empire. The story focuses on the Romulan attempts at taking over the Coalition whilst the Vulcans who are aware they are vulnerable to the telecapture weapon withdraw from the fight early. The other Coalition members withdraw one by one in the face of continued losses, leaving it up to Earth Starfleet to stop the Romulan menace.\n* In ''[[Star Trek Online]]'', set in the year 2409, a Romulan surivior \"D'Tan\" assisted in building a New Romulus after the destruction of the original homeworld twenty-two years prior. As part of rebuilding a new Romulan Republic, he became leader of the Romulan Unification Movement in an attempt to continue Ambassador Spock's work of bringing the Vulcan and Romulan people together.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction|Television}}\n* [[Weapons in Star Trek|Weapons in ''Star Trek'']]\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n\n* {{cite book |last1=Erdmann |first1=Terry J. |last2=Block |first2=Paula M. |year=2000 |title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York |isbn=9780671501068 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Nemecek |first=Larry |year=1995 |title=The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion |edition=revised |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York |isbn=9780671883409 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/startreknextgene00neme_0 }}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages''\n* ''[[Star Trek: The Magazine]]'' vol.3, #10 (February 2003) and #11 (March 2003)\n* ''Star Trek Enterprise: The Good That Men Do''\n* ''Star Trek Enterprise: Kobayashi Maru''\n* ''Star Trek Enterprise: The Romulan War - Beneath the Raptor's Wing''\n\n==External links==\n{{Memory Alpha|Romulan}}\n* [http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/library/aliens/article/70706.html StarTrek.com - Romulans]\n* [http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/features/documentaries/article/1479.html StarTrek.com - \"Strange Relations: Romulans and Vulcans\"]\n* [http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/features/specials/article/1629.html StarTrek.com - \"Great Romulan Episodes\"]\n\n{{Star Trek Romulan stories}}\n{{Star Trek}}\n\n[[Category:Romulans| ]]\n[[Category:Fictional elements introduced in 1966]]\n[[Category:Fictional humanoids]]\n[[Category:Galactic empires]]\n[[Category:Star Trek species]]\n\n[[de:V\u00f6lker und Gruppierungen im Star-Trek-Universum#Romulaner]]\n[[sv:Lista \u00f6ver utomjordiska raser i Star Trek#Romulaner]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional extraterrestrial humanoid species in the Star Trek franchise}}\n{{Infobox fictional race\n| name               = Romulans\n| image              = Star Trek costume - Romulan.jpg\n| caption            = A mannequin of a Romulan, as they appeared in the television series ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''\n| series             = [[Star Trek]]\n| home_world         = Romulus\n| quadrant           = Beta\n}}\nThe '''Romulans''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|\u0252|m|j|\u028a|l|\u0259|n|z|,_|-|j|\u0259|-}}) are a fictional [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] race in the American [[science fiction]] franchise ''[[Star Trek]]''. They first appeared in the series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' (1966\u20131969). They have appeared in most subsequent ''Star Trek'' releases, including: ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series|The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard|Picard]]''. They have also appeared in the ''Star Trek'' [[Star Trek (film series)|feature films]] ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' (1989), ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' (1991), ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' (2002) and ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009). They also appear in various other spin-off media, including books, comics, toys and games.\n\nWriter [[Paul Schneider (writer)|Paul Schneider]] created the Romulans for use in the 1966 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode \"[[Balance of Terror]]\". As a basis, he considered what the ancient [[Roman Empire]] might have looked like had it developed to the point of [[spaceflight]]. Physically, the Romulans were presented as [[humanoid]], but the show's make-up department gave them pointed ears to distinguish them from humans. In the series, which is set in the 23rd century, the Romulans were speculated as to having split from another alien species, the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]], in the distant past. In contrast to the Vulcans, who were presented as peaceful and logic-oriented, the Romulans were depicted as militaristic, having founded an interstellar empire. The Romulans were used as antagonists for the series' protagonists, the [[starship]] USS ''Enterprise'', her crew, and their fictional government, the [[United Federation of Planets]].\n\nIn 1987, the writers of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''\u2014set in the 24th century\u2014again used the Romulans as antagonists of the Federation. The show's designers gave the Romulans new costumes and added a V-shaped ridge on the foreheads of most Romulan characters, though with indications that Romulans without the ridges also existed. The 2009 film, ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', depicted the Romulan homeworld, Romulus, being destroyed by a [[supernova]] in the year 2387. This film featured Romulans without the head ridges. The impact of Romulus' destruction forms a plot-theme in the ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'' series. Romulans in that series have included those with and without ridges, and a line about northern Romulans may have been intended to refer to these two groups.\n\n==History==\n\n===Original development===\n\nThe Romulans were devised for the episode \"[[Balance of Terror]]\".

Among their key appearances have been:\n\n* [[Diane Duane]]'s miniseries ''[[Star Trek: Rihannsu]]'', consisting to-date of five books written between 1984 and 2006, is regarded as one of deepest works focusing on the Romulans.\n* In Dalla Van Hise's ''[[Killing Time (Star Trek novel)|Killing Time]]'' (1985), the Romulans use time travel to alter history, which results in James T. Kirk becoming an ensign and Spock a starship captain.\n* A prototype Romulan warbird is the focus of [[Simon Hawke]]'s novel ''[[Simon Hawke#Star Trek The Next Generation|The Romulan Prize]]'' (1993).\n* Robert Greenberger's ''The Romulan Stratagem'' (1995) involves [[Jean-Luc Picard]] and his crew competing with the Romulan officer [[Sela (Star Trek)|Sela]] to convince a planet to join their respective states.\n* In [[Diane Carey]]'s ''Red Sector'' (1999), Spock and [[Leonard McCoy]] try to cure a virus that has infected the Romulan royal family.\n* [[Josepha Sherman]] and Susan M. Schwartz's ''Vulcan's Heart'' (1999) involved Spock traveling to Romulus to aid the Romulan Commander from \"[[The Enterprise Incident|The ''Enterprise'' Incident]]\".\n* ''[[Captain's Blood]]'' (2003), one of many collaborative works between ''Star Trek'' lead [[William Shatner]] and husband-and-wife team [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]], focused on the involvement of Kirk in preventing a Romulan [[civil war]] in the aftermath of ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''.\n* The Tomed Incident is the focus of David R. George III's novel ''Serpents Among the Ruins'' (2003), which features the crew of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-B)|Enterprise-B]]''.\n* ''Star Trek: Vulcan's Soul'' is a trilogy written by Sherman and Shwartz between 2004 and 2007; set in the aftermath of the [[Dominion War]], it focuses on members of Kirk's original crew becoming involved in a war between the Romulans and a fellow Vulcan offshoot, the Watraii.\n* In ''[[Star Trek: Titan]]'' premier ''Taking Wing'' (2005), the Romulan Star Empire collapses into civil war in the wake of ''Star Trek: Nemesis''.\n* The ''Star Trek: Titan'' novel ''The Red King'' (2005) opens with the disappearance of a Romulan fleet and features Donatra, the Romulan commander featured in ''Star Trek: Nemesis'', working alongside William Riker and his crew.\n* In the novel ''Kobayashi Maru'' (2008) by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels, Admiral Valdore attempts once again to cause conflict in the region approximately one year after the incident involving the Aenar, this time using a \"telecapture\" system, designed to take over and control enemy ships. Using three Klingon vessels, Valdore attacks Coalition of Planets allies hoping to weaken or destroy two enemies of the Romulan Star Empire by provoking a war. Captain Archer is eventually able to provide evidence of this Romulan deception. This is followed by yet another unsuccessful attempt to break apart the alliance which involves using telecaptured Vulcan cruisers against Proxima Centauri (a recent coalition member). In the book, the event that finally sparks the Coalition's declaration of war against the Romulans is the destruction of the Earth freighter ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]''.\n* The sequel to the novel ''Kobayashi Maru'' is titled ''The Romulan War: Beneath the Raptor's Wing'' by Michael A. Martin. It is set between July 22, 2155 and July 22, 2156, and details the war between the Coalition of Planets and the Romulan Star Empire. The story focuses on the Romulan attempts at taking over the Coalition whilst the Vulcans who are aware they are vulnerable to the telecapture weapon withdraw from the fight early. The other Coalition members withdraw one by one in the face of continued losses, leaving it up to Earth Starfleet to stop the Romulan menace.\n* In ''[[Star Trek Online]]'', set in the year 2409, a Romulan surivior \"D'Tan\" assisted in building a New Romulus after the destruction of the original homeworld twenty-two years prior. As part of rebuilding a new Romulan Republic, he became leader of the Romulan Unification Movement in an attempt to continue Ambassador Spock's work of bringing the Vulcan and Romulan people together.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction|Television}}\n* [[Weapons in Star Trek|Weapons in ''Star Trek'']]\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n\n* {{cite book |last1=Erdmann |first1=Terry J. |last2=Block |first2=Paula M. |year=2000 |title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York |isbn=9780671501068 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Nemecek |first=Larry |year=1995 |title=The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion |edition=revised |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York |isbn=9780671883409 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/startreknextgene00neme_0 }}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages''\n* ''[[Star Trek: The Magazine]]'' vol.3, #10 (February 2003) and #11 (March 2003)\n* ''Star Trek Enterprise: The Good That Men Do''\n* ''Star Trek Enterprise: Kobayashi Maru''\n* ''Star Trek Enterprise: The Romulan War - Beneath the Raptor's Wing''\n\n==External links==\n{{Memory Alpha|Romulan}}\n* [http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/library/aliens/article/70706.html StarTrek.com - Romulans]\n* [http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/features/documentaries/article/1479.html StarTrek.com - \"Strange Relations: Romulans and Vulcans\"]\n* [http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/features/specials/article/1629.html StarTrek.com - \"Great Romulan Episodes\"]\n\n{{Star Trek Romulan stories}}\n{{Star Trek}}\n\n[[Category:Romulans| ]]\n[[Category:Fictional elements introduced in 1966]]\n[[Category:Fictional humanoids]]\n[[Category:Galactic empires]]\n[[Category:Star Trek species]]\n\n[[de:V\u00f6lker und Gruppierungen im Star-Trek-Universum#Romulaner]]\n[[sv:Lista \u00f6ver utomjordiska raser i Star Trek#Romulaner]]\n", "name_user": "DT Strain", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulan"}

The PlayStation also had a redesigned version, the [[PS one|PSone]], which was launched on July 7, 2000.\n\nFor handhelds, this era was characterized by significant fragmentation, because the first handheld of the generation, the [[Genesis Nomad|Sega Nomad]], had a lifespan of just two years, and the [[Nintendo]] [[Virtual Boy]] had a lifespan of less than one. Both of them were discontinued before the other handhelds made their debut. The [[Neo Geo Pocket]] was released on October 28, 1998, but was dropped by [[SNK]] in favor of the fully backwards-compatible [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] just a year later. Nintendo's [[Game Boy Color]] (1998) was the winner in handhelds by a large margin. There were also two simply updated versions of the original [[Game Boy]]: [[Game Boy Light]] (Japan only) and [[Game Boy Pocket]].\n\nSome features that distinguished fifth generation consoles from previous [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth generation consoles]] include:\n\n*[[3D computer graphics|3D polygon graphics]] with [[texture mapping]]\n*3D graphics capabilities \u2013 [[Computer graphics lighting|lighting]], [[Gouraud shading]], [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] and [[texture filtering]]\n*[[Optical disc]] ([[CD-ROM]]) game storage, allowing much larger storage space (up to 650 [[Mebibyte|MB]]) than [[ROM cartridge]]s\n*[[Compact disc|CD]] [[Sound quality|quality]] audio recordings (music and speech) \u2013 [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio with [[Audio bit depth|16-bit depth]] and 44.1&nbsp;kHz [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] rate\n* Wide adoption of [[full motion video]], displaying [[pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] [[computer animation]] or [[live action]] footage\n*[[Analog Joystick|Analog controllers]]\n*[[Display resolution]]s from [[480i]] to [[576i]]\n*[[Color depth]] up to 16,777,216 colors ([[24-bit color|24-bit true color]])\n\nThis era is known for its pivotal role in the [[video game industry]]'s leap from [[2D computer graphics|2D]] to [[3D computer graphics]], as well as the shift from home console games being stored on [[ROM cartridge|ROM cartridges]] to [[Optical disc|optical discs]].  This was also the first generation to feature [[internet]] connectivity, some systems like the Sega Saturn's [[Sega Net Link]], had add-ons to add connectivity to existing devices, and the [[Apple Pippin]], a commercial flop, was the first system to feature on-board internet capabilities.  There was considerable time overlap between this generation and the next, [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|the sixth generation of consoles]], which began with the launch of the [[Dreamcast]] in Japan on November 27, 1998. The fifth generation officially ended with the discontinuation of the PlayStation (namely, its re-engineered form, the \"PSOne\") on March 23, 2006, a year after the launch of the seventh generation.\n\n==History==\n===Transition to 3D===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2007}}\nThe [[32-bit]]/[[64-bit computing|64-bit]] era is most noted for the rise of fully [[3D computer graphics|3D polygon]] games. While there were games prior that had used three-dimensional polygon environments, such as ''[[Virtua Racing]]'' and ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]'' in the [[Arcade game|arcades]] and [[Star Fox (1993 video game)|''Star Fox'']] on the Super NES, it was in this era that many game designers began to move traditionally 2D and [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] genres into 3D on video game consoles. Early efforts from then-industry leaders Sega and Nintendo saw the introduction of the [[32X]] and [[Super FX]], which provided rudimentary 3D capabilities to the [[16-bit]] [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Super NES]]. Starting in 1996, 3D video games began to take off with releases such as ''[[Virtua Fighter 2]]'' on the Saturn, ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' on the PlayStation and Saturn, ''[[Tekken 2]]'' and ''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' on the PlayStation, and ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' on the N64. Their 3D environments were widely marketed and they steered the industry's focus away from [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] and [[Rail shooter|rail-style]] titles, as well as opening doors to more complex games and genres. 3D became the main focus in this era as well as a slow decline of cartridges in favor of CDs, due to the ability to produce games less expensively and the media's high storage capabilities.\n\n===CD vs. cartridge===\n{{see also|ROM cartridge}}\nAfter allowing Sony to develop a [[Compact disc|CD]]-based [[PlayStation (console)#Development|prototype console]] for them and a similar failed partnership with [[Philips]],<ref name=dring>Christopher Dring, 2013-07-11, [http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/tale-of-two-e3s-Xbox-vs-Sony-vs-Sega/0118482 A Tale of Two E3s \u2013 Xbox vs Sony vs Sega], MCV</ref> Nintendo decided to make the Nintendo 64 a cartridge-based system like its predecessors. Publicly, Nintendo defended this decision on the grounds that it would give games shorter load times than a compact disc (and would decrease piracy).{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, it also had the dubious benefit of allowing Nintendo to charge higher licensing fees, as cartridge production was considerably more expensive than CD production. Many third-party developers like EA Sports viewed this as an underhanded attempt to raise more money for Nintendo and many of them became more reluctant to release games on the N64.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nNintendo's decision to use a cartridge based system sparked a small scale war among gamers as to which was better. The chief advantages of the [[CD-ROM]] format were (1)larger storage capacity, allowing for a much greater amount of game content,<ref name=GPro59>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Format of the Future: CD-ROM or Cartridge?|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=69|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1994|page=8}}</ref><ref name=NGen14>{{cite magazine |title=Ultra 64: Nintendo's Shot at the Title|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=14 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1996|pages=36\u201344}}</ref> (2)considerably lower manufacturing costs, making them much less risky for game publishers,<ref name=NGen14/><ref name=NGen20>{{cite magazine |title=10 Reasons Why Nintendo 64 Will Kick Sony's and Sega's Ass (& 20 Reasons Why it Won't) |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=20|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=August 1996 |pages=39\u201341}}</ref> (3)lower retail prices due to the reduced need to compensate for manufacturing costs,<ref name=GPro59/><ref name=NGen14/><ref>Ryan, Michael E. \"'I Gotta Have This Game Machine!'

Consequent to the storage and cost advantages of the CD-ROM format, many game developers shifted their support away from the Nintendo 64 to the PlayStation. One of the most influential game franchises to change consoles during this era was the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, beginning with ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', which was originally being developed for the N64 but due to storage capacity issues was shifted to and released on the PlayStation;<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Squaresoft Head for Sony|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=4 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=March 1996|page=105}}</ref> prior Final Fantasy games had all been published on Nintendo consoles&nbsp;\u2013 either the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] or [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], with the only other entries being on the [[Wonderswan]], or computers like the [[MSX]].\n\n===Overview of the fifth generation consoles===\nThere was no prevailing consensus on which fifth generation console was superior. More competing consoles comprised this generation than any other since the [[North American video game crash of 1983]], leading video game magazines of the time to frequently predict a second crash.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carpenter |first=Danyon |title=The Flood Waters Are Rising...|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=60|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=July 1994|page=6}}</ref> The increased complexity of the systems also made it ambiguous how their technical capabilities would improve the games.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe [[FM Towns Marty]] is considered the world's first 32-bit console (predating the [[Amiga CD32]] and 3DO), being released in February 20, 1993 by Japanese electronic company [[Fujitsu]]. Never released outside Japan, it was largely marketed as a console version of the [[FM Towns]] home computer, [[backward compatibility|being compatible]] with [[List of FM Towns games|games developed for the FM Towns]].

Despite its impressive specs, it was marketed as the ultimate 2D side-scrolling games console and could not match the sales of the 3D systems released a short time later.\n\nDespite massive third party support and an unprecedented amount of hype for a first-time entrant into the industry, the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]]'s [[United States dollar|$]]700 price tag hindered its success.\n\nThe [[Amiga CD32]] was sold in Europe, Australia, Canada and Brazil, but never in the United States due to Commodore's bankruptcy.<ref>Perelman, M: \"Steal This Idea\", page 60. Palgrave Macmillan, 2004</ref>\n\nThe 32X, an add-on console for the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], was launched a short time before the Sega Saturn. The [[Sega Neptune]], a standalone version of the 32X, was announced but ultimately canceled.

However, sales at launch were well below the incumbent fourth generation consoles, and a small games library rooted in a shortage of third party support made it impossible for the Jaguar to catch up, selling below 250,000 units. The system's 64-bit nature was [[Atari Jaguar#Bit count controversy|also questioned by many]]. The 32-bit [[Atari Panther]], set to be released in 1991, was canceled due to unexpectedly rapid progress in developing the Jaguar.<ref>[http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/history.html Atari Jaguar History], AtariAge.</ref>\n\nThe [[Atari Jaguar CD]], an add-on console for the Jaguar, was released in 1995. It was produced in limited quantities due to the low install base of the system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe PlayStation was the most successful console of this generation.

The system's delays and use of the expensive cartridge format made it an unpopular platform among third party developers.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Several popular 1st party titles allowed the Nintendo 64 to maintain strong sales in the United States, but it remained a distant second to the PlayStation.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Aftermath of the fifth generation===\nBy the end of the 1995 [[Christmas shopping season]], the fifth generation had come down to a struggle between the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, and the upcoming Nintendo 64. The FM Towns Marty and Amiga CD32 had already been discontinued; the Jaguar and Genesis 32X were still on the market but were considered a lost cause by industry analysts; the [[Neo Geo CD]] had proven to appeal only to a niche market; and industry analysts had already determined that the yet-to-launch [[Apple Bandai Pippin]] was too expensive to make any impact in the market.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=1996 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=January 1996|pages=18\u201320}}</ref> Moreover, even the leading fifth generation consoles were still facing sluggish sales. Combined sales for the PlayStation, Saturn, and 3DO barely topped 1 million units for the Christmas shopping season, as compared to combined sales of 4 million for the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Super NES]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=16-Bit Surge|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=91|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1996|page=16}}</ref> [[Focus group]]s showed that most children under 12 years old are equally happy playing on fourth generation consoles as they are playing on fifth generation consoles, making the fourth generation consoles more appealing to adults buying gifts for children, since they are cheaper.<ref name=\"NGen20\"/> Industry analysts began putting forth the possibility that the fifth generation of consoles would never overtake the fourth generation in sales, and become superseded by a new generation of [[DVD player]] consoles before they could achieve mass acceptance.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=1996: The Year of the Videogame|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=65}}</ref>\n\n1996 saw the fifth generation consoles' fortunes finally turn around. With the Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64 all showing dramatic increases in sales over the previous year, they claimed a combined 40% of the retail market for hardware and software, putting them in position to finally overtake the fourth generation consoles in 1997.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Don't Call it a Comeback |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1997 |page=20}}</ref>\n\nAfter the dust settled in the fifth generation console wars, several companies saw their outlooks change drastically. [[Atari Corporation]], which was not able to recover its losses, ended up [[Reverse takeover|reverse merging]] with [[JT Storage|JTS, Inc.]] and caused [[Atari|the Atari brand]] to fade out of the consumer gaming market until 1998, when it was revived by [[Hasbro Interactive]]. Sega's loss of consumer confidence (coupled with its previous console failures) along with their financial difficulties, set the company up for a similar fate in the next round of console wars.\n\nThe Sega Saturn suffered from poor marketing and comparatively limited third-party support outside Japan.<ref name=dring/> Sega's decision to use dual processors was roundly criticized, as this made it difficult to efficiently develop for the console.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Sega was also hurt by a surprise four-month-early U.S. launch of their console. Third party developers, who had been planning for the originally scheduled launch, could not provide launch titles and were angered by the move. Retailers were caught unprepared, resulting in distribution problems. Some retailers, such as the now defunct [[KB Toys]], were so furious that they refused to stock the Saturn thereafter.<ref>Helgeson, Matt. \"Top 10 Embarrassing E3 Moments\", ''Game Informer''(208): 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nDue to numerous delays, the Nintendo 64 was released one year later than its competitors. By the time it was finally launched in 1996, Sony had already established its dominance, the Saturn was starting to struggle, and the Jaguar and 3DO had been discontinued.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Its use of cartridge media rather than compact discs alienated some developers and publishers due to the space limits, the relatively high cost involved, and a considerably longer production time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In addition, the initially high suggested retail price of the console may have driven potential customers away, and some early adopters of the system who had paid the initial price may have been angered by Nintendo's decision to cut the price of the system by $50 six months after its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-64-price-shock/1100-2466820|title=Nintendo 64 Price Shock|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 26, 2000}}</ref> However, the Nintendo 64 turned out to be a commercial success, particularly in the United States, where it sold 20.63 million units, nearly two third of its worldwide sales of 32.93 million units. It was also home to highly successful games such as ''[[Star Fox 64]]'', ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'', ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'', ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', and ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' While Nintendo 64 sold far more units than the Sega Saturn, Atari Jaguar, and 3DO combined, it posed no challenge to the [[#Worldwide sales|PlayStation's lead in the market]].\n\nBy 1997, 40% to 60% of American homes played on video game consoles. 30% to 40% of these homes owned a console, while an additional 10% to 20% rented or shared a console.<ref>{{cite web

The PlayStation also had a redesigned version, the [[PS one|PSone]], which was launched on July 7, 2000.\n\nFor handhelds, this era was characterized by significant fragmentation, because the first handheld of the generation, the [[Genesis Nomad|Sega Nomad]], had a lifespan of just two years, and the [[Nintendo]] [[Virtual Boy]] had a lifespan of less than one. Both of them were discontinued before the other handhelds made their debut. The [[Neo Geo Pocket]] was released on October 28, 1998, but was dropped by [[SNK]] in favor of the fully backwards-compatible [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] just a year later. Nintendo's [[Game Boy Color]] (1998) was the winner in handhelds by a large margin. There were also two simply updated versions of the original [[Game Boy]]: [[Game Boy Light]] (Japan only) and [[Game Boy Pocket]].\n\nSome features that distinguished fifth generation consoles from previous [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth generation consoles]] include:\n\n*[[3D computer graphics|3D polygon graphics]] with [[texture mapping]]\n*3D graphics capabilities \u2013 [[Computer graphics lighting|lighting]], [[Gouraud shading]], [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] and [[texture filtering]]\n*[[Optical disc]] ([[CD-ROM]]) game storage, allowing much larger storage space (up to 650 [[Mebibyte|MB]]) than [[ROM cartridge]]s\n*[[Compact disc|CD]] [[Sound quality|quality]] audio recordings (music and speech) \u2013 [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio with [[Audio bit depth|16-bit depth]] and 44.1&nbsp;kHz [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] rate\n* Wide adoption of [[full motion video]], displaying [[pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] [[computer animation]] or [[live action]] footage\n*[[Analog Joystick|Analog controllers]]\n*[[Display resolution]]s from [[480i]] to [[576i]]\n*[[Color depth]] up to 16,777,216 colors ([[24-bit color|24-bit true color]])\n\nThis era is known for its pivotal role in the [[video game industry]]'s leap from [[2D computer graphics|2D]] to [[3D computer graphics]], as well as the shift from home console games being stored on [[ROM cartridge|ROM cartridges]] to [[Optical disc|optical discs]].  This was also the first generation to feature [[internet]] connectivity, some systems like the Sega Saturn's [[Sega Net Link]], had add-ons to add connectivity to existing devices, and the [[Apple Pippin]], a commercial flop, was the first system to feature on-board internet capabilities.  There was considerable time overlap between this generation and the next, [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|the sixth generation of consoles]], which began with the launch of the [[Dreamcast]] in Japan on November 27, 1998. The fifth generation officially ended with the discontinuation of the PlayStation (namely, its re-engineered form, the \"PSOne\") on March 23, 2006, a year after the launch of the seventh generation.\n\n==History==\n===Transition to 3D===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2007}}\nThe [[32-bit]]/[[64-bit computing|64-bit]] era is most noted for the rise of fully [[3D computer graphics|3D polygon]] games. While there were games prior that had used three-dimensional polygon environments, such as ''[[Virtua Racing]]'' and ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]'' in the [[Arcade game|arcades]] and [[Star Fox (1993 video game)|''Star Fox'']] on the Super NES, it was in this era that many game designers began to move traditionally 2D and [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] genres into 3D on video game consoles. Early efforts from then-industry leaders Sega and Nintendo saw the introduction of the [[32X]] and [[Super FX]], which provided rudimentary 3D capabilities to the [[16-bit]] [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Super NES]]. Starting in 1996, 3D video games began to take off with releases such as ''[[Virtua Fighter 2]]'' on the Saturn, ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' on the PlayStation and Saturn, ''[[Tekken 2]]'' and ''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' on the PlayStation, and ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' on the N64. Their 3D environments were widely marketed and they steered the industry's focus away from [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] and [[Rail shooter|rail-style]] titles, as well as opening doors to more complex games and genres. 3D became the main focus in this era as well as a slow decline of cartridges in favor of CDs, due to the ability to produce games less expensively and the media's high storage capabilities.\n\n===CD vs. cartridge===\n{{see also|ROM cartridge}}\nAfter allowing Sony to develop a [[Compact disc|CD]]-based [[PlayStation (console)#Development|prototype console]] for them and a similar failed partnership with [[Philips]],<ref name=dring>Christopher Dring, 2013-07-11, [http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/tale-of-two-e3s-Xbox-vs-Sony-vs-Sega/0118482 A Tale of Two E3s \u2013 Xbox vs Sony vs Sega], MCV</ref> Nintendo decided to make the Nintendo 64 a cartridge-based system like its predecessors. Publicly, Nintendo defended this decision on the grounds that it would give games shorter load times than a compact disc (and would decrease piracy).{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, it also had the dubious benefit of allowing Nintendo to charge higher licensing fees, as cartridge production was considerably more expensive than CD production. Many third-party developers like EA Sports viewed this as an underhanded attempt to raise more money for Nintendo and many of them became more reluctant to release games on the N64.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nNintendo's decision to use a cartridge based system sparked a small scale war among gamers as to which was better. The chief advantages of the [[CD-ROM]] format were (1)larger storage capacity, allowing for a much greater amount of game content,<ref name=GPro59>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Format of the Future: CD-ROM or Cartridge?|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=69|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1994|page=8}}</ref><ref name=NGen14>{{cite magazine |title=Ultra 64: Nintendo's Shot at the Title|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=14 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1996|pages=36\u201344}}</ref> (2)considerably lower manufacturing costs, making them much less risky for game publishers,<ref name=NGen14/><ref name=NGen20>{{cite magazine |title=10 Reasons Why Nintendo 64 Will Kick Sony's and Sega's Ass (& 20 Reasons Why it Won't) |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=20|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=August 1996 |pages=39\u201341}}</ref> (3)lower retail prices due to the reduced need to compensate for manufacturing costs,<ref name=GPro59/><ref name=NGen14/><ref>Ryan, Michael E. \"'I Gotta Have This Game Machine!'

Consequent to the storage and cost advantages of the CD-ROM format, many game developers shifted their support away from the Nintendo 64 to the PlayStation. One of the most influential game franchises to change consoles during this era was the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, beginning with ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', which was originally being developed for the N64 but due to storage capacity issues was shifted to and released on the PlayStation;<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Squaresoft Head for Sony|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=4 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=March 1996|page=105}}</ref> prior Final Fantasy games had all been published on Nintendo consoles&nbsp;\u2013 either the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] or [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], with the only other entries being on the [[Wonderswan]], or computers like the [[MSX]].\n\n===Overview of the fifth generation consoles===\nThere was no prevailing consensus on which fifth generation console was superior.

The FM Towns Marty and Amiga CD32 had already been discontinued; the Jaguar and Genesis 32X were still on the market but were considered a lost cause by industry analysts; the [[Neo Geo CD]] had proven to appeal only to a niche market; and industry analysts had already determined that the yet-to-launch [[Apple Bandai Pippin]] was too expensive to make any impact in the market.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=1996 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=January 1996|pages=18\u201320}}</ref> Moreover, even the leading fifth generation consoles were still facing sluggish sales. Combined sales for the PlayStation, Saturn, and 3DO barely topped 1 million units for the Christmas shopping season, as compared to combined sales of 4 million for the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Super NES]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=16-Bit Surge|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=91|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1996|page=16}}</ref> [[Focus group]]s showed that most children under 12 years old are equally happy playing on fourth generation consoles as they are playing on fifth generation consoles, making the fourth generation consoles more appealing to adults buying gifts for children, since they are cheaper.<ref name=\"NGen20\"/> Industry analysts began putting forth the possibility that the fifth generation of consoles would never overtake the fourth generation in sales, and become superseded by a new generation of [[DVD player]] consoles before they could achieve mass acceptance.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=1996: The Year of the Videogame|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=65}}</ref>\n\n1996 saw the fifth generation consoles' fortunes finally turn around. With the Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64 all showing dramatic increases in sales over the previous year, they claimed a combined 40% of the retail market for hardware and software, putting them in position to finally overtake the fourth generation consoles in 1997.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Don't Call it a Comeback |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1997 |page=20}}</ref>\n\nAfter the dust settled in the fifth generation console wars, several companies saw their outlooks change drastically. [[Atari Corporation]], which was not able to recover its losses, ended up [[Reverse takeover|reverse merging]] with [[JT Storage|JTS, Inc.]] and caused [[Atari|the Atari brand]] to fade out of the consumer gaming market until 1998, when it was revived by [[Hasbro Interactive]]. Sega's loss of consumer confidence (coupled with its previous console failures) along with their financial difficulties, set the company up for a similar fate in the next round of console wars.\n\nThe Sega Saturn suffered from poor marketing and comparatively limited third-party support outside Japan.<ref name=dring/> Sega's decision to use dual processors was roundly criticized, as this made it difficult to efficiently develop for the console.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Sega was also hurt by a surprise four-month-early U.S. launch of their console. Third party developers, who had been planning for the originally scheduled launch, could not provide launch titles and were angered by the move. Retailers were caught unprepared, resulting in distribution problems. Some retailers, such as the now defunct [[KB Toys]], were so furious that they refused to stock the Saturn thereafter.<ref>Helgeson, Matt. \"Top 10 Embarrassing E3 Moments\", ''Game Informer''(208): 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nDue to numerous delays, the Nintendo 64 was released one year later than its competitors. By the time it was finally launched in 1996, Sony had already established its dominance, the Saturn was starting to struggle, and the Jaguar and 3DO had been discontinued.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Its use of cartridge media rather than compact discs alienated some developers and publishers due to the space limits, the relatively high cost involved, and a considerably longer production time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In addition, the initially high suggested retail price of the console may have driven potential customers away, and some early adopters of the system who had paid the initial price may have been angered by Nintendo's decision to cut the price of the system by $50 six months after its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-64-price-shock/1100-2466820|title=Nintendo 64 Price Shock|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 26, 2000}}</ref> However, the Nintendo 64 turned out to be a commercial success, particularly in the United States, where it sold 20.63 million units, nearly two third of its worldwide sales of 32.93 million units. It was also home to highly successful games such as ''[[Star Fox 64]]'', ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'', ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'', ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', and ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' While Nintendo 64 sold far more units than the Sega Saturn, Atari Jaguar, and 3DO combined, it posed no challenge to the [[#Worldwide sales|PlayStation's lead in the market]].\n\nBy 1997, 40% to 60% of American homes played on video game consoles. 30% to 40% of these homes owned a console, while an additional 10% to 20% rented or shared a console.<ref>{{cite web

The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Harold. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png}}\nOn April&nbsp;1, the

The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Harold. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png}}\nOn April&nbsp;1, the

In previous seasons, the bottom two queens had to \"Lip-sync for their Life\" to avoid elimination. This season had the top two performing queens of the challenge \"Lip-sync for their Legacy,\" with the winner of the lip-sync earning $10,000 and choosing which one of the bottom queens gets eliminated. The prizes for the winner were a one-year supply of [[Anastasia Beverly Hills]] cosmetics and a cash prize of $100,000.\n\nThe winner of the second season of ''RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars'' was [[Alaska Thunderfuck|Alaska]], with [[Katya Zamolodchikova|Katya]] and [[Detox Icunt|Detox]] being the runners-up.\n\n==Contestants==\n{{See also|List of RuPaul's Drag Race contestants}}\n''(Ages and
