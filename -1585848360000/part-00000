In reflection to the evolutionary origin of its codon, the other AUN codons encode isoleucine, which is also a hydrophobic amino acid. In the mitochondrial genome of several organisms, including [[Vertebrate mitochondrial code|metazoa]] and [[The yeast mitochondrial code|yeast]], the codon AUA also encodes for methionine.

A \"Start\" codon is message for a [[ribosome]] that signals the initiation of protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]] from mRNA when the AUG codon is in a [[Kozak consensus sequence]]. As a consequence, methionine is often incorporated into the N-terminal position of [[protein]]s in [[eukaryote]]s and [[archaea]] during translation, although it can be removed by [[post-translational modification]]. In [[bacteria]], the derivative [[N-Formylmethionine|''N''-formylmethionine]] is used as the initial amino acid.\n\n==Derivatives==\n\n===''S''-adenosyl-methionine===\n[[File:S-Adenosyl-L-methionin.svg|thumbnail|left|''S''-Adenosyl-methionine is a cofactor derived from methionine.]]\n{{main|S-adenosyl methionine}}\nThe methionine-derivative [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) is a cofactor that serves mainly as a [[methyl]] donor. SAM is composed of an adenosyl molecule (via 5' carbon) attached to the sulfur of methionine, therefore making it a [[sulfonium]] cation (i.e., three substituents and positive charge). The sulfur acts as a [[HSAB theory|soft Lewis acid]] (i.e., donor/electrophile) which allows the ''S''-methyl group to be transferred to an oxygen, nitrogen, or aromatic system, often with the aid of other cofactors such as [[cobalamin]] (vitamin B12 in humans). Some enzymes use SAM to initiate a radical reaction; these are called [[radical SAM]] enzymes.\nAs a result of the transfer of the methyl group, S-adenosyl-homocysteine is obtained. In bacteria, this is either regenerated by methylation or is salvaged by removing the adenine and the homocysteine, leaving the compound dihydroxypentandione to spontaneously convert into [[autoinducer-2]], which is excreted as a waste product / quorum signal.\n\n== Biosynthesis ==\n[[File:Met biosynthesis.svg|thumb|550px|Methionine biosynthesis]]\nAs an essential amino acid, methionine is not synthesized [[De novo synthesis|''de novo'']] in humans and other animals, which must ingest methionine or methionine-containing proteins.  In plants and microorganisms, methionine biosynthesis belongs to the [[aspartate]] family, along with threonine and [[lysine]] (via [[diaminopimelate]], but not via [[Alpha-Aminoadipic acid|\u03b1-aminoadipate]]). The main backbone is derived from [[aspartic acid]], while the sulfur may come from [[cysteine]], [[methanethiol]], or [[hydrogen sulfide]].<ref name=review/>\n* First, aspartic acid is converted via \u03b2-aspartyl-semialdehyde into [[homoserine]] by two reduction steps of the terminal carboxyl group (homoserine has therefore a \u03b3-hydroxyl, hence the [[homologous series|homo-]] series). The intermediate aspartate-semialdehyde is the branching point with the lysine biosynthetic pathway, where it is instead [[Aldol condensation|condensed]] with pyruvate. Homoserine is the branching point with the threonine pathway, where instead it is isomerised after activating the terminal hydroxyl with phosphate (also used for methionine biosynthesis in plants).<ref name=review/>\n* Homoserine is then activated with a phosphate, succinyl or an acetyl group on the hydroxyl.\n** In plants and possibly in some bacteria,<ref name=review/> phosphate is used. This step is shared with threonine biosynthesis.<ref name=review/>\n** In most organisms, an acetyl group is used to activate the homoserine. This can be catalysed in bacteria by an enzyme encoded by ''metX'' or ''metA'' (not homologues).<ref name=review/> \n** In [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]] and a limited number of other organisms, succinate is used. The enzyme that catalyses the reaction is MetA and the specificity for acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is dictated by a single reside.<ref name=review/> The physiological basis for the preference of acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA is unknown, but such alternative routes are present in some other pathways (''e.g.'' lysine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis).\n* The hydroxyl activating group is then replaced with cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. A replacement reaction is technically a \u03b3-[[Elimination reaction|elimination]] followed by a variant of a [[Michael addition]]. All the enzymes involved are homologues and members of the [[Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme family]], which is a subset of the PLP-dependent fold type I clade. They utilise the cofactor PLP ([[pyridoxal phosphate]]), which functions by stabilising carbanion intermediates.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with cysteine, it produces [[cystathionine]], which is cleaved to yield [[homocysteine]]. The enzymes involved are [[cystathionine-\u03b3-synthase]] (encoded by ''metB'' in bacteria) and [[cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]] (''metC''). Cystathionine is bound differently in the two enzymes allowing \u03b2 or \u03b3 reactions to occur.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with free hydrogen sulfide, it produces homocysteine. This is catalysed by [[O-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase|''O''-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase]] (formerly known as ''O''-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase. It is encoded by either ''metY'' or ''metZ'' in bacteria.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with  methanethiol, it produces methionine directly. Methanethiol is a byproduct of catabolic pathway of certain compounds, therefore this route is more uncommon.<ref name=review/> \n* If homocysteine is produced, the thiol group is methylated, yielding methionine. Two [[methionine synthase]]s are known; one is [[cobalamin]] (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) dependent and one is independent.<ref name=review/>\n\nThe pathway using cysteine is called the \"[[transsulfuration pathway]]\", while the pathway using hydrogen sulfide (or methanethiol) is called \"direct-sulfurylation pathway\".\n\nCysteine is similarly produced, namely it can be made from an activated serine and either from homocysteine (\"reverse trans-sulfurylation route\") or from hydrogen sulfide (\"direct sulfurylation route\"); the activated serine is generally ''O''-acetyl-serine (via CysK or CysM in ''E. coli''), but in ''[[Aeropyrum pernix]]'' and some other archaea ''O''-phosphoserine is used.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mino K, Ishikawa K | title = A novel O-phospho-L-serine sulfhydrylation reaction catalyzed by O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from Aeropyrum pernix K1 | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 551 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = 133\u20138 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12965218 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(03)00913-X }}</ref> CysK and CysM are homologues, but belong to the PLP fold type III clade.\n\n===Trans-sulfurylation pathway===\n{{main|Transsulfuration pathway}}\nEnzymes involved in the ''E. coli'' trans-sulfurylation route of methionine biosynthesis:\n# [[Aspartokinase]]\n# [[Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase]]\n# [[Homoserine dehydrogenase]]\n# [[Homoserine O-transsuccinylase]]\n# [[Cystathionine-\u03b3-synthase]]\n# [[Cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]]\n# [[Methionine synthase]] (in mammals, this step is performed by [[homocysteine methyltransferase]] or [[betaine\u2014homocysteine S-methyltransferase]].)\n\n== Other biochemical pathways ==\n[[File:Met pathway.svg|thumb|Fates of methionine|400px|Fates of methionine]]\nAlthough mammals cannot synthesize methionine, they can still use it in a variety of biochemical pathways:\n\n===Catabolism===\nMethionine is converted to [[S-adenosylmethionine]] (SAM) by (1) [[methionine adenosyltransferase]].\n\nSAM serves as a methyl-donor in many (2) [[methyltransferase]] reactions, and is converted to [[S-adenosylhomocysteine|''S''-adenosylhomocysteine]] (SAH).\n\n(3) [[Adenosylhomocysteinase]] converts SAH to [[homocysteine]].\n\nHomocysteine can be used to regenerate methionine or to form cysteine.\n\n===Regeneration===\nMethionine can be regenerated from homocysteine via (4) [[methionine synthase]] in a reaction that requires [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].\n\nHomocysteine can also be remethylated using [[glycine betaine]] (NNN-trimethyl glycine, TMG) to methionine via the enzyme [[betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase]] (E.C.2.1.1.5, BHMT).  BHMT makes up to 1.5% of all the soluble protein of the liver, and recent evidence suggests that it may have a greater influence on methionine and homocysteine homeostasis than methionine synthase.\n\n===Reverse-transulfurylation pathway: conversion to cysteine===\nHomocysteine can be converted to cysteine.\n\n* (5) [[Cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase]] (an enzyme which requires the active form of [[vitamin B6]], [[pyridoxal phosphate]]) combines homocysteine and serine to produce [[cystathionine]].  Instead of degrading [[cystathionine]] via [[cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]], as in the biosynthetic pathway, cystathionine is broken down to [[cysteine]] and [[\u03b1-ketobutyrate]] via (6) [[cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase]].\n* (7) The enzyme [[\u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase]] converts \u03b1-ketobutyrate to [[propionyl-CoA]], which is metabolized to [[succinyl-CoA]] in a three-step process (see [[propionyl-CoA]] for pathway).\n\n===Ethylene synthesis===\nThis [[amino acid]] is also used by [[plant]]s for synthesis of [[ethylene]].

A \"Start\" codon is message for a [[ribosome]] that signals the initiation of protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]] from mRNA when the AUG codon is in a [[Kozak consensus sequence]]. As a consequence, methionine is often incorporated into the N-terminal position of [[protein]]s in [[eukaryote]]s and [[archaea]] during translation, although it can be removed by [[post-translational modification]]. In [[bacteria]], the derivative [[N-Formylmethionine|''N''-formylmethionine]] is used as the initial amino acid.\n\n==Derivatives==\n\n===''S''-adenosyl-methionine===\n[[File:S-Adenosyl-L-methionin.svg|thumbnail|left|''S''-Adenosyl-methionine is a cofactor derived from methionine.]]\n{{main|S-adenosyl methionine}}\nThe methionine-derivative [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) is a cofactor that serves mainly as a [[methyl]] donor. SAM is composed of an adenosyl molecule (via 5' carbon) attached to the sulfur of methionine, therefore making it a [[sulfonium]] cation (i.e., three substituents and positive charge). The sulfur acts as a [[HSAB theory|soft Lewis acid]] (i.e., donor/electrophile) which allows the ''S''-methyl group to be transferred to an oxygen, nitrogen, or aromatic system, often with the aid of other cofactors such as [[cobalamin]] (vitamin B12 in humans). Some enzymes use SAM to initiate a radical reaction; these are called [[radical SAM]] enzymes.\nAs a result of the transfer of the methyl group, S-adenosyl-homocysteine is obtained. In bacteria, this is either regenerated by methylation or is salvaged by removing the adenine and the homocysteine, leaving the compound dihydroxypentandione to spontaneously convert into [[autoinducer-2]], which is excreted as a waste product / quorum signal.\n\n== Biosynthesis ==\n[[File:Met biosynthesis.svg|thumb|550px|Methionine biosynthesis]]\nAs an essential amino acid, methionine is not synthesized [[De novo synthesis|''de novo'']] in humans and other animals, which must ingest methionine or methionine-containing proteins.  In plants and microorganisms, methionine biosynthesis belongs to the [[aspartate]] family, along with threonine and [[lysine]] (via [[diaminopimelate]], but not via [[Alpha-Aminoadipic acid|\u03b1-aminoadipate]]). The main backbone is derived from [[aspartic acid]], while the sulfur may come from [[cysteine]], [[methanethiol]], or [[hydrogen sulfide]].<ref name=review/>\n* First, aspartic acid is converted via \u03b2-aspartyl-semialdehyde into [[homoserine]] by two reduction steps of the terminal carboxyl group (homoserine has therefore a \u03b3-hydroxyl, hence the [[homologous series|homo-]] series). The intermediate aspartate-semialdehyde is the branching point with the lysine biosynthetic pathway, where it is instead [[Aldol condensation|condensed]] with pyruvate. Homoserine is the branching point with the threonine pathway, where instead it is isomerised after activating the terminal hydroxyl with phosphate (also used for methionine biosynthesis in plants).<ref name=review/>\n* Homoserine is then activated with a phosphate, succinyl or an acetyl group on the hydroxyl.\n** In plants and possibly in some bacteria,<ref name=review/> phosphate is used. This step is shared with threonine biosynthesis.<ref name=review/>\n** In most organisms, an acetyl group is used to activate the homoserine. This can be catalysed in bacteria by an enzyme encoded by ''metX'' or ''metA'' (not homologues).<ref name=review/> \n** In [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]] and a limited number of other organisms, succinate is used. The enzyme that catalyses the reaction is MetA and the specificity for acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is dictated by a single reside.<ref name=review/> The physiological basis for the preference of acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA is unknown, but such alternative routes are present in some other pathways (''e.g.'' lysine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis).\n* The hydroxyl activating group is then replaced with cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. A replacement reaction is technically a \u03b3-[[Elimination reaction|elimination]] followed by a variant of a [[Michael addition]]. All the enzymes involved are homologues and members of the [[Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme family]], which is a subset of the PLP-dependent fold type I clade. They utilise the cofactor PLP ([[pyridoxal phosphate]]), which functions by stabilising carbanion intermediates.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with cysteine, it produces [[cystathionine]], which is cleaved to yield [[homocysteine]]. The enzymes involved are [[cystathionine-\u03b3-synthase]] (encoded by ''metB'' in bacteria) and [[cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]] (''metC''). Cystathionine is bound differently in the two enzymes allowing \u03b2 or \u03b3 reactions to occur.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with free hydrogen sulfide, it produces homocysteine. This is catalysed by [[O-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase|''O''-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase]] (formerly known as ''O''-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase. It is encoded by either ''metY'' or ''metZ'' in bacteria.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with  methanethiol, it produces methionine directly. Methanethiol is a byproduct of catabolic pathway of certain compounds, therefore this route is more uncommon.<ref name=review/> \n* If homocysteine is produced, the thiol group is methylated, yielding methionine. Two [[methionine synthase]]s are known; one is [[cobalamin]] (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) dependent and one is independent.<ref name=review/>\n\nThe pathway using cysteine is called the \"[[transsulfuration pathway]]\", while the pathway using hydrogen sulfide (or methanethiol) is called \"direct-sulfurylation pathway\".\n\nCysteine is similarly produced, namely it can be made from an activated serine and either from homocysteine (\"reverse trans-sulfurylation route\") or from hydrogen sulfide (\"direct sulfurylation route\"); the activated serine is generally ''O''-acetyl-serine (via CysK or CysM in ''E. coli''), but in ''[[Aeropyrum pernix]]'' and some other archaea ''O''-phosphoserine is used.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mino K, Ishikawa K | title = A novel O-phospho-L-serine sulfhydrylation reaction catalyzed by O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from Aeropyrum pernix K1 | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 551 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = 133\u20138 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12965218 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(03)00913-X }}</ref> CysK and CysM are homologues, but belong to the PLP fold type III clade.\n\n===Trans-sulfurylation pathway===\n{{main|Transsulfuration pathway}}\nEnzymes involved in the ''E. coli'' trans-sulfurylation route of methionine biosynthesis:\n# [[Aspartokinase]]\n# [[Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase]]\n# [[Homoserine dehydrogenase]]\n# [[Homoserine O-transsuccinylase]]\n# [[Cystathionine-\u03b3-synthase]]\n# [[Cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]]\n# [[Methionine synthase]] (in mammals, this step is performed by [[homocysteine methyltransferase]] or [[betaine\u2014homocysteine S-methyltransferase]].)\n\n== Other biochemical pathways ==\n[[File:Met pathway.svg|thumb|Fates of methionine|400px|Fates of methionine]]\nAlthough mammals cannot synthesize methionine, they can still use it in a variety of biochemical pathways:\n\n===Catabolism===\nMethionine is converted to [[S-adenosylmethionine]] (SAM) by (1) [[methionine adenosyltransferase]].\n\nSAM serves as a methyl-donor in many (2) [[methyltransferase]] reactions, and is converted to [[S-adenosylhomocysteine|''S''-adenosylhomocysteine]] (SAH).\n\n(3) [[Adenosylhomocysteinase]] converts SAH to [[homocysteine]].\n\nHomocysteine can be used to regenerate methionine or to form cysteine.\n\n===Regeneration===\nMethionine can be regenerated from homocysteine via (4) [[methionine synthase]] in a reaction that requires [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].\n\nHomocysteine can also be remethylated using [[glycine betaine]] (NNN-trimethyl glycine, TMG) to methionine via the enzyme [[betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase]] (E.C.2.1.1.5, BHMT).  BHMT makes up to 1.5% of all the soluble protein of the liver, and recent evidence suggests that it may have a greater influence on methionine and homocysteine homeostasis than methionine synthase.\n\n===Reverse-transulfurylation pathway: conversion to cysteine===\nHomocysteine can be converted to cysteine.\n\n* (5) [[Cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase]] (an enzyme which requires the active form of [[vitamin B6]], [[pyridoxal phosphate]]) combines homocysteine and serine to produce [[cystathionine]].  Instead of degrading [[cystathionine]] via [[cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]], as in the biosynthetic pathway, cystathionine is broken down to [[cysteine]] and [[\u03b1-ketobutyrate]] via (6) [[cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase]].\n* (7) The enzyme [[\u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase]] converts \u03b1-ketobutyrate to [[propionyl-CoA]], which is metabolized to [[succinyl-CoA]] in a three-step process (see [[propionyl-CoA]] for pathway).\n\n===Ethylene synthesis===\nThis [[amino acid]] is also used by [[plant]]s for synthesis of [[ethylene]].

Before he can confront AK-74, he faces the agent sent to kill him who joined hands with AK-74 to kill Karan. After another fight, Karan kills the agent and beats up AK-74. He publicly hangs him on the town square and surrenders to his commander Col. Akhilesh Sinha, who had arrived on time to save Karan from the local police working for AK. Karan finally reveals his full name to Simrit and promises to return after his court-martial.\n\n===''Commando 2: The Black Money Trail'' (2017)===\n{{Main|Commando 2: The Black Money Trail}}\nCommando Karanveer Singh Dogra \"Karan\" is skilled in many aspects of survival, weaponry, and hand-to-hand combat. He is on a mission to eradicate black money, which has been siphoned to banks along with his gang. He goes to Vicky Chaddha's house where during night time, his wife Maria reveals that they didn't have a life like this in the past. The film flashes to a flashback where his husband was forced to do all this because when he declined to do a negative job, the very next day, a bomb blast occurred where Vicky was saved but their daughter Tara died. Very soon, Maria kills her husband and says that she is the real Vicky Chaddha. Karan and his gang follow Vicky Chaddha and finally find her transferring money to an account. Karan beats up all the army in her team but doesn't stop the money transfer. It is then revealed that he changed the account in which the money was scheduled to the transferred and the replaced account which will help the poor people. He said this was planned on the very first day. When Vicky says that police cannot arrest her, Bhavna Reddy shoots Vicky and they get out of there. While Karan and Bhavna will be together, a phone call arrives where Karan says he is waiting for a new mystery to arrive.\n\n===''Commando 3'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Commando 3 (film)}}\nThe Mumbai Police officers arrest 3 young terror suspects and try to interrogate them but get no information. Karanveer Singh Dogra \"Karan\" is called to help the police but one of the suspects kills himself. Upon investigating further, Karan learns the suspects received money and VHS tapes containing a terrorist's message. Also, one of the suspects talks repeatedly about 9/11, which is decoded as an attack on India on the day of Diwali. Further learning the recordings were shot by a camera in London, Karan decides to go undercover along with Bhavana Reddy, who assisted him on his previous mission. Posing as a married couple, they arrive in London where Mallika Sood, a British Intelligence officer picks them up and takes them to their work station where another agent named Armaan Akhtar assists them. On the other hand, the British Muslim terrorist Buraq Ansari forces his son Abeer to watch him killing a man, due to which Abeer's mother and Buraq's ex wife Zahira wants to contact the police but is threatened by Buraq. Learning two Indian agent have arrived in London possibly to capture him, Buraq enlists the help of his agents to track them while Karan and his team go through the same process to track Buraq's agents. While pursuing a suspect, Karan meets Zahira and Abeer, and soon gets involved in a bike chase with the suspect, resulting in the latter's accidental death. Karan retrieves his phone and answers Buraq's call, further telling him he would soon visit the dead suspect's house. Karan and team arrive at the house, but outside it are stopped by Buraq's goons. A fight breaks out, resulting in Karan getting thrown out of the house by an explosion. The video goes viral, and so does Bhavana's tweet supporting Karan.\n\nIt is soon revealed to be a part of Karan's plan when he releases a video of himself challenging Buraq without disclosing his identity. When Buraq's DNA matches with that of a murder suspect, Karan and his team rush to Buraq's restaurant but find him gone. Realizing he would have gone to pick up his son from school, Karan arrives there and challenges him before the latter disappears. Back in Mumbai, the two suspects are reformed by a Muslim saint. Buraq is unwilling to let go of his son and soon finds himself exposed when Karan holds a press conference with Abeer and Zahira. While the mother and son are being escorted safely to the airport for India, Buraq's henchmen attack the vehicles. Bhavana is knocked out in the crash while Karan and Mallika fight off the henchmen. However, Zahira and Abeer are kidnapped and Mallika is informed about Buraq's surrender. Karan tries to interrogate him but ends up using force due to which he is ordered to leave London within 24 hours. Buraq is freed due to making a deal with the BI; he gives them evidence for a previous attack in exchange for his freedom. On his way to a safe house, Buraq asks the officers to stop at a mosque so that he can pray. He switches places with one of his henchmen and kills Zahira. Realizing the attack would be not on Diwali but before it, Karan decides to continue alone but is joined by his team. Through Abeer's tablet, the safe house is located and attacked by Karan and team. Following the fight that leaves all the henchmen dead, Karan injects Buraq and takes him away as he is unconscious. Bhavana and Mallika rescue Abeer, while Karan is safely picked up by his agency's helicopter and escorted to a cargo ship heading towards India. With minimal time remaining for the attacks, Karan and the police try to find the targeted cities. Decoding \"ALLAH\" spoken repeatedly by Buraq, Karan finds the targeted cities and releases a video requesting the Muslims of India to understand the value of religious unity. When the good Muslims gear up to face the terrorists, they are joined by the police officers and terrorists are arrested. Karan kills Buraq, and hands over Abeer to the dead suspect's father.\n\n==Cast==\n===''Commando: A One Man Army''===\n* [[Vidyut Jamwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Pooja Chopra]] as Simrit Kaur\n* [[Jaideep Ahlawat]] as Amrit Kanwal ([[AK-74]])\n* [[Jagat Rawat]] as MP Mahendra Pratap\n* [[Darshan Jariwala]] as Colonel  Akhilesh Sinha, Karan's Commanding officer\n* [[Nathalia Kaur]] Special appearance (Item song) in \"Mungda\" song\n\n===''Commando 2: The Black Money Trail''===\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Inspector Bhavna Reddy\n* [[Esha Gupta]] as Maria, later real Vicky Chaddha \n* Vansh Bharadwaj as Maria's husband and fake Vicky Chaddha\n* [[Freddy Daruwala]] as ACP Bakhtawar Khan\n* [[Suhail Nayyar]] as Dishank Chowdhury\n* [[Thakur Anoop Singh]] as K.P\n* [[Shefali Shah]] as Leena Chowdhury\n* [[Satish Kaushik]] as Dhariwal Ranwal\n* [[Ivan Sylvester Rodrigues|Ivan Rodrigues]] as Kamath\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Karan's Boss\n* Kannan Arunachalam as Shrinath Iyer\n* Siddharth Kher as Jimmy Kher\n* Avisha Sharma as Tara\n* [[Sumit Gulati]] as Zafar Hussain, the hacktivist\n\n===''Commando 3''===\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Agent Bhavana Reddy \n* [[Angira Dhar]] as British Intelligence Agent Mallika Sood \n* [[Gulshan Devaiah]] as Buraq Ansari\n* Sumeet Thakur as British Intelligence Agent Armaan Akhtar\n* [[Rajesh Tailang]] as Roy\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Ahmed\n* [[Vibhawari Deshpande]] as Rajani\n* [[Feryna Wazheir]] as Zahira\n* Suresh Vishwakarma as Inspector Tambe\n* R.

He decides to escort Simrit out of the town for her safety but finds himself surrounded by AK-74 and his goons at a bridge. Outnumbered and outgunned, he jumps into the river along with Simrit who later explains AK-74 or Amrit Kanwal Singh wants to marry her for political gains. Moving to the woods, Karan and Simrit start to develop feelings for each other. They soon find themselves pursued by AK-74 and his goons, and Karan uses his martial arts skills to fight them off.\n\nAK-74 hires special trackers and hunting dogs, who get a scent of Karan and Simrit from a torn piece of her shirt. Karan misleads the dogs and crosses a river. However, Karan is shot in the ensuing fight and eventually thrown into a river by AK-74. On the other hand, learning of Karan's entering India, an agent is sent to eliminate him. AK-74 kills Simrit's parents and stages it as an accident, eventually forcing Simrit to marry him. However, Karan is saved by some people who heal his wounds before he heads to the town. Karan invades AK-74's house and kills all his henchmen including his brother. Before he can confront AK-74, he faces the agent sent to kill him who joined hands with AK-74 to kill Karan. After another fight, Karan kills the agent and beats up AK-74. He publicly hangs him on the town square and surrenders to his commander Col. Akhilesh Sinha, who had arrived on time to save Karan from the local police working for AK. Karan finally reveals his full name to Simrit and promises to return after his court-martial.\n\n===''Commando 2: The Black Money Trail'' (2017)===\n{{Main|Commando 2: The Black Money Trail}}\nCommando Karanveer Singh Dogra \"Karan\" is skilled in many aspects of survival, weaponry, and hand-to-hand combat. He is on a mission to eradicate black money, which has been siphoned to banks along with his gang. He goes to Vicky Chaddha's house where during night time, his wife Maria reveals that they didn't have a life like this in the past. The film flashes to a flashback where his husband was forced to do all this because when he declined to do a negative job, the very next day, a bomb blast occurred where Vicky was saved but their daughter Tara died. Very soon, Maria kills her husband and says that she is the real Vicky Chaddha. Karan and his gang follow Vicky Chaddha and finally find her transferring money to an account. Karan beats up all the army in her team but doesn't stop the money transfer. It is then revealed that he changed the account in which the money was scheduled to the transferred and the replaced account which will help the poor people. He said this was planned on the very first day. When Vicky says that police cannot arrest her, Bhavna Reddy shoots Vicky and they get out of there. While Karan and Bhavna will be together, a phone call arrives where Karan says he is waiting for a new mystery to arrive.\n\n===''Commando 3'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Commando 3 (film)}}\nThe Mumbai Police officers arrest 3 young terror suspects and try to interrogate them but get no information. Karanveer Singh Dogra \"Karan\" is called to help the police but one of the suspects kills himself. Upon investigating further, Karan learns the suspects received money and VHS tapes containing a terrorist's message. Also, one of the suspects talks repeatedly about 9/11, which is decoded as an attack on India on the day of Diwali. Further learning the recordings were shot by a camera in London, Karan decides to go undercover along with Bhavana Reddy, who assisted him on his previous mission. Posing as a married couple, they arrive in London where Mallika Sood, a British Intelligence officer picks them up and takes them to their work station where another agent named Armaan Akhtar assists them. On the other hand, the British Muslim terrorist Buraq Ansari forces his son Abeer to watch him killing a man, due to which Abeer's mother and Buraq's ex wife Zahira wants to contact the police but is threatened by Buraq. Learning two Indian agent have arrived in London possibly to capture him, Buraq enlists the help of his agents to track them while Karan and his team go through the same process to track Buraq's agents. While pursuing a suspect, Karan meets Zahira and Abeer, and soon gets involved in a bike chase with the suspect, resulting in the latter's accidental death. Karan retrieves his phone and answers Buraq's call, further telling him he would soon visit the dead suspect's house. Karan and team arrive at the house, but outside it are stopped by Buraq's goons. A fight breaks out, resulting in Karan getting thrown out of the house by an explosion. The video goes viral, and so does Bhavana's tweet supporting Karan.\n\nIt is soon revealed to be a part of Karan's plan when he releases a video of himself challenging Buraq without disclosing his identity. When Buraq's DNA matches with that of a murder suspect, Karan and his team rush to Buraq's restaurant but find him gone. Realizing he would have gone to pick up his son from school, Karan arrives there and challenges him before the latter disappears. Back in Mumbai, the two suspects are reformed by a Muslim saint. Buraq is unwilling to let go of his son and soon finds himself exposed when Karan holds a press conference with Abeer and Zahira. While the mother and son are being escorted safely to the airport for India, Buraq's henchmen attack the vehicles. Bhavana is knocked out in the crash while Karan and Mallika fight off the henchmen. However, Zahira and Abeer are kidnapped and Mallika is informed about Buraq's surrender. Karan tries to interrogate him but ends up using force due to which he is ordered to leave London within 24 hours. Buraq is freed due to making a deal with the BI; he gives them evidence for a previous attack in exchange for his freedom. On his way to a safe house, Buraq asks the officers to stop at a mosque so that he can pray. He switches places with one of his henchmen and kills Zahira. Realizing the attack would be not on Diwali but before it, Karan decides to continue alone but is joined by his team. Through Abeer's tablet, the safe house is located and attacked by Karan and team. Following the fight that leaves all the henchmen dead, Karan injects Buraq and takes him away as he is unconscious. Bhavana and Mallika rescue Abeer, while Karan is safely picked up by his agency's helicopter and escorted to a cargo ship heading towards India. With minimal time remaining for the attacks, Karan and the police try to find the targeted cities. Decoding \"ALLAH\" spoken repeatedly by Buraq, Karan finds the targeted cities and releases a video requesting the Muslims of India to understand the value of religious unity. When the good Muslims gear up to face the terrorists, they are joined by the police officers and terrorists are arrested. Karan kills Buraq, and hands over Abeer to the dead suspect's father.\n\n==Cast==\n===''Commando: A One Man Army''===\n* [[Vidyut Jamwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Pooja Chopra]] as Simrit Kaur\n* [[Jaideep Ahlawat]] as Amrit Kanwal ([[AK-74]])\n* [[Jagat Rawat]] as MP Mahendra Pratap\n* [[Darshan Jariwala]] as Colonel  Akhilesh Sinha, Karan's Commanding officer\n* [[Nathalia Kaur]] Special appearance (Item song) in \"Mungda\" song\n\n===''Commando 2: The Black Money Trail''===\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Inspector Bhavna Reddy\n* [[Esha Gupta]] as Maria, later real Vicky Chaddha \n* Vansh Bharadwaj as Maria's husband and fake Vicky Chaddha\n* [[Freddy Daruwala]] as ACP Bakhtawar Khan\n* [[Suhail Nayyar]] as Dishank Chowdhury\n* [[Thakur Anoop Singh]] as K.P\n* [[Shefali Shah]] as Leena Chowdhury\n* [[Satish Kaushik]] as Dhariwal Ranwal\n* [[Ivan Sylvester Rodrigues|Ivan Rodrigues]] as Kamath\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Karan's Boss\n* Kannan Arunachalam as Shrinath Iyer\n* Siddharth Kher as Jimmy Kher\n* Avisha Sharma as Tara\n* [[Sumit Gulati]] as Zafar Hussain, the hacktivist\n\n===''Commando 3''===\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Agent Bhavana Reddy \n* [[Angira Dhar]] as British Intelligence Agent Mallika Sood \n* [[Gulshan Devaiah]] as Buraq Ansari\n* Sumeet Thakur as British Intelligence Agent Armaan Akhtar\n* [[Rajesh Tailang]] as Roy\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Ahmed\n* [[Vibhawari Deshpande]] as Rajani\n* [[Feryna Wazheir]] as Zahira\n* Suresh Vishwakarma as Inspector Tambe\n* R.

For the same reason, while the [[Year 2000 problem|2000s]] began on Saturday, 1 January 2000&nbsp;CE, the official [[3rd millennium|Third Millennium]] began on Monday, 1 January 2001&nbsp;CE.\n\n{{center|\n'''&nbsp;[[#21st century|2000s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#1990s|1900s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#1890s|1800s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#18th century|1700s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#17th century|1600s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#16th century|1500s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#15th century|1400s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#14th century|1300s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#13th century|1200s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#12th century|1100s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#11th century|1000s]]&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;[[#1990s|1st&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;CE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#First Millennium&nbsp;BCE|1st&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Second Millennium&nbsp;BCE|2nd&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Third Millennium&nbsp;BCE|3rd&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Fourth Millennium&nbsp;BCE|4th&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Tenth Millennium&nbsp;BCE|10th&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp;'''\n}}\n\n{{Expand list|date=November 2019}}\n\n===21st century===\n\n====2010s====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:6%\"|Year||style=\"width:8%\"|Date||style=\"width:86%\"|Event\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|2019\n|align=center|20&nbsp;March||'''[[Kazakhstan]]''' changes the name of its capital from Astana to [[Nur-Sultan]] in honour of ex-President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] after the [[Constitution of Kazakhstan]] is amended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meduza.io/news/2019/03/20/parlament-kazahstana-odobril-pereimenovanie-astany-v-nursultan|title=Parliament of Kazakhstan approves renaming of Astana to Nursultan|last=|first=|date=|website=meduza.io|language=Russian|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=center|12&nbsp;February||The [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] adopts the name '''[[Republic of North Macedonia]]''' as part of the [[Prespa agreement]], under which [[Greece]] will no longer veto the country's accession to [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vlada.mk/node/16763?ln=en-gb|title=Announcement of the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia for entry into force of the Final Agreement, Constitutional Amendments and Constitutional Law for Implementation of Amendments |work=Government of the Republic of North Macedonia |date=12 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213025155/https://vlada.mk/node/16763?ln=en-gb |archive-date=13 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"TestoridesPaphitis2019\">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/macedonia-vote-rattles-government-in-neighbor-greece/2019/01/11/5d31e88e-15a4-11e9-ab79-30cd4f7926f2_story.html |title=Europe: Macedonian lawmakers set to vote to change country's name |work=The Washington Post |date=11 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113162131/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/macedonia-vote-rattles-government-in-neighbor-greece/2019/01/11/5d31e88e-15a4-11e9-ab79-30cd4f7926f2_story.html |archive-date=13 January 2019 |url-status=live |first=Konstantin |last=Testorides |author1-link=Konstantin Testorides |first2=Nicholas |last2=Paphitis |author2-link=Nicholas Paphitis |agency=Associated Press |quote=Macedonia late Friday {{bracket|11 January 2019}} fulfilled its part of a historic deal that will pave its way to NATO membership and normalize relations with neighboring Greece, after lawmakers approved constitutional changes to rename the country North Macedonia.&nbsp;... {{bracket|Under}} the full implementation of the agreement&nbsp;...

It includes dates of [[declarations of independence]], [[geographical renaming|changes in country name]], changes of [[capital city]] or name, and significant [[Political history of the world|changes in territory]] such as the [[annexation]], [[cession]], or [[secession]] of land.\n\nThe types of changes listed here usually include (but are not limited to) the alteration of borders, the creation and fall of [[State (polity)|states]], changes of geographical names, as well as a few geographical changes caused by unusually destructive natural disasters. Through the knowledge of such dates and events, the approximate year and age of a [[world map]] could be calculated and estimated.\n\nNot all maps of the world created during a given age or period will be the same across the globe, as different [[cartography|mapmakers]]{{spnd}}or their employers{{spnd}}may have different views on the sovereignty or territorial integrity of the countries of the world or possess different levels of technological sophistication or geographical insight. {{citation needed span|Even maps created by the same mapmaker around the same time can differ significantly.|date=January 2019|reason=This statement needs not just a reference to two maps, but rather a WP:SECONDARY source that supports this assertion.}}\n\nThe timeline below presents its information in reverse chronological order, beginning in the modern era and working backwards.\n\nThis article uses the [[Common Era|Common Calendar System]], which was established as the new [[Gregorian calendar|Christian Calendar]] by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] in 1582. The Common Calendar uses the designation [[Common Era]] (CE or AD for [[Anno Domini]]) for years starting 1 January 1&nbsp;CE, and [[Before Common Era]] (BCE or BC for [[Before Christ]]) for years before that date. The Common Calendar also follows the [[ordinal number]]s rather than the [[cardinal number]]s, so there was no \"[[year zero]]\" in this format; that is, the date 1 January 1&nbsp;CE immediately followed the date 31 December 1&nbsp;BCE. For the same reason, while the [[Year 2000 problem|2000s]] began on Saturday, 1 January 2000&nbsp;CE, the official [[3rd millennium|Third Millennium]] began on Monday, 1 January 2001&nbsp;CE.\n\n{{center|\n'''&nbsp;[[#21st century|2000s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#1990s|1900s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#1890s|1800s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#18th century|1700s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#17th century|1600s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#16th century|1500s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#15th century|1400s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#14th century|1300s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#13th century|1200s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#12th century|1100s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#11th century|1000s]]&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;[[#1990s|1st&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;CE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#First Millennium&nbsp;BCE|1st&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Second Millennium&nbsp;BCE|2nd&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Third Millennium&nbsp;BCE|3rd&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Fourth Millennium&nbsp;BCE|4th&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Tenth Millennium&nbsp;BCE|10th&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp;'''\n}}\n\n{{Expand list|date=November 2019}}\n\n===21st century===\n\n====2010s====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:6%\"|Year||style=\"width:8%\"|Date||style=\"width:86%\"|Event\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|2019\n|align=center|20&nbsp;March||'''[[Kazakhstan]]''' changes the name of its capital from Astana to [[Nur-Sultan]] in honour of ex-President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] after the [[Constitution of Kazakhstan]] is amended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meduza.io/news/2019/03/20/parlament-kazahstana-odobril-pereimenovanie-astany-v-nursultan|title=Parliament of Kazakhstan approves renaming of Astana to Nursultan|last=|first=|date=|website=meduza.io|language=Russian|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=center|12&nbsp;February||The [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] adopts the name '''[[Republic of North Macedonia]]''' as part of the [[Prespa agreement]], under which [[Greece]] will no longer veto the country's accession to [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vlada.mk/node/16763?ln=en-gb|title=Announcement of the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia for entry into force of the Final Agreement, Constitutional Amendments and Constitutional Law for Implementation of Amendments |work=Government of the Republic of North Macedonia |date=12 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213025155/https://vlada.mk/node/16763?ln=en-gb |archive-date=13 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"TestoridesPaphitis2019\">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/macedonia-vote-rattles-government-in-neighbor-greece/2019/01/11/5d31e88e-15a4-11e9-ab79-30cd4f7926f2_story.html |title=Europe: Macedonian lawmakers set to vote to change country's name |work=The Washington Post |date=11 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113162131/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/macedonia-vote-rattles-government-in-neighbor-greece/2019/01/11/5d31e88e-15a4-11e9-ab79-30cd4f7926f2_story.html |archive-date=13 January 2019 |url-status=live |first=Konstantin |last=Testorides |author1-link=Konstantin Testorides |first2=Nicholas |last2=Paphitis |author2-link=Nicholas Paphitis |agency=Associated Press |quote=Macedonia late Friday {{bracket|11 January 2019}} fulfilled its part of a historic deal that will pave its way to NATO membership and normalize relations with neighboring Greece, after lawmakers approved constitutional changes to rename the country North Macedonia.&nbsp;... {{bracket|Under}} the full implementation of the agreement&nbsp;...

The population was 11,340 at the 2010 census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5584425.html|title=2010 U.S. Census|publisher=}}</ref> Of this, 7,864 were in Dodge County, and 3,476 were in Fond du Lac County. In Fond du Lac County, the [[Waupun (town), Wisconsin|Town of Waupun]] abuts the city of Waupun.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Founding ===\nWaupun was founded in 1839 by [[Seymour Wilcox]], the first settler along the Rock River in what was then deciduous forested land. Wilcox chose the land on recommendation of John Bannister, the first surveyor of Fond du Lac County, who reported to the government office in Green Bay that \"the Rock River Valley was the most beautiful and fertile he had ever seen.\"<ref name=\":0\">''The First Hundred Years: A History of Waupun, 1839-1939''. Scott, Edith Moul, 1939.</ref> Wilcox surveyed the land himself in late fall of 1838, returning to Green Bay for the winter. In February 1839 he returned to the plot he laid out accompanied by two men, John N. Ackerman and Hiram Walker, whom were interested in the powerful river and fertile land. They quickly nailed together a shanty to four burr-oaks and began building a suitable cabin for the Wilcox homestead. Leaving Ackerman and Walker to finish, Wilcox returned to Green Bay to bring his family to their new home. They reached Waupun on March 20, 1839.<ref>''The Early History of Waupun''. Hermann, Agnes E., 1916.</ref>\n\nWaupun comes from the Ojibwe word \"Waubun\" which means \"the east,\" \"the morning,\" \"the twilight of dawn\" and \"dawn of day.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://parkrapids.com/neighborhoods/waubun.htm|work=Tamarac National Wildlife Rescue|publisher=Park Rapids Chamber|accessdate=23 March 2014|title=Waubun Minnesota Vacation Destination}}</ref> In fact, Waupun was originally supposed to be named \"Waubun\" but the State of Wisconsin made a spelling error, and Waupun never bothered to change it. An adjacent township with the same name was changed along with the village.\n\n=== Early City History ===\nThe first town election took place in 1842 at the Wilcox home; eleven votes were cast. When the village charter was ratified fifteen years later, 323 votes were cast in the first election. Due to the steady growth of the village and the peculiar geographical location, a city charter was granted on March 15, 1878. John N. Ackerman was elected as the first city mayor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1851, the city was chosen for the State Penitentiary, owing to the abundance of limestone for construction. The main building, constructed in 1854, is still in use.\n\nThe Milwaukee & Horicon Railroad reached Waupun in 1856. It was sold to the Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway June 23, 1863.  This company eventually became the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]], known as \"The Milwaukee Road\", which served Waupun until 1980, when the line was sold to the state of Wisconsin and became the [[Wisconsin & Southern Railroad]].<ref>August Derleth. ''The Milwaukee Road: Its First Hundred Years''. New York: Creative Age Press, 1948.</ref>\n\nThe Waupun Library Association was established in 1858 through the efforts of William Euen and [[Edwin Hillyer]]. Hillyer ran the library out of his insurance office for 37 years without pay. In 1895, the city took ownership of the library, appointing a new library board which included Edwin Hillyer and Lucius D. Hinkley. When the city took ownership, it was soon moved to a side room in the Whiting Theater, which became the Davison Theater while still housing the library. In 1900, through the fundraising efforts of the Waupun Women's Club, it became a free public library. The [[Waupun Public Library|Waupun Carnegie Library]], now Waupun Heritage Museum, was built in 1904 with a $10,000 grant from [[Andrew Carnegie]].<ref name=\":0\" /> A new library building was built in 1968 and is the current Waupun Public Library.\n\nThe territorial Census in 1847 showed Waupun Township to have a population of 956. The 1875 Wisconsin Census showed the village of Waupun to have a total population of 1,867.<ref>''The History of Dodge County, Wisconsin''. Western Historical Company, 1880.</ref>\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\n==== POW camp ====\nIn 1945 the [[United States Army]] announced that Waupun, along with fifteen other Wisconsin communities, were selected for the sites of German POW camps. Despite public opposition, the camp was constructed next to the canning factory, south of Doty Street. The prisoners were brought to Wisconsin to relieve deficits of manpower in the regional factories and farms. There were about 200 POWs at the Waupun camp who were assigned to work either for Canned Foods Inc. in Waupun or Stokely Foods in [[Brandon, Wisconsin]].<ref>''The First One Hundred Fifty Years: A History of Waupun, Wisconsin, 1839 to 1989''.

The population was 11,340 at the 2010 census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5584425.html|title=2010 U.S. Census|publisher=}}</ref> Of this, 7,864 were in Dodge County, and 3,476 were in Fond du Lac County. In Fond du Lac County, the [[Waupun (town), Wisconsin|Town of Waupun]] abuts the city of Waupun.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Founding ===\nWaupun was founded in 1839 by [[Seymour Wilcox]], the first settler along the Rock River in what was then deciduous forested land. Wilcox chose the land on recommendation of John Bannister, the first surveyor of Fond du Lac County, who reported to the government office in Green Bay that \"the Rock River Valley was the most beautiful and fertile he had ever seen.\"<ref name=\":0\">''The First Hundred Years: A History of Waupun, 1839-1939''. Scott, Edith Moul, 1939.</ref> Wilcox surveyed the land himself in late fall of 1838, returning to Green Bay for the winter. In February 1839 he returned to the plot he laid out accompanied by two men, John N. Ackerman and Hiram Walker, whom were interested in the powerful river and fertile land. They quickly nailed together a shanty to four burr-oaks and began building a suitable cabin for the Wilcox homestead. Leaving Ackerman and Walker to finish, Wilcox returned to Green Bay to bring his family to their new home. They reached Waupun on March 20, 1839.<ref>''The Early History of Waupun''. Hermann, Agnes E., 1916.</ref>\n\nWaupun comes from the Ojibwe word \"Waubun\" which means \"the east,\" \"the morning,\" \"the twilight of dawn\" and \"dawn of day.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://parkrapids.com/neighborhoods/waubun.htm|work=Tamarac National Wildlife Rescue|publisher=Park Rapids Chamber|accessdate=23 March 2014|title=Waubun Minnesota Vacation Destination}}</ref> In fact, Waupun was originally supposed to be named \"Waubun\" but the State of Wisconsin made a spelling error, and Waupun never bothered to change it. An adjacent township with the same name was changed along with the village.\n\n=== Early City History ===\nThe first town election took place in 1842 at the Wilcox home; eleven votes were cast. When the village charter was ratified fifteen years later, 323 votes were cast in the first election. Due to the steady growth of the village and the peculiar geographical location, a city charter was granted on March 15, 1878. John N. Ackerman was elected as the first city mayor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1851, the city was chosen for the State Penitentiary, owing to the abundance of limestone for construction. The main building, constructed in 1854, is still in use.\n\nThe Milwaukee & Horicon Railroad reached Waupun in 1856. It was sold to the Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway June 23, 1863.  This company eventually became the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]], known as \"The Milwaukee Road\", which served Waupun until 1980, when the line was sold to the state of Wisconsin and became the [[Wisconsin & Southern Railroad]].<ref>August Derleth. ''The Milwaukee Road: Its First Hundred Years''. New York: Creative Age Press, 1948.</ref>\n\nThe Waupun Library Association was established in 1858 through the efforts of William Euen and [[Edwin Hillyer]]. Hillyer ran the library out of his insurance office for 37 years without pay. In 1895, the city took ownership of the library, appointing a new library board which included Edwin Hillyer and Lucius D. Hinkley. When the city took ownership, it was soon moved to a side room in the Whiting Theater, which became the Davison Theater while still housing the library. In 1900, through the fundraising efforts of the Waupun Women's Club, it became a free public library. The [[Waupun Public Library|Waupun Carnegie Library]], now Waupun Heritage Museum, was built in 1904 with a $10,000 grant from [[Andrew Carnegie]].<ref name=\":0\" /> A new library building was built in 1968 and is the current Waupun Public Library.\n\nThe territorial Census in 1847 showed Waupun Township to have a population of 956. The 1875 Wisconsin Census showed the village of Waupun to have a total population of 1,867.<ref>''The History of Dodge County, Wisconsin''. Western Historical Company, 1880.</ref>\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\n==== POW camp ====\nIn 1945 the [[United States Army]] announced that Waupun, along with fifteen other Wisconsin communities, were selected for the sites of German POW camps. Despite public opposition, the camp was constructed next to the canning factory, south of Doty Street. The prisoners were brought to Wisconsin to relieve deficits of manpower in the regional factories and farms. There were about 200 POWs at the Waupun camp who were assigned to work either for Canned Foods Inc. in Waupun or Stokely Foods in [[Brandon, Wisconsin]].<ref>''The First One Hundred Fifty Years: A History of Waupun, Wisconsin, 1839 to 1989''.

Her introduction through a vocal collaboration was with Bunji Garlin, who at that time was in the spotlight. It was her refreshingly soothing and powerful vocals that quickly got her the attention that many established entertainers desired. Very few were able to provide accurate answers about her and her career, appearing mystery like. Patrice Roberts has assumed her position in the Caribbean music industry as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nMusic was always an instrumental part of her life and would inevitably become her career. As far as her mind allows her to journey Patrice recollects always being in love with music and singing. It was at the tender age of seven she began taking her passion seriously. Since then Patrice has not regretted surrendering to her passion.\n\nIn 2006, shortly after Patrice shot into the spotlight she became one of the frontline vocalists and the only female vocalists in the internationally recognized Soca Band, which at that time was known as Xtatik (now HD). For Patrice\n\nher professional career had just begun and she was in full flight. It would be a challenging and difficult journey for\n\nPatrice but one that she would embrace and make her own when given the opportunity.\n\nFresh out of school, Roberts experienced what many would consider \u201cculture shock\u201d; moving from her countryside dwellings in Toco to city lights. Her transition from a calypso consumed lifestyle to Soca meant that the life she was accepting would attract obstacles beyond her understanding, ''\u201cI had to adapt to the culture, the atmosphere and'' ''now compete with established artistes.\u201d''\n\nPrior to her collaboration with Bunji Garlin and her alliance with Machel Montano and HD, Patrice had numerous Calypso accolades under her belt. Her journey from then to now was crafted by ace songwriter and producer, Kernal Roberts. The male Roberts was approached by Patrice's then mentors; Dan Nero and George Stanisclaus for her introduction into\n\nthe \"Soca World.\" This is how 2005 began. One of her greatest achievements followed soon after when she was named the youngest female Road March winner for her collaboration with Machel Montano titled \u201cBand Of The Year\u201d. This achievement would solidify her existence in the Soca world and prove to critics that she was more talent than they expected. Her talent has provided her with opportunities to travel extensively throughout the Caribbean, The USA and Europe with more opportunities still presenting themselves.\n\nTo understand her career one must understand her struggles, obstacles and successes, a simple word of advice from her to anyone interested in following their dreams is, ''\"Believe in them.\"'' To date Roberts has been recognized for some of her hit singles namely, 'Big Girl Now', 'Old and Grey', \u2018A Little Wine\u2019, \u2018Sweet Fuh Days\u2019, \u2018Like It Like This\u2019, 'Touch Me', \u2018Into You\u2019, \u2018Criminal Wine\u2019, and 'B.O.D.Y' with [[Machel Montano]], among others.\n\n==Artistry: Feminism in Trinidad==\nOn 1 January 2017 Patrice Roberts released a song called Big Girl Now. In the context of Caribbean and Trinidadian history and Roberts\u2019 role as a female soca artist, the song serves as a modern repudiation of a male dominated culture. Trinidadian culture has historically been male dominated and the same can be said of soca since its inception. Before and after Trinidad's independence from Britain, the country has kept a strict binary of male and female roles. Men dominated the \"rational\" public sphere thus laying claim to the spoken word and women were relegated to the private sphere as was much of the rest of the Caribbean.<ref>Pinto, Samantha. \"Why Must All Girls Want to Be Flag Women? Postcolonial Sexualities, National Reception, and Caribbean Soca Performance.\" Meridians 10.1 (2009): 137-63. JSTOR. Web. 29 May 2017.\n</ref> The gendered authority over the spoken word in the Caribbean and Trinidad gives great meaning to women who challenge such notions. In the 1980s, the male dominated field of soca music began to shift as Trinidadian vocal performers began to emerge. Enter Patrice Roberts who was born in 1985 just as women began to dominate soca music. In Big Girl Now, Patrice Roberts brushes past traditional notions of who can and can't produce soca music and takes back her own sexuality as a grown woman from a society that attempts to tell her what she can and can't do. Much of gendered Trinidadian society can be traced back to early post-independence. Just after the independence of Trinidad from Britain on 31 August 1962, the country set about creating the imagined community of \"nation\" and citizenry (state). In this light the creation of cultural borders such as that on sexuality is one of the modern nation-state.<ref>Harewood, Susan. \"Transnational Soca Performances, Gendered Re-Narrations Of Caribbean Nationalism.\" Social and Economic Studies 55.1/2, POPULAR CULTURE (2006): 25-48. JSTOR. Web. 29 May 2017.\n</ref> For example, the Sexual Offenses Bill of 1986 that attempted to regulate women's bodies by dictating what was allowed sexually. The bill stated that \" promiscuity\" was a \"contaminant of the West\". Soca music as performed by female soca performers, such as Patrice Roberts in Big Girl Now, can be thought of as a repudiation of the nation-state evident in lyrics such as \"mind your business, hush your mouth\" while Patrice Roberts and her friends in the music video for Big Girl Now take part in what might be considered \"promiscuous behavior\" by traditional norms. Some critics of Caribbean music and the soca music scene such as author Kevin Frank<ref>Frank, Kevin. \"Female Agency and Oppression in Caribbean Bacchanalian Culture: Soca, Carnival, and Dancehall.\" Women's Studies Quarterly 35.1/2, The Sexual Body (2007): 172-90. JSTOR. Web. 29 May 2017.</ref> believe the role of women to be a solely exploitative and poisonous one while looking at the lyrics of male soca artists and the dance \"winning\". These critics fail to take into account contemporary female soca performers and the colonial history of pre-independence Trinidad as well as early post-independence Trinidad. Both periods sought out to control the sexuality of women. According to Susan Harewood, national narratives that make up the conception of \"nation\" are multi-authored but rarely egalitarian. Throughout Trinidad's history these narratives have been written by men. Artists and Trinidadian women such as Patrice Roberts are authoring their own narrative of what it means to be a Trinidadian woman.\n\n==Carnival and Soca Music (Traditional Culture)==\nPatrice Roberts was born and grew up in Trinidad. Trinidad is a nation having remarkable carnival culture, and it is also known to be the hub of the soca and the calypso music. The soca music is also called the soul calypso. Both genres represent the carnival culture in Trinidad. Trinidad carnival music exhibits three themes including the tradition, the social identity, and the performance context and function. The tradition component of the carnival music includes the usage of music in religious ceremonies and weddings. In these occasions, the instruments such as guitar, cautro, and maracas are used. In additional, vocal, clapping, stamping and special breathing sound \"doption\" are also used in the soca and calypso music. People dance in the Trinidad carnivals. The social identity component reflects the ethnic diversity in Trinidad. There are huge population of Indians, Africans, and other ethnicities. The soca music mixes the calypso with East Indian music. Comparing to calypso, the soca music has faster tempo and it is more energetic. The soca music is designed for festivity and cheerful dance. While the soca lyric has less storytelling, it is calling the audiences to respond to the singer. The soca music is also having more sound effects from the studio production. As a Trinidadian, Patrice Roberts\u2019 songs exhibit characteristics of the soca music and the Trinidad carnival dynamic. As a popular singer, she performs the soca music to broad global audiences and fosters cultural exchanges. In 2006, Patrice Roberts sang with Machel Montano, an internationally known soca singer. Together, their song \"Band of De Year\" won the 2006 Carnival Road March. This achievement brought fame to both singers, the soca music, and the Trinidad carnival culture.\n\n==Patrice Roberts and Motherhood==\nDespite their best efforts the people of Trinidad and Tobago still suffer color and class discrimination as well as sexism . It is apparent in the music industry is male-dominated while women are taking up the vocalist roles in bands. Even though women are able to use their voice to speak of the gender-biased oppression as a welcoming to the music industry, it is also to be said that they are restricted to playing musical instruments roles that can farther increase their credibility. Despite this, Calypso music became the opening door for women to work in the music industry. Calypso music is a type of political and social folk song genre from Trinidad. Calypso music gave the women of Trinidad a voice to sing of gendered-biased oppression.<ref>Munro, Hope. What She Go Do: Women in Afro-Trinidadian Music. Jackson: U of Mississippi, 2016. Print.\n</ref> Patrice Roberts started her career with calypso music but transitioned to Soca, the Soul of Calypso music. Despite being a musical performance that are sometimes cases as a form of male objectification, she is also a mother. She wrote a song for her daughter of one, Lily. \nPatrice Roberts came from a traditional Muslim family where it restricted her of doing what she loved, to sing. The changing role of women as well as the improved status of local expressive forms help create a space for women to participate in the cultural life of Trinidad and Tobago, just as they won role for themselves in public life in general.<ref>Munro, Hope.

This past mother's day, she celebrated her daughter's first birthday by publishing a song for her. Her daughter's name is Lily and the song title is Diamond in My Heart. This music video features Patrice Roberts being a mother during Lily's baptism.\n\n== Achievements ==\n[[File:Machel Montano and Patrice Roberts on Stage.jpg|250px|left|thumb|''Patrice Roberts'' (left) and [[Machel Montano]] (right) perform at [[University of the West Indies|UWI]] Splash in [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]], [[Trinidad]].]]\nIn her early career, Roberts first won the 1995 [[Sangre Grande]] Junior Calypso Monarch competition.

His other brother died before his birth. John's life as an entertainer began at the age of eight, when he put on magic shows for his peers and their families. This once got him into trouble, when he had himself chained up and tossed into a swimming pool with the intention of re-creating [[Harry Houdini]]'s legendary escape act. When he was 14, he and his mother moved to [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where his love for performing continued.

In 1982, a tangle of legal suits with the producers over the distribution of merchandising royalties sent Schneider and co-star Tom Wopat leaving the show for most of a season. They returned to their roles in February 1983, only after their claims were satisfied. The show was canceled in 1985, after 7 seasons. Schneider directed the series finale, titled ''Opening Night at the Boar's Nest'', airing originally on CBS, February 8, 1985.\n\n[[File:John Schneider, Tom Welling & Brian Peterson.jpg|right|thumb|Schneider (left) with Smallville co-star Tom Welling and producer Brian Peterson]]\n\n\nIn 2001, he portrayed [[Jonathan \"Pa\" Kent|Jonathan Kent]], the adoptive father of [[Clark Kent]] on ''[[Smallville]]'', starring in 100 episodes before his character was killed off.

It was in the early 80's that Schneider would sign with Scotti Brothers Label and release his debut full-length, ''Now or Never'', which peaked at #8 on the US Country Billboard charts. Also from the album came \"It's Now or Never,\" a remake of the Elvis Presley hit, which peaked at #4 on the US Country Billboard charts in 1981 and remains the top charting Elvis cover of all time in any genre to date. Continuing to release albums year after year, Schneider released ''Quiet Man'' and ''If You Believe'' and in 1984, signed with MCA Nashville. Through MCA Nashville, Schneider released ''Too Good to Stop Now'' which included his first #1 hits, \"I've Been Around Enough to Know\" and \"Country Girls,\" also peaking at #1 on the CAN Country music charts, cementing his way into the country music world. The following year, Schneider unleashed ''Tryin' To Outrun the Wind'', followed by ''A Memory Like You'' which debuted at #1 on the US Country Billboard charts, a first for Schneider. Off the album ''A Memory Like You'' came \"What's a Memory Like You (Doing In A Love Like This)\" and \"You're The Last Thing I Needed Tonight,\" singles which both peaked at #1 on the US Country Billboard charts and CAN Country. In the late 80's, Schneider continued releasing albums including his Greatest Hits record. Taking some time off to pursue acting opportunities, Schneider would return with ''Worth The Wait'', ''John's Acoustic Christmas'', ''The Promise'' and ''Home For Christmas'', with ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' co-star Tom Wopat in 2014.[[File:JohnSchneidermg.jpg|thumb|John Schneider at a meet and greet 2019]]\nIn 2019, on January 29, LIVE, at a filming of the TV show \"Good Rockin' Tonight,\" John Schneider was Inducted on the air into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\"I hadn't done music since 1990.

Caricatures of far-left leaders from the Russian Empire in [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ''[[The Jewish Bolshevism]]'']]\n[[Walter Laqueur]] traces the Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy theory to Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]], for whom Bolshevism was \"the revolt of the Jewish, Slavic and [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] against the German ([[Aryan]]) element in Russia\". Germans, according to Rosenberg, had been responsible for Russia's historic achievements and had been sidelined by the Bolsheviks, who did not represent the interests of the Russian people, but instead those of its ethnic Jewish and Chinese population.{{sfn|Laqueur|1990|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nMichael Kellogg, in his Ph.D. thesis, argues that the racist ideology of Nazis was to a significant extent influenced by [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9]]s in Germany, many of whom, while being former subjects of the Russian Empire, were of non-Russian descent: [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|ethnic Germans]], residents of Baltic lands including [[Baltic Germans]], and [[Ukrainians]]. Of particular role was their ''Aufbau'' organization (Aufbau: Wirtschafts-politische Vereinigung f\u00fcr den Osten (Reconstruction: Economic-Political Organization for the East)). For example, its leader was instrumental in making ''The Protocols of The Elders of Zion'' available in German language. He argues that early Hitler was rather [[philosemitic]], and became rabidly antisemitic since 1919 under the influence of the White \u00e9migr\u00e9 convictions about the conspiracy of the Jews, an unseen unity from financial capitalists to Bolsheviks, to conquer the world.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael |last=Kellogg |title=The Russian Roots of Nazism: White \u00c9migr\u00e9s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917\u20131945 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-521-84512-0 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511079498&ss=exc}}</ref> Therefore, his conclusion is that White \u00e9migr\u00e9s were at the source of the Nazi concept of Jewish Bolshevism. Annemarie Sammartino argues that this view is contestable. While there is no doubt that White emigres were instrumental in reinforcing the idea of 'Jewish Bolshevism' among Nazis, the concept is also found in many German early post\u2013World War I documents. Also, Germany had its own share of Jewish Communists \"to provide fodder for the paranoid fantasies of German antisemites\" without Russian Bolsheviks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=12282 |title=Michael Kellogg: ''The Russian Roots of Nazism'' (review) |first=Annemarie |last=Sammartino |work=Humanities and Social Sciences Net |date=September 2006 |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s, Hitler declared that the mission of the Nazi movement was to destroy \"Jewish Bolshevism\".{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=257}} Hitler asserted that the \"three vices\" of \"Jewish Marxism\" were democracy, pacifism and internationalism,{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=303}} and that the Jews were behind Bolshevism, communism and Marxism.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=259}}\n\nIn [[Nazi Germany]], this concept of Jewish Bolshevism reflected a common perception that Communism was a Jewish-inspired and Jewish-led movement seeking world domination from its origin. The term was popularized in print in German journalist [[Dietrich Eckhart]]'s 1924 pamphlet \"{{lang|de|italic=no|Der Bolschewismus von Moses bis Lenin}}\" (\"Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin\") which depicted [[Moses]] and Lenin as both being Communists and Jews. This was followed by [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s 1923 edition of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in 1925, which saw Bolshevism as \"Jewry's twentieth century effort to take world dominion unto itself\".\n\nAccording to French spymaster and writer [[Henri Rollin]], \"Hitlerism\" was based on \"anti-Soviet counter-revolution\" promoting the \"myth of a mysterious Jewish\u2013Masonic\u2013Bolshevik plot\", entailing that the [[First World War]] had been instigated by a vast Jewish\u2013Masonic conspiracy to topple the Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian Empires and implement Bolshevism by fomenting liberal ideas.{{sfn|Kellogg|2008}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nA major source for [[propaganda]] about Jewish Bolshevism in the 1930s and early 1940s was the pro-Nazi and antisemitic international ''Welt-Dienst'' news agency founded in 1933 by [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]].\n\nWithin the German Army, a tendency to see Soviet Communism as a Jewish conspiracy had grown since the First World War, something that became officialized under the Nazis.

In the article, which asserted that [[Zionism]] and Bolshevism were engaged in a \"struggle for the soul of the Jewish people\", he called on Jews to repudiate \"the Bolshevik conspiracy\" and make clear that \"the Bolshevik movement is not a Jewish movement\" but stated that:\n\n<blockquote>[Bolshevism] among the Jews is nothing new.

One option was to recognize the structural link between the oppression of the Jews and their involvement in the Left, and to introduce social and political reforms which ended discrimination against Jews... This option would have meant accepting that Jews had as much right as any other religious or ethnic grouping to freely participate in political activities. The second option... was to reject any social or political emancipation of Jews... Instead, this policy blamed the Jewish victims for their persecution, and assumed that anti-Semitic legislation and violence was justified as a response to the alleged threat of \u2018Jewish Bolshevism\u2019.

Of particular role was their ''Aufbau'' organization (Aufbau: Wirtschafts-politische Vereinigung f\u00fcr den Osten (Reconstruction: Economic-Political Organization for the East)). For example, its leader was instrumental in making ''The Protocols of The Elders of Zion'' available in German language. He argues that early Hitler was rather [[philosemitic]], and became rabidly antisemitic since 1919 under the influence of the White \u00e9migr\u00e9 convictions about the conspiracy of the Jews, an unseen unity from financial capitalists to Bolsheviks, to conquer the world.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael |last=Kellogg |title=The Russian Roots of Nazism: White \u00c9migr\u00e9s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917\u20131945 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-521-84512-0 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511079498&ss=exc}}</ref> Therefore, his conclusion is that White \u00e9migr\u00e9s were at the source of the Nazi concept of Jewish Bolshevism. Annemarie Sammartino argues that this view is contestable. While there is no doubt that White emigres were instrumental in reinforcing the idea of 'Jewish Bolshevism' among Nazis, the concept is also found in many German early post\u2013World War I documents.

The term was popularized in print in German journalist [[Dietrich Eckhart]]'s 1924 pamphlet \"{{lang|de|italic=no|Der Bolschewismus von Moses bis Lenin}}\" (\"Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin\") which depicted [[Moses]] and Lenin as both being Communists and Jews. This was followed by [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s 1923 edition of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in 1925, which saw Bolshevism as \"Jewry's twentieth century effort to take world dominion unto itself\".\n\nAccording to French spymaster and writer [[Henri Rollin]], \"Hitlerism\" was based on \"anti-Soviet counter-revolution\" promoting the \"myth of a mysterious Jewish\u2013Masonic\u2013Bolshevik plot\", entailing that the [[First World War]] had been instigated by a vast Jewish\u2013Masonic conspiracy to topple the Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian Empires and implement Bolshevism by fomenting liberal ideas.{{sfn|Kellogg|2008}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nA major source for [[propaganda]] about Jewish Bolshevism in the 1930s and early 1940s was the pro-Nazi and antisemitic international ''Welt-Dienst'' news agency founded in 1933 by [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]].\n\nWithin the German Army, a tendency to see Soviet Communism as a Jewish conspiracy had grown since the First World War, something that became officialized under the Nazis. A 1932 pamphlet by [[Ewald Banse]] of the Government-financed German National Association for the Military Sciences described the Soviet leadership as mostly Jewish, dominating an apathetic and mindless Russian population.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|2005|p=119}}\n\n[[File:German antisemitic and anti-Soviet poster.JPG|thumb|upright|German antisemitic and anti-Soviet propaganda poster, written in the Polish language.

One option was to recognize the structural link between the oppression of the Jews and their involvement in the Left, and to introduce social and political reforms which ended discrimination against Jews... This option would have meant accepting that Jews had as much right as any other religious or ethnic grouping to freely participate in political activities. The second option... was to reject any social or political emancipation of Jews... Instead, this policy blamed the Jewish victims for their persecution, and assumed that anti-Semitic legislation and violence was justified as a response to the alleged threat of \u2018Jewish Bolshevism\u2019. In short, cause and effect were reversed, and Jewish responses to anti-Semitism were utilized to rationalize anti-Semitic practices.<ref name=\"Mendes 2014\"/>}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cultural Bolshevism]]\n*[[Frankfurt School#Conspiracy theory|Cultural Marxism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Alderman\n  | first = G.\n  | title = The Jewish Community in British Politics\n  | publisher = Clarendon Press\n  | location = Oxford\n  | year = 1983\n  | page = 102\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Ascher\n  | first = Abraham\n  | author-link = Berel Wein\n  | title = The Revolution of 1905\n  | publisher = Stanford University Press\n  | location = Palo Alto\n  | year = 1992\n  | isbn = \n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite news\n  | last = Churchill\n  | first = Winston\n  | authorlink = Winston Churchill\n  | title = Zionism versus Bolshevism\n  | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Zionism_versus_Bolshevism\n  | newspaper = Illustrated Sunday Herald\n  | date = 8 February 1920\n  | ref = {{harvid|Churchill|8 February 1920}}\n  }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Evans\n  | first = Richard J.\n  | title = In Hitler's Shadow West German Historians and the Attempt to Escape the Nazi Past\n  | publisher = Pantheon\n  | location = New York\n  | year = 1989\n  | isbn = 978-0-394-57686-2\n  | ref = harv\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/inhitlersshadow00rich\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Figes\n  | first = Orlando\n  | title = The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia\n  | publisher = Picador\n  | location = London\n  | year = 2008\n  | isbn = \n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = F\u00f6rster\n  | first = J\u00fcrgen\n  | authorlink = J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster\n  | contribution = The German Military's Image of Russia\n  | editor1-last = Erickson\n  | editor1-first = Ljubica\n  | editor2-last = Erickson\n  | editor2-first = Mark \n  | title = Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy\n  | publisher = Weidenfeld & Nicolson\n  | location = London\n  | year = 2005\n  | isbn =\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* Friedman, Isaiah (1997).

It is the second-highest [[mountain]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], after [[Mount Rainier]].<ref name=CAG/>\n\nAdams, [[#Exploration|named for]] President [[John Adams]], is a member of the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]], and is one of the arc's largest volcanoes,<ref name=\"Scott\"/> located in a remote wilderness approximately {{convert|34|mi|km|0}} east of [[Mount St. Helens]].<ref name=Wood1990/> The [[Mount Adams Wilderness]] consists of the upper and western part of the volcano's cone. The eastern side of the mountain is designated as part of the territory of the [[Yakama Nation]].<ref name=\"Mt. Adams Wilderness\"/><ref name=YNSite/>\n\nAdams' asymmetrical and broad body rises {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} above the Cascade crest. Its nearly flat summit was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. The [[Pacific Crest Trail]] traverses the western flank of the mountain.<ref name=USFSAdamsPCT/><ref name=USFSPCTWA/>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===General===\n[[File:Mt Adams from south - Wasco County Oregon.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Adams from [[Wasco County, Oregon]]]]\n\nMount Adams stands {{convert|37|mi|km}} east of [[Mount St. Helens]] and about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south of [[Mount Rainier]]. It is {{convert|30|mi|km}} north of the [[Columbia River]] and {{convert|55|mi|km}} north of [[Mount Hood]] in [[Oregon]]. The nearest major cities are [[Yakima]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} to the northeast, and the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] metropolitan area, {{convert|60|mi|km}} to the southwest. Between half and two thirds of Adams is within the [[Mount Adams Wilderness]] of the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]]. The remaining area is within the [[Mount Adams Recreation Area]] of the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]]. While many of the volcanic peaks in Oregon are located on the Cascade Crest, Adams is the only active volcano in Washington to do so. It is farther east than all the rest of Washington's volcanoes except [[Glacier Peak]].<ref name=CVO_Adams/>\n\nAdams is one of the long-lived [[stratovolcano|volcano]]es in the [[Cascade Range]], with minor activity beginning 900,000 years ago and major cone building activity beginning 520,000 years ago. The whole mountain has been completely eroded by glaciers to an elevation of {{convert|8200|ft|m}} twice during its lifetime. The  current cone was built during the most recent major eruptive period 40,000\u201310,000 years ago.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=Simcoes/>\n\nStanding at {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, Adams towers about {{convert|9800|ft|m}} over the surrounding countryside. It is the second-highest mountain in Washington and third-highest in the [[Cascade Range]]. Because of the way it developed, it is the largest stratovolcano in Washington and second-largest in the Cascades, behind only [[Mount Shasta]]. Its large size is reflected in its {{convert|18|mi|km}}-diameter base, which has a prominent north-south trending axis.<ref name=CVO_Adams/>\n\n[[File:Meadows at Mount Adams Wilderness 03.JPG|thumbnail|left|Meadows at Mount Adams Wilderness]]\nAdams is the source of the headwaters for two major rivers, the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] and [[White Salmon River]]. The many streams that emanate from the glaciers and from springs at its base flow into two more major river systems, the [[Cispus River]] and the [[Klickitat River]]. The streams on the north and west portions of Adams feed the Cispus River, which joins the [[Cowlitz River]] near [[Riffe Lake]], and the Lewis River.\n\nTo the south, the White Salmon River has its source on the lower flanks of the west side of Adams and gains additional flows from streams along the southwest side of the mountain. Streams on the east side all flow to the Klickitat River. Streams on all sides, at some point in their courses, provide essential [[irrigation]] water for [[farming]] and [[ranching]]. The [[Klickitat River|Klickitat]] and [[White Salmon River|White Salmon]] rivers are nearly completely free flowing, with only small barriers to aid irrigation (White Salmon)<ref name=Haring/> and [[Check dam|erosion control]] (Klickitat).<ref name=Keller/><ref name=KH_DEIS/> The [[Cispus River|Cispus]] and [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis]] rivers have been [[Dam|impounded]] with dams farther downstream for [[flood control]] and [[hydroelectricity|power generation]] purposes.\n\nMount Adams is the second-most isolated, in terms of access, stratovolcano in Washington; [[Glacier Peak]] is the most isolated. Only two major highways pass close to it. [[U.S. Route 12|Highway 12]] passes about 25 miles to the north of Adams through the Cascades. [[Washington State Route 141|Highway 141]] comes within 13 miles of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the [[Columbia River]] to the small town of [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]]. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to get closer to the mountain. The main access roads, FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Most all other roads are gravel or dirt, with varying degrees of maintenance.<ref name=CowlitzValleyRec/><ref name=AdamsRec/> Access to the [[Mount Adams Recreation Area]] is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles.<ref name=YNRecArea/> Two small towns, [[Glenwood, Klickitat County, Washington|Glenwood]] and [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]], are located in valleys less than 15 miles from the summit, Glenwood on the southeast quarter and Trout Lake on the southwest quarter.\n\nIts size and distance from major cities, and the tendency of some people to forget or ignore Mount Adams, has led some people to call this volcano \"The Forgotten Giant of Washington.\"<ref name=Harris/>{{rp|237}}\n\nOn a clear day from the summit, other visible volcanoes in the [[Cascade Range]] include [[Mount Rainier]], [[Mount Baker]], and [[Glacier Peak]] to the north, [[Mount St. Helens]] to the west, all in Washington; and [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]], [[Three Sisters (Oregon)|the Three Sisters]], [[Mount Thielsen]], [[Mount Scott (Klamath County, Oregon)|Mount Scott]], [[Diamond Peak (Oregon)|Diamond Peak]], and [[Mount McLoughlin]], all to the south in [[Oregon]].<ref name=WTAClimbTR/><ref name=Lyman1/>\n\n===Summit area===\nContrary to legend, the flatness of Adams' current summit area is not due to the loss of the volcano's peak. Instead it was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. A false summit, Pikers Peak, rises {{convert|11657|ft|m|sigfig=4}} on the south side of the nearly half-mile (800 m) wide summit area. The true summit is about {{convert|600|ft|m|sigfig=2}} higher on the gently sloping north side. A small lava and [[scoria]] cone marks the highest point. Suksdorf Ridge is a long buttress descending from the false summit to an elevation of {{convert|8000|ft|m|sigfig=1}}. This structure was built by repeated lava flows in the late [[Pleistocene]]. The Pinnacle forms the northwest false summit and was created by erosion from the Adams and White Salmon glaciers. On the east side, The Castle is a low prominence at the top of Battlement Ridge. The summit crater is filled with snow and is open on its west rim.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n{{wide image|Mount Adams Summit Panorama.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view from the relatively flat summit area of Mount Adams, with the center of the image looking due west towards Mount St. Helens. Six [[Cascade Volcanoes]] are visible (not including Adams itself). From left to right: [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]], [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount St. Helens]], [[Mount Rainier]], [[Mount Baker]], and [[Glacier Peak]].}}\n\n===Flank terrain features===\nProminent ridges descend from the mountain on all sides. On the north side, the aptly named North Cleaver comes down from a point below the summit [[ice cap]] heading almost due north. The Northwest Ridge and West Ridge descend from the Pinnacle, to the northwest and west, respectively. Stagman Ridge descends west-southwest from a point about halfway up the west side and turns more southwest at about {{convert|6000|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. South of Stagman Ridge lies Crofton Ridge. Crofton gradually becomes very broad as it descends southwesterly from the tree line. MacDonald Ridge, on the south side, starts at about tree line below the lower end of Suksdorf Ridge and descends in a southerly direction.\n\nThree prominent ridges descend from the east side of the mountain. The Ridge of Wonders is farthest south and ends at an area away from the mountain called The Island. Battlement Ridge is very rugged and descends from high on the mountain. The farthest ridge north on the east side, Victory Ridge, descends from a lower elevation on the mountain than Battlement Ridge beneath the precipitous Roosevelt Cliff. Lava Ridge, starting at about the same location as the North Cleaver, descends slightly east of north.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/>\n\nSeveral rock prominences exist on the lower flanks of Adams. The Spearhead is an abrupt rocky prominence near the bottom of Battlement Ridge. Burnt Rock, The Hump, and The Bumper are three smaller rocky prominences at or below the tree line on the west side.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/>\n\n===Glaciers===\n[[File:Mt. Adams Glaciers above Bird Creek Meadows.JPG|thumb|Heavily crevassed glaciers on the southeast side of the mountain]]\n[[File:USGS Glaciers of Mount Adams Map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.45|Glaciers of Mount Adams]]\n\nIn the early 21st century, glaciers cover a total of 2.5% of Adams' surface. During the last [[ice age]] about 90% of the mountain was glaciated. Mount Adams has 209 perennial snow and ice features and 12 officially named glaciers. The total ice-covered area makes up {{convert|9.3|sqmi|km2}}, while the area of named glaciers is {{convert|7.7|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Glaciers of Washington\"/>  Most of the largest remaining glaciers (including the [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams]], [[Klickitat Glacier|Klickitat]], [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]], and [[White Salmon River|White Salmon]]) originate from Adams' summit ice cap.<ref name=Guardians/><ref name=Reid1/>\n\nOn the northwest face of the mountain, [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]] cascades down a steep channel in a series of [[icefall]]s before spreading out and terminating at around the {{convert|7000|ft|m|sigfig=3}} elevation, where it becomes the source of the Lewis River and Adams Creek, a tributary of the [[Cispus River]].<ref name=Guardians/> Its eastern lobe ends at a small glacial [[tarn (lake)|tarn]], Equestria Lake. In the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], Adams Glacier is second in size only to [[Carbon Glacier]] on [[Mount Rainier]].<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=\"Wood\"/><ref name=Treser/>\n\n[[File:Upper Portion of the Adams Glacier.JPG|thumb|Deep crevasses and icefalls on Adams Glacier]]\n\nThe [[Pinnacle Glacier (Mount Adams)|Pinnacle]], [[White Salmon Glacier (Mount Adams)|White Salmon]], and [[Avalanche Glacier|Avalanche]] glaciers on the west side of the mountain are less thick and voluminous, and are generally patchy in appearance. They all originate from [[cirques|glacial cirques]] below the actual summit. Although the White Salmon Glacier does not originate from the summit [[ice cap]], it does begin very high on the mountain at about {{convert|11600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. In the early 1900s, a portion of it descended from the summit ice cap,<ref name=Reid1/> but volume loss has separated it. Some of its glacial ice feeds the Avalanche Glacier below it to the southwest while the rest tumbles over some large cliffs to its diminutive lower section to the west. The White Salmon and Avalanche Glaciers feed the many streams of the Salt Creek and Cascade Creek drainages, which flow into the [[White Salmon River]]. The Pinnacle Glacier is the source of a fork of the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] as well as Riley Creek, which is also a tributary of the Lewis River.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe south side of the mountain along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small [[Gotchen Glacier]] and the [[Crescent Glacier (Mount Adams)|Crescent Glacier]]. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the [[White Salmon River]].<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe rugged east side has four glaciers, the [[Mazama Glacier (Mount Adams)|Mazama Glacier]], [[Klickitat Glacier]], [[Rusk Glacier]], and the [[Wilson Glacier (Mount Adams)|Wilson Glacier]]. During the last [[Ice Age]], they carved out two immense canyons: the Hellroaring Canyon and the Avalanche Valley. This created the Ridge of Wonders between the two. Of the four glaciers on the east side, the Mazama Glacier is the farthest south and begins between the Suksdorf Ridge and Ridge of Wonders at about {{convert|10500|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. Near its terminus, it straddles the Ridge of Wonders and a small portion feeds into the Klickitat Glacier. The glacier gains more area from additional glacier ice that collects from drifting snow and avalanches below the Suksdorf Ridge as the ridge turns south. The Mazama Glacier terminates at about {{convert|8000|ft|m|sigfig=3}} and is the source of Hellroaring Creek, which flows over several waterfalls before it joins Big Muddy Creek. [[Klickitat Glacier]] on the volcano's eastern flank originates in a {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} wide [[cirque]] and is fed by two smaller glaciers from the summit ice cap. It terminates around {{convert|6600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}, where it becomes the source of Big Muddy Creek, a tributary of the [[Klickitat River]]. The Rusk Glacier does not start from the summit ice cap, but starts at {{convert|10500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} below the Roosevelt Cliff and is fed by avalanching snow and ice from the summit cap. It is enclosed on the south by Battlement Ridge and Victory Ridge on the north and terminates at about {{convert|7100|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. It is the source of Rusk Creek, which flows over two waterfalls before joining the Big Muddy on its way to the Klickitat. The Wilson Glacier, like the Rusk Glacier, starts below the Roosevelt Cliff and is fed by avalanching snow and ice; however, the Wilson Glacier starts slightly higher at about {{convert|10800|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. It is also fed by an arm of the Lyman Glacier as it flows down from the summit ice cap. The Wilson Glacier terminates at {{convert|7500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} where it is the source of Little Muddy Creek, another tributary of the Klickitat.<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe north side is distinguished by two major glaciers, the [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]] and [[Lava Glacier|Lava]] Glaciers. Like the [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]], the Lyman Glacier is characterized by deep [[crevasse]]s and many [[icefall]]s as it cascades down from the summit [[ice cap]].<ref name=Guardians/> It is divided into two arms by a very rugged ridge at {{convert|10200|ft|m|sigfig=3}} and terminates at {{convert|7400|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. The [[Lava Glacier]] originates in a large cirque below the summit at about {{convert|10000|ft|m|sigfig=3}}, sandwiched between the North Cleaver on the west and the Lava Ridge to the east. It terminates at about {{convert|7600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. The Lava and Lyman Glaciers are the source of the Muddy Fork of the [[Cispus River]].<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=\"Glaciers of Washington\"/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe total glacier area on Mount Adams decreased 49%, from {{convert|31.5|km2|order=flip}} to {{convert|16.2|km2|order=flip}}, between 1904 and 2006, with the greatest loss occurring before 1949. Since 1949, the total glacier area has been relatively stable with a small amount of decline since the 1990s.<ref name=Treser/><ref name=\"Sitts\"/>\n\n===Surrounding area===\n[[File:Mt. Adams from the south.JPG|left|thumb|Aerial view of the south face from across the [[Columbia River Gorge]]]]\nMount Adams is surrounded by a variety of other volcanic features and [[volcano]]es. It stands near the center of a north-south trending volcanic field that is about {{convert|4|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|30|mi|km}} long, from just south of the [[Goat Rocks]] to Guler Mountain, the vent farthest south in the field. This field includes over 120 vents; about 25 of these are considered flank volcanoes of Mount Adams. The largest flank volcano is a [[basalt]]ic [[shield volcano]] on Adams east base called Goat Butte. This structure is at least 150,000&nbsp;years old.\nLittle Mount Adams is a symmetrical [[cinder cone]] on top of the Ridge of Wonders on Adams' southeast flank.<ref name=AdamsNatHistory/>\n\nPotato Hill is a cinder cone on Adams' north side that was created in the late [[Pleistocene]] and stands {{convert|800|ft|m|sigfig=2}} above its lava plain.<ref name=\"MZ\"/>\nLavas from its base flowed into the Cispus Valley where they were later modified by glaciers.  At the {{convert|7500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} level on Adams' south flank is South Butte. The lavas associated with this structure are all younger than Suksdorf Ridge but were emplaced before the end of the last ice age.<ref name=\"MZ\"/>\n[[File:Simulating Trout Lake, Klickitat County, Washington.jpg|thumbnail|right|Trout Lake (Trout Lake Creek) reflecting Mount Adams near the small town of Trout Lake]]\n\nSeveral relatively young obvious lava flows exist in the area around Adams. Most of these flows are on the north side of the mountain and include the flow in the Mutton Creek area, Devils Garden, the Takh Takh Meadows Flow, and the much larger Muddy Fork Lava Flow to the north of Devils Garden. Only one obvious flow appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nThe many other vents and volcanoes encompassed by the Mount Adams field include Glaciate Butte and Red Butte on the north, King Mountain, Meadow Butte, Quigley Butte, and Smith Butte on the south, with others interspersed throughout.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nLocated a few miles north of Adams is [[Goat Rocks Wilderness]] and the heavily eroded ruins of a [[stratovolcano]] that is much older than Adams. Unlike Adams, the [[Goat Rocks]] volcano was periodically explosive and deposited [[volcanic ash|ash]] 2.5&nbsp;million years ago that later solidified into {{convert|2100|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=2}} thick [[tuff]] layers.<ref name=CascadesVolcanosObservatory/>\n\nIn the area surrounding Mount Adams, many caves have formed around inactive lava vents.<ref name=Lyman1/>  These caves are usually close to the surface and can be hundreds of feet deep and wide.<ref name=NYTCaves/> A few of the more well known caves include the [[Cheese Cave]], Ice Cave, and Deadhorse Caves. Cheese Cave has the largest bore of the caves near Adams with a diameter of {{convert|40|-|50|ft|m}} and a length of over {{convert|2000|ft|m}}.<ref name=Caldwell1953/> Ice cave, which is made up of several sections created by several [[sinkhole]]s, has an ice section that is {{convert|120|ft|m}} long and {{convert|20|-|30|ft|m}} in diameter and noted for its ice formations.<ref name=Lyman2/><ref name=AdamsOuting1913/> From the same entrance, the tube continues another {{convert|500|ft|m}} to the west.<ref name=IceCaveWA/><ref name=CavesOfWA/> Deadhorse Cave is a massive network of lava tubes. It the most complex [[lava tube]] in the United States with {{convert|14441|ft|m}} of passage.<ref name=OregonGrotto/> These caves are all just outside of [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]]. These and many other caves in the Trout Lake area were at one time part of a huge system that originated at the [[Indian Heaven]] [[volcanic field]]. The most obscure caves around Adams are the Windholes on the southeast side near Island Cabin Campground.<ref name=windholes/>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Takh Takh Lava Flow.png|thumb|Takh Takh Lava Flow below Mount Adams]]\nAdams is made of several overlapping cones that together form an {{convert|18|mi|km|0|adj=on}} diameter base which is elongated in its north-south axis and covers an area of {{convert|250|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. The volcano has a volume of {{convert|70|cumi|km3|sigfig=2}} placing it second only to [[Mount Shasta]] in that category among the [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] stratovolcanoes.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>  Mount Adams was created by the subduction of the [[Juan de Fuca plate]], which is located just off the coast of the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name=Harris/>\n\nMount Adams was born in the mid to late [[Pleistocene]] and grew in several pulses of mostly [[lava]]-extruding eruptions. Each eruptive cycle was separated from one another by long periods of dormancy and minor activity, during which, [[glacier]]s eroded the mountain to below {{convert|9000|ft|m}}. [[Potassium-argon dating]] has identified three such eruptive periods; the first occurring 520,000&nbsp;to 500,000 years ago, the second 450,000&nbsp;years ago, and the third 40,000&nbsp;to 10,000 years ago.<ref name=Harris/> Most of these eruptions and therefore most of the [[volcano]], consist of [[lava flows]] with little [[tephra]]. The loose material that makes up much of Adams' core is made of [[breccia]]ted lava.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[Andesite]] and [[basalt]] flows formed a {{convert|20|to|200|ft|m|sigfig=1|adj=on}} thick circle around the base of the Mount Adams, and filled existing depressions and ponded in valleys. Most of the volcano is made of andesite together with handful of [[dacite]] and [[pyroclastic flow]]s which erupted early in Adams' development. The present main cone was built when Adams was capped by a glacier system in the last [[ice age]]. The lava that erupted was shattered when it came in contact with the ice and the cone interior is therefore made of easily [[erosion|eroded]] [[andesite]] fragments. Since its construction, constant emissions of heat and caustic gases have transformed much of the rock into [[clay]]s (mostly [[kaolinite]]), [[iron oxide]]s, [[sulfur]]-rich compounds and [[quartz]].<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/>\n\nThe present eruptive cone above {{convert|7000|ft|m}} was constructed sometime between 40,000&nbsp;to 10,000 years ago. Since that time the volcano has erupted at least ten times, generally from above {{convert|6500|ft|m}}. One of the more recent flows issued from South Butte and created the {{convert|4.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} wide A.G. Aiken Lava Bed. This flow looks young but has 3,500-year-old [[Mount St. Helens]] ash on it, meaning it is at least that old.<ref name=\"Wright\"/> Of a similar age are the Takh Takh Meadows and Muddy Fork lava flows. The lowest vent to erupt since the main cone was constructed is Smith Butte on the south slope of Adams. The last lava known to have erupted from Adams is an approximately 1000-year-old flow that emerged from a vent at about {{convert|8200|ft|m}} on Battlement Ridge.<ref name=Harris/>\n[[File:Mount Adams Volcano Hazard Zones.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|Mount Adams, Washington simplified hazards map showing potential impact area for ground-based hazards during a volcanic event.]]\n\nThe Trout Lake Mudflow is the youngest large [[debris flow]] from Adams and the only large one since the end of the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]]. The flow dammed Trout Creek and covered {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} of the [[White Salmon River]] valley. Impounded water later formed Trout Lake. The Great Slide of 1921 started close to the headwall of the White Salmon Glacier and was the largest [[avalanche]] on Adams in historic time. The slide fell about {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} and its debris covered about {{convert|1|sqmi|km2|1}} of the upper Salt Creek area.<ref name=Slide/> Steam vents were reported active at the slide source for three years, leading to speculation that the event was started with a small steam explosion.<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/> This was the only debris flow in Mount Adams' recorded history, but there are five known lahars.<ref name=\"Vallance\"/>\n\nSince then, thermal anomalies (hot spots) and gas emissions (including [[hydrogen sulfide]]) have occurred especially on the summit plateau and indicate that Adams is [[Volcano#Dormant|dormant]], not [[Volcano#Extinct|extinct]]. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of [[andesite]] or [[basalt]]. Because the primary products were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams tend to have a low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens and some of the other Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone is little more than a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large [[landslide]]s and other debris flows.<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams rock and ice debris avalanche.jpg|thumb|Rock and ice debris avalanche that occurred on October 20, 1997 on the east side of Mount Adams.]]\nIn 1997, Adams experienced two slides seven weeks apart that were the largest slides in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], ignoring the catastrophic [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|landslide eruption of Mount St. Helens]], since a slide that occurred on [[Little Tahoma]] in 1963.<ref name=avalanche/> The first occurred at the end of August and consisted of mainly snow and ice with some rock. It fell from a similar location and in a similar path to the slide of 1921. The second slide that year occurred in late October and originated high on Battlement Ridge just below The Castle. It consisted of mainly rock and flowed three miles down the [[Klickitat Glacier]] and the Big Muddy Creek streambed. Both slides were estimated to have moved as much as {{convert|6.5|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of material.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nThe [[Indian Heaven]] [[volcanic field]] is located between St. Helens and Adams and within the [[Indian Heaven Wilderness]]. Its principal feature is an {{convert|18|mi|km|0|adj=on}} long linear zone of [[shield volcano]]es, [[cinder cone]]s, and flows with volumes of up to {{convert|23|cumi|km3}} with the highest peak, [[Lemei Rock]]. The shield volcanoes, which form the backbone of the volcanic field, are located on the northern and southern sides of the field. Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams are on the western and the eastern sides.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\nTo the east, across the [[Klickitat River]], lies the [[Simcoe Mountains|Simcoe Mountains volcanic field]]. This area contains many small shield volcanoes and cinder cones of mainly [[alkali basalt|alkalic intraplate basalt]] with fractionated intermediate alkalic products, subordinate subalkaline [[mafic]] lavas, and several [[rhyolite]]s as secondary products. There are about 205 vents that were active between 4.2 million and 600 thousand years ago.<ref name=Simcoes/>\n\n[[Seismic activity]] around Adams is very low and it is one of the quietest volcanoes in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is monitored by the [[Pacific Northwest Seismic Network]] and the [[Cascades Volcano Observatory]] via a [[seismic station]] on the southwest flank of the mountain.<ref name=CVO_Seismic/>\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Mount Adams summit area.jpg|thumbnail|right|The South Climb, or South Spur climbing route on Mount Adams along Suksdorf Ridge]]\nLike many other [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] volcanoes, Mount Adams offers many recreational activities, including mountain climbing, hiking and backpacking, berry picking, camping, [[boating]], [[fishing]], [[rafting]], [[photography]], wildlife viewing, and scenic driving among other things.<ref name=\"Mt.

Don't crab, the mountain was here first.\"<ref name=Smoot/> [[Crampons]] and [[ice axe]]s are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route's steepness. Aside from [[crevasse]]s on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep [[headwall]]s of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, [[avalanche]]s, [[altitude sickness]], and inexperience.

He was so pleased with Loowit's faithfulness that he offered Loowit whatever she wanted. She asked for youth and beauty and Saghalie granted her wish. Suitors came from near and far until finally she could not decide between Klickitat and Wiyeast. Klickitat and Wiyeast went to war over the matter until finally Sahalie decided to punish them for creating such chaos. He broke the Bridge of the Gods and put the three lovers to death.

The Native Americans lived on the sea and each year they would hold two large powwows at [[Mount Multnomah]], one in the spring and one in the fall. The demigod Koyoda Spielei lived among them and settled disputes among the living things of the earth, including the mountains Pa-toe (Adams) and Yi-east ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]), sons of the [[Great Spirit]] Soclai Tyee. For many years, peace prevailed over the land. Then a beautiful squaw mountain moved to the valley between Pa-toe and Yi-east. She fell in love with Yi-east, but liked to flirt with Pa-toe. This caused the two mountains to quarrel with each other and it quickly escalated into an all out brawl. Ignoring Koyoda's calls for peace, they belched forth smoke and ash and threw hot rocks at each other. Some time later, they paused for a rest and discovered the catastrophe they had caused. The forests and meadows had been burnt to the ground and many animals and other living things had been killed. The earth had been shaken so severely that a hole had been created in the mountains and the sea had drained away and the [[Bridge of the Gods (land bridge)|Bridge of the Gods]] was formed. The squaw mountain had hid herself in a cave during the battle and because they could no longer find her, they were about to resume fighting. However, while they had been fighting, Koyoda went to Soclai and told him what was happening. Soclai arrived in time to stop them from resuming their quarrel. He decreed that the squaw mountain should remain in the cave forever and the Bridge of the Gods was to be a covenant of peace between the mountains that he would cause to fall if they ever resumed their quarrel. He also placed an ugly old woman, known as Loo-wit, as a mountain to guard the bridge and remind the brothers that beauty is never permanent. After many years, the signs of the great battle and the evidence of the inland sea had disappeared and there was happiness and contentment over the earth. The squaw mountain wished to come out of her cave and grew very lonely. In an effort to ease her loneliness, Soclai sent the Bats, a tribe of beautiful birds, to be her companions. Yi-east eventually learned that the Bats were her guardians and carried out secret communication with the squaw mountain through them. He befriended Loo-wit and crossed the bridge at night to meet with the squaw mountain. One night, he stayed too long and had to hurry to get back to his proper place. He caused the ground to shake so much in his haste that a large rock fell and blocked the entrance to the cave. When Soclai found this, he was furious with the Bats and punished them by turning them into bats that are seen today. He allowed the squaw mountain to remain out of the cave on her promise to be good, but would not allow her and Yi-east to be married, fearing the inevitable quarrel that might start again. He did promise to look for a mate for Pa-toe, hoping this would initiate a lasting peace. However, because of his many duties, he forgot this promise and the two mountains were only held in check by his threats. Eventually, when Soclai was in another part of the world, they resumed their quarrel and created chaos again. Their violence broke the Bridge of the Gods and destroyed the landscape again. Loo-wit, in her attempts to stop the two brothers, was badly burned and scarred; and when the bridge collapsed, she fell with it. Finally, Pa-toe won the battle and Yi-east admitted defeat. Soclai returned from where he had been, but he was too late to avert the disaster. He found Loo-wit and because she had been faithful in her guardianship, he rewarded her by giving her her greatest desire, youth and beauty. Having received this gift, she moved to the west side of the Cascades and remains there to this day as [[Mount St. Helens]]. Since Pa-toe won the battle, the squaw mountain belonged to him. She was heart broken, but took her place at his side. She soon fell at his feet and into a deep sleep from which she never awoke. She is now known as Sleeping Beauty. Pa-toe became so sad that he caused her deep sleep, he lowered his own head in remorse.<ref name=Sterrett/>\n\n[[File:Thunderbird on Totem Pole.jpg|thumb|upright|Thunderbird on a Totem Pole]]\nThe [[Yakama]]s also have a legend attempting to explain Adams' squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the [[Goat Rocks]]), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]], and [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]]. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now the first to be greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee ([[Three Sisters (Oregon)|the Three Sisters]]) convinced Wyeast ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken with the rest of the mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The [[Great Spirit]] had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.<ref name=WAHistoryOnline/>\n\nIn many of the legends of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]], there are [[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird]]s that live on them and Adams is no exception. This particular thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized the inhabitants of the land. Speelyi, the [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]] coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.<ref name=Lyman4/>\n\nSeveral other tribes have legends involving battles and disagreements between the great peaks. The [[Cowlitz people|Cowlitz]] and [[Chehalis people|Chehalis]] have a legend where [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]] and [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]] were female mountains and quarreled over Adams, the male mountain. In a different legend from the Cowlitz, St. Helens was the man and Pahto (Adams) and Takhoma (Rainier) were his wives and the two wives quarreled with each other. A thunderbird legend from the [[Yakama]]s has a terrific battle between the thunderbird, Enumklah, and his five wives, Tahoma (Rainier), Pahto (Adams), Ah-kee-kun ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]), Low-we-lat-Klah (St. Helens), and Simcoe. Pahto and Tahoma were badly beaten, Ah-kee-kun and Low-we-lat-Klah escaped without injury, and Simcoe suffered the greatest injury for starting the battle.<ref name=Clark/>\n\n===Exploration===\nAdams was known to the Native Americans as Pahto (with various spellings) and Klickitat. In various tribal languages ([[Plateau Penutian languages|Plateau Penutian]], [[Chinookan languages|Chinookan]], [[Salishan languages|Salishan]]), Pahto means ''high up'', ''very high'', ''standing up'', or ''high sloping mountain''.<ref name=ORNativeSonML/><ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/> The [[Klickitat people#Name|Klickitat name]] is of [[Sahaptin language#Dialects|Klickitat]] origin and comes from the [[Chinookan]] for ''beyond''.\n\nIn 1805, on the journey westward down the [[Columbia River|Columbia]], the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] recorded seeing the mountain; noting that it was \"a high mountain of emence hight covered with snow\"<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> and thought it \"perhaps the highest pinnacle in America.\"<ref name=Guardians/><ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> They initially misidentified it as [[Mount St. Helens]], which had been previously discovered and named by [[George Vancouver]]. On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but did not give Adams a name, only calling it \"a very high humped mountain\".<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/>\n\nFor several decades after Lewis and Clark sighted the mountain, people continued to get Adams confused with [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]], due in part to their somewhat similar appearance and similar [[latitude]]. In the 1830s, [[Hall J. Kelley]] led a campaign to rename the [[Cascade Range]] as the President's Range and rename each major Cascade mountain after a former [[President of the United States]]. Mount Adams was not known to Kelley and was thus not in his plan. [[Mount Hood]], in fact, was designated by Kelley to be renamed after President [[John Adams]] and St. Helens was to be renamed after [[George Washington]]. In a mistake or deliberate change by mapmaker and proponent of the Kelley plan, [[Thomas J. Farnham]], the names for Hood and St. Helens were interchanged. And, likely because of the confusion about which mountain was St. Helens, he placed the ''Mount Adams'' name north of Mount Hood and about {{convert|40|mi|km}} east of Mount St. Helens. By what would seem sheer coincidence, there was in fact a large mountain there to receive the name. Since the mountain had no official name at the time, Kelley's name stuck even though the rest of his plan failed.<ref name=CVO_Adams/> However, it was not official until 1853, when the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]], under the direction of [[Washington Territory]] governor [[Isaac I. Stevens]], determined its location, described the surrounding countryside, and placed the name on the map.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=Guardians/><ref name=Beckey/><ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/><ref name=Meany1/>\n\nSince its discovery by explorers, the height of Adams has also been subject to revision. The topographer for the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]], Lt. [[Johnson K. Duncan]], and [[George Gibbs (ethnologist)|George Gibbs]], ethnologist and naturalist for the expedition, thought it was about the same height as St. Helens. Its large, uneven size apparently contributed to the underestimation.<ref name=Beckey/> The [[Canada\u2013United States border#The Northwest Boundary Survey (1857\u201361)|Northwest Boundary Survey]] listed Adams as having an elevation of {{convert|9570|ft|m}}<ref name=Beckey/>  while a later [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|US Coast and Geodetic Survey]] gave it an elevation of {{convert|11906|ft|m}}.<ref name=HistorianReport/> The height was more closely determined in 1895 by members of the [[Mazamas|Mazamas mountaineering club]], William A. Gilmore, Professor Edgar McClure, and [[William Gladstone Steel]]. Using a [[Hypsometer#Pressure hypsometer|boiling point thermometer]], [[Barometer#Mercury barometers|mercurial barometer]], and an [[Barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid barometer]], they determined the elevation to be {{convert|12255|,|12402|, and|12150|ft|m}} respectively.<ref name=Elevation/> None of these numbers were used on any map because that same year, 1895, the [[US Geological Survey]] (USGS), using a [[triangulation]] method, also measured the height of several mountains in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and they measured Adams as having an elevation of {{convert|12470|ft|m}}.<ref name=NatGeo/> The USGS further refined their measurement sometime in late 1909 or early 1910 to {{convert|12307|ft|m}} and again in 1970 to {{convert|12276|ft|m}} for the release of the Mount Adams East 1:24000 quadrangle. The current elevation, {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, is generated by the new method, [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988|NAVD88]], for calculating altitudes.\n\n[[Claude Ewing Rusk]], a local settler and [[mountaineer]], was one of those most familiar with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given to places around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle [[glacier]]s. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman<ref name=Rusk/> and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone.<ref name=Beckey/> While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.<ref name=Rusk/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams (Washington) Map 1901 Reid.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Reid's map from his survey of Adams in 1901]]\nNo detailed descriptions of Adams or its [[glacier]]s existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of the mountain in 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams to be the source of some of the [[Columbia River Basalt Group|Columbia River basalt flows]]. They thought that Adams was within what was originally an enormous [[caldera]] that was about one hundred miles across. The southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the [[anticline]] ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley.<ref name=Lyman2/> Modern [[geology]] has since dismissed this theory. From information collected on an outing of the [[Mazamas]] in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896.<ref name=Lyman7/> Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted [[geologist]]/[[glaciologist]] [[Harry Fielding Reid]] to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant [[glacier]]s, [[Pinnacle Glacier (Mount Adams)|Pinnacle]], [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams]], [[Lava Glacier|Lava]], [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]], and [[Rusk Glacier|Rusk]] with suggestions from Rusk.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Beckey/> He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte.<ref name=Reid1/><ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Reid2/> Reid noted that it was apparent that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the [[Little Ice Age]].<ref name=Reid1/><ref name=Reid2/> The geologic history of Adams would have to wait another 80 years before it was fully explored.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nOn the 1895 [[Mazamas]] expedition, the first [[heliograph]]y between several of the peaks of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] was attempted with some success. A party on [[Mount Hood]] was able to communicate back and forth with the party on Mount Adams, but the parties on [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]], [[Mount Baker|Baker]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Jefferson]], and [[Diamond Peak (Oregon)|Diamond Peak]] were not successful, mainly because of dense smoke and logistical problems.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=HistorianReport/><ref name=Wells/>\n\n[[File:Cascadians Climbing Party east side Mount Adams (Washington).jpg|thumb|left|Cascadians climbing party before starting the ascent of the east side of Adams]]\nThe first ascent of Mount Adams was in 1854 by Andrew Glenn Aiken,<ref name=AikenName/> [[Edward Jay Allen]], and Andrew J. Burge.<ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/><ref name=Meany1/><ref name=Hazard/> While most sources list the aforementioned names, at least one substitutes Colonel Benjamin Franklin Shaw for Andrew Burge.<ref name=Guardians/> Their route was likely up the North Cleaver because that summer they were improving a newly designated military road that passes through [[Naches Pass]], which is to the north of Adams.<ref name=Meany1/>\n\nWhile the north and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the mountain were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and [[icefall|ice cascades]].<ref name=Guardians/> To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, [[C. E. Rusk]] searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the [[Wilson Glacier (Mount Adams)|Wilson Glacier]], Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, up and over The Castle, and across the vast, heavily [[crevasse]]d eastern side of the summit [[ice cap]].<ref name=Rusk/> One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was \"thrilling to the point of extreme danger.\"<ref name=Hazard/> Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Coursen/> Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the [[Mazamas]] finally climbed the west face of Adams.<ref name=WestAscent/> This route is straightforward, but made difficult by [[icefall]]s, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.<ref name=Hazard/>\n\nSome of the caves around Adams were subject to commercial ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] in years of short supply elsewhere.<ref name=CondonCaves/> Oddly, a \"claim\" to the cave using mining laws was used in order to gain exclusive access to the ice.<ref name=IceCaveWA/> [[Cheese Cave]] was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, for a number of years in the 1950s, a [[bleu cheese]] similar to the [[Roquefort]] produced in [[Roquefort-sur-Soulzon]], France.<ref name=Caldwell1953/><ref name=Cheese/><ref name=Halliday/> A legend from the [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]]s regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the \"mouse-wife,\" they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man's wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she dug out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the \"mouse-wife\" to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.<ref name=Meany1/>\n\nAdams was the feature of a 1915 documentary \"When the Mountains Call.\" This film documented the journey from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] to the summit and showed many of the sights along the way.<ref name=Movie/>\n\n===Forest Service operations===\n[[File:Gotchen Creek Guard Station.jpg|thumb|left|Gotchen Creek Guard Station ca. 1911]]\nAdams and the lands surrounding it were initially set aside as part of the [[Mount Rainier Forest Reserve]] under the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] in 1897. Eight years later, in 1905, the Bureau of Forestry, later the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], was created under the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and all the Forest Reserves were transferred to the new agency. In 1907, the Forest Reserves were renamed to National Forests and in 1908, the [[Rainier National Forest]] was divided among three Forests. The southern half became the [[Columbia National Forest]]. The name was changed in 1949 to honor the first Chief of the Forest, [[Gifford Pinchot]]. In 1964, the lands around Mount Adams were set aside as a wilderness.<ref name=GPNF_History/>\n\nAdams is home to the oldest building on the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]], the Gotchen Creek Guard Station just south of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Built in 1909, it served as the administrative headquarters of the Mount Adams District until 1916. It was built along a major grazing trail to allow for easy monitoring of the thousands of sheep grazed on the lower slopes. Later, in the 1940s, as the amount of grazing decreased, the station housed the Forest Guards responsible for the area.<ref name=EarToTheGround/> In 2008, it was wrapped in protective foil as a precautionary method to shield it from a large [[wildfire]], the [[Cold Springs Fire]], although fire crews were able to stop the fire before it got too close. Wildfires in 2012 ([[Cascade Creek Fire]]) and 2015 ([[Cougar Creek Fire]]) also required this precaution, and fire crews were able to stop them as well.<ref name=mailonline/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams Lookout.jpg|thumb|right|US Forest Service lookout on the summit, August 9, 1922.]]\nIn 1916, the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] began preparations to establish the highest [[Fire lookout tower|fire lookout]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] at the top of Adams. This was part of an endeavor that began in 1915 on [[Mount Hood]]<ref name=HoodLO/> and 1916 on [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]]<ref name=StHelensLO/> The idea was to situate lookouts far above all low-lying hills and mountains to give the lookouts an immense area for observation without obstructions. Being at {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, the new lookout would also be the third highest in the world and still is.<ref name=showtell/> In 1917, building materials were moved to the base of the mountain and in 1918, Dan Lewis packed the building materials and lumber to the lower portion of Suksdorf Ridge.<ref name=WALookouts/><ref name=MtnMen/> The following summer was spent hauling the building materials to the top.<ref name=WALookouts/><ref name=MtnMen/> The four men assigned the job, Arthur \"Art\" Jones, Adolph Schmid, Julius Wang, and Jessie Robbins, had a difficult task ahead of them until they engineered a way to quickly and, for the most part, safely bring the building materials up the slope using a deadman/rope technique.<ref name=MtnMen/> Construction of the standard D-6 building with a \u00bc second story cupola<ref name=Abegg/> began in the summer of 1920 and was completed a year later by Art, Adolph, James Huffman and Joe Guler.<ref name=Rusk/> It was manned as a lookout during the last year of its construction through 1924. After which it was abandoned because of the difficulties of operating a [[fire lookout tower|lookout]] that high and because lower level clouds, smoke, and haze frequently and effectively blocked the view of the lower elevations. Arthur Jones was likely the one person most involved in the project, spending five seasons on the mountain. Others who worked on the project or staffed the lookout include Rudolph Deitrich, the last [[fire lookout|lookout]], and Chaffin \"Chafe\" Johnson.<ref name=MtnMen/>\n\nAfter the [[fire lookout tower|lookout]] at the summit was abandoned, the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] changed strategies from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as [[airplane]]s became the cheaper method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate.<ref name=WashingtonLO/><ref name=SWWALO/> One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer<ref name=BurleyMtn/> and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending.<ref name=Abegg/><ref name=ORLive/> Two lookouts remain nearby on the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]]. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high [[National Fire Danger Rating System|fire danger]].<ref name=Abegg/>\n\n===Sulfur mine===\nIn 1929, Wade Dean formed the Glacier Mining Company and filed [[mining claim]]s to the [[sulfur]] on Adams' {{convert|210|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} summit plateau. Beginning in 1932, the first assessment work was done. The initial test pits were dug by hand, but this proved to be dangerous work and an alternative was needed to drill through the up to {{convert|210|ft|m}} thick ice cap more safely. The answer was a diamond tipped drilling machine, but, being a heavy machine, it could not be carried up the newly completed horse and mule trail like other supplies. So it winched itself up the mountain using a series of deadman anchors. 168 pack string trips led by John Perry were made over the course of the mining activities. The crew stayed in the abandoned [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] [[fire lookout tower|lookout]], a tight fit for the usual eight men and their equipment. This problem was alleviated somewhat in the later years of the project when an enclosed {{convert|8|by|12|ft|m}} [[lean-to]] was added to the cabin. Another smaller lean-to was added later. The conditions and weather above {{convert|12000|ft|m}} could be incredibly variable with the highest temperature of {{convert|110|F|C}} recorded 12 hours before the lowest temperature of {{convert|-48|F|C}}. This preliminary mining continued for several years until 1937 when the last crew worked from the summit lookout. In the years following, Dean periodically attempted to restart this venture and in 1946, he and Lt. John Hodgkins made several landings by airplane on the summit [[ice cap]]. Although sulfur was found, the amount of the ore that was able to be mined in a season was only enough to make up the cost of getting it off the mountain and was not enough to be competitive. Part of this stemmed from Dean's desire that if operations were expanded, an ore as well as passenger transport system was needed, and his desire that Adams not be significantly scarred by the operation. The project was fully abandoned in 1959.<ref name=MtnMen/>  Adams is the only large [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=\"Vallance\"/>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Level IV ecoregions, Cascades.png|thumb|upright|Level IV ecoregions, Cascades]]\nBecause of its remote location and relative inaccessibility, [[Climate Data Records|climate records]] are poor.

Although snowfall is not measured directly, it can be estimated from the [[Snow#Snowfall measurement|snow depth]]; and since the Potato Hill station was upgraded to report daily snow depth in 2006, there has been an average of {{convert|210|in|cm}} of snow every year. Also since 2006, the most snow to fall in a day was {{convert|28|in|cm}} (Feb 26, 2011), in a month, {{convert|92|in|cm}} (Dec 2007), and in a year, {{convert|288|in|cm}} (2012).<ref name=PHWeather/>\n\n[[File:Lenticular clouds over Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|left|Towering [[lenticular cloud]]s over Mount Adams]]\nBy April, there is, on average, {{convert|89|in|cm}} of snow on the ground at Potato Hill.<ref name=PHWeather/> The average monthly snow depth at Potato Hill has not changed much from the records collected from 1950\u20131976 with only a small decrease in January, February, and May and a small increase in March and April.

These two stations average a greater amount of snow than Potato Hill, with an average of {{convert|102|in|cm}} at Council Pass and {{convert|141|in|cm}} at Divide Meadow by April. Divide Meadow generally receives the most snow with a record depth of {{convert|222|in|cm}} in 1972. The [[snowpack]] at Potato Hill starts building in late October to early November and the last of the snow generally melts by the beginning of June, but occasionally lingers into July.<ref name=snowdepth/>\n\n[[Temperature]]s and [[precipitation]] can be highly variable around Adams, due in part to its geographic location astride the Cascade Crest, which gives it more of a [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP D: Continental.2Fmicrothermal climates|continental]] influence than some of its neighbors.

[[climate]] of Adams gives it a large amount of diversity within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, [[Abies grandis|grand fir]] and [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|Douglas fir]] dominate the forest with [[Tsuga heterophylla|Western hemlock]] and [[Thuja plicata|Western red cedar]] as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] are dominant with some patches of dense [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]]. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by [[Abies amabilis|Pacific silver fir]] and [[Abies procera|noble fir]]; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases, the forest changes again with [[Abies lasiocarpa|subalpine fir]], [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]], and [[Tsuga mertensiana|mountain hemlock]] becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant [[Pinus albicaulis|whitebark pine]] and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are [[Pinus monticola|Western white pine]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]], [[Larix occidentalis|Western larch]], [[Taxus brevifolia|Pacific yew]], [[Cupressus nootkatensis|Alaska cedar]], and [[Juniperus communis|mountain juniper]]. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species [[Acer macrophyllum|big leaf maple]], [[Quercus garryana|Oregon white oak]], [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspen]], [[Populus trichocarpa|black cottonwood]], and [[Alnus rubra|red alder]]. Large shrubs/small trees include the [[Betula glandulosa|dwarf birch]], [[Crataegus suksdorfii|Suksdorf's hawthorn]], [[Corylus cornuta|California hazelnut]], [[Prunus emarginata|bitter cherry]], [[Acer circinatum|vine maple]], [[Acer glabrum|Douglas maple]], and [[Sambucus cerulea|blue elderberry]] and contribute to a vibrant fall display.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=flora2/>\n\n[[Big Tree (Washington)|Big Tree]], (also known as Trout Lake Big Tree), is a massive [[Ponderosa pine|ponderosa]] pine tree in majestic, [[old growth]] pine and fir forests at the southern base of Mount Adams.<ref name=\"trails1\"/> The tree rises to a lofty {{convert|202|ft|m}}<ref name=\"richard1\"/>  with a diameter of {{convert|7|ft|m}},<ref name=\"FSBigTree\"/> and is one of the largest known ponderosa pine trees in the world.<ref name=\"trails1\"/> As of 2015, however, the tree has been stressed by attacks from [[Bark beetle|pine beetle]]s.<ref name=\"FSBigTree\"/>\n\nThe large diversity of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the [[Herbaceous plant|herbage]] and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is more than any other mountain in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by [[Wilhelm Nikolaus Suksdorf|William Suksdorf]] and [[Thomas J. Howell (botanist)|Thomas Howell]] and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts.<ref name=flora/> This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed.<ref name=flora2/> Adams is home to many rare plants including [[Actaea elata|tall bugbane]], [[Mimulus suksdorfii|Suksdorf's monkeyflower]], northern microseris (''[[Microceris borealis]]''), Brewer's potentilla (''[[Potentilla breweri]]''), and [[Sisyrinchium sarmentosum|mountain blue-eyed grass]].<ref name=flora2/> The plant diversity is most evident in the many [[meadow]]s and [[wetland]]s on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, [[Castilleja parviflora|magenta paintbrush]], [[Senecio triangularis|arrowleaf ragwort]], [[penstemon]]s, [[Lupinus|lupine]]s, [[Mimulus|monkeyflower]]s, [[Phyllodoce (plant)|mountain heather]]s, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find [[Vaccinium uliginosum|bog blueberry]], [[Viburnum edule|highbush cranberry]], [[Drosera anglica|sundew]], [[Comarum palustre|purple cinquefoil]], and [[Utricularia intermedia|flatleaf bladderwort]], in addition to many [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and [[Juncaceae|rush]]es. [[Montane ecology#Subalpine zone|Subalpine]] and [[Montane ecology#Alpine grasslands and tundra|alpine]] meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a display as well with [[Luetkea|partrigefoot]], Cascade [[Boechera|rockcress]], [[subalpine buttercup]], [[Valeriana sitchensis|Sitka valerian]], [[Smelowskia ovalis|alpine false candytuft]], [[Polemonium elegans|elegant Jacob's ladder]], and various [[Polygonaceae|buckwheat]]s as prominent players.<ref name=Friends/>\n\n===Fauna===\n[[File:Hoary marmot Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|[[Hoary marmot]] above the tree line on Adams]]\nAdams is home to a fairly wide variety of animal species. Several [[hoofed mammals]] call the mountain home: [[mountain goat]]s, [[Roosevelt elk]], [[black-tailed deer]], and [[mule deer]]. Large carnivores include [[cougar]], [[American black bear|black bear]], [[coyote]], [[bobcat]], and the [[Red fox#Subspecies|Cascade mountain fox]],<ref name=CCP/> an endemic subspecies of the [[red fox]]. There have also been sightings of [[wolverine]]<ref name=CCP/><ref name=Wolverine_Oregonian /> and unconfirmed reports of [[Gray wolf|wolves]].<ref name=WDFWWolf/> Many small mammals also make Adams their home. [[Squirrel]]s and [[chipmunk]]s are numerous throughout the forest. [[Douglas squirrel]]s, [[least chipmunk]]s, and [[Townsend's chipmunk]]s live throughout the forest with [[golden-mantled ground squirrel]]s and [[California ground squirrel]]s occupying drier areas as well. These squirrels are preyed upon by the elusive and secretive [[pine marten]]s that also call Adams their home. [[Hoary marmot]]s and [[pika]]s make their home on open rocky areas at any altitude while the elusive [[snowshoe hare]] lives throughout the forest.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=CCP/><ref name=Lyman3/><ref name=animals/>\n\nThe profusion of wildflowers attracts a large number of [[pollinator]]s including [[butterflies]] such as [[Parnassius|Apollos]], ''[[Melitaea]]'', ''[[Coenonympha]]'', [[Neophasia menapia|snowflakes]], [[Painted lady|painted ladies]], [[Pieris (butterfly)|garden whites]], [[Papilio|swallowtails]], [[Skipper (butterfly)|skippers]], [[Limenitis|admirals]], [[Coliadinae|sulphurs]], [[Lycaenidae|blues]], and [[List of fritillaries (butterflies)|fritillaries]].<ref name=animals/><ref name=Butterflies/>\n\n[[File:Gray-crowned rosy finch Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|left|[[Grey-crowned rosy finch|Gray-crowned rosy finch]] high up the slopes on Adams]]\nMany birds call Adams home or a stopover on their migration routes. Songbirds include three species of [[chickadee]], two [[kinglet]]s, several [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]]es, [[warbler]]s, [[American sparrow|sparrow]]s, and [[finch]]es. One unique [[songbird]] to the high elevations is the [[grey-crowned rosy finch|gray-crowned rosy finch]], who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. [[Raptor (bird)|Raptors]] that live in the forest and meadows include ''[[Accipiter]]''s, [[red-tailed hawk]]s, [[golden eagle|golden]] and [[bald eagle]]s, [[osprey]]s, [[great horned owl]]s, and [[falcon]]s. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the [[hairy woodpecker]], [[downy woodpecker]], and [[white-headed woodpecker]]. Jays such as the [[Steller's jay]] and [[Canada jay]] are common and the Canada jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the [[Clark's nutcracker]] with its distinctive call. [[Swallow]]s and [[swift]]s are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. [[Common merganser]]s and several other species of [[water bird]]s can be found on many of the lakes as well. The [[American dipper]] with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several [[grouse]] species, the [[sooty grouse|sooty]], [[spruce grouse|spruce]], and [[ruffed grouse]] and the [[white-tailed ptarmigan]], call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=animals/><ref name=MountaineerBirds/>\n\nThe streams and lakes around Adams offer a number of [[fish]] for the [[Angling|angler]] to seek out. The two most common species, [[eastern brook trout]] and [[rainbow trout]] ([[Columbia River redband trout]]), are in nearly every lake and stream. [[Brown trout]] and [[cutthroat trout]] appear in most of the lakes in the [[Midway High Lakes Area|High Lakes Area]] and three lakes are home to [[tiger trout]]. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species of [[trout]].<ref name=WDFWFish/> [[Bull trout]] can be found in the upper reaches of the [[Klickitat River|Klickitat]] and [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]]s.<ref name=FSFishing/><ref name=YKFP/> [[Westslope cutthroat trout]] can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat trout are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the [[Cispus River]]. [[mountain whitefish|Whitefish]] can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers.<ref name=FSFishing/><ref name=YKFP/> Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and [[Cowlitz River]]s, falls on the [[White Salmon River]]), the only river where [[anadromous fish]]es can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River.

It is the second-highest [[mountain]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], after [[Mount Rainier]].<ref name=CAG/>\n\nAdams, [[#Exploration|named for]] President [[John Adams]], is a member of the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]], and is one of the arc's largest volcanoes,<ref name=\"Scott\"/> located in a remote wilderness approximately {{convert|34|mi|km|0}} east of [[Mount St. Helens]].<ref name=Wood1990/> The [[Mount Adams Wilderness]] consists of the upper and western part of the volcano's cone. The eastern side of the mountain is designated as part of the territory of the [[Yakama Nation]].<ref name=\"Mt. Adams Wilderness\"/><ref name=YNSite/>\n\nAdams' asymmetrical and broad body rises {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} above the Cascade crest. Its nearly flat summit was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. The [[Pacific Crest Trail]] traverses the western flank of the mountain.<ref name=USFSAdamsPCT/><ref name=USFSPCTWA/>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===General===\n[[File:Mt Adams from south - Wasco County Oregon.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Adams from [[Wasco County, Oregon]]]]\n\nMount Adams stands {{convert|37|mi|km}} east of [[Mount St. Helens]] and about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south of [[Mount Rainier]]. It is {{convert|30|mi|km}} north of the [[Columbia River]] and {{convert|55|mi|km}} north of [[Mount Hood]] in [[Oregon]]. The nearest major cities are [[Yakima]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} to the northeast, and the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] metropolitan area, {{convert|60|mi|km}} to the southwest. Between half and two thirds of Adams is within the [[Mount Adams Wilderness]] of the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]]. The remaining area is within the [[Mount Adams Recreation Area]] of the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]]. While many of the volcanic peaks in Oregon are located on the Cascade Crest, Adams is the only active volcano in Washington to do so. It is farther east than all the rest of Washington's volcanoes except [[Glacier Peak]].<ref name=CVO_Adams/>\n\nAdams is one of the long-lived [[stratovolcano|volcano]]es in the [[Cascade Range]], with minor activity beginning 900,000 years ago and major cone building activity beginning 520,000 years ago. The whole mountain has been completely eroded by glaciers to an elevation of {{convert|8200|ft|m}} twice during its lifetime. The  current cone was built during the most recent major eruptive period 40,000\u201310,000 years ago.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=Simcoes/>\n\nStanding at {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, Adams towers about {{convert|9800|ft|m}} over the surrounding countryside. It is the second-highest mountain in Washington and third-highest in the [[Cascade Range]]. Because of the way it developed, it is the largest stratovolcano in Washington and second-largest in the Cascades, behind only [[Mount Shasta]]. Its large size is reflected in its {{convert|18|mi|km}}-diameter base, which has a prominent north-south trending axis.<ref name=CVO_Adams/>\n\n[[File:Meadows at Mount Adams Wilderness 03.JPG|thumbnail|left|Meadows at Mount Adams Wilderness]]\nAdams is the source of the headwaters for two major rivers, the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] and [[White Salmon River]]. The many streams that emanate from the glaciers and from springs at its base flow into two more major river systems, the [[Cispus River]] and the [[Klickitat River]]. The streams on the north and west portions of Adams feed the Cispus River, which joins the [[Cowlitz River]] near [[Riffe Lake]], and the Lewis River.\n\nTo the south, the White Salmon River has its source on the lower flanks of the west side of Adams and gains additional flows from streams along the southwest side of the mountain. Streams on the east side all flow to the Klickitat River. Streams on all sides, at some point in their courses, provide essential [[irrigation]] water for [[farming]] and [[ranching]]. The [[Klickitat River|Klickitat]] and [[White Salmon River|White Salmon]] rivers are nearly completely free flowing, with only small barriers to aid irrigation (White Salmon)<ref name=Haring/> and [[Check dam|erosion control]] (Klickitat).<ref name=Keller/><ref name=KH_DEIS/> The [[Cispus River|Cispus]] and [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis]] rivers have been [[Dam|impounded]] with dams farther downstream for [[flood control]] and [[hydroelectricity|power generation]] purposes.\n\nMount Adams is the second-most isolated, in terms of access, stratovolcano in Washington; [[Glacier Peak]] is the most isolated. Only two major highways pass close to it. [[U.S. Route 12|Highway 12]] passes about 25 miles to the north of Adams through the Cascades. [[Washington State Route 141|Highway 141]] comes within 13 miles of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the [[Columbia River]] to the small town of [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]]. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to get closer to the mountain. The main access roads, FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Most all other roads are gravel or dirt, with varying degrees of maintenance.<ref name=CowlitzValleyRec/><ref name=AdamsRec/> Access to the [[Mount Adams Recreation Area]] is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles.<ref name=YNRecArea/> Two small towns, [[Glenwood, Klickitat County, Washington|Glenwood]] and [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]], are located in valleys less than 15 miles from the summit, Glenwood on the southeast quarter and Trout Lake on the southwest quarter.\n\nIts size and distance from major cities, and the tendency of some people to forget or ignore Mount Adams, has led some people to call this volcano \"The Forgotten Giant of Washington.\"<ref name=Harris/>{{rp|237}}\n\nOn a clear day from the summit, other visible volcanoes in the [[Cascade Range]] include [[Mount Rainier]], [[Mount Baker]], and [[Glacier Peak]] to the north, [[Mount St. Helens]] to the west, all in Washington; and [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]], [[Three Sisters (Oregon)|the Three Sisters]], [[Mount Thielsen]], [[Mount Scott (Klamath County, Oregon)|Mount Scott]], [[Diamond Peak (Oregon)|Diamond Peak]], and [[Mount McLoughlin]], all to the south in [[Oregon]].<ref name=WTAClimbTR/><ref name=Lyman1/>\n\n===Summit area===\nContrary to legend, the flatness of Adams' current summit area is not due to the loss of the volcano's peak. Instead it was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. A false summit, Pikers Peak, rises {{convert|11657|ft|m|sigfig=4}} on the south side of the nearly half-mile (800 m) wide summit area. The true summit is about {{convert|600|ft|m|sigfig=2}} higher on the gently sloping north side. A small lava and [[scoria]] cone marks the highest point. Suksdorf Ridge is a long buttress descending from the false summit to an elevation of {{convert|8000|ft|m|sigfig=1}}. This structure was built by repeated lava flows in the late [[Pleistocene]]. The Pinnacle forms the northwest false summit and was created by erosion from the Adams and White Salmon glaciers. On the east side, The Castle is a low prominence at the top of Battlement Ridge. The summit crater is filled with snow and is open on its west rim.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n{{wide image|Mount Adams Summit Panorama.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view from the relatively flat summit area of Mount Adams, with the center of the image looking due west towards Mount St. Helens. Six [[Cascade Volcanoes]] are visible (not including Adams itself). From left to right: [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]], [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount St. Helens]], [[Mount Rainier]], [[Mount Baker]], and [[Glacier Peak]].}}\n\n===Flank terrain features===\nProminent ridges descend from the mountain on all sides. On the north side, the aptly named North Cleaver comes down from a point below the summit [[ice cap]] heading almost due north. The Northwest Ridge and West Ridge descend from the Pinnacle, to the northwest and west, respectively. Stagman Ridge descends west-southwest from a point about halfway up the west side and turns more southwest at about {{convert|6000|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. South of Stagman Ridge lies Crofton Ridge. Crofton gradually becomes very broad as it descends southwesterly from the tree line. MacDonald Ridge, on the south side, starts at about tree line below the lower end of Suksdorf Ridge and descends in a southerly direction.\n\nThree prominent ridges descend from the east side of the mountain. The Ridge of Wonders is farthest south and ends at an area away from the mountain called The Island. Battlement Ridge is very rugged and descends from high on the mountain. The farthest ridge north on the east side, Victory Ridge, descends from a lower elevation on the mountain than Battlement Ridge beneath the precipitous Roosevelt Cliff. Lava Ridge, starting at about the same location as the North Cleaver, descends slightly east of north.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/>\n\nSeveral rock prominences exist on the lower flanks of Adams. The Spearhead is an abrupt rocky prominence near the bottom of Battlement Ridge. Burnt Rock, The Hump, and The Bumper are three smaller rocky prominences at or below the tree line on the west side.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/>\n\n===Glaciers===\n[[File:Mt. Adams Glaciers above Bird Creek Meadows.JPG|thumb|Heavily crevassed glaciers on the southeast side of the mountain]]\n[[File:USGS Glaciers of Mount Adams Map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.45|Glaciers of Mount Adams]]\n\nIn the early 21st century, glaciers cover a total of 2.5% of Adams' surface. During the last [[ice age]] about 90% of the mountain was glaciated. Mount Adams has 209 perennial snow and ice features and 12 officially named glaciers. The total ice-covered area makes up {{convert|9.3|sqmi|km2}}, while the area of named glaciers is {{convert|7.7|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Glaciers of Washington\"/>  Most of the largest remaining glaciers (including the [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams]], [[Klickitat Glacier|Klickitat]], [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]], and [[White Salmon River|White Salmon]]) originate from Adams' summit ice cap.<ref name=Guardians/><ref name=Reid1/>\n\nOn the northwest face of the mountain, [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]] cascades down a steep channel in a series of [[icefall]]s before spreading out and terminating at around the {{convert|7000|ft|m|sigfig=3}} elevation, where it becomes the source of the Lewis River and Adams Creek, a tributary of the [[Cispus River]].<ref name=Guardians/> Its eastern lobe ends at a small glacial [[tarn (lake)|tarn]], Equestria Lake. In the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], Adams Glacier is second in size only to [[Carbon Glacier]] on [[Mount Rainier]].<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=\"Wood\"/><ref name=Treser/>\n\n[[File:Upper Portion of the Adams Glacier.JPG|thumb|Deep crevasses and icefalls on Adams Glacier]]\n\nThe [[Pinnacle Glacier (Mount Adams)|Pinnacle]], [[White Salmon Glacier (Mount Adams)|White Salmon]], and [[Avalanche Glacier|Avalanche]] glaciers on the west side of the mountain are less thick and voluminous, and are generally patchy in appearance. They all originate from [[cirques|glacial cirques]] below the actual summit. Although the White Salmon Glacier does not originate from the summit [[ice cap]], it does begin very high on the mountain at about {{convert|11600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. In the early 1900s, a portion of it descended from the summit ice cap,<ref name=Reid1/> but volume loss has separated it. Some of its glacial ice feeds the Avalanche Glacier below it to the southwest while the rest tumbles over some large cliffs to its diminutive lower section to the west. The White Salmon and Avalanche Glaciers feed the many streams of the Salt Creek and Cascade Creek drainages, which flow into the [[White Salmon River]]. The Pinnacle Glacier is the source of a fork of the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] as well as Riley Creek, which is also a tributary of the Lewis River.<ref name=AdamsW/><ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe south side of the mountain along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small [[Gotchen Glacier]] and the [[Crescent Glacier (Mount Adams)|Crescent Glacier]]. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the [[White Salmon River]].<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe rugged east side has four glaciers, the [[Mazama Glacier (Mount Adams)|Mazama Glacier]], [[Klickitat Glacier]], [[Rusk Glacier]], and the [[Wilson Glacier (Mount Adams)|Wilson Glacier]]. During the last [[Ice Age]], they carved out two immense canyons: the Hellroaring Canyon and the Avalanche Valley. This created the Ridge of Wonders between the two. Of the four glaciers on the east side, the Mazama Glacier is the farthest south and begins between the Suksdorf Ridge and Ridge of Wonders at about {{convert|10500|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. Near its terminus, it straddles the Ridge of Wonders and a small portion feeds into the Klickitat Glacier. The glacier gains more area from additional glacier ice that collects from drifting snow and avalanches below the Suksdorf Ridge as the ridge turns south. The Mazama Glacier terminates at about {{convert|8000|ft|m|sigfig=3}} and is the source of Hellroaring Creek, which flows over several waterfalls before it joins Big Muddy Creek. [[Klickitat Glacier]] on the volcano's eastern flank originates in a {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} wide [[cirque]] and is fed by two smaller glaciers from the summit ice cap. It terminates around {{convert|6600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}, where it becomes the source of Big Muddy Creek, a tributary of the [[Klickitat River]]. The Rusk Glacier does not start from the summit ice cap, but starts at {{convert|10500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} below the Roosevelt Cliff and is fed by avalanching snow and ice from the summit cap. It is enclosed on the south by Battlement Ridge and Victory Ridge on the north and terminates at about {{convert|7100|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. It is the source of Rusk Creek, which flows over two waterfalls before joining the Big Muddy on its way to the Klickitat. The Wilson Glacier, like the Rusk Glacier, starts below the Roosevelt Cliff and is fed by avalanching snow and ice; however, the Wilson Glacier starts slightly higher at about {{convert|10800|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. It is also fed by an arm of the Lyman Glacier as it flows down from the summit ice cap. The Wilson Glacier terminates at {{convert|7500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} where it is the source of Little Muddy Creek, another tributary of the Klickitat.<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe north side is distinguished by two major glaciers, the [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]] and [[Lava Glacier|Lava]] Glaciers. Like the [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]], the Lyman Glacier is characterized by deep [[crevasse]]s and many [[icefall]]s as it cascades down from the summit [[ice cap]].<ref name=Guardians/> It is divided into two arms by a very rugged ridge at {{convert|10200|ft|m|sigfig=3}} and terminates at {{convert|7400|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. The [[Lava Glacier]] originates in a large cirque below the summit at about {{convert|10000|ft|m|sigfig=3}}, sandwiched between the North Cleaver on the west and the Lava Ridge to the east. It terminates at about {{convert|7600|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. The Lava and Lyman Glaciers are the source of the Muddy Fork of the [[Cispus River]].<ref name=AdamsE/><ref name=\"Glaciers of Washington\"/><ref name=Treser/>\n\nThe total glacier area on Mount Adams decreased 49%, from {{convert|31.5|km2|order=flip}} to {{convert|16.2|km2|order=flip}}, between 1904 and 2006, with the greatest loss occurring before 1949. Since 1949, the total glacier area has been relatively stable with a small amount of decline since the 1990s.<ref name=Treser/><ref name=\"Sitts\"/>\n\n===Surrounding area===\n[[File:Mt. Adams from the south.JPG|left|thumb|Aerial view of the south face from across the [[Columbia River Gorge]]]]\nMount Adams is surrounded by a variety of other volcanic features and [[volcano]]es. It stands near the center of a north-south trending volcanic field that is about {{convert|4|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|30|mi|km}} long, from just south of the [[Goat Rocks]] to Guler Mountain, the vent farthest south in the field. This field includes over 120 vents; about 25 of these are considered flank volcanoes of Mount Adams. The largest flank volcano is a [[basalt]]ic [[shield volcano]] on Adams east base called Goat Butte. This structure is at least 150,000&nbsp;years old.\nLittle Mount Adams is a symmetrical [[cinder cone]] on top of the Ridge of Wonders on Adams' southeast flank.<ref name=AdamsNatHistory/>\n\nPotato Hill is a cinder cone on Adams' north side that was created in the late [[Pleistocene]] and stands {{convert|800|ft|m|sigfig=2}} above its lava plain.<ref name=\"MZ\"/>\nLavas from its base flowed into the Cispus Valley where they were later modified by glaciers.  At the {{convert|7500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} level on Adams' south flank is South Butte. The lavas associated with this structure are all younger than Suksdorf Ridge but were emplaced before the end of the last ice age.<ref name=\"MZ\"/>\n[[File:Simulating Trout Lake, Klickitat County, Washington.jpg|thumbnail|right|Trout Lake (Trout Lake Creek) reflecting Mount Adams near the small town of Trout Lake]]\n\nSeveral relatively young obvious lava flows exist in the area around Adams. Most of these flows are on the north side of the mountain and include the flow in the Mutton Creek area, Devils Garden, the Takh Takh Meadows Flow, and the much larger Muddy Fork Lava Flow to the north of Devils Garden. Only one obvious flow appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nThe many other vents and volcanoes encompassed by the Mount Adams field include Glaciate Butte and Red Butte on the north, King Mountain, Meadow Butte, Quigley Butte, and Smith Butte on the south, with others interspersed throughout.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nLocated a few miles north of Adams is [[Goat Rocks Wilderness]] and the heavily eroded ruins of a [[stratovolcano]] that is much older than Adams. Unlike Adams, the [[Goat Rocks]] volcano was periodically explosive and deposited [[volcanic ash|ash]] 2.5&nbsp;million years ago that later solidified into {{convert|2100|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=2}} thick [[tuff]] layers.<ref name=CascadesVolcanosObservatory/>\n\nIn the area surrounding Mount Adams, many caves have formed around inactive lava vents.<ref name=Lyman1/>  These caves are usually close to the surface and can be hundreds of feet deep and wide.<ref name=NYTCaves/> A few of the more well known caves include the [[Cheese Cave]], Ice Cave, and Deadhorse Caves. Cheese Cave has the largest bore of the caves near Adams with a diameter of {{convert|40|-|50|ft|m}} and a length of over {{convert|2000|ft|m}}.<ref name=Caldwell1953/> Ice cave, which is made up of several sections created by several [[sinkhole]]s, has an ice section that is {{convert|120|ft|m}} long and {{convert|20|-|30|ft|m}} in diameter and noted for its ice formations.<ref name=Lyman2/><ref name=AdamsOuting1913/> From the same entrance, the tube continues another {{convert|500|ft|m}} to the west.<ref name=IceCaveWA/><ref name=CavesOfWA/> Deadhorse Cave is a massive network of lava tubes. It the most complex [[lava tube]] in the United States with {{convert|14441|ft|m}} of passage.<ref name=OregonGrotto/> These caves are all just outside of [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]]. These and many other caves in the Trout Lake area were at one time part of a huge system that originated at the [[Indian Heaven]] [[volcanic field]]. The most obscure caves around Adams are the Windholes on the southeast side near Island Cabin Campground.<ref name=windholes/>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Takh Takh Lava Flow.png|thumb|Takh Takh Lava Flow below Mount Adams]]\nAdams is made of several overlapping cones that together form an {{convert|18|mi|km|0|adj=on}} diameter base which is elongated in its north-south axis and covers an area of {{convert|250|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. The volcano has a volume of {{convert|70|cumi|km3|sigfig=2}} placing it second only to [[Mount Shasta]] in that category among the [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] stratovolcanoes.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>  Mount Adams was created by the subduction of the [[Juan de Fuca plate]], which is located just off the coast of the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name=Harris/>\n\nMount Adams was born in the mid to late [[Pleistocene]] and grew in several pulses of mostly [[lava]]-extruding eruptions. Each eruptive cycle was separated from one another by long periods of dormancy and minor activity, during which, [[glacier]]s eroded the mountain to below {{convert|9000|ft|m}}. [[Potassium-argon dating]] has identified three such eruptive periods; the first occurring 520,000&nbsp;to 500,000 years ago, the second 450,000&nbsp;years ago, and the third 40,000&nbsp;to 10,000 years ago.<ref name=Harris/> Most of these eruptions and therefore most of the [[volcano]], consist of [[lava flows]] with little [[tephra]]. The loose material that makes up much of Adams' core is made of [[breccia]]ted lava.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[Andesite]] and [[basalt]] flows formed a {{convert|20|to|200|ft|m|sigfig=1|adj=on}} thick circle around the base of the Mount Adams, and filled existing depressions and ponded in valleys. Most of the volcano is made of andesite together with handful of [[dacite]] and [[pyroclastic flow]]s which erupted early in Adams' development. The present main cone was built when Adams was capped by a glacier system in the last [[ice age]]. The lava that erupted was shattered when it came in contact with the ice and the cone interior is therefore made of easily [[erosion|eroded]] [[andesite]] fragments. Since its construction, constant emissions of heat and caustic gases have transformed much of the rock into [[clay]]s (mostly [[kaolinite]]), [[iron oxide]]s, [[sulfur]]-rich compounds and [[quartz]].<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/>\n\nThe present eruptive cone above {{convert|7000|ft|m}} was constructed sometime between 40,000&nbsp;to 10,000 years ago. Since that time the volcano has erupted at least ten times, generally from above {{convert|6500|ft|m}}. One of the more recent flows issued from South Butte and created the {{convert|4.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} wide A.G. Aiken Lava Bed. This flow looks young but has 3,500-year-old [[Mount St. Helens]] ash on it, meaning it is at least that old.<ref name=\"Wright\"/> Of a similar age are the Takh Takh Meadows and Muddy Fork lava flows. The lowest vent to erupt since the main cone was constructed is Smith Butte on the south slope of Adams. The last lava known to have erupted from Adams is an approximately 1000-year-old flow that emerged from a vent at about {{convert|8200|ft|m}} on Battlement Ridge.<ref name=Harris/>\n[[File:Mount Adams Volcano Hazard Zones.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|Mount Adams, Washington simplified hazards map showing potential impact area for ground-based hazards during a volcanic event.]]\n\nThe Trout Lake Mudflow is the youngest large [[debris flow]] from Adams and the only large one since the end of the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]]. The flow dammed Trout Creek and covered {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} of the [[White Salmon River]] valley. Impounded water later formed Trout Lake. The Great Slide of 1921 started close to the headwall of the White Salmon Glacier and was the largest [[avalanche]] on Adams in historic time. The slide fell about {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} and its debris covered about {{convert|1|sqmi|km2|1}} of the upper Salt Creek area.<ref name=Slide/> Steam vents were reported active at the slide source for three years, leading to speculation that the event was started with a small steam explosion.<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/> This was the only debris flow in Mount Adams' recorded history, but there are five known lahars.<ref name=\"Vallance\"/>\n\nSince then, thermal anomalies (hot spots) and gas emissions (including [[hydrogen sulfide]]) have occurred especially on the summit plateau and indicate that Adams is [[Volcano#Dormant|dormant]], not [[Volcano#Extinct|extinct]]. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of [[andesite]] or [[basalt]]. Because the primary products were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams tend to have a low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens and some of the other Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone is little more than a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large [[landslide]]s and other debris flows.<ref name=\"Hoblitt\"/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams rock and ice debris avalanche.jpg|thumb|Rock and ice debris avalanche that occurred on October 20, 1997 on the east side of Mount Adams.]]\nIn 1997, Adams experienced two slides seven weeks apart that were the largest slides in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], ignoring the catastrophic [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|landslide eruption of Mount St. Helens]], since a slide that occurred on [[Little Tahoma]] in 1963.<ref name=avalanche/> The first occurred at the end of August and consisted of mainly snow and ice with some rock. It fell from a similar location and in a similar path to the slide of 1921. The second slide that year occurred in late October and originated high on Battlement Ridge just below The Castle. It consisted of mainly rock and flowed three miles down the [[Klickitat Glacier]] and the Big Muddy Creek streambed. Both slides were estimated to have moved as much as {{convert|6.5|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of material.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nThe [[Indian Heaven]] [[volcanic field]] is located between St. Helens and Adams and within the [[Indian Heaven Wilderness]]. Its principal feature is an {{convert|18|mi|km|0|adj=on}} long linear zone of [[shield volcano]]es, [[cinder cone]]s, and flows with volumes of up to {{convert|23|cumi|km3}} with the highest peak, [[Lemei Rock]]. The shield volcanoes, which form the backbone of the volcanic field, are located on the northern and southern sides of the field. Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams are on the western and the eastern sides.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\nTo the east, across the [[Klickitat River]], lies the [[Simcoe Mountains|Simcoe Mountains volcanic field]]. This area contains many small shield volcanoes and cinder cones of mainly [[alkali basalt|alkalic intraplate basalt]] with fractionated intermediate alkalic products, subordinate subalkaline [[mafic]] lavas, and several [[rhyolite]]s as secondary products. There are about 205 vents that were active between 4.2 million and 600 thousand years ago.<ref name=Simcoes/>\n\n[[Seismic activity]] around Adams is very low and it is one of the quietest volcanoes in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

According to the [[Bridge of the Gods (geologic event)|Bridge of the Gods]] tale, Wy'east ([[Mount Hood]]) and Pahto (Mount Adams; also called Paddo or Klickitat by native peoples) were the sons of the [[Great Spirit]]. The brothers both competed for the love of the beautiful La-wa-la-clough ([[Mount St. Helens]]). When La-wa-la-clough chose Pahto, Wy'east struck his brother hard so that Pahto's head was flattened and Wy'east took La-wa-la-clough from him (thus attempting to explain Adams' squat appearance).<ref name=Harris/> Other versions of the story state that losing La-wa-la-clough caused Pahto such grief that he dropped his head in shame.<ref name=Scott1997/><ref name=CVO_Volcano_Names/><ref name=Hill/>\n\nIn a legend from the [[Klickitat people|Klickitats]], the chief of the gods, Tyhee Saghalie, came to [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] with his two sons. The sons quarreled about who would settle where. To settle the dispute, Saghalie shot an arrow to the west and to the north and told his sons to find them and to settle where the arrows had fallen. So one settled in the [[Willamette Valley]] and the other in the area between the [[Yakima River|Yakima]] and [[Columbia River]]s and they became the ancestors of the [[Multnomah people|Multnomah]] and [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]] tribes respectively. To separate the tribes, Saghalie raised the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]]. He also created the \"[[Bridge of the Gods (land bridge)|Bridge of the Gods]]\" as a way for the tribes to meet with one another easily. A \"witch-woman,\" whose name was Loowit, lived on the bridge and had control of the only fire in the world. She wanted to give the tribes fire to improve their condition and Saghalie consented. He was so pleased with Loowit's faithfulness that he offered Loowit whatever she wanted. She asked for youth and beauty and Saghalie granted her wish. Suitors came from near and far until finally she could not decide between Klickitat and Wiyeast. Klickitat and Wiyeast went to war over the matter until finally Sahalie decided to punish them for creating such chaos. He broke the Bridge of the Gods and put the three lovers to death. However, in order to honor their beauty, he raised up three mountains: Wiyeast (Hood), Klickitat (Adams), and Loowit (St. Helens).<ref name=Guardians/><ref name=Lyman4/><ref name=Lyman5/><ref name=Lyman6/><ref name=ORNativeSon/>\n\nIn a similar legend from the [[Klickitat people|Klickitats]], there was a large inland sea between the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The Native Americans lived on the sea and each year they would hold two large powwows at [[Mount Multnomah]], one in the spring and one in the fall. The demigod Koyoda Spielei lived among them and settled disputes among the living things of the earth, including the mountains Pa-toe (Adams) and Yi-east ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]), sons of the [[Great Spirit]] Soclai Tyee. For many years, peace prevailed over the land. Then a beautiful squaw mountain moved to the valley between Pa-toe and Yi-east. She fell in love with Yi-east, but liked to flirt with Pa-toe. This caused the two mountains to quarrel with each other and it quickly escalated into an all out brawl. Ignoring Koyoda's calls for peace, they belched forth smoke and ash and threw hot rocks at each other. Some time later, they paused for a rest and discovered the catastrophe they had caused. The forests and meadows had been burnt to the ground and many animals and other living things had been killed. The earth had been shaken so severely that a hole had been created in the mountains and the sea had drained away and the [[Bridge of the Gods (land bridge)|Bridge of the Gods]] was formed. The squaw mountain had hid herself in a cave during the battle and because they could no longer find her, they were about to resume fighting. However, while they had been fighting, Koyoda went to Soclai and told him what was happening. Soclai arrived in time to stop them from resuming their quarrel. He decreed that the squaw mountain should remain in the cave forever and the Bridge of the Gods was to be a covenant of peace between the mountains that he would cause to fall if they ever resumed their quarrel. He also placed an ugly old woman, known as Loo-wit, as a mountain to guard the bridge and remind the brothers that beauty is never permanent. After many years, the signs of the great battle and the evidence of the inland sea had disappeared and there was happiness and contentment over the earth. The squaw mountain wished to come out of her cave and grew very lonely. In an effort to ease her loneliness, Soclai sent the Bats, a tribe of beautiful birds, to be her companions. Yi-east eventually learned that the Bats were her guardians and carried out secret communication with the squaw mountain through them. He befriended Loo-wit and crossed the bridge at night to meet with the squaw mountain. One night, he stayed too long and had to hurry to get back to his proper place. He caused the ground to shake so much in his haste that a large rock fell and blocked the entrance to the cave. When Soclai found this, he was furious with the Bats and punished them by turning them into bats that are seen today. He allowed the squaw mountain to remain out of the cave on her promise to be good, but would not allow her and Yi-east to be married, fearing the inevitable quarrel that might start again. He did promise to look for a mate for Pa-toe, hoping this would initiate a lasting peace. However, because of his many duties, he forgot this promise and the two mountains were only held in check by his threats. Eventually, when Soclai was in another part of the world, they resumed their quarrel and created chaos again. Their violence broke the Bridge of the Gods and destroyed the landscape again. Loo-wit, in her attempts to stop the two brothers, was badly burned and scarred; and when the bridge collapsed, she fell with it. Finally, Pa-toe won the battle and Yi-east admitted defeat. Soclai returned from where he had been, but he was too late to avert the disaster. He found Loo-wit and because she had been faithful in her guardianship, he rewarded her by giving her her greatest desire, youth and beauty. Having received this gift, she moved to the west side of the Cascades and remains there to this day as [[Mount St. Helens]]. Since Pa-toe won the battle, the squaw mountain belonged to him. She was heart broken, but took her place at his side. She soon fell at his feet and into a deep sleep from which she never awoke. She is now known as Sleeping Beauty. Pa-toe became so sad that he caused her deep sleep, he lowered his own head in remorse.<ref name=Sterrett/>\n\n[[File:Thunderbird on Totem Pole.jpg|thumb|upright|Thunderbird on a Totem Pole]]\nThe [[Yakama]]s also have a legend attempting to explain Adams' squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the [[Goat Rocks]]), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]], and [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]]. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now the first to be greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee ([[Three Sisters (Oregon)|the Three Sisters]]) convinced Wyeast ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken with the rest of the mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The [[Great Spirit]] had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.<ref name=WAHistoryOnline/>\n\nIn many of the legends of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]], there are [[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird]]s that live on them and Adams is no exception. This particular thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized the inhabitants of the land. Speelyi, the [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]] coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.<ref name=Lyman4/>\n\nSeveral other tribes have legends involving battles and disagreements between the great peaks. The [[Cowlitz people|Cowlitz]] and [[Chehalis people|Chehalis]] have a legend where [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]] and [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]] were female mountains and quarreled over Adams, the male mountain. In a different legend from the Cowlitz, St. Helens was the man and Pahto (Adams) and Takhoma (Rainier) were his wives and the two wives quarreled with each other. A thunderbird legend from the [[Yakama]]s has a terrific battle between the thunderbird, Enumklah, and his five wives, Tahoma (Rainier), Pahto (Adams), Ah-kee-kun ([[Mount Hood|Hood]]), Low-we-lat-Klah (St. Helens), and Simcoe. Pahto and Tahoma were badly beaten, Ah-kee-kun and Low-we-lat-Klah escaped without injury, and Simcoe suffered the greatest injury for starting the battle.<ref name=Clark/>\n\n===Exploration===\nAdams was known to the Native Americans as Pahto (with various spellings) and Klickitat. In various tribal languages ([[Plateau Penutian languages|Plateau Penutian]], [[Chinookan languages|Chinookan]], [[Salishan languages|Salishan]]), Pahto means ''high up'', ''very high'', ''standing up'', or ''high sloping mountain''.<ref name=ORNativeSonML/><ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/> The [[Klickitat people#Name|Klickitat name]] is of [[Sahaptin language#Dialects|Klickitat]] origin and comes from the [[Chinookan]] for ''beyond''.\n\nIn 1805, on the journey westward down the [[Columbia River|Columbia]], the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] recorded seeing the mountain; noting that it was \"a high mountain of emence hight covered with snow\"<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> and thought it \"perhaps the highest pinnacle in America.\"<ref name=Guardians/><ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> They initially misidentified it as [[Mount St. Helens]], which had been previously discovered and named by [[George Vancouver]]. On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but did not give Adams a name, only calling it \"a very high humped mountain\".<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/> This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.<ref name=CVO_LewisClark/>\n\nFor several decades after Lewis and Clark sighted the mountain, people continued to get Adams confused with [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]], due in part to their somewhat similar appearance and similar [[latitude]]. In the 1830s, [[Hall J. Kelley]] led a campaign to rename the [[Cascade Range]] as the President's Range and rename each major Cascade mountain after a former [[President of the United States]]. Mount Adams was not known to Kelley and was thus not in his plan. [[Mount Hood]], in fact, was designated by Kelley to be renamed after President [[John Adams]] and St. Helens was to be renamed after [[George Washington]]. In a mistake or deliberate change by mapmaker and proponent of the Kelley plan, [[Thomas J. Farnham]], the names for Hood and St. Helens were interchanged. And, likely because of the confusion about which mountain was St. Helens, he placed the ''Mount Adams'' name north of Mount Hood and about {{convert|40|mi|km}} east of Mount St. Helens. By what would seem sheer coincidence, there was in fact a large mountain there to receive the name. Since the mountain had no official name at the time, Kelley's name stuck even though the rest of his plan failed.<ref name=CVO_Adams/> However, it was not official until 1853, when the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]], under the direction of [[Washington Territory]] governor [[Isaac I. Stevens]], determined its location, described the surrounding countryside, and placed the name on the map.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=Guardians/><ref name=Beckey/><ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/><ref name=Meany1/>\n\nSince its discovery by explorers, the height of Adams has also been subject to revision. The topographer for the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]], Lt. [[Johnson K. Duncan]], and [[George Gibbs (ethnologist)|George Gibbs]], ethnologist and naturalist for the expedition, thought it was about the same height as St. Helens. Its large, uneven size apparently contributed to the underestimation.<ref name=Beckey/> The [[Canada\u2013United States border#The Northwest Boundary Survey (1857\u201361)|Northwest Boundary Survey]] listed Adams as having an elevation of {{convert|9570|ft|m}}<ref name=Beckey/>  while a later [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|US Coast and Geodetic Survey]] gave it an elevation of {{convert|11906|ft|m}}.<ref name=HistorianReport/> The height was more closely determined in 1895 by members of the [[Mazamas|Mazamas mountaineering club]], William A. Gilmore, Professor Edgar McClure, and [[William Gladstone Steel]]. Using a [[Hypsometer#Pressure hypsometer|boiling point thermometer]], [[Barometer#Mercury barometers|mercurial barometer]], and an [[Barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid barometer]], they determined the elevation to be {{convert|12255|,|12402|, and|12150|ft|m}} respectively.<ref name=Elevation/> None of these numbers were used on any map because that same year, 1895, the [[US Geological Survey]] (USGS), using a [[triangulation]] method, also measured the height of several mountains in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and they measured Adams as having an elevation of {{convert|12470|ft|m}}.<ref name=NatGeo/> The USGS further refined their measurement sometime in late 1909 or early 1910 to {{convert|12307|ft|m}} and again in 1970 to {{convert|12276|ft|m}} for the release of the Mount Adams East 1:24000 quadrangle. The current elevation, {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, is generated by the new method, [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988|NAVD88]], for calculating altitudes.\n\n[[Claude Ewing Rusk]], a local settler and [[mountaineer]], was one of those most familiar with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given to places around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle [[glacier]]s. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman<ref name=Rusk/> and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone.<ref name=Beckey/> While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.<ref name=Rusk/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams (Washington) Map 1901 Reid.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Reid's map from his survey of Adams in 1901]]\nNo detailed descriptions of Adams or its [[glacier]]s existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of the mountain in 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams to be the source of some of the [[Columbia River Basalt Group|Columbia River basalt flows]]. They thought that Adams was within what was originally an enormous [[caldera]] that was about one hundred miles across. The southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the [[anticline]] ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley.<ref name=Lyman2/> Modern [[geology]] has since dismissed this theory. From information collected on an outing of the [[Mazamas]] in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896.<ref name=Lyman7/> Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted [[geologist]]/[[glaciologist]] [[Harry Fielding Reid]] to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant [[glacier]]s, [[Pinnacle Glacier (Mount Adams)|Pinnacle]], [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams]], [[Lava Glacier|Lava]], [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman]], and [[Rusk Glacier|Rusk]] with suggestions from Rusk.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Beckey/> He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte.<ref name=Reid1/><ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Reid2/> Reid noted that it was apparent that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the [[Little Ice Age]].<ref name=Reid1/><ref name=Reid2/> The geologic history of Adams would have to wait another 80 years before it was fully explored.<ref name=Harris/>\n\nOn the 1895 [[Mazamas]] expedition, the first [[heliograph]]y between several of the peaks of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] was attempted with some success. A party on [[Mount Hood]] was able to communicate back and forth with the party on Mount Adams, but the parties on [[Mount Rainier|Rainier]], [[Mount Baker|Baker]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Jefferson]], and [[Diamond Peak (Oregon)|Diamond Peak]] were not successful, mainly because of dense smoke and logistical problems.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=HistorianReport/><ref name=Wells/>\n\n[[File:Cascadians Climbing Party east side Mount Adams (Washington).jpg|thumb|left|Cascadians climbing party before starting the ascent of the east side of Adams]]\nThe first ascent of Mount Adams was in 1854 by Andrew Glenn Aiken,<ref name=AikenName/> [[Edward Jay Allen]], and Andrew J. Burge.<ref name=CenturyOfClimbing/><ref name=Meany1/><ref name=Hazard/> While most sources list the aforementioned names, at least one substitutes Colonel Benjamin Franklin Shaw for Andrew Burge.<ref name=Guardians/> Their route was likely up the North Cleaver because that summer they were improving a newly designated military road that passes through [[Naches Pass]], which is to the north of Adams.<ref name=Meany1/>\n\nWhile the north and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the mountain were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and [[icefall|ice cascades]].<ref name=Guardians/> To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, [[C. E. Rusk]] searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the [[Wilson Glacier (Mount Adams)|Wilson Glacier]], Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, up and over The Castle, and across the vast, heavily [[crevasse]]d eastern side of the summit [[ice cap]].<ref name=Rusk/> One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was \"thrilling to the point of extreme danger.\"<ref name=Hazard/> Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher.<ref name=Rusk/><ref name=Coursen/> Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the [[Mazamas]] finally climbed the west face of Adams.<ref name=WestAscent/> This route is straightforward, but made difficult by [[icefall]]s, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.<ref name=Hazard/>\n\nSome of the caves around Adams were subject to commercial ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] in years of short supply elsewhere.<ref name=CondonCaves/> Oddly, a \"claim\" to the cave using mining laws was used in order to gain exclusive access to the ice.<ref name=IceCaveWA/> [[Cheese Cave]] was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, for a number of years in the 1950s, a [[bleu cheese]] similar to the [[Roquefort]] produced in [[Roquefort-sur-Soulzon]], France.<ref name=Caldwell1953/><ref name=Cheese/><ref name=Halliday/> A legend from the [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]]s regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the \"mouse-wife,\" they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man's wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she dug out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the \"mouse-wife\" to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.<ref name=Meany1/>\n\nAdams was the feature of a 1915 documentary \"When the Mountains Call.\" This film documented the journey from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] to the summit and showed many of the sights along the way.<ref name=Movie/>\n\n===Forest Service operations===\n[[File:Gotchen Creek Guard Station.jpg|thumb|left|Gotchen Creek Guard Station ca. 1911]]\nAdams and the lands surrounding it were initially set aside as part of the [[Mount Rainier Forest Reserve]] under the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] in 1897. Eight years later, in 1905, the Bureau of Forestry, later the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], was created under the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and all the Forest Reserves were transferred to the new agency. In 1907, the Forest Reserves were renamed to National Forests and in 1908, the [[Rainier National Forest]] was divided among three Forests. The southern half became the [[Columbia National Forest]]. The name was changed in 1949 to honor the first Chief of the Forest, [[Gifford Pinchot]]. In 1964, the lands around Mount Adams were set aside as a wilderness.<ref name=GPNF_History/>\n\nAdams is home to the oldest building on the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]], the Gotchen Creek Guard Station just south of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Built in 1909, it served as the administrative headquarters of the Mount Adams District until 1916. It was built along a major grazing trail to allow for easy monitoring of the thousands of sheep grazed on the lower slopes. Later, in the 1940s, as the amount of grazing decreased, the station housed the Forest Guards responsible for the area.<ref name=EarToTheGround/> In 2008, it was wrapped in protective foil as a precautionary method to shield it from a large [[wildfire]], the [[Cold Springs Fire]], although fire crews were able to stop the fire before it got too close. Wildfires in 2012 ([[Cascade Creek Fire]]) and 2015 ([[Cougar Creek Fire]]) also required this precaution, and fire crews were able to stop them as well.<ref name=mailonline/>\n\n[[File:Mount Adams Lookout.jpg|thumb|right|US Forest Service lookout on the summit, August 9, 1922.]]\nIn 1916, the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] began preparations to establish the highest [[Fire lookout tower|fire lookout]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] at the top of Adams. This was part of an endeavor that began in 1915 on [[Mount Hood]]<ref name=HoodLO/> and 1916 on [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]]<ref name=StHelensLO/> The idea was to situate lookouts far above all low-lying hills and mountains to give the lookouts an immense area for observation without obstructions. Being at {{convert|12281|ft|m}}, the new lookout would also be the third highest in the world and still is.<ref name=showtell/> In 1917, building materials were moved to the base of the mountain and in 1918, Dan Lewis packed the building materials and lumber to the lower portion of Suksdorf Ridge.<ref name=WALookouts/><ref name=MtnMen/> The following summer was spent hauling the building materials to the top.<ref name=WALookouts/><ref name=MtnMen/> The four men assigned the job, Arthur \"Art\" Jones, Adolph Schmid, Julius Wang, and Jessie Robbins, had a difficult task ahead of them until they engineered a way to quickly and, for the most part, safely bring the building materials up the slope using a deadman/rope technique.<ref name=MtnMen/> Construction of the standard D-6 building with a \u00bc second story cupola<ref name=Abegg/> began in the summer of 1920 and was completed a year later by Art, Adolph, James Huffman and Joe Guler.<ref name=Rusk/> It was manned as a lookout during the last year of its construction through 1924. After which it was abandoned because of the difficulties of operating a [[fire lookout tower|lookout]] that high and because lower level clouds, smoke, and haze frequently and effectively blocked the view of the lower elevations. Arthur Jones was likely the one person most involved in the project, spending five seasons on the mountain. Others who worked on the project or staffed the lookout include Rudolph Deitrich, the last [[fire lookout|lookout]], and Chaffin \"Chafe\" Johnson.<ref name=MtnMen/>\n\nAfter the [[fire lookout tower|lookout]] at the summit was abandoned, the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] changed strategies from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as [[airplane]]s became the cheaper method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate.<ref name=WashingtonLO/><ref name=SWWALO/> One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer<ref name=BurleyMtn/> and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending.<ref name=Abegg/><ref name=ORLive/> Two lookouts remain nearby on the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]]. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high [[National Fire Danger Rating System|fire danger]].<ref name=Abegg/>\n\n===Sulfur mine===\nIn 1929, Wade Dean formed the Glacier Mining Company and filed [[mining claim]]s to the [[sulfur]] on Adams' {{convert|210|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} summit plateau. Beginning in 1932, the first assessment work was done. The initial test pits were dug by hand, but this proved to be dangerous work and an alternative was needed to drill through the up to {{convert|210|ft|m}} thick ice cap more safely. The answer was a diamond tipped drilling machine, but, being a heavy machine, it could not be carried up the newly completed horse and mule trail like other supplies. So it winched itself up the mountain using a series of deadman anchors. 168 pack string trips led by John Perry were made over the course of the mining activities. The crew stayed in the abandoned [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] [[fire lookout tower|lookout]], a tight fit for the usual eight men and their equipment. This problem was alleviated somewhat in the later years of the project when an enclosed {{convert|8|by|12|ft|m}} [[lean-to]] was added to the cabin. Another smaller lean-to was added later. The conditions and weather above {{convert|12000|ft|m}} could be incredibly variable with the highest temperature of {{convert|110|F|C}} recorded 12 hours before the lowest temperature of {{convert|-48|F|C}}. This preliminary mining continued for several years until 1937 when the last crew worked from the summit lookout. In the years following, Dean periodically attempted to restart this venture and in 1946, he and Lt. John Hodgkins made several landings by airplane on the summit [[ice cap]]. Although sulfur was found, the amount of the ore that was able to be mined in a season was only enough to make up the cost of getting it off the mountain and was not enough to be competitive. Part of this stemmed from Dean's desire that if operations were expanded, an ore as well as passenger transport system was needed, and his desire that Adams not be significantly scarred by the operation. The project was fully abandoned in 1959.<ref name=MtnMen/>  Adams is the only large [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.<ref name=Harris/><ref name=\"Vallance\"/>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Level IV ecoregions, Cascades.png|thumb|upright|Level IV ecoregions, Cascades]]\nBecause of its remote location and relative inaccessibility, [[Climate Data Records|climate records]] are poor. The nearest weather station, Potato Hill, has only been measuring [[precipitation]] since 1982 and [[temperature]]s since 1989.<ref name=PHWeather/> [[Temperature record|Temperature]] and precipitation records from [[Glenwood, Klickitat County, Washington|Glenwood]] and [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]], both considerably lower in [[elevation]] and farther from the mountain, are more complete and go back further, 1948 at Glenwood<ref name=AdamsCOOP/> and 1924 at Trout Lake.<ref name=NWS/> [[Snow]]fall records from the three [[Snow hydrology#Equipment and Testing|snow station]]s on Adams cover a number of years but are discontinuous and are limited to the northwest side. The Potato Hill station was monitored monthly from 1950\u20131976 and was replaced in 1982 with the automated precipitation sensor. It was upgraded in 1983 to report snow water equivalent and it was upgraded again in 2006 to report snow depth.<ref name=PHWeather/> The Council Pass station was monitored monthly from 1956\u20131978 and the Divide Meadow station was monitored monthly from 1962\u20131978. Divide Meadow was the most representative of the snow depth on the west side of Adams because it was the highest station on the flanks of the mountain.<ref name=snowdepth/>\n\nLike the rest of the high [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] mountains, Adams receives a large amount of snow, but because it lies farther east than many of its [[Washington (state)|Washington]] compatriots, it receives less than one might expect for a mountain of its height. Although snowfall is not measured directly, it can be estimated from the [[Snow#Snowfall measurement|snow depth]]; and since the Potato Hill station was upgraded to report daily snow depth in 2006, there has been an average of {{convert|210|in|cm}} of snow every year. Also since 2006, the most snow to fall in a day was {{convert|28|in|cm}} (Feb 26, 2011), in a month, {{convert|92|in|cm}} (Dec 2007), and in a year, {{convert|288|in|cm}} (2012).<ref name=PHWeather/>\n\n[[File:Lenticular clouds over Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|left|Towering [[lenticular cloud]]s over Mount Adams]]\nBy April, there is, on average, {{convert|89|in|cm}} of snow on the ground at Potato Hill.<ref name=PHWeather/> The average monthly snow depth at Potato Hill has not changed much from the records collected from 1950\u20131976 with only a small decrease in January, February, and May and a small increase in March and April.

These two stations average a greater amount of snow than Potato Hill, with an average of {{convert|102|in|cm}} at Council Pass and {{convert|141|in|cm}} at Divide Meadow by April. Divide Meadow generally receives the most snow with a record depth of {{convert|222|in|cm}} in 1972. The [[snowpack]] at Potato Hill starts building in late October to early November and the last of the snow generally melts by the beginning of June, but occasionally lingers into July.<ref name=snowdepth/>\n\n[[Temperature]]s and [[precipitation]] can be highly variable around Adams, due in part to its geographic location astride the Cascade Crest, which gives it more of a [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP D: Continental.2Fmicrothermal climates|continental]] influence than some of its neighbors.

[[climate]] of Adams gives it a large amount of diversity within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, [[Abies grandis|grand fir]] and [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|Douglas fir]] dominate the forest with [[Tsuga heterophylla|Western hemlock]] and [[Thuja plicata|Western red cedar]] as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] are dominant with some patches of dense [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]]. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by [[Abies amabilis|Pacific silver fir]] and [[Abies procera|noble fir]]; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases, the forest changes again with [[Abies lasiocarpa|subalpine fir]], [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]], and [[Tsuga mertensiana|mountain hemlock]] becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant [[Pinus albicaulis|whitebark pine]] and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are [[Pinus monticola|Western white pine]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]], [[Larix occidentalis|Western larch]], [[Taxus brevifolia|Pacific yew]], [[Cupressus nootkatensis|Alaska cedar]], and [[Juniperus communis|mountain juniper]]. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species [[Acer macrophyllum|big leaf maple]], [[Quercus garryana|Oregon white oak]], [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspen]], [[Populus trichocarpa|black cottonwood]], and [[Alnus rubra|red alder]]. Large shrubs/small trees include the [[Betula glandulosa|dwarf birch]], [[Crataegus suksdorfii|Suksdorf's hawthorn]], [[Corylus cornuta|California hazelnut]], [[Prunus emarginata|bitter cherry]], [[Acer circinatum|vine maple]], [[Acer glabrum|Douglas maple]], and [[Sambucus cerulea|blue elderberry]] and contribute to a vibrant fall display.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=flora2/>\n\n[[Big Tree (Washington)|Big Tree]], (also known as Trout Lake Big Tree), is a massive [[Ponderosa pine|ponderosa]] pine tree in majestic, [[old growth]] pine and fir forests at the southern base of Mount Adams.<ref name=\"trails1\"/> The tree rises to a lofty {{convert|202|ft|m}}<ref name=\"richard1\"/>  with a diameter of {{convert|7|ft|m}},<ref name=\"FSBigTree\"/> and is one of the largest known ponderosa pine trees in the world.<ref name=\"trails1\"/> As of 2015, however, the tree has been stressed by attacks from [[Bark beetle|pine beetle]]s.<ref name=\"FSBigTree\"/>\n\nThe large diversity of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the [[Herbaceous plant|herbage]] and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is more than any other mountain in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by [[Wilhelm Nikolaus Suksdorf|William Suksdorf]] and [[Thomas J. Howell (botanist)|Thomas Howell]] and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts.<ref name=flora/> This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed.<ref name=flora2/> Adams is home to many rare plants including [[Actaea elata|tall bugbane]], [[Mimulus suksdorfii|Suksdorf's monkeyflower]], northern microseris (''[[Microceris borealis]]''), Brewer's potentilla (''[[Potentilla breweri]]''), and [[Sisyrinchium sarmentosum|mountain blue-eyed grass]].<ref name=flora2/> The plant diversity is most evident in the many [[meadow]]s and [[wetland]]s on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, [[Castilleja parviflora|magenta paintbrush]], [[Senecio triangularis|arrowleaf ragwort]], [[penstemon]]s, [[Lupinus|lupine]]s, [[Mimulus|monkeyflower]]s, [[Phyllodoce (plant)|mountain heather]]s, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find [[Vaccinium uliginosum|bog blueberry]], [[Viburnum edule|highbush cranberry]], [[Drosera anglica|sundew]], [[Comarum palustre|purple cinquefoil]], and [[Utricularia intermedia|flatleaf bladderwort]], in addition to many [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and [[Juncaceae|rush]]es. [[Montane ecology#Subalpine zone|Subalpine]] and [[Montane ecology#Alpine grasslands and tundra|alpine]] meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a display as well with [[Luetkea|partrigefoot]], Cascade [[Boechera|rockcress]], [[subalpine buttercup]], [[Valeriana sitchensis|Sitka valerian]], [[Smelowskia ovalis|alpine false candytuft]], [[Polemonium elegans|elegant Jacob's ladder]], and various [[Polygonaceae|buckwheat]]s as prominent players.<ref name=Friends/>\n\n===Fauna===\n[[File:Hoary marmot Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|[[Hoary marmot]] above the tree line on Adams]]\nAdams is home to a fairly wide variety of animal species. Several [[hoofed mammals]] call the mountain home: [[mountain goat]]s, [[Roosevelt elk]], [[black-tailed deer]], and [[mule deer]]. Large carnivores include [[cougar]], [[American black bear|black bear]], [[coyote]], [[bobcat]], and the [[Red fox#Subspecies|Cascade mountain fox]],<ref name=CCP/> an endemic subspecies of the [[red fox]]. There have also been sightings of [[wolverine]]<ref name=CCP/><ref name=Wolverine_Oregonian /> and unconfirmed reports of [[Gray wolf|wolves]].<ref name=WDFWWolf/> Many small mammals also make Adams their home. [[Squirrel]]s and [[chipmunk]]s are numerous throughout the forest. [[Douglas squirrel]]s, [[least chipmunk]]s, and [[Townsend's chipmunk]]s live throughout the forest with [[golden-mantled ground squirrel]]s and [[California ground squirrel]]s occupying drier areas as well. These squirrels are preyed upon by the elusive and secretive [[pine marten]]s that also call Adams their home. [[Hoary marmot]]s and [[pika]]s make their home on open rocky areas at any altitude while the elusive [[snowshoe hare]] lives throughout the forest.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=CCP/><ref name=Lyman3/><ref name=animals/>\n\nThe profusion of wildflowers attracts a large number of [[pollinator]]s including [[butterflies]] such as [[Parnassius|Apollos]], ''[[Melitaea]]'', ''[[Coenonympha]]'', [[Neophasia menapia|snowflakes]], [[Painted lady|painted ladies]], [[Pieris (butterfly)|garden whites]], [[Papilio|swallowtails]], [[Skipper (butterfly)|skippers]], [[Limenitis|admirals]], [[Coliadinae|sulphurs]], [[Lycaenidae|blues]], and [[List of fritillaries (butterflies)|fritillaries]].<ref name=animals/><ref name=Butterflies/>\n\n[[File:Gray-crowned rosy finch Mount Adams (Washington).JPG|thumb|left|[[Grey-crowned rosy finch|Gray-crowned rosy finch]] high up the slopes on Adams]]\nMany birds call Adams home or a stopover on their migration routes. Songbirds include three species of [[chickadee]], two [[kinglet]]s, several [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]]es, [[warbler]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, and [[finch]]es. One unique [[songbird]] to the high elevations is the [[grey-crowned rosy finch|gray-crowned rosy finch]], who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. [[Raptor (bird)|Raptors]] that live in the forest and meadows include ''[[Accipiter]]''s, [[red-tailed hawk]]s, [[golden eagle|golden]] and [[bald eagle]]s, [[osprey]]s, [[great horned owl]]s, and [[falcon]]s. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the [[hairy woodpecker]], [[downy woodpecker]], and [[white-headed woodpecker]]. Jays such as the [[Steller's jay]] and [[Canada jay]] are common and the Canada jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the [[Clark's nutcracker]] with its distinctive call. [[Swallow]]s and [[swift]]s are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. [[Common merganser]]s and several other species of [[water bird]]s can be found on many of the lakes as well. The [[American dipper]] with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several [[grouse]] species, the [[sooty grouse|sooty]], [[spruce grouse|spruce]], and [[ruffed grouse]] and the [[white-tailed ptarmigan]], call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.<ref name=Friends/><ref name=animals/><ref name=MountaineerBirds/>\n\nThe streams and lakes around Adams offer a number of [[fish]] for the [[Angling|angler]] to seek out. The two most common species, [[eastern brook trout]] and [[rainbow trout]] ([[Columbia River redband trout]]), are in nearly every lake and stream. [[Brown trout]] and [[cutthroat trout]] appear in most of the lakes in the [[Midway High Lakes Area|High Lakes Area]] and three lakes are home to [[tiger trout]]. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species of [[trout]].<ref name=WDFWFish/> [[Bull trout]] can be found in the upper reaches of the [[Klickitat River|Klickitat]] and [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]]s.<ref name=FSFishing/><ref name=YKFP/> [[Westslope cutthroat trout]] can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat trout are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the [[Cispus River]]. [[mountain whitefish|Whitefish]] can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers.<ref name=FSFishing/><ref name=YKFP/> Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and [[Cowlitz River]]s, falls on the [[White Salmon River]]), the only river where [[anadromous fish]]es can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. [[Chinook salmon]], [[coho salmon]], and [[steelhead]], in several different [[Salmon run|run]]s, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.<ref name=YKFP/>\n\nThe [[Conboy Lake National Wildlife Refuge]] lies at the base of Mount Adams.

[[Pamela Reed]] plays his partner, Phoebe O'Hara, and [[Penelope Ann Miller]] plays Joyce, the teacher who becomes his love interest. The original music score was composed by [[Randy Edelman]]. The film was released in the United States on December 21, 1990.<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web|title=Kindergarten Cop|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kindergartencop.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter years of pursuing infamous drug dealer Cullen Crisp, [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective John Kimble arrests him for murder; a witness saw him murder an informant after getting information regarding the whereabouts of his ex-wife, Rachel Myatt Crisp, who allegedly stole millions of dollars from him before fleeing with his son, Cullen Jr. Partnered with former teacher-turned-detective Phoebe O'Hara, Kimble goes undercover in [[Astoria, Oregon]] to find Rachel and offer her immunity in exchange for testifying against Crisp in court. To this end, O'Hara must act as a substitute teacher in Cullen Jr's [[kindergarten]] class at Astoria Elementary School. O'Hara gets a terrible case of [[stomach flu]], falling ill at the last moment, so  Kimble takes her place. The suspicious school principal, Miss Schlowski, is convinced he will not last long before quitting. Though initially overwhelmed, he adapts to his new status quickly, despite not having any formal teaching experience. With the use of his pet [[ferret]] as a class mascot, positive reinforcement, his police training as a model for structure in class and his experience as a father, he becomes a much admired and cherished figure to the students.\n\nKimble begins to enjoy his undercover role. At one point, he deals with a case of [[child abuse]] by assaulting and threatening the father of the abused child, winning Miss Schlowski's favor. In observation of his teaching style, she assures him that even though she does not agree with his methods, she can see that he is a good teacher. Kimble also becomes fond of fellow teacher Joyce Palmieri, whose son Dominic is one of his students. She is estranged from her husband and will not speak of him, telling Dominic that he lives in [[France]]. Conversing with the gradually more trusting Joyce, Kimble deduces that she is Rachel and that Dominic is Cullen Jr. Back in California, the case holding Crisp in jail is closed after the witness dies from using tainted cocaine provided by Crisp's mother, Eleanor. He is subsequently released from prison, and quickly travels to Astoria with Eleanor to search for Cullen Jr.\n\nWhen Kimble learns Crisp has been released, he confronts Rachel about her identity, saying he can protect her if she cooperates. Outraged that he misled her, she tells him that Crisp lied about her stealing the money to convince drug dealers to help him find her; the real reason was to find Cullen Jr, as he was angry that Rachel disappeared with him (even though she had every reason to do this, given her ex-husband's infamy, and the bad example of a father he would be as a result). Crisp starts a fire in the library as a distraction to kidnap Cullen Jr, but uses him as a hostage when Kimble arrives. Kimble's ferret, who was hiding in Cullen Jr's shirt, bites Crisp in the neck, allowing Cullen Jr to escape; Crisp shoots Kimble in the leg before Kimble fatally shoots Crisp. Outside, Eleanor injures O'Hara with her car before going inside and discovering Crisp dead; she wounds Kimble in the shoulder, but O'Hara appears and vengefully knocks her unconscious with a baseball bat. Eleanor is then arrested and the unconscious Kimble is hospitalized with O'Hara, with both of them making a full recovery. O'Hara returns to the police force in Los Angeles, while Kimble decides to retire, staying in Astoria to become a kindergarten teacher at the school full-time. Rachel joins him and the two share a kiss while everyone cheers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n<!--- top billed in closing credits order --->\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Detective John Kimble\n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Joyce Palmieri/Rachel Myatt Crisp\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Detective Phoebe O'Hara\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as Miss Schlowski\n* [[Richard Tyson]] as Cullen Crisp\n* [[Carroll Baker]] as Eleanor Crisp \n* [[Christian and Joseph Cousins]] as Dominic Palmieri/Cullen Crisp, Jr.\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Jillian  \n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Zach's mother\n* [[Park Overall]] as Samantha's mother\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Captain Salazar\n* [[Bob Nelson (comedian)|Bob Nelson]] as Henry Shoop\n* Justin Page as Zach Sullivan\n* [[Sarah Rose Karr]] as Emma\n* [[Adam Wylie]] as Larry\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Stewardess\n* Marissa Rosen as Samantha\n* [[Miko Hughes]] as Joseph\n* [[Ben Diskin]] as Sylvester\n* Ben McCreary as Lowell \n* Krystle and Tiffany Mataras as Tina and Rina\n* Amber Reaves as Mary\n* [[Odette Annable|Odette Yustman]] as Rosa\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n[[Bill Murray]] was approached to play the role of John Kimble.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray|date=17 February 2011|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/|accessdate=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray|archive-date=20 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDirector Ivan Reitman and casting director Michael Chinich auditioned more than 2,000 children for the roles of the students.<ref>{{cite news | first=Susan | last=King | title=Ivan Reitman, 'Kindergarten Cop's' Top Sergeant | work=The Los Angeles Times | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-7037_1_kindergarten-cop | accessdate=December 2, 2010 | date=December 21, 1990 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425210549/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-7037_1_kindergarten-cop | archivedate=25 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\nExterior scenes at Astoria Elementary School were filmed at John Jacob Astor Elementary School, located at 3550 Franklin Avenue in [[Astoria, Oregon]].<ref name = \"Filming\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099938/locations |title=Filming locations for Kindergarten Cop |website=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=June 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Universal Studios]] hired local artists Judith Niland and Carl Lyle Jenkins to paint murals on the walls at Astoria, and provided new playground equipment, a fenced playground, and a new lawn and hedges around the school.

[[Pamela Reed]] plays his partner, Phoebe O'Hara, and [[Penelope Ann Miller]] plays Joyce, the teacher who becomes his love interest. The original music score was composed by [[Randy Edelman]]. The film was released in the United States on December 21, 1990.<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web|title=Kindergarten Cop|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kindergartencop.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter years of pursuing infamous drug dealer Cullen Crisp, [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective John Kimble arrests him for murder; a witness saw him murder an informant after getting information regarding the whereabouts of his ex-wife, Rachel Myatt Crisp, who allegedly stole millions of dollars from him before fleeing with his son, Cullen Jr. Partnered with former teacher-turned-detective Phoebe O'Hara, Kimble goes undercover in [[Astoria, Oregon]] to find Rachel and offer her immunity in exchange for testifying against Crisp in court. To this end, O'Hara must act as a substitute teacher in Cullen Jr's [[kindergarten]] class at Astoria Elementary School. O'Hara gets a terrible case of [[stomach flu]], falling ill at the last moment, so  Kimble takes her place. The suspicious school principal, Miss Schlowski, is convinced he will not last long before quitting. Though initially overwhelmed, he adapts to his new status quickly, despite not having any formal teaching experience. With the use of his pet [[ferret]] as a class mascot, positive reinforcement, his police training as a model for structure in class and his experience as a father, he becomes a much admired and cherished figure to the students.\n\nKimble begins to enjoy his undercover role. At one point, he deals with a case of [[child abuse]] by assaulting and threatening the father of the abused child, winning Miss Schlowski's favor. In observation of his teaching style, she assures him that even though she does not agree with his methods, she can see that he is a good teacher. Kimble also becomes fond of fellow teacher Joyce Palmieri, whose son Dominic is one of his students. She is estranged from her husband and will not speak of him, telling Dominic that he lives in [[France]]. Conversing with the gradually more trusting Joyce, Kimble deduces that she is Rachel and that Dominic is Cullen Jr. Back in California, the case holding Crisp in jail is closed after the witness dies from using tainted cocaine provided by Crisp's mother, Eleanor. He is subsequently released from prison, and quickly travels to Astoria with Eleanor to search for Cullen Jr.\n\nWhen Kimble learns Crisp has been released, he confronts Rachel about her identity, saying he can protect her if she cooperates. Outraged that he misled her, she tells him that Crisp lied about her stealing the money to convince drug dealers to help him find her; the real reason was to find Cullen Jr, as he was angry that Rachel disappeared with him (even though she had every reason to do this, given her ex-husband's infamy, and the bad example of a father he would be as a result). Crisp starts a fire in the library as a distraction to kidnap Cullen Jr, but uses him as a hostage when Kimble arrives. Kimble's ferret, who was hiding in Cullen Jr's shirt, bites Crisp in the neck, allowing Cullen Jr to escape; Crisp shoots Kimble in the leg before Kimble fatally shoots Crisp. Outside, Eleanor injures O'Hara with her car before going inside and discovering Crisp dead; she wounds Kimble in the shoulder, but O'Hara appears and vengefully knocks her unconscious with a baseball bat. Eleanor is then arrested and the unconscious Kimble is hospitalized with O'Hara, with both of them making a full recovery. O'Hara returns to the police force in Los Angeles, while Kimble decides to retire, staying in Astoria to become a kindergarten teacher at the school full-time. Rachel joins him and the two share a kiss while everyone cheers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n<!--- top billed in closing credits order --->\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Detective John Kimble\n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Joyce Palmieri/Rachel Myatt Crisp\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Detective Phoebe O'Hara\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as Miss Schlowski\n* [[Richard Tyson]] as Cullen Crisp\n* [[Carroll Baker]] as Eleanor Crisp \n* [[Christian and Joseph Cousins]] as Dominic Palmieri/Cullen Crisp, Jr.\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Jillian  \n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Zach's mother\n* [[Park Overall]] as Samantha's mother\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Captain Salazar\n* [[Bob Nelson (comedian)|Bob Nelson]] as Henry Shoop\n* Justin Page as Zach Sullivan\n* [[Sarah Rose Karr]] as Emma\n* [[Adam Wylie]] as Larry\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Stewardess\n* Marissa Rosen as Samantha\n* [[Miko Hughes]] as Joseph\n* [[Ben Diskin]] as Sylvester\n* Ben McCreary as Lowell \n* Krystle and Tiffany Mataras as Tina and Rina\n* Amber Reaves as Mary\n* [[Odette Annable|Odette Yustman]] as Rosa\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n[[Bill Murray]] was approached to play the role of John Kimble.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray|date=17 February 2011|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/|accessdate=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray|archive-date=20 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDirector Ivan Reitman and casting director Michael Chinich auditioned more than 2,000 children for the roles of the students.<ref>{{cite news | first=Susan | last=King | title=Ivan Reitman, 'Kindergarten Cop's' Top Sergeant | work=The Los Angeles Times | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-7037_1_kindergarten-cop | accessdate=December 2, 2010 | date=December 21, 1990 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425210549/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-7037_1_kindergarten-cop | archivedate=25 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\nExterior scenes at Astoria Elementary School were filmed at John Jacob Astor Elementary School, located at 3550 Franklin Avenue in [[Astoria, Oregon]].<ref name = \"Filming\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099938/locations |title=Filming locations for Kindergarten Cop |website=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=June 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Universal Studios]] hired local artists Judith Niland and Carl Lyle Jenkins to paint murals on the walls at Astoria, and provided new playground equipment, a fenced playground, and a new lawn and hedges around the school.
