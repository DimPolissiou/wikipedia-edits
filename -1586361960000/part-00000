They use the stars to navigate themselfes all aroung, for they can not see when they are rolling dung.\nMany dung beetles, known as ''rollers'', roll dung into round balls, which are used as a food source or breeding chambers. Others, known as ''tunnelers'', bury the dung wherever they find it. A third group, the ''dwellers'', neither roll nor burrow: they simply live in manure. They are often attracted by the dung collected by [[burrowing owl]]s. There are dung beetle species of different colours and sizes, and some functional traits such as body mass (or biomass) and leg length can have high levels of variability.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=Hannah M.|last2=Louzada|first2=Julio|last3=Bardgett|first3=Richard D.|last4=Barlow|first4=Jos|date=2016-03-03|title=Assessing the Importance of Intraspecific Variability in Dung Beetle Functional Traits|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e0145598|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0145598|pmid=26939121|pmc=4777568|issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1145598G}}</ref>\n\nAll the [[species]] belong to the superfamily [[Scarabaeoidea]], most of them to the subfamilies [[Scarabaeinae]] and [[Aphodiinae]] of the family [[Scarabaeidae]] (scarab beetles). As most species of Scarabaeinae feed exclusively on feces, that subfamily is often dubbed ''true dung beetles''. There are dung-feeding beetles which belong to other families, such as the [[Geotrupidae]] (the ''earth-boring dung beetle''). The Scarabaeinae alone comprises more than 5,000 species.<ref>Frolov, A.V.

Some smaller species simply attach themselves to the dung-providers to wait for the dung. After capturing the dung, a dung beetle rolls it, following a straight line despite all obstacles. Sometimes, dung beetles try to steal the dung ball from another beetle, so the dung beetles have to move rapidly away from a dung pile once they have rolled their ball to prevent it from being stolen. Dung beetles can roll up to 10 times their weight. Male ''Onthophagus taurus'' beetles can pull 1,141 times their own body weight: the equivalent of an average person pulling six double-decker buses full of people.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/24/dung-beetles | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Homa | last=Khaleeli | title=Just how strong is a dung beetle? | date=24 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Scarabaeus laticollis 2.jpg|thumb|left|Two dung beetles fighting over a ball of dung]]\n\nA species of dung beetle (the African ''Scarabaeus zambesianus'') [[animal navigation|navigates]] by [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] patterns in [[moonlight]],{{Sfn|Tills|2013|p=123}}  the first animal known to do so.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/424033a| pmid = 12840748| title = Animal behaviour: Insect orientation to polarized moonlight| journal = Nature| volume = 424| issue = 6944| page = 33| year = 2003| last1 = Dacke | first1 = M. | last2 = Nilsson | first2 = D.

The \"rollers\" roll and bury a dung ball either for food storage or for making a brooding ball. In the latter case, two beetles, one male and one female, stay around the dung ball during the rolling process. Usually it is the male that rolls the ball, while the female hitch-hikes or simply follows behind. In some cases, the male and the female roll together. When a spot with soft soil is found, they stop and bury the  ball, then [[mating|mate]] underground. After the mating, one or both of them prepares the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of [[mass provisioning]].\n\nSome species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring. The dung beetle goes through a complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The larvae live in brood balls made with dung prepared by their parents. During the larval stage, the beetle feeds on the dung surrounding it.\n\nThe behavior of the beetles was poorly understood until the studies of [[Jean Henri Fabre]] in the late 19th century. For example, Fabre corrected the myth that a dung beetle would seek aid from other dung beetles when confronted by obstacles. By observation and experiment, he found the seeming helpers were in fact awaiting an opportunity to steal the roller's food source.<ref>{{cite book |author=Fabre, J.

The derivative term ''xprw'' or ''\u1e2bpr(w)'' is variously translated as \"form\", \"transformation\", \"happening\", \"mode of being\" or \"what has come into being\", depending on the context. It may have existential, fictional, or ontologic significance.\n\nThe scarab was linked to [[Khepri]] (\"he who has come into being\"), the god of the rising [[sun]]. The ancients believed that the dung beetle was only male in gender, and reproduced by depositing [[semen]] into a dung ball. The supposed self-creation of the beetle resembles that of Khepri, who creates himself out of nothing. Moreover, the dung ball rolled by a dung beetle resembles the sun. [[Plutarch]] wrote: {{quote|The race of beetles has no female, but all the males eject their sperm into a round pellet of material which they roll up by pushing it from the opposite side, just as the sun seems to turn the heavens in the direction opposite to its own course, which is from west to east.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/E.html#ref373 \"Isis and Osiris\"], ''Moralia'', in volume V of the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition, 1936, now in the public domain. Retrieved on 2007-08-02.</ref>}}\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. Some [[New Kingdom]] royal tombs exhibit a threefold image of the sun god, with the beetle as symbol of the morning sun. The astronomical ceiling in the tomb of [[Ramses VI]] portrays the nightly \"death\" and \"rebirth\" of the sun as being swallowed by [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], goddess of the sky, and re-emerging from her womb as Khepri.\n\nThe image of the scarab, conveying ideas of transformation, renewal, and resurrection, is ubiquitous in ancient Egyptian religious and [[funerary art]].\n\nExcavations of ancient Egyptian sites have yielded images of the scarab in bone, [[ivory]], stone, [[Egyptian faience]], and precious metals, dating from the Sixth Dynasty and up to the period of Roman rule. They are generally small, bored to allow stringing on a necklace, and the base bears a brief inscription or [[cartouche]]. Some have been used as [[Impression seal|seals]]. [[Pharaoh]]s sometimes commissioned the manufacture of larger images with lengthy inscriptions, such as the [[The lion hunts of Amenhotep III during the first ten years of his reign|commemorative scarab]] of Queen [[Tiye]]. Massive sculptures of scarabs can be seen at [[Luxor Temple]], at the Serapeum in Alexandria (see [[Serapis]]) and elsewhere in Egypt.\n\n[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|left|A scarab, depicted on the walls of [[KV6|Tomb KV6]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]]]]\n\nThe scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. Scarabs, generally, though not always, were cut from green stone, and placed on the chest of the deceased. Perhaps the most famous example of such \"heart scarabs\" is the yellow-green [[pectoral (Ancient Egypt)|pectoral]] scarab found among the entombed provisions of [[Tutankhamen]]. It was carved from a large piece of [[Libyan desert glass]]. The purpose of the \"heart scarab\" was to ensure that the heart would not bear witness against the deceased at judgement in the Afterlife. Other possibilities are suggested by the \"transformation spells\" of the ''Coffin Texts'', which affirm that the soul of the deceased may transform (''xpr'') into a human being, a god, or a bird and reappear in the world of the living.\n\nOne scholar comments on other traits of the scarab connected with the theme of death and rebirth:\n{{quote|It may not have gone unnoticed that the pupa, whose wings and legs are encased at this stage of development, is very mummy-like. It has even been pointed out that the egg-bearing ball of dung is created in an underground chamber which is reached by a vertical shaft and horizontal passage curiously reminiscent of Old Kingdom mastaba tombs.\"<ref>Andrews, Carol (1994). ''Amulets of Ancient Egypt''. Texas: University of Texas Press. {{ISBN|0-292-70464-X}}. p. 51.</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast to funerary contexts, some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for [[scaraboid seal|seals]] of varying types. The best-known of these being Judean [[LMLK seal]]s (8 of 21 designs contained scarab beetles), which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of [[Hezekiah]].\n\nThe scarab remains an item of popular interest thanks to modern fascination with the art and beliefs of ancient Egypt. Scarab beads in semiprecious stones or glazed ceramics can be purchased at most bead shops, while at Luxor Temple a massive ancient scarab has been roped off to discourage visitors from rubbing the base of the statue \"for luck\".\n\n==In culture==\nSome dung beetles are used as food in South East Asia and a variety of dung beetle species have been used [[therapeutically]] (and are still being used in traditionally living societies) in potions and folk medicines to treat a number of illnesses and disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meyer-Rochow | first=V.B. |title=Therapeutic arthropods and other, largely terrestrial, folk-medicinally important invertebrates: a comparative survey and review. |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine| date=January 2017| volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=9| doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0136-0| pmid=28173820 | pmc=5296966 }}</ref>\n\n===In literature===\nIn [[Aesop's fable]] \"[[The Eagle and the Beetle]]\", the eagle kills a hare that has asked for sanctuary with a beetle. The beetle then takes revenge by twice destroying the eagle's eggs. The eagle, in despair, flies up to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] and places her latest eggs in [[Zeus]]'s lap, beseeching the god to protect them. When the beetle finds out what the eagle has done, it stuffs itself with dung, goes straight up to Zeus and flies right into his face. Zeus is startled at the sight of the unpleasant creature, jumping to his feet so that the eggs are broken. Learning of the origin of their feud, Zeus attempts to mediate and, when his efforts to mediate fail, he changes the breeding season of the eagle to a time when the beetles are not above ground.\n\n[[Aristophanes]] alluded to Aesop's fable several times in his plays. In ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'', the hero rides up to Olympus to free the goddess Peace from her prison. His steed is an enormous dung beetle which has been fed so much dung that it has grown to monstrous size.\n\n[[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s \"The Dung Beetle\" tells the story of a dung beetle who lives in the stable of the king's horses in an imaginary kingdom. When he demands golden shoes like those the king's horse wears and is refused, he flies away and has a series of adventures, which are often precipitated by his [[Superiority complex|feeling of superiority]] to other animals. He finally returns to the stable having decided (against all logic) that it is for him that the king's horse wears golden shoes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andersen|first1=Hans Christian|last2=James|first2=M.

The \"rollers\" roll and bury a dung ball either for food storage or for making a brooding ball. In the latter case, two beetles, one male and one female, stay around the dung ball during the rolling process. Usually it is the male that rolls the ball, while the female hitch-hikes or simply follows behind. In some cases, the male and the female roll together. When a spot with soft soil is found, they stop and bury the  ball, then [[mating|mate]] underground. After the mating, one or both of them prepares the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of [[mass provisioning]].\n\nSome species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring. The dung beetle goes through a complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The larvae live in brood balls made with dung prepared by their parents. During the larval stage, the beetle feeds on the dung surrounding it.\n\nThe behavior of the beetles was poorly understood until the studies of [[Jean Henri Fabre]] in the late 19th century. For example, Fabre corrected the myth that a dung beetle would seek aid from other dung beetles when confronted by obstacles. By observation and experiment, he found the seeming helpers were in fact awaiting an opportunity to steal the roller's food source.<ref>{{cite book |author=Fabre, J.

The derivative term ''xprw'' or ''\u1e2bpr(w)'' is variously translated as \"form\", \"transformation\", \"happening\", \"mode of being\" or \"what has come into being\", depending on the context. It may have existential, fictional, or ontologic significance.\n\nThe scarab was linked to [[Khepri]] (\"he who has come into being\"), the god of the rising [[sun]]. The ancients believed that the dung beetle was only male in gender, and reproduced by depositing [[semen]] into a dung ball. The supposed self-creation of the beetle resembles that of Khepri, who creates himself out of nothing. Moreover, the dung ball rolled by a dung beetle resembles the sun. [[Plutarch]] wrote: {{quote|The race of beetles has no female, but all the males eject their sperm into a round pellet of material which they roll up by pushing it from the opposite side, just as the sun seems to turn the heavens in the direction opposite to its own course, which is from west to east.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/E.html#ref373 \"Isis and Osiris\"], ''Moralia'', in volume V of the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition, 1936, now in the public domain. Retrieved on 2007-08-02.</ref>}}\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. Some [[New Kingdom]] royal tombs exhibit a threefold image of the sun god, with the beetle as symbol of the morning sun. The astronomical ceiling in the tomb of [[Ramses VI]] portrays the nightly \"death\" and \"rebirth\" of the sun as being swallowed by [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], goddess of the sky, and re-emerging from her womb as Khepri.\n\nThe image of the scarab, conveying ideas of transformation, renewal, and resurrection, is ubiquitous in ancient Egyptian religious and [[funerary art]].\n\nExcavations of ancient Egyptian sites have yielded images of the scarab in bone, [[ivory]], stone, [[Egyptian faience]], and precious metals, dating from the Sixth Dynasty and up to the period of Roman rule. They are generally small, bored to allow stringing on a necklace, and the base bears a brief inscription or [[cartouche]]. Some have been used as [[Impression seal|seals]]. [[Pharaoh]]s sometimes commissioned the manufacture of larger images with lengthy inscriptions, such as the [[The lion hunts of Amenhotep III during the first ten years of his reign|commemorative scarab]] of Queen [[Tiye]]. Massive sculptures of scarabs can be seen at [[Luxor Temple]], at the Serapeum in Alexandria (see [[Serapis]]) and elsewhere in Egypt.\n\n[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|left|A scarab, depicted on the walls of [[KV6|Tomb KV6]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]]]]\n\nThe scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. Scarabs, generally, though not always, were cut from green stone, and placed on the chest of the deceased. Perhaps the most famous example of such \"heart scarabs\" is the yellow-green [[pectoral (Ancient Egypt)|pectoral]] scarab found among the entombed provisions of [[Tutankhamen]]. It was carved from a large piece of [[Libyan desert glass]]. The purpose of the \"heart scarab\" was to ensure that the heart would not bear witness against the deceased at judgement in the Afterlife. Other possibilities are suggested by the \"transformation spells\" of the ''Coffin Texts'', which affirm that the soul of the deceased may transform (''xpr'') into a human being, a god, or a bird and reappear in the world of the living.\n\nOne scholar comments on other traits of the scarab connected with the theme of death and rebirth:\n{{quote|It may not have gone unnoticed that the pupa, whose wings and legs are encased at this stage of development, is very mummy-like. It has even been pointed out that the egg-bearing ball of dung is created in an underground chamber which is reached by a vertical shaft and horizontal passage curiously reminiscent of Old Kingdom mastaba tombs.\"<ref>Andrews, Carol (1994). ''Amulets of Ancient Egypt''. Texas: University of Texas Press. {{ISBN|0-292-70464-X}}. p. 51.</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast to funerary contexts, some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for [[scaraboid seal|seals]] of varying types. The best-known of these being Judean [[LMLK seal]]s (8 of 21 designs contained scarab beetles), which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of [[Hezekiah]].\n\nThe scarab remains an item of popular interest thanks to modern fascination with the art and beliefs of ancient Egypt. Scarab beads in semiprecious stones or glazed ceramics can be purchased at most bead shops, while at Luxor Temple a massive ancient scarab has been roped off to discourage visitors from rubbing the base of the statue \"for luck\".\n\n==In culture==\nSome dung beetles are used as food in South East Asia and a variety of dung beetle species have been used [[therapeutically]] (and are still being used in traditionally living societies) in potions and folk medicines to treat a number of illnesses and disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meyer-Rochow | first=V.B. |title=Therapeutic arthropods and other, largely terrestrial, folk-medicinally important invertebrates: a comparative survey and review. |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine| date=January 2017| volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=9| doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0136-0| pmid=28173820 | pmc=5296966 }}</ref>\n\n===In literature===\nIn [[Aesop's fable]] \"[[The Eagle and the Beetle]]\", the eagle kills a hare that has asked for sanctuary with a beetle. The beetle then takes revenge by twice destroying the eagle's eggs. The eagle, in despair, flies up to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] and places her latest eggs in [[Zeus]]'s lap, beseeching the god to protect them. When the beetle finds out what the eagle has done, it stuffs itself with dung, goes straight up to Zeus and flies right into his face. Zeus is startled at the sight of the unpleasant creature, jumping to his feet so that the eggs are broken. Learning of the origin of their feud, Zeus attempts to mediate and, when his efforts to mediate fail, he changes the breeding season of the eagle to a time when the beetles are not above ground.\n\n[[Aristophanes]] alluded to Aesop's fable several times in his plays. In ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'', the hero rides up to Olympus to free the goddess Peace from her prison. His steed is an enormous dung beetle which has been fed so much dung that it has grown to monstrous size.\n\n[[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s \"The Dung Beetle\" tells the story of a dung beetle who lives in the stable of the king's horses in an imaginary kingdom. When he demands golden shoes like those the king's horse wears and is refused, he flies away and has a series of adventures, which are often precipitated by his [[Superiority complex|feeling of superiority]] to other animals. He finally returns to the stable having decided (against all logic) that it is for him that the king's horse wears golden shoes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andersen|first1=Hans Christian|last2=James|first2=M.

He rows ashore with his first mate Brown and other crew members, unaware the island is inhabited by three white adventurers who have been stranded there: Hurricane Smith, Dan O'Hara and Brundage.\n\nSmith, O'Hara and Brundage sneak on board \"The Southern Cross\", overwhelm the remaining crew, and takes over the boat. He sails it to Australia. On the way Smith explains he has buried half a million dollars in Dakaru before being unfairly arrested for piracy. He persuades O'Hara and Brundage to become his partners in retrieving it.\n\nIn Australia, the three men rename their ship \"The Lady Betty\" try to raise money to track down the treasure. They are approached by Eric Gorvahlsen, a scientist who wants to hire a ship. Raikes and Brown arrive in Australia so Hurricane, Dan and Brundage take them prisoner on \"The Lady Betty\". \n\nGorvahlsen goes on board the ship with his companions, Dr. Whitmore and Whitmore's half-Polynesian daughter Luana, who is also Gorvahlsen's lover. Gorvahlsen is actually planning to capture Hurricane's treasure on Dakaru. He has never seen Hurricane Smith and suspects that Dan O'Hara is he (the real Hurricane pretends to be \"Jim Tyler\"). \n\nGorvahlsen tells Luana to find out information about Dan/O'Hara from Hurricane/Tyler. Luana and the real Hurricane fall in love with each other and she admits to having doubts about the scheme. \n\nRaikes and Brown have been released from the brig. They start a knife fight with Brundage and another sailor Clobb, which results in Raikes being sent back to the brig. \n\nLuana falls in the water and Hurricane rescues her from a shark. During this, Brundage accidentally calls Hurricane by his real name and Gorvahlsen notices. He orders Luana to drug Hurricane with gin but she warns him instead. Hurricane swims to the island of Dakaru to prepare the natives for the attack.\n\nGorvahlsen orders Dan to anchor the ship off Dakaru. Brown then persuades Gorvahlsen to join forces with him and order Dan to release Raikes. Dan then leaves for the island to warn Hurricane. \n\nHurricane sneaks back on board the boat by which time Brown has caused the crew to be unsettled. Hurricane is thrown in the brig and Clobb kills a sailor. Gorvahlsen takes over the ship, and Clobb encourages the rest of the crew to arm themselves. Gorvahlsen tells the crew about the gold and convinces them to help him claim it. \n\nIn Dakaru, Hurricane is forced to lead Gorvahlsen, Brown and Raikes to where the gold has been buried. They dig up the treasure but then Dan leads the natives to attack. Dr. Whitmore spears Gorvahlsen to death and Brundage kills Clobb in a knife fight. Hurricane and Luana are united.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78730/Hurricane-Smith/|title=Hurricane Smith (1952) - Overview - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yvonne de Carlo]] as Luana Whitmore\n* [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]] as Hurricane Smith\n* [[James Craig (actor)|Jame Craig]] as Govahlsen\n* [[Forrest Tucker]] as Dan McGuire\n* [[Lyle Bettger]] as Clobb\n* [[Richard Arlen]] as Brundage\n* [[Mike Kellin]] as Dicer\n* [[Murray Matheson]] as Dr. Whitmore\n* [[Henry Brandon (actor)|Henry Brandon]] as Sam\n* [[Emile Meyer]] as Capt.

He rows ashore with his first mate Brown and other crew members, unaware the island is inhabited by three white adventurers who have been stranded there: Hurricane Smith, Dan O'Hara and Brundage.\n\nSmith, O'Hara and Brundage sneak on board \"The Southern Cross\", overwhelm the remaining crew, and takes over the boat. He sails it to Australia. On the way Smith explains he has buried half a million dollars in Dakaru before being unfairly arrested for piracy. He persuades O'Hara and Brundage to become his partners in retrieving it.\n\nIn Australia, the three men rename their ship \"The Lady Betty\" try to raise money to track down the treasure. They are approached by Eric Gorvahlsen, a scientist who wants to hire a ship. Raikes and Brown arrive in Australia so Hurricane, Dan and Brundage take them prisoner on \"The Lady Betty\". \n\nGorvahlsen goes on board the ship with his companions, Dr. Whitmore and Whitmore's half-Polynesian daughter Luana, who is also Gorvahlsen's lover. Gorvahlsen is actually planning to capture Hurricane's treasure on Dakaru. He has never seen Hurricane Smith and suspects that Dan O'Hara is he (the real Hurricane pretends to be \"Jim Tyler\"). \n\nGorvahlsen tells Luana to find out information about Dan/O'Hara from Hurricane/Tyler. Luana and the real Hurricane fall in love with each other and she admits to having doubts about the scheme. \n\nRaikes and Brown have been released from the brig. They start a knife fight with Brundage and another sailor Clobb, which results in Raikes being sent back to the brig. \n\nLuana falls in the water and Hurricane rescues her from a shark. During this, Brundage accidentally calls Hurricane by his real name and Gorvahlsen notices. He orders Luana to drug Hurricane with gin but she warns him instead. Hurricane swims to the island of Dakaru to prepare the natives for the attack.\n\nGorvahlsen orders Dan to anchor the ship off Dakaru. Brown then persuades Gorvahlsen to join forces with him and order Dan to release Raikes. Dan then leaves for the island to warn Hurricane. \n\nHurricane sneaks back on board the boat by which time Brown has caused the crew to be unsettled. Hurricane is thrown in the brig and Clobb kills a sailor. Gorvahlsen takes over the ship, and Clobb encourages the rest of the crew to arm themselves. Gorvahlsen tells the crew about the gold and convinces them to help him claim it. \n\nIn Dakaru, Hurricane is forced to lead Gorvahlsen, Brown and Raikes to where the gold has been buried. They dig up the treasure but then Dan leads the natives to attack. Dr. Whitmore spears Gorvahlsen to death and Brundage kills Clobb in a knife fight. Hurricane and Luana are united.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78730/Hurricane-Smith/|title=Hurricane Smith (1952) - Overview - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yvonne de Carlo]] as Luana Whitmore\n* [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]] as Hurricane Smith\n* [[James Craig (actor)|Jame Craig]] as Govahlsen\n* [[Forrest Tucker]] as Dan McGuire\n* [[Lyle Bettger]] as Clobb\n* [[Richard Arlen]] as Brundage\n* [[Mike Kellin]] as Dicer\n* [[Murray Matheson]] as Dr. Whitmore\n* [[Henry Brandon (actor)|Henry Brandon]] as Sam\n* [[Emile Meyer]] as Capt.
