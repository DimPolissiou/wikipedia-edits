Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released on the orders of Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], who referred to Corbett as \"the patriot\" upon dismissing him. He was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.\n\nKnown for his devout religious beliefs and eccentric behavior, Corbett drifted around the United States before disappearing around 1888. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] in September 1894, but that remains impossible to substantiate.\n\n==Early life and education==\nCorbett was born in [[London]] and immigrated with his family to [[New York City]] in 1840. The Corbetts moved frequently before eventually settling in [[Troy, New York]]. As a young man, Corbett began apprenticing as a [[milliner]] (also called a \"hatter\"), a profession that he would hold intermittently throughout his life. As a milliner, Corbett was regularly exposed to the fumes of [[mercury(II) nitrate]], then used in the treatment of [[fur]] to produce [[felt]] used on hats. Excessive exposure to the compound can lead to  [[hallucination]]s, [[psychosis]] and twitching (known as the \"hatter's shakes\").<ref name=\"jameson128\">{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|pp=128}}</ref> Historians have theorized that the mental issues Corbett exhibited before and after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] were caused by this exposure.<ref name = \"walker159\">{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|p=159}}</ref>\n\n===Family and religion===\nAfter working as a milliner in Troy, Corbett returned to New York City.<ref name=\"johnson45\">{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=45}}</ref> He later married, but his wife and child died in childbirth. Following their deaths, he moved to [[Boston]]. Corbett became despondent over the loss of his wife and began drinking heavily. He was unable to hold a job and eventually became homeless.<ref name=\"jameson128\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|p=160}}</ref> After a night of heavy drinking, he was confronted by a street preacher whose message persuaded him to join the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]. Corbett immediately stopped drinking and became devoutly religious. After being [[baptized]], he subsequently changed his name to Boston, the name of the city where he was converted.<ref name=\"Harper's Weekly, May 13, 1865\">Harper's Weekly, May&nbsp;13, 1865</ref> He regularly attended meetings at the Fulton and Bromfield Street churches where his enthusiastic behavior earned him the nickname \"The Glory to God man\".<ref name=\"johnson45\"/> In an attempt to imitate [[Jesus]], Corbett began to wear his hair very long (he was forced to cut it upon enlisting in the [[Union Army]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Kauffman|2004|p=310}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=46}}</ref>\n\nIn 1857, Corbett began working at a hat manufacturer's shop on [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington Street]] in downtown Boston. He was reported to be a proficient milliner, but was known to proselytize frequently and stop work to pray and sing for co-workers who used profanity in his presence. He also began working as a [[street preacher]] and would sermonize and distribute religious literature in [[North Square (Boston, Massachusetts)|North Square]].<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> Corbett soon earned a reputation around Boston for being a \"local eccentric\" and religious fanatic.<ref name=\"jameson128\"/><ref name=\"walker159\"/> On July&nbsp;16, 1858, Corbett was propositioned by two [[prostitution|prostitutes]] while walking home from a church meeting. He was deeply disturbed by the encounter. Upon returning to his room at a boardinghouse, Corbett began reading [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#19:12|chapters 18 and 19]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (\"And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee....and there be [[eunuch]]s, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake\"). In order to avoid sexual temptation and remain holy, he [[castration|castrated]] [[self-surgery|himself]] with a pair of scissors.<ref name=\"walker159\"/> He then ate a meal and went to a prayer meeting before seeking medical treatment.<ref name=\"Swanson329\">{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=329}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n\n===Enlistment in the Union army===\n[[File:Sergent Boston Corbett, 16th N.Y. Cav. Who shot J. Wilkes Booth, April 26, 1865. (2719965829).jpg|thumb|upright|Sgt. Boston Corbett, Union Army.]]\nIn April 1861, early in the [[American Civil War]], Corbett enlisted as a private in Company I of the 12th Regiment [[New York Militia]]. Corbett's eccentric behavior quickly got him into trouble. He carried a Bible with him at all times and read passages aloud from it regularly, held unauthorized prayer meetings and argued with his superior officers.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|pp=160\u2013161}}</ref> Corbett also condemned officers and superiors for what he perceived as violations of [[Religious texts|God's word]]. In one instance, he verbally reprimanded [[Daniel Butterfield|Colonel Daniel Butterfield]] for using profanity and taking the Lord's name in vain. He was sent to the [[guardhouse]] for several days but refused to apologize for his insubordination.<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\">{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|p=161}}</ref> Due to his continued disruptive behavior and refusal to take orders, Corbett was [[court-martial]]ed and sentenced to be shot. His sentence was eventually reduced and he was discharged in August 1863.<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|p=129}}</ref>\n\nCorbett re-enlisted later that month as a private in Company L, [[16th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry|16th New York Cavalry Regiment]]. On June&nbsp;24, 1864, he was captured by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Colonel [[John S. Mosby]]'s men in [[Culpeper, Virginia]] and held prisoner at [[Andersonville prison]] for five months. Corbett was released in an [[Prisoner exchange|exchange]] in November 1864 and was admitted to the Army hospital in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] where he was treated for [[scurvy]], [[malnutrition]] and exposure.<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\"/> On his return to his company, he was promoted to [[Sergeant (United States)|Sergeant]]. Corbett later testified for the prosecution in the trial of the commandant of Andersonville, Captain [[Henry Wirz]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chamlee|Chamlee|1989|p=289}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chipman|1891|p=40}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Wilkes Booth wanted poster new.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wanted poster]] for [[John Wilkes Booth]], [[John Surratt]], and [[David Herold]] (1865)]]\n\n===Pursuit of John Wilkes Booth===\nOn April 24, 1865, [[16th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry|Corbett's regiment]] was sent to apprehend [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], whom Booth [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|fatally shot]] on April 14, 1865. On April 26, the regiment surrounded Booth and one of his accomplices, [[David Herold]], in a tobacco barn on the [[Virginia]] farm of Richard Garrett. Herold surrendered, but Booth refused and cried out, \"I will not be taken alive!\". The barn was set on fire in an attempt to force him out into the open, but Booth remained inside.<ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|pp=324\u2013335}}</ref> Corbett was positioned near a large crack in the barn wall. \n\nIn an 1878 interview, Corbett claimed that he saw Booth aim his [[carbine]], prompting him to shoot Booth with his [[Colt revolver]] despite [[Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]'s orders that Booth be captured alive. The bullet struck Booth in the back of the head behind his left ear, passed though his neck, and out into the barn.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/assassination/ |title=American Experience &#124; The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln |publisher=PBS |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=103}}</ref> A low scream of pain like that produced by a sudden throttling came from the assassin, and he pitched headlong to the floor.<ref>{{cite book|title=Terry Alford, Fortune\u2019s Fool: The Life of John Wilkes Booth}}</ref> Corbett and the other soliders would note a sense of poetic, or cosmic, justice in that Lincoln and Booth were each shot around the same spot of the head.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|pp=227\u2013228}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Death of John Wilkes Booth, 1865|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/booth.htm|publisher=Eyewitness to History/Ibis Communications|accessdate=August 16, 2012|quote=the bullet struck Booth in the back of the head, about an inch below the spot where his shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln.}}</ref> And the damage to Booth was no less severe than that to Lincoln: the bullet had pierced three [[vertebrae]] and partially severed his [[spinal cord]], [[paralysis|paralyzing]] him.<ref name=\"Goodrich, p. 211\">Goodrich, p. 211.</ref><ref name=Smith210>Smith, pp. 210\u2013213.</ref> Their conditions were different as well, as [[Mary C.

The bullet wound prevented him from swallowing any of the liquid. In a weak voice, Booth asked for water and Conger and Baker gave it to him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=104}}</ref> He asked them to roll him over and turn him facedown. Conger thought it a bad idea. Then at least turn me on my side, the assassin pleaded. They did, but Conger saw that the move did not relieve Booth\u2019s suffering. Baker noticed it, too: \"He seemed to suffer extreme pain whenever he was moved...and would several times repeat, \u2018Kill me.\u2019\"<ref>Swanson, p. 139.</ref> At sunrise, Booth remained in agonising pain. His pulse weakening as his breathing became more laboured and irregular. In agony, unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered as he gazed at them, \"Useless ... Useless.\" These were his last words. A few minutes later, Booth began gasping for air as his throat continued to swell, then there was a shiver and a gurgle and his body shuddered, before Booth died from asphyxia - he literally choked to death. He died two hours after Corbett shot him.\n\n[[File:boston corbett.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Boston Corbett]]\n[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Colonel]] [[Everton Conger]] initially thought Booth had shot himself. After realizing Booth had been shot by someone else, Conger and Lt. Doherty asked which officer had shot Booth. Corbett stepped forward and admitted he was the shooter.<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|p=135}}</ref> When asked why he had violated orders, Corbett replied, \"[[Divine providence|Providence]] directed me\".<ref name=\"Swanson340\">{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=340}}</ref> He was immediately arrested and was accompanied by Lt. Doherty to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to be court martialed. When questioned by Edwin Stanton about Booth's capture and shooting, both Doherty and Corbett agreed that Corbett had in fact disobeyed orders not to shoot. However, Corbett maintained that he believed Booth had intended to shoot his way out of the barn and that he acted in self-defense. He told Stanton, \"...Booth would have killed me if I had not shot first. I think I did right.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=227}}</ref> Corbett maintained that he didn't intend to kill Booth, but merely wanted to inflict a disabling wound, but either his aim slipped or Booth moved at the moment Corbett pulled the trigger.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=104}}</ref> Stanton paused and then stated, \"The rebel is dead. The patriot lives; he has spared the country expense, continued excitement and trouble. Discharge the patriot.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\"/> Upon leaving the War Department, Corbett was greeted by a cheering crowd. As he made his way to [[Mathew Brady]]'s studio to have his official portrait taken, the crowd followed him asking for autographs and requesting that he tell them about shooting Booth. Corbett told the crowd:\n\n{{quote|I aimed at his body. I did not want to kill him....I think he stooped to pick up something just as I fired. That may probably account for his receiving the ball in the head. [W]hen the assassin lay at my feet, a wounded man, and I saw the [[bullet]] had taken effect about an inch back of the ear, and I remembered that Mr. Lincoln was wounded about the same part of the head, I said: \"What a God we have...God avenged Abraham Lincoln.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|pp=227\u2013228}}</ref>}}\n\nEyewitnesses to Booth's shooting contradicted Corbett's version of events and expressed doubts that Corbett was responsible for shooting Booth. Officers who were near Corbett at the time claimed that they never saw him fire his gun (Corbett's gun was never inspected and was eventually lost). They claimed that Corbett came forward only after Lt. Colonel Conger asked who had shot Booth. Richard Garrett, the owner of the farm on which Booth was found, and his 12-year-old son Robert also contradicted Corbett's testimony that he acted in self-defense. Both maintained that Booth had never reached for his gun.<ref>{{harvnb|Nottingham|1997|p=148}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was some criticism of Corbett's actions, he was largely considered a hero by the public and press. One newspaper editor declared that Corbett would, \"live as one of the World's great avengers.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=228}}</ref> For his part in Booth's capture, Corbett received a portion of the $100,000 reward money, amounting to $1,653.84 ({{Inflation|US|1653.84|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"goodrich291\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=291}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=358}}</ref> His annual salary as a U.S. sergeant was $204 ({{Inflation|US|204|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). Corbett received offers to purchase the gun he used to shoot Booth. He refused stating, \"That is not mine-it belongs to the Government, and I would not sell it for any price.\"<ref name=\"basler\">{{harvnb|Basler|1965|pp=57\u201358}}</ref>  Corbett also declined an offer for one of Booth's pistols as he did not want a reminder of shooting Booth.<ref name=\"basler\"/>\n\n==Post-war life==\nAfter his discharge from the army in August 1865, Corbett went back to work as a hatter in Boston and frequently attended the Bromfield Street Church. When the hatting business in Boston slowed, Corbett moved to [[Danbury, Connecticut]], to continue his work and also \"preached in the country round about.\" By 1870, he had relocated once again to [[Camden, New Jersey]], where he was known as a \"Methodist lay preacher\". Corbett's inability to hold a job was attributed to his fanatical behavior; he was routinely fired after continuing his habit of stopping work to pray for his co-workers.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19670103&id=BqpVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=J-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7151,566580|title=The Strange Fate Of Boston Corbett|last=Frazier|first=Robert B.|date=January 3, 1967|work=Eugene Register-Guard|page=5|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref> In an effort to earn money, Corbett capitalized on his role as \"Lincoln's Avenger\".<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\"/> He gave lectures about the shooting of Booth accompanied by illustrated [[lantern slide]]s at Sunday schools, women's groups and tent meetings. Corbett was never asked back due to his increasingly erratic behavior and incoherent speeches.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\"/>\n\nR.B. Hoover, a man who later befriended Corbett, recalled that Corbett believed \"men who were high in authority at Washington at the time of the assassination\" were hounding him. Corbett said the men were angry because he had deprived them of prosecuting and executing John Wilkes Booth themselves. He also believed the same men had gotten him fired from various jobs.<ref name=\"sparks\">{{harvnb|Sparks|Everett|Lowell|Lodge|1889|p=382}}</ref> Corbett's paranoia was furthered by [[hate mail]] he received for killing Booth. He became fearful that \"Booth's Avengers\" or organizations like the \"Secret Order\" were planning to seek revenge upon him and took to carrying a pistol with him at all times. As his paranoia increased, Corbett began brandishing his pistol at friends or strangers he deemed suspicious.<ref name=\"goodrich291\"/>\n\nWhile attending the Soldiers' Reunion of the Blue and Gray in [[Caldwell, Ohio]], in 1875, Corbett got into an argument with several men over the death of John Wilkes Booth. The men questioned if Booth had really been killed at all which enraged Corbett. He then drew his pistol on the men but was removed from the reunion before he could fire it.<ref name=\"sparks\"/> In 1878, Corbett moved to [[Concordia, Kansas]], where he acquired a plot of land through [[Homestead principle|homesteading]] upon which he constructed a [[Dugout (shelter)|dugout]] home. He continued working as a preacher and attended [[revival meeting]]s frequently.<ref name=\"johnson51\">{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=51}}</ref>\n\n==Presumed fate==\nDue to his fame as \"Lincoln's Avenger\", Corbett was appointed assistant doorkeeper of the [[Kansas House of Representatives]] in [[Topeka]] in January 1887. On February 15, he became convinced that \nofficers of the House were discriminating against him. He jumped to his feet, brandished a revolver and began chasing the officers out of the building. No one was hurt and Corbett was arrested. The following day, a judge declared Corbett insane and sent him to the [[Topeka State Hospital|Topeka Asylum for the Insane]]. On May 26, 1888, he escaped from the asylum on horseback.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Dale|date=September 2005|title=The Mad Hatter|journal=American Cowboy|volume=12|issue=3|page=82|issn=1079-3690|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-oCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> He then rode to [[Neodesha, Kansas]], where he briefly stayed with Richard Thatcher, a man he had met while they were [[prisoners of war]]. When Corbett left, he told Thatcher he was going to Mexico.<ref name=\"johnson51\"/>\n\nRather than going to Mexico, Corbett is believed to have settled in a cabin he built in the forests near [[Hinckley, Minnesota|Hinckley]], in [[Pine County, Minnesota|Pine County]] in eastern [[Minnesota]]. He is believed to have died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] on September&nbsp;1, 1894.

A few years after Corbett was last seen in Neodesha, Kansas, a [[patent medicine]] salesman in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] filed an application using Corbett's name to receive pension benefits. After an investigation proved that the man was not Boston Corbett, he was sent to prison. In September 1905, a man arrested in [[Dallas]] also claimed to be Corbett. He too was proven to be an imposter and was sent to prison for perjury, and then to the [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|Government Hospital for the Insane]].<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|pp=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Memorials===\nIn 1958, Boy Scout Troop 31, of [[Concordia, Kansas]], built a roadside monument to Corbett located on Key Road.

Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released on the orders of Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], who referred to Corbett as \"the patriot\" upon dismissing him. He was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.\n\nKnown for his devout religious beliefs and eccentric behavior, Corbett drifted around the United States before disappearing around 1888. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] in September 1894, but that remains impossible to substantiate.\n\n==Early life and education==\nCorbett was born in [[London]] and immigrated with his family to [[New York City]] in 1840. The Corbetts moved frequently before eventually settling in [[Troy, New York]]. As a young man, Corbett began apprenticing as a [[milliner]] (also called a \"hatter\"), a profession that he would hold intermittently throughout his life. As a milliner, Corbett was regularly exposed to the fumes of [[mercury(II) nitrate]], then used in the treatment of [[fur]] to produce [[felt]] used on hats. Excessive exposure to the compound can lead to  [[hallucination]]s, [[psychosis]] and twitching (known as the \"hatter's shakes\").<ref name=\"jameson128\">{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|pp=128}}</ref> Historians have theorized that the mental issues Corbett exhibited before and after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] were caused by this exposure.<ref name = \"walker159\">{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|p=159}}</ref>\n\n===Family and religion===\nAfter working as a milliner in Troy, Corbett returned to New York City.<ref name=\"johnson45\">{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=45}}</ref> He later married, but his wife and child died in childbirth. Following their deaths, he moved to [[Boston]]. Corbett became despondent over the loss of his wife and began drinking heavily. He was unable to hold a job and eventually became homeless.<ref name=\"jameson128\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|p=160}}</ref> After a night of heavy drinking, he was confronted by a street preacher whose message persuaded him to join the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]. Corbett immediately stopped drinking and became devoutly religious. After being [[baptized]], he subsequently changed his name to Boston, the name of the city where he was converted.<ref name=\"Harper's Weekly, May 13, 1865\">Harper's Weekly, May&nbsp;13, 1865</ref> He regularly attended meetings at the Fulton and Bromfield Street churches where his enthusiastic behavior earned him the nickname \"The Glory to God man\".<ref name=\"johnson45\"/> In an attempt to imitate [[Jesus]], Corbett began to wear his hair very long (he was forced to cut it upon enlisting in the [[Union Army]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Kauffman|2004|p=310}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=46}}</ref>\n\nIn 1857, Corbett began working at a hat manufacturer's shop on [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington Street]] in downtown Boston. He was reported to be a proficient milliner, but was known to proselytize frequently and stop work to pray and sing for co-workers who used profanity in his presence. He also began working as a [[street preacher]] and would sermonize and distribute religious literature in [[North Square (Boston, Massachusetts)|North Square]].<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> Corbett soon earned a reputation around Boston for being a \"local eccentric\" and religious fanatic.<ref name=\"jameson128\"/><ref name=\"walker159\"/> On July&nbsp;16, 1858, Corbett was propositioned by two [[prostitution|prostitutes]] while walking home from a church meeting. He was deeply disturbed by the encounter. Upon returning to his room at a boardinghouse, Corbett began reading [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#19:12|chapters 18 and 19]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (\"And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee....and there be [[eunuch]]s, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake\"). In order to avoid sexual temptation and remain holy, he [[castration|castrated]] [[self-surgery|himself]] with a pair of scissors.<ref name=\"walker159\"/> He then ate a meal and went to a prayer meeting before seeking medical treatment.<ref name=\"Swanson329\">{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=329}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n\n===Enlistment in the Union army===\n[[File:Sergent Boston Corbett, 16th N.Y. Cav. Who shot J. Wilkes Booth, April 26, 1865. (2719965829).jpg|thumb|upright|Sgt. Boston Corbett, Union Army.]]\nIn April 1861, early in the [[American Civil War]], Corbett enlisted as a private in Company I of the 12th Regiment [[New York Militia]]. Corbett's eccentric behavior quickly got him into trouble. He carried a Bible with him at all times and read passages aloud from it regularly, held unauthorized prayer meetings and argued with his superior officers.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|pp=160\u2013161}}</ref> Corbett also condemned officers and superiors for what he perceived as violations of [[Religious texts|God's word]]. In one instance, he verbally reprimanded [[Daniel Butterfield|Colonel Daniel Butterfield]] for using profanity and taking the Lord's name in vain. He was sent to the [[guardhouse]] for several days but refused to apologize for his insubordination.<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\">{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|p=161}}</ref> Due to his continued disruptive behavior and refusal to take orders, Corbett was [[court-martial]]ed and sentenced to be shot. His sentence was eventually reduced and he was discharged in August 1863.<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|p=129}}</ref>\n\nCorbett re-enlisted later that month as a private in Company L, [[16th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry|16th New York Cavalry Regiment]]. On June&nbsp;24, 1864, he was captured by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Colonel [[John S. Mosby]]'s men in [[Culpeper, Virginia]] and held prisoner at [[Andersonville prison]] for five months. Corbett was released in an [[Prisoner exchange|exchange]] in November 1864 and was admitted to the Army hospital in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] where he was treated for [[scurvy]], [[malnutrition]] and exposure.<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\"/> On his return to his company, he was promoted to [[Sergeant (United States)|Sergeant]]. Corbett later testified for the prosecution in the trial of the commandant of Andersonville, Captain [[Henry Wirz]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chamlee|Chamlee|1989|p=289}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chipman|1891|p=40}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Wilkes Booth wanted poster new.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wanted poster]] for [[John Wilkes Booth]], [[John Surratt]], and [[David Herold]] (1865)]]\n\n===Pursuit of John Wilkes Booth===\nOn April 24, 1865, [[16th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry|Corbett's regiment]] was sent to apprehend [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], whom Booth [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|fatally shot]] on April 14, 1865. On April 26, the regiment surrounded Booth and one of his accomplices, [[David Herold]], in a tobacco barn on the [[Virginia]] farm of Richard Garrett. Herold surrendered, but Booth refused and cried out, \"I will not be taken alive!\". The barn was set on fire in an attempt to force him out into the open, but Booth remained inside.<ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|pp=324\u2013335}}</ref> Corbett was positioned near a large crack in the barn wall. In an 1878 interview, Corbett claimed that he saw Booth aim his [[carbine]], prompting him to shoot Booth with his [[Colt revolver]] despite [[Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]'s orders that Booth be captured alive. The bullet struck Booth in the back of the head behind his left ear, passed though his neck, and out into the barn.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/assassination/ |title=American Experience &#124; The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln |publisher=PBS |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=103}}</ref> A low scream of pain like that produced by a sudden throttling came from the assassin, and he pitched headlong to the floor.<ref>{{cite book|title=Terry Alford, Fortune\u2019s Fool: The Life of John Wilkes Booth}}</ref> Corbett and the other soliders would note a sense of poetic, or cosmic, justice in that Lincoln and Booth were each shot around the same spot of the head.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|pp=227\u2013228}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Death of John Wilkes Booth, 1865|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/booth.htm|publisher=Eyewitness to History/Ibis Communications|accessdate=August 16, 2012|quote=the bullet struck Booth in the back of the head, about an inch below the spot where his shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln.}}</ref> And the damage to Booth was no less severe than that to Lincoln: the bullet had pierced three [[vertebrae]] and partially severed his [[spinal cord]], [[paralysis|paralyzing]] him.<ref name=\"Goodrich, p. 211\">Goodrich, p. 211.</ref><ref name=Smith210>Smith, pp. 210\u2013213.</ref> Their conditions were different as well, as [[Mary C.

The bullet wound prevented him from swallowing any of the liquid. In a weak voice, Booth asked for water and Conger and Baker gave it to him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=104}}</ref> He asked them to roll him over and turn him facedown. Conger thought it a bad idea. Then at least turn me on my side, the assassin pleaded. They did, but Conger saw that the move did not relieve Booth\u2019s suffering. Baker noticed it, too: \"He seemed to suffer extreme pain whenever he was moved...and would several times repeat, \u2018Kill me.\u2019\"<ref>Swanson, p. 139.</ref> At sunrise, Booth remained in agonising pain. His pulse weakening as his breathing became more laboured and irregular. In agony, unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered as he gazed at them, \"Useless ... Useless.\" These were his last words. A few minutes later, Booth began gasping for air as his throat continued to swell, then there was a shiver and a gurgle and his body shuddered, before Booth died from asphyxia - he literally choked to death. He died two hours after Corbett shot him.\n\n[[File:boston corbett.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Boston Corbett]]\n[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Colonel]] [[Everton Conger]] initially thought Booth had shot himself. After realizing Booth had been shot by someone else, Conger and Lt. Doherty asked which officer had shot Booth. Corbett stepped forward and admitted he was the shooter.<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|p=135}}</ref> When asked why he had violated orders, Corbett replied, \"[[Divine providence|Providence]] directed me\".<ref name=\"Swanson340\">{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=340}}</ref> He was immediately arrested and was accompanied by Lt. Doherty to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to be court martialed. When questioned by Edwin Stanton about Booth's capture and shooting, both Doherty and Corbett agreed that Corbett had in fact disobeyed orders not to shoot. However, Corbett maintained that he believed Booth had intended to shoot his way out of the barn and that he acted in self-defense. He told Stanton, \"...Booth would have killed me if I had not shot first. I think I did right.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=227}}</ref> Corbett maintained that he didn't intend to kill Booth, but merely wanted to inflict a disabling wound, but either his aim slipped or Booth moved at the moment Corbett pulled the trigger.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=104}}</ref> Stanton paused and then stated, \"The rebel is dead. The patriot lives; he has spared the country expense, continued excitement and trouble. Discharge the patriot.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\"/> Upon leaving the War Department, Corbett was greeted by a cheering crowd. As he made his way to [[Mathew Brady]]'s studio to have his official portrait taken, the crowd followed him asking for autographs and requesting that he tell them about shooting Booth. Corbett told the crowd:\n\n{{quote|I aimed at his body. I did not want to kill him....I think he stooped to pick up something just as I fired. That may probably account for his receiving the ball in the head. [W]hen the assassin lay at my feet, a wounded man, and I saw the [[bullet]] had taken effect about an inch back of the ear, and I remembered that Mr. Lincoln was wounded about the same part of the head, I said: \"What a God we have...God avenged Abraham Lincoln.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|pp=227\u2013228}}</ref>}}\n\nEyewitnesses to Booth's shooting contradicted Corbett's version of events and expressed doubts that Corbett was responsible for shooting Booth. Officers who were near Corbett at the time claimed that they never saw him fire his gun (Corbett's gun was never inspected and was eventually lost). They claimed that Corbett came forward only after Lt. Colonel Conger asked who had shot Booth. Richard Garrett, the owner of the farm on which Booth was found, and his 12-year-old son Robert also contradicted Corbett's testimony that he acted in self-defense. Both maintained that Booth had never reached for his gun.<ref>{{harvnb|Nottingham|1997|p=148}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was some criticism of Corbett's actions, he was largely considered a hero by the public and press. One newspaper editor declared that Corbett would, \"live as one of the World's great avengers.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=228}}</ref> For his part in Booth's capture, Corbett received a portion of the $100,000 reward money, amounting to $1,653.84 ({{Inflation|US|1653.84|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"goodrich291\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=291}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=358}}</ref> His annual salary as a U.S. sergeant was $204 ({{Inflation|US|204|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).

He refused stating, \"That is not mine-it belongs to the Government, and I would not sell it for any price.\"<ref name=\"basler\">{{harvnb|Basler|1965|pp=57\u201358}}</ref>  Corbett also declined an offer for one of Booth's pistols as he did not want a reminder of shooting Booth.<ref name=\"basler\"/>\n\n==Post-war life==\nAfter his discharge from the army in August 1865, Corbett went back to work as a hatter in Boston and frequently attended the Bromfield Street Church. When the hatting business in Boston slowed, Corbett moved to [[Danbury, Connecticut]], to continue his work and also \"preached in the country round about.\" By 1870, he had relocated once again to [[Camden, New Jersey]], where he was known as a \"Methodist lay preacher\". Corbett's inability to hold a job was attributed to his fanatical behavior; he was routinely fired after continuing his habit of stopping work to pray for his co-workers.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19670103&id=BqpVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=J-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7151,566580|title=The Strange Fate Of Boston Corbett|last=Frazier|first=Robert B.|date=January 3, 1967|work=Eugene Register-Guard|page=5|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref> In an effort to earn money, Corbett capitalized on his role as \"Lincoln's Avenger\".<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\"/> He gave lectures about the shooting of Booth accompanied by illustrated [[lantern slide]]s at Sunday schools, women's groups and tent meetings. Corbett was never asked back due to his increasingly erratic behavior and incoherent speeches.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\"/>\n\nR.B. Hoover, a man who later befriended Corbett, recalled that Corbett believed \"men who were high in authority at Washington at the time of the assassination\" were hounding him. Corbett said the men were angry because he had deprived them of prosecuting and executing John Wilkes Booth themselves. He also believed the same men had gotten him fired from various jobs.<ref name=\"sparks\">{{harvnb|Sparks|Everett|Lowell|Lodge|1889|p=382}}</ref> Corbett's paranoia was furthered by [[hate mail]] he received for killing Booth. He became fearful that \"Booth's Avengers\" or organizations like the \"Secret Order\" were planning to seek revenge upon him and took to carrying a pistol with him at all times. As his paranoia increased, Corbett began brandishing his pistol at friends or strangers he deemed suspicious.<ref name=\"goodrich291\"/>\n\nWhile attending the Soldiers' Reunion of the Blue and Gray in [[Caldwell, Ohio]], in 1875, Corbett got into an argument with several men over the death of John Wilkes Booth. The men questioned if Booth had really been killed at all which enraged Corbett. He then drew his pistol on the men but was removed from the reunion before he could fire it.<ref name=\"sparks\"/> In 1878, Corbett moved to [[Concordia, Kansas]], where he acquired a plot of land through [[Homestead principle|homesteading]] upon which he constructed a [[Dugout (shelter)|dugout]] home. He continued working as a preacher and attended [[revival meeting]]s frequently.<ref name=\"johnson51\">{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=51}}</ref>\n\n==Presumed fate==\nDue to his fame as \"Lincoln's Avenger\", Corbett was appointed assistant doorkeeper of the [[Kansas House of Representatives]] in [[Topeka]] in January 1887. On February 15, he became convinced that \nofficers of the House were discriminating against him. He jumped to his feet, brandished a revolver and began chasing the officers out of the building. No one was hurt and Corbett was arrested. The following day, a judge declared Corbett insane and sent him to the [[Topeka State Hospital|Topeka Asylum for the Insane]]. On May 26, 1888, he escaped from the asylum on horseback.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Dale|date=September 2005|title=The Mad Hatter|journal=American Cowboy|volume=12|issue=3|page=82|issn=1079-3690|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-oCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> He then rode to [[Neodesha, Kansas]], where he briefly stayed with Richard Thatcher, a man he had met while they were [[prisoners of war]]. When Corbett left, he told Thatcher he was going to Mexico.<ref name=\"johnson51\"/>\n\nRather than going to Mexico, Corbett is believed to have settled in a cabin he built in the forests near [[Hinckley, Minnesota|Hinckley]], in [[Pine County, Minnesota|Pine County]] in eastern [[Minnesota]]. He is believed to have died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] on September&nbsp;1, 1894.

A few years after Corbett was last seen in Neodesha, Kansas, a [[patent medicine]] salesman in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] filed an application using Corbett's name to receive pension benefits. After an investigation proved that the man was not Boston Corbett, he was sent to prison. In September 1905, a man arrested in [[Dallas]] also claimed to be Corbett. He too was proven to be an imposter and was sent to prison for perjury, and then to the [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|Government Hospital for the Insane]].<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|pp=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Memorials===\nIn 1958, Boy Scout Troop 31, of [[Concordia, Kansas]], built a roadside monument to Corbett located on Key Road.

The expedition's notable achievement was reaching 82\u00b0 29\u2032 N by ship, a record at the time.\n\nThe expedition was commanded by the experienced and self-taught Arctic explorer [[Charles Francis Hall]], who had previously lived among the [[Inuit]] in the Arctic region while on his obsessive quest to determine the fate of [[Franklin's lost expedition]] of 1845. Hall possessed the necessary survival skills, but lacked an academic background, and had no experience leading men and commanding a ship. He had managed to secure the position of expedition commander based on his authority on the subject of the Arctic.\n\n{{USS|Polaris|1871|2}} departed from [[New York City|New York]] in June&nbsp;1871. Barely underway, the expedition already found itself hampered by poor leadership. Insubordination loomed, mainly at the instigation of chief scientist [[Emil Bessels]] and meteorologist Frederick Meyer\u2014both German\u2014who looked down on what they perceived to be their unqualified commander. Bessels and Meyer were supported by the German half of the crew, further increasing tensions among a crew that was already divided by nationality.\n\nBy October, the men were wintering in [[Thank God Harbor]], on the shore of northern [[Greenland]], and making preparations for the trip to the Pole. Hall returned to the ship from an exploratory sledging journey to a fjord he named [[Newman Bay]], and promptly fell ill. Before he died, he accused members of the crew of orchestrating his murder, an accusation especially directed at Bessels. On the way southward, 19&nbsp;members of the expedition became separated from the ship and drifted on an ice floe for six months and {{convert|1800|mi}}, before being rescued. The damaged ''Polaris'' was run aground and wrecked near [[Etah, Greenland|Etah]] in October&nbsp;1872. The remaining men were able to survive the winter and were rescued the following summer.\n\nA naval board of inquiry investigated Hall's death, but no charges were ever laid. However, an exhumation of his body in 1968 revealed he had ingested a large quantity of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Coupled with recently-discovered affectionate letters written by both Hall and Bessels to [[Vinnie Ream]], a young sculptor they met in New York while waiting for ''Polaris'' to be outfitted, suggests Bessels had a motive, besides the means, to kill Hall.\n\n== Preparations ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Charles Francis Hall only known photo (cropped).jpg|thumb|The only known photograph of [[Charles Francis Hall]], in late 1870]]\nIn 1827, Sir [[William Edward Parry]] led a British [[Royal Navy]] expedition with the aim to be the first men to reach the North Pole.{{sfn|Berton|1988|pp=97\u2013102}} In the next five decades following Parry's attempt, the Americans would mount three such expeditions: [[Elisha Kent Kane]] in {{nowr|1853\u20131855}},{{sfn|Fleming|2011|pp=10\u201349}} [[Isaac Israel Hayes]] in 1860\u20131861,{{sfn|Fleming|2011|pp=62\u201378}} and [[Charles Francis Hall]] with the {{USS|Polaris|1871|2}} in 1871\u20131873.\n\nHall was a [[Cincinnati]] businessman with no notable academic background or sailing experience. He previously worked as a blacksmith, engraver, and for a couple of years he published his own newspaper&nbsp;\u2013 the ''Cincinnati Occasional'' (later renamed the ''Daily&nbsp;Press''&thinsp;).{{sfn|Loomis|2000|p=32}} Energetic and enterprising, he enthusiastically wrote about the latest technological innovations; he was fascinated by hot-air-balloon travel and praised the new [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].{{sfn|Loomis|2000|pp=32\u201334}} He was also a voracious reader especially captivated by the Arctic. His focus was directed towards the region around 1857, after it had slowly dawned on society that [[Franklin's lost expedition|Franklin's Arctic expedition]] of 1845, in all likelihood, would never be coming home.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=345}}\n\nHe spent the next few years studying the reports of previous explorers and trying to raise money for an expedition. As a result of his charisma and personality, he was able to eventually launch two solo expeditions in search of Franklin and his crew; [[Charles Francis Hall#First|one in 1860]], and a [[Charles Francis Hall#Second|second in 1864]]. These experiences established him as a seasoned Arctic explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the [[Inuit]] people.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=15}} The renown he gained allowed him to convince the U.S. Government to finance a third expedition; an attempt on the North Pole.{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=19\u201321}}\n\n=== Finance and materiel ===\nIn 1870, the [[U.S. Senate]] introduced a bill in [[United States Congress|Congress]] to fund an expedition to the North Pole. Hall, aided by Navy Secretary [[George M. Robeson]], successfully lobbied for, and received, a $50,000&nbsp;grant to command the expedition.{{sfn|Davis|1876|p=43}} He began recruiting personnel in late 1870.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=113}}\n\nHe secured the Navy tugboat ''Periwinkle'', a 387-ton screw-propelled steamer. At the [[Washington Navy Yard]], the ship was fitted as a fore-topsail schooner, and renamed {{USS|Polaris|1871|2}}.{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=28\u201329}} She was prepared for Arctic service by the addition of solid oak timber all over her hull, and the bow was sheathed in iron. A new engine was added, and one of the boilers was retrofitted to burn seal or whale oil.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=24\u201327}}\n\nThe ship was also outfitted with four [[whaleboat]]s, {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide|spell=in}}, and a flat-bottomed [[scow]]. During his previous Arctic expeditions, Hall came to admire the Inuit [[umiak]]\u2014a type of open boat made of driftwood, whalebone, and walrus- or seal skins\u2014and brought a similarly constructed collapsible boat which could hold 20 people.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=26}} Food packed on board consisted of tinned ham, salted beef, bread, and sailor's biscuit. They intended to prevent scurvy by supplementing their diet with fresh muskox, seal, and polar bear meat.{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=283\u2013284}}\n\n=== Personnel ===\nIn July 1870, U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] appointed Hall as the expedition's overall commander, to be referred to as captain.{{sfn|Grant|1870|p=209}} Although Hall had abundant Arctic experience, he had no sailing experience, and the title was purely honorary.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=384}} In selecting officers and seamen, Hall relied heavily on whalers with experience in Arctic waters.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=385}} This was markedly different from the polar expeditions of the [[British Admiralty]], who tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.\n\nFor his selection of [[Captain (nautical)|sailing master]], Hall first turned to Sidney O. Budington, then to George E. Tyson. Both initially declined due to prior whaling commitments. When those commitments\u2014Budington's first, followed by Tyson's\u2014fell through, Hall named Budington as sailing master and Tyson as assistant navigator.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=384}} Budington and Tyson had decades of experience captaining whaling vessels between the two of them. In effect, the ''Polaris'' now had three captains, a fact which would weigh heavily on the fate of the expedition. To further complicate matters, Budington and Hall had quarreled before, in 1863, during Hall's earlier search of Franklin's lost expedition. At the time, Budington had denied permission for Hall to bring north his Inuit guides, [[Ipirvik]] and [[Taqulittuq]], whom had taken ill and were in the Budingtons' care.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nThe remaining personnel was composed of Americans and Germans, as well as a Dane and a Swede&nbsp;\u2013 both of whom closely associated with the Germans. First mate Hubbard Chester, second mate William Morton, astronomer and chaplain Richard Bryan, and second engineer Alvin Odell\u2014among others\u2014were American. Chief scientist and surgeon [[Emil Bessels]] and chief engineer Emil Schumann were German, as were most of the seamen.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=385}} Meteorologist Frederick Meyer was a German-born sergeant from the [[U.S. Signal Corps]].{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=130}}\n\nIn addition to the 25&nbsp;officers, crew, and scientific staff, Hall brought along his native companions whose assistance he had relied on during his earlier expeditions; guide and hunter Ipirvik, interpreter and seamstress Taqulittuq, as well as their infant son.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=117}} Later, at [[Upernavik]], also joining their ranks would be [[Hans Hendrik]],{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=146}} the esteemed [[Greenlandic Inuk]] hunter previously employed by [[Elisha Kent Kane]] and [[Isaac Israel Hayes]] on their respective expeditions, and whose expertise had been crucial to their survival, helping ward off starvation.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=89}} Throwing his weight around, Hans, wrote Bessels, \"refused to see that his [wife] and their children were extremely unwelcome extras on such an undertaking.\"{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=101}} Reluctant to increase their number with \"four useless mouths,\"{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=101}} Hall aquiesced, so that now, besides Hans' wife, added to their complement were three young children.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=146}}\n\n== Expedition ==\n\n=== New York to Upernavik ===\n[[File:Polaris Expedition route.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Route of the ''Polaris'' expedition, 1871\u20131873]]\nEven before leaving the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] on June 29, 1871, the expedition ran into personnel troubles. The cook, a seaman, a fireman, and assistant engineer deserted. The steward turned out to be a drunk and was left in port.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=48}} The ship stopped in [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], to pick up a replacement assistant engineer, and left on July&nbsp;3. By the time the ship reached [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], there was dissension among the officers and scientific staff. Bessels, backed by Meyer, had openly rejected Hall's command over the scientific staff.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=51}}{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=134}} The dissension spread to the crew, which was divided by nationality.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=387}}\n\nIn his diary, Tyson wrote that by the time they reached [[Disko Island]], \"[...]&nbsp;expressions are freely made that Hall shall not get any credit out of this expedition. Already some have made up their minds how far they will go and when they will get home again.\"{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=120}} Hall asked Captain Henry K. Davenport of the supply ship {{USS|Congress|1868|6}} to intervene. Davenport threatened to have Meyer shackled for insubordination and sent back to the United States, at which point all of the Germans threatened to quit. Hall and Davenport were forced to back down, although Davenport delivered a strongly worded speech on naval discipline to the crew.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=387}}\n\nIn another open display of dissent, the ship's boilers had been tampered with by one of the crew. The special blubber-fired boilers had disappeared, apparently thrown overboard.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=61}} On August 18, the ship reached [[Upernavik]] on Greenland's west coast, where they picked up Inuit hunter and interpreter Hans Hendrik. The ''Polaris'' proceeded north through [[Smith Sound]] and the [[Nares Strait]], passing the previous furthest north by ship records held of [[Elisha Kent Kane]] and [[Isaac Israel Hayes]].\n\n=== Polar preparations and Hall's death ===\nBy September 2, ''Polaris'' had reached her furthest [[Circle of latitude#Polar Circles|parallel north]], 82\u00b0 29\u2032 N.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=121}} Tension flared again as the three leading officers could not agree on whether to proceed any further. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance they would have to travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=389}} In the end, they sailed into [[Thank God Harbor]] on September&nbsp;10, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.\n\nWithin a few weeks, Hall was making preparations for a sledging trip with the aim of beating William Parry's furthest north record.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=121}} Mistrust among the men in charge showed again when Hall told Tyson that \"I cannot trust [Budington]. I want you to go with me, but don't know how to leave him alone with the ship.\"{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=121}} There is some evidence that Budington may have been an alcoholic; on at least three occasions he raided the ship's stores, including the alcohol kept by the scientists for the preservation of specimens.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=470}} Hall had complained about Budington's drunken behavior,{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=60}} and it fully came to light from the crew's testimony at the inquest following the expedition.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=269, 285}} With Tyson watching over the ship, Hall took two sleds with first mate Chester and the native guides Ipirvik and Hendrik, leaving on October&nbsp;10. \n\n[[File:The funeral of Captain Charles Francis Hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|''The Funeral of Captain Charles Francis Hall'']]\nThe day after leaving, Hall sent Hendrik back to the ship to retrieve a number of forgotten items. Hall also sent back a note to Bessels, reminding him to wind the [[chronometer watch|chronometers]] at the right time every day. In his book ''Trial by Ice'', [[Richard Lloyd Parry|Richard Parry]] postulated that such a note from the uneducated Hall must have rankled Bessels, who held a number of degrees from the [[University of Stuttgart]], [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], and [[University of Jena|Jena]]. It was another example of Hall's micromanagement of the expedition. Before he left on the overland trip, Hall gave Budington a detailed list of instructions regarding how to manage the ship in his absence.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=99}} This likely did not sit well with a sailing master with over 20&nbsp;years of experience.\n\nUpon their return on October 24, Hall suddenly fell ill after drinking a cup of coffee.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=124}} His symptoms started with an upset stomach, then progressed to vomiting and delirium the following day. Hall accused several of the ship's company, including Bessels, of having poisoned him.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=124}} Following these accusations, he refused medical treatment from Bessels, and drank only liquids delivered directly by his friend Taqulittuq.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=390}}\n\nHe seemed to improve for a few days and was even able to go up on deck.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=162}} Bessels had prevailed upon Bryan, the ship's chaplain, to convince Hall to allow the doctor to see him. By November&nbsp;4, Hall relented and Bessels resumed treatment. Shortly thereafter, Hall's condition began to deteriorate; he suffered vomiting and delirium, and collapsed.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=115}} Bessels diagnosed [[apoplexy]] before Hall finally died on November&nbsp;8. He was taken ashore and given a formal burial.{{sfn|Davis|1876|p=183}}\n\n=== Attempt at North Pole ===\nAccording to the protocol provided by Navy Secretary Robeson, command of the expedition was turned over to Budington, under whom discipline further devolved.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=341}} The precious coal was being burned at a high rate: {{convert|6334|lb}} in November, which was {{convert|1596|lb}} more than the previous month,{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=133}}and close to {{convert|8300|lb}} in December.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=139}} Budington was often seen to be drunk, but he was far from the only one to pilfer the alcohol stores; according to testimony at the inquiry, Tyson was also seen \"drunk like old mischief\", and Schumann had gone so far as to craft a duplicate of Budington's key so that he could help himself to alcohol as well.{{sfn|Loomis|2000|p=302}}\n\n[[File:Budington.jpg|thumb|left|Captain Sidney O. Budington's lackluster command contributed to the gradual breakdown of discipline]]\nWhatever the role of alcohol, it was clear that shipboard routine was breaking down; as Tyson remarked, \"There is so little regularity observed. There is no stated time for putting out lights; the men are allowed to do as they please; and, consequently, they often make nights hideous by their carousing, playing cards to all hours.\"{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=133\u2013134}} For purposes unknown, Budington chose to issue the ship's supply of firearms to the crew.{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=145}} There is some evidence of a morally questionable plan being formulated among the senior officers that winter.\n\nOn January 1, 1872, Tyson wrote in his diary: \"Last month such an astonishing proposition was made to me that I have never ceased thinking of it since&nbsp;[...] It grew out of a discussion as to the feasibility of attempting to get farther north next summer.\"{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=126}} Furthermore, Tyson was convinced, \"It is enough to make Captain Hall stir in his ice-cold grave to hear some of the talk that goes on.\"{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=174}} He revisited the subject on April&nbsp;23: \"Had a talk with Chester about the astounding proposition made to me in the winter. We agreed it was monstrous and must be prevented. Chester said he is determined, when he got home, to expose the matter.\"{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=126}} Author [[Farley Mowat]] has suggested the officers were contemplating faking a journey to the Pole, or at least to a high latitude.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=135}}\n\nWhatever the unmentioned plan was, an expedition to try for the Pole was dispatched on June&nbsp;6.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=155}} Chester led the expedition in a whaleboat, which was crushed by ice within a few miles of the ''Polaris''. Chester and his men hiked back to the ship and persuaded Budington to give them the collapsible boat.{{sfn|Blake|1874|pp=189\u2013191}} With this boat and with Tyson piloting another whaleboat, the men set out to travel north again.{{sfn|Blake|1874|pp=184\u2013185}}\n\nIn the meantime, the ''Polaris'' had found open water and was searching for a route south. Budington, not eager to spend another winter in the ice, sent Ipirvik north with orders for the Tyson and Chester: return to the ship at once.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=165}} The men were forced to abandon the boats and walk {{convert|20|mi}} back to the ''Polaris''. Now three of the ship's precious lifeboats were lost, and a fourth\u2014the small scow\u2014would be crushed by ice in July after being carelessly left out overnight. The expedition had failed in its main objective of reaching the North Pole.\n\nFrom Tyson's journal entries it appears he, Chester, and Bessels were among those with the strongest inclination to keep on pushing north. Disappointed, on August&nbsp;1, he wrote: \"What opportunities have been lost! And the expedition is to be carried back only to report a few geographical discoveries&nbsp;[...] with patience we might have worked up beyond [[Newman Bay]], and there is no telling how much farther.\"{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=192}} Exasperated by his companions' apathy and very much aware of the fact that they may never again find themselves presented with an opportunity as good as the one were currently facing, Tyson added: \"{{as written|Some one}} will some day reach the pole, and I envy not those who have prevented ''Polaris'' having that chance.\"{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=192}}\n\n=== Fate of the ''Polaris'' and journeys home ===\nWith the expedition's main goal abandoned, the ''Polaris'' turned south for home. In Smith Sound, west of the [[Humboldt Glacier]], she ran aground on a shallow iceberg and could not be freed. On the night of October 15, with an iceberg threatening the ship, Schuman reported that water was coming in and the pumps could not keep up.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=396}} Budington ordered cargo to be thrown onto the ice to buoy the ship. Men began throwing goods overboard, as Tyson put it, \"with no care taken as to how or where these things were thrown.\"{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=126}} Much of the jettisoned cargo was lost.\n\n[[File:Nnpeussp41.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The breaking up of the ice pack]]\nA number of the crew were out on the surrounding ice during the night when a break-up of the pack occurred. When morning came, the group, consisting of Tyson, Meyer, six of the seamen, the cook, the steward, and all of the Inuit, found themselves stranded on an [[Drift ice|ice floe]].{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=199\u2013200}} The castaways could see the ''Polaris'' {{convert|8|to|10|mi|km|spell=in}} away, but attempts to attract the ship's attention with a large black cloth were futile.\n\nResigned to the ice, the Inuit soon had igloo shelters built, and Tyson estimated that they had {{convert|1900|lb}} of food.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=398}} They also had the ship's two whaleboats, and two kayaks, although one kayak was soon lost during a breakup of the ice.{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=526\u2013527}} Meyer reckoned that they were drifting on the Greenland side of the [[Davis Strait]] and would soon be within rowing distance of [[Disko Island]]. He was incorrect; the men were actually on the Canadian side of the strait. The error caused the men to reject Tyson's plans for conserving. The seamen soon broke up one of the whaleboats for firewood, making a safe escape to land unlikely.\n\nOne night in November, the men went on an eating binge, consuming a large quantity of the food stores.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=398}} The group drifted over {{convert|1800|mi}} on the ice floe for the next six months,{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=152}} before being rescued off the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] by the whaler {{USS|Tigress|1871|2}} on April 30, 1873.{{sfn|Davis|1876|p=572}} All probably would have perished had the group not included the skilled Inuit hunters Ipirvik and Hendrik, who were able to kill seal on a number of occasions.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=399}}\n\nOn October 16, 1872, with the ship's coal stores running low, Budington decided to run the ''Polaris'' aground near [[Etah, Greenland|Etah]]. Having lost much of their bedding, clothing, and food when it was haphazardly jettisoned from the ship on October 12, the remaining 14 men were in poor condition to face another winter. They built a hut from lumber salvaged from the ship, and on October 24, extinguished the ship's boilers to conserve coal. The bilge pumps stopped for good, and the ship heeled over on her side, half out of the water.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Fortunately, the Etah Inuit helped the men survive the winter.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=155}} After wintering ashore, the crew built two boats from salvaged wood from the ship, and on June 3, 1873, the crew sailed south. They were spotted and rescued by the whaler {{SS|Ravenscraig||2}} in July, and returned home via Scotland.{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=511\u2013519}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n=== Inquiry ===\n[[File:Emil Bessels 1880 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Based on circumstantial evidence, [[Emil Bessels]] is nevertheless strongly suspected of having killed Hall by means of [[arsenic poisoning]]]]\nOn June 5, 1873, a [[United States Navy]] board of inquiry began. At this time, the crew and Inuit families had been rescued from the ice floe, however, the fate of Budington, Bessels, and the remainder of the crew was still unknown. The board consisted of Admiral [[Louis M. Goldsborough]], Navy Secretary [[George M. Robeson]], Commodore [[William Reynolds (naval officer)|William Reynolds]], Army Captain [[Henry W. Howgate]], and [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]].{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=265}}\n\nTyson was the first to appear for questioning and related the friction between Hall, Budington, and Bessels, and Hall's deathbed accusations of poisoning.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=472}} The board also inquired about the whereabouts of Hall's journals and records. Tyson responded that while Hall was delirious, he instructed Budington to burn some of the papers, and the rest had disappeared.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=266\u2013267}} Later, journals of other crew members were discovered at the site of the ''Polaris'' wreck, but these had the sections regarding Hall's death cut out.{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=156}} Meyer testified to Budington's drinking, saying that the sailing master was \"drunk most always while we were going southward\".{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=269}} \n\nSteward John Herron testified that he had not made the coffee that Hall had suspected of being laced with poison; he explained that the cook made the coffee and that he had not kept track of how many people had touched the cup before it was brought to Hall.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=272}} After Budington and the remainder of the crew were rescued and returned to the United States, the board of inquiry continued. Budington attacked Tyson's credibility, disputing Tyson's claim that he had obstructed Hall's efforts to sail the ship further north. He also disputed reports of his drinking, saying that he \"[made] it a practice to drink but very little\".{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=285}} \n\nBessels was questioned about Hall's cause of death. Bessels stated that \"My idea of the cause of the first attack is that he had been exposed to very low temperature during the time that he was on the sledge journey. He came back and entered a warm cabin without taking off his heavy fur clothing, and then took a warm cup of coffee. And anyone knows what the consequences of that might be.\"{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=290}} Bessels testified that Hall was \"taken by [[hemiplegia]]\", and his left arm and side were paralyzed, and that he had injected Hall with [[quinine]] to correct his elevated temperature before he died.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=291\u2013292}}\n\nFaced with conflicting testimony, lack of official records and journals, and no body for an autopsy, no charges were laid in connection with Hall's death. In the inquiry's final report, the surgeons general of the Army and Navy wrote: \"From the circumstances and symptoms detailed by him, and comparing them with the medical testimony of all the witnesses, we are conclusively of the opinion that Captain Hall died from natural causes\u2014''viz.'', apoplexy\u2014and that the treatment of the case by Dr.&nbsp;Bessels was the best practicable under the circumstances.\"{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=182\u2013183}}\n\n=== Controversy ===\nThere has been speculation as to why Budington and the men aboard the ''Polaris'' did not attempt a rescue of those stranded on the ice floe. Tyson was perplexed as to why the ship could not see them {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} distant, a group of men and supplies waving a dark-colored flag in a sea of white.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=133}} The day after the storm was clear and calm and the men on the floe could see the ship was under both steam and sail. Aboard the ship, first mate Chester reported that he could see \"provisions and stores\" on a distant floe,{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=133}} however there were never any orders to retrieve the stores or search for the castaways.\n\n[[File:The Burial of Captain Hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''The Burial of Captain Hall'']]\nBudington's decision to beach the ''Polaris'' is equally controversial. Budington said that he \"believed the propeller was smashed and the rudder broke\".{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=154}} The official report of the expedition states that the vessel should have been abandoned because \"there was only coal enough to keep the fires alive for a few days.\"{{sfn|Davis|1876|p=442}}\n\nHowever, the same report states that the propeller and rudder were in fact discovered to be intact after the ship was run aground, and the ship's boiler and sails were available.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=154}} Even if she ran out of coal, the ship was perfectly able to travel under sail alone. In defense of Budington's decision, when low tide exposed the ship's hull, the men found that the [[Stem (ship)|stem]] had completely broken away at the six-foot mark, taking iron sheeting and planking with it. Budington wrote in his journal that he \"called the officer's attention to it, {{as written|who only wondered she had kept afloat so long\".}}{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=211}}\n\nRegarding Hall's fate, the official investigation that followed ruled the cause of death was [[apoplexy]] (an early term for stroke).{{sfn|Henderson|2001|p=280}} Some of Hall's symptoms\u2014partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium\u2014certainly fit that diagnosis.{{sfn|Henderson|2001|p=85}} Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke.{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=138}}\n\nHowever, in 1968, while working on Hall's biography, ''Weird and Tragic Shores'', [[Chauncey C. Loomis]] became sufficiently intrigued by the possibility that Hall might have been poisoned, and applied for a permit to visit [[Thank God Harbor]] to exhume Hall's body and to perform an autopsy.{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=537}} Because of the [[permafrost]], Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing, and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails, and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of [[arsenic trioxide|arsenic]] in the last two weeks of his life.{{sfn|Barr|2016|pp=538\u2013539}}\n\nAcute [[arsenic poisoning]] appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, dehydration, stupor, and [[mania]].{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=390}} Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach.{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=140}} It also appears that at least three of the crew\u2014Budington, Meyer, and Bessels\u2014expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=392}} In ''The Arctic Grail'', [[Pierre Berton]] suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time.{{sfn|Berton|1988|pp=380\u2013392}} \n\nHowever, it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition; possibly Bessels, who was in near-constant attendance of Hall after he had taken sick. Furthermore, Bessels and Hall appear to have vied for the attention of sculptor [[Vinnie Ream]] \u2013 Bessels more so than Hall, the latter of whom Ream evidently preferred.{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=541}} While the ''Polaris'' was outfitted in Washington and New York, both were known to sometimes associate with Ream.{{sfn|Cooper|2004|p=160}} Just before their departure to the Arctic, Bessels expressed his desire to see Ream again in a letter.{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=541}} Envy towards Hall over Ream's affections could be construed as motive. No charges were ever filed, however.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=392}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Arctic expeditions]]\n** The [[Second Grinnell Expedition|Second Grinnell expedition]] of 1853\u20131855: set out to determine the fate of [[Franklin's lost expedition|Franklin's expedition]]\n** The [[Frederick Schwatka#Search for Franklin's expedition|Schwatka expedition]] of 1878\u20131880: conclusively determined the fate of Franklin's expedition\n** The [[Jeannette Expedition|''Jeannette'' expedition]] of 1879\u20131881: ill-fated attempt to reach the North Pole via the [[Bering Strait]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|15em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n |last         = Barr\n |first        = W.\n |authorlink   = William Barr (Arctic historian)\n |date         = 2016\n |title        = Polaris: The Chief Scientist's Recollections of the American North Pole Expedition\n |url          = https://press.ucalgary.ca/books/9781552388754\n |publisher    = [[UCalgary Press]]\n |isbn         = 9781552388754\n |ref          = harv\n}} {{open access}}\n*{{cite book\n |last         = Berton\n |first        = P.

The expedition's notable achievement was reaching 82\u00b0 29\u2032 N by ship, a record at the time.\n\nThe expedition was commanded by the experienced and self-taught Arctic explorer [[Charles Francis Hall]], who had previously lived among the [[Inuit]] in the Arctic region while on his obsessive quest to determine the fate of [[Franklin's lost expedition]] of 1845. Hall possessed the necessary survival skills, but lacked an academic background, and had no experience leading men and commanding a ship. He had managed to secure the position of expedition commander based on his authority on the subject of the Arctic.\n\n{{USS|Polaris|1871|2}} departed from [[New York City|New York]] in June&nbsp;1871. Barely underway, the expedition already found itself hampered by poor leadership. Insubordination loomed, mainly at the instigation of chief scientist [[Emil Bessels]] and meteorologist Frederick Meyer\u2014both German\u2014who looked down on what they perceived to be their unqualified commander. Bessels and Meyer were supported by the German half of the crew, further increasing tensions among a crew that was already divided by nationality.\n\nBy October, the men were wintering in [[Thank God Harbor]], on the shore of northern [[Greenland]], and making preparations for the trip to the Pole. Hall returned to the ship from an exploratory sledging journey to a fjord he named [[Newman Bay]], and promptly fell ill. Before he died, he accused members of the crew of orchestrating his murder, an accusation especially directed at Bessels. On the way southward, 19&nbsp;members of the expedition became separated from the ship and drifted on an ice floe for six months and {{convert|1800|mi}}, before being rescued. The damaged ''Polaris'' was run aground and wrecked near [[Etah, Greenland|Etah]] in October&nbsp;1872. The remaining men were able to survive the winter and were rescued the following summer.\n\nA naval board of inquiry investigated Hall's death, but no charges were ever laid. However, an exhumation of his body in 1968 revealed he had ingested a large quantity of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Coupled with recently-discovered affectionate letters written by both Hall and Bessels to [[Vinnie Ream]], a young sculptor they met in New York while waiting for ''Polaris'' to be outfitted, suggests Bessels had a motive, besides the means, to kill Hall.\n\n== Preparations ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Charles Francis Hall only known photo (cropped).jpg|thumb|The only known photograph of [[Charles Francis Hall]], in late 1870]]\nIn 1827, Sir [[William Edward Parry]] led a British [[Royal Navy]] expedition with the aim to be the first men to reach the North Pole.{{sfn|Berton|1988|pp=97\u2013102}} In the next five decades following Parry's attempt, the Americans would mount three such expeditions: [[Elisha Kent Kane]] in {{nowr|1853\u20131855}},{{sfn|Fleming|2011|pp=10\u201349}} [[Isaac Israel Hayes]] in 1860\u20131861,{{sfn|Fleming|2011|pp=62\u201378}} and [[Charles Francis Hall]] with the {{USS|Polaris|1871|2}} in 1871\u20131873.\n\nHall was a [[Cincinnati]] businessman with no notable academic background or sailing experience. He previously worked as a blacksmith, engraver, and for a couple of years he published his own newspaper&nbsp;\u2013 the ''Cincinnati Occasional'' (later renamed the ''Daily&nbsp;Press''&thinsp;).{{sfn|Loomis|2000|p=32}} Energetic and enterprising, he enthusiastically wrote about the latest technological innovations; he was fascinated by hot-air-balloon travel and praised the new [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].{{sfn|Loomis|2000|pp=32\u201334}} He was also a voracious reader especially captivated by the Arctic. His focus was directed towards the region around 1857, after it had slowly dawned on society that [[Franklin's lost expedition|Franklin's Arctic expedition]] of 1845, in all likelihood, would never be coming home.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=345}}\n\nHe spent the next few years studying the reports of previous explorers and trying to raise money for an expedition. As a result of his charisma and personality, he was able to eventually launch two solo expeditions in search of Franklin and his crew; [[Charles Francis Hall#First|one in 1860]], and a [[Charles Francis Hall#Second|second in 1864]]. These experiences established him as a seasoned Arctic explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the [[Inuit]] people.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=15}} The renown he gained allowed him to convince the U.S. Government to finance a third expedition; an attempt on the North Pole.{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=19\u201321}}\n\n=== Finance and materiel ===\nIn 1870, the [[U.S. Senate]] introduced a bill in [[United States Congress|Congress]] to fund an expedition to the North Pole. Hall, aided by Navy Secretary [[George M. Robeson]], successfully lobbied for, and received, a $50,000&nbsp;grant to command the expedition.{{sfn|Davis|1876|p=43}} He began recruiting personnel in late 1870.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=113}}\n\nHe secured the Navy tugboat ''Periwinkle'', a 387-ton screw-propelled steamer. At the [[Washington Navy Yard]], the ship was fitted as a fore-topsail schooner, and renamed {{USS|Polaris|1871|2}}.{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=28\u201329}} She was prepared for Arctic service by the addition of solid oak timber all over her hull, and the bow was sheathed in iron. A new engine was added, and one of the boilers was retrofitted to burn seal or whale oil.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=24\u201327}}\n\nThe ship was also outfitted with four [[whaleboat]]s, {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide|spell=in}}, and a flat-bottomed [[scow]]. During his previous Arctic expeditions, Hall came to admire the Inuit [[umiak]]\u2014a type of open boat made of driftwood, whalebone, and walrus- or seal skins\u2014and brought a similarly constructed collapsible boat which could hold 20 people.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=26}} Food packed on board consisted of tinned ham, salted beef, bread, and sailor's biscuit. They intended to prevent scurvy by supplementing their diet with fresh muskox, seal, and polar bear meat.{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=283\u2013284}}\n\n=== Personnel ===\nIn July 1870, U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] appointed Hall as the expedition's overall commander, to be referred to as captain.{{sfn|Grant|1870|p=209}} Although Hall had abundant Arctic experience, he had no sailing experience, and the title was purely honorary.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=384}} In selecting officers and seamen, Hall relied heavily on whalers with experience in Arctic waters.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=385}} This was markedly different from the polar expeditions of the [[British Admiralty]], who tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.\n\nFor his selection of [[Captain (nautical)|sailing master]], Hall first turned to Sidney O. Budington, then to George E. Tyson. Both initially declined due to prior whaling commitments. When those commitments\u2014Budington's first, followed by Tyson's\u2014fell through, Hall named Budington as sailing master and Tyson as assistant navigator.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=384}} Budington and Tyson had decades of experience captaining whaling vessels between the two of them. In effect, the ''Polaris'' now had three captains, a fact which would weigh heavily on the fate of the expedition. To further complicate matters, Budington and Hall had quarreled before, in 1863, during Hall's earlier search of Franklin's lost expedition. At the time, Budington had denied permission for Hall to bring north his Inuit guides, [[Ipirvik]] and [[Taqulittuq]], whom had taken ill and were in the Budingtons' care.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nThe remaining personnel was composed of Americans and Germans, as well as a Dane and a Swede&nbsp;\u2013 both of whom closely associated with the Germans. First mate Hubbard Chester, second mate William Morton, astronomer and chaplain Richard Bryan, and second engineer Alvin Odell\u2014among others\u2014were American. Chief scientist and surgeon [[Emil Bessels]] and chief engineer Emil Schumann were German, as were most of the seamen.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=385}} Meteorologist Frederick Meyer was a German-born sergeant from the [[U.S. Signal Corps]].{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=130}}\n\nIn addition to the 25&nbsp;officers, crew, and scientific staff, Hall brought along his native companions whose assistance he had relied on during his earlier expeditions; guide and hunter Ipirvik, interpreter and seamstress Taqulittuq, as well as their infant son.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=117}} Later, at [[Upernavik]], also joining their ranks would be [[Hans Hendrik]],{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=146}} the esteemed [[Greenlandic Inuk]] hunter previously employed by [[Elisha Kent Kane]] and [[Isaac Israel Hayes]] on their respective expeditions, and whose expertise had been crucial to their survival, helping ward off starvation.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=89}} Throwing his weight around, Hans, wrote Bessels, \"refused to see that his [wife] and their children were extremely unwelcome extras on such an undertaking.\"{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=101}} Reluctant to increase their number with \"four useless mouths,\"{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=101}} Hall aquiesced, so that now, besides Hans' wife, added to their complement were three young children.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=146}}\n\n== Expedition ==\n\n=== New York to Upernavik ===\n[[File:Polaris Expedition route.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Route of the ''Polaris'' expedition, 1871\u20131873]]\nEven before leaving the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] on June 29, 1871, the expedition ran into personnel troubles. The cook, a seaman, a fireman, and assistant engineer deserted. The steward turned out to be a drunk and was left in port.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=48}} The ship stopped in [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], to pick up a replacement assistant engineer, and left on July&nbsp;3. By the time the ship reached [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], there was dissension among the officers and scientific staff. Bessels, backed by Meyer, had openly rejected Hall's command over the scientific staff.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=51}}{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=134}} The dissension spread to the crew, which was divided by nationality.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=387}}\n\nIn his diary, Tyson wrote that by the time they reached [[Disko Island]], \"[...]&nbsp;expressions are freely made that Hall shall not get any credit out of this expedition. Already some have made up their minds how far they will go and when they will get home again.\"{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=120}} Hall asked Captain Henry K. Davenport of the supply ship {{USS|Congress|1868|6}} to intervene. Davenport threatened to have Meyer shackled for insubordination and sent back to the United States, at which point all of the Germans threatened to quit. Hall and Davenport were forced to back down, although Davenport delivered a strongly worded speech on naval discipline to the crew.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=387}}\n\nIn another open display of dissent, the ship's boilers had been tampered with by one of the crew. The special blubber-fired boilers had disappeared, apparently thrown overboard.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=61}} On August 18, the ship reached [[Upernavik]] on Greenland's west coast, where they picked up Inuit hunter and interpreter Hans Hendrik. The ''Polaris'' proceeded north through [[Smith Sound]] and the [[Nares Strait]], passing the previous furthest north by ship records held of [[Elisha Kent Kane]] and [[Isaac Israel Hayes]].\n\n=== Polar preparations and Hall's death ===\nBy September 2, ''Polaris'' had reached her furthest [[Circle of latitude#Polar Circles|parallel north]], 82\u00b0 29\u2032 N.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=121}} Tension flared again as the three leading officers could not agree on whether to proceed any further. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance they would have to travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=389}} In the end, they sailed into [[Thank God Harbor]] on September&nbsp;10, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.\n\nWithin a few weeks, Hall was making preparations for a sledging trip with the aim of beating William Parry's furthest north record.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=121}} Mistrust among the men in charge showed again when Hall told Tyson that \"I cannot trust [Budington]. I want you to go with me, but don't know how to leave him alone with the ship.\"{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=121}} There is some evidence that Budington may have been an alcoholic; on at least three occasions he raided the ship's stores, including the alcohol kept by the scientists for the preservation of specimens.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=470}} Hall had complained about Budington's drunken behavior,{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=60}} and it fully came to light from the crew's testimony at the inquest following the expedition.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=269, 285}} With Tyson watching over the ship, Hall took two sleds with first mate Chester and the native guides Ipirvik and Hendrik, leaving on October&nbsp;10. \n\n[[File:The funeral of Captain Charles Francis Hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|''The Funeral of Captain Charles Francis Hall'']]\nThe day after leaving, Hall sent Hendrik back to the ship to retrieve a number of forgotten items. Hall also sent back a note to Bessels, reminding him to wind the [[chronometer watch|chronometers]] at the right time every day. In his book ''Trial by Ice'', [[Richard Lloyd Parry|Richard Parry]] postulated that such a note from the uneducated Hall must have rankled Bessels, who held a number of degrees from the [[University of Stuttgart]], [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], and [[University of Jena|Jena]]. It was another example of Hall's micromanagement of the expedition. Before he left on the overland trip, Hall gave Budington a detailed list of instructions regarding how to manage the ship in his absence.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=99}} This likely did not sit well with a sailing master with over 20&nbsp;years of experience.\n\nUpon their return on October 24, Hall suddenly fell ill after drinking a cup of coffee.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=124}} His symptoms started with an upset stomach, then progressed to vomiting and delirium the following day. Hall accused several of the ship's company, including Bessels, of having poisoned him.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=124}} Following these accusations, he refused medical treatment from Bessels, and drank only liquids delivered directly by his friend Taqulittuq.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=390}}\n\nHe seemed to improve for a few days and was even able to go up on deck.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=162}} Bessels had prevailed upon Bryan, the ship's chaplain, to convince Hall to allow the doctor to see him. By November&nbsp;4, Hall relented and Bessels resumed treatment. Shortly thereafter, Hall's condition began to deteriorate; he suffered vomiting and delirium, and collapsed.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=115}} Bessels diagnosed [[apoplexy]] before Hall finally died on November&nbsp;8. He was taken ashore and given a formal burial.{{sfn|Davis|1876|p=183}}\n\n=== Attempt at North Pole ===\nAccording to the protocol provided by Navy Secretary Robeson, command of the expedition was turned over to Budington, under whom discipline further devolved.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=341}} The precious coal was being burned at a high rate: {{convert|6334|lb}} in November, which was {{convert|1596|lb}} more than the previous month,{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=133}}and close to {{convert|8300|lb}} in December.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=139}} Budington was often seen to be drunk, but he was far from the only one to pilfer the alcohol stores; according to testimony at the inquiry, Tyson was also seen \"drunk like old mischief\", and Schumann had gone so far as to craft a duplicate of Budington's key so that he could help himself to alcohol as well.{{sfn|Loomis|2000|p=302}}\n\n[[File:Budington.jpg|thumb|left|Captain Sidney O. Budington's lackluster command contributed to the gradual breakdown of discipline]]\nWhatever the role of alcohol, it was clear that shipboard routine was breaking down; as Tyson remarked, \"There is so little regularity observed. There is no stated time for putting out lights; the men are allowed to do as they please; and, consequently, they often make nights hideous by their carousing, playing cards to all hours.\"{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=133\u2013134}} For purposes unknown, Budington chose to issue the ship's supply of firearms to the crew.{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=145}} There is some evidence of a morally questionable plan being formulated among the senior officers that winter.\n\nOn January 1, 1872, Tyson wrote in his diary: \"Last month such an astonishing proposition was made to me that I have never ceased thinking of it since&nbsp;[...] It grew out of a discussion as to the feasibility of attempting to get farther north next summer.\"{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=126}} Furthermore, Tyson was convinced, \"It is enough to make Captain Hall stir in his ice-cold grave to hear some of the talk that goes on.\"{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=174}} He revisited the subject on April&nbsp;23: \"Had a talk with Chester about the astounding proposition made to me in the winter. We agreed it was monstrous and must be prevented. Chester said he is determined, when he got home, to expose the matter.\"{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=126}} Author [[Farley Mowat]] has suggested the officers were contemplating faking a journey to the Pole, or at least to a high latitude.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=135}}\n\nWhatever the unmentioned plan was, an expedition to try for the Pole was dispatched on June&nbsp;6.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=155}} Chester led the expedition in a whaleboat, which was crushed by ice within a few miles of the ''Polaris''. Chester and his men hiked back to the ship and persuaded Budington to give them the collapsible boat.{{sfn|Blake|1874|pp=189\u2013191}} With this boat and with Tyson piloting another whaleboat, the men set out to travel north again.{{sfn|Blake|1874|pp=184\u2013185}}\n\nIn the meantime, the ''Polaris'' had found open water and was searching for a route south. Budington, not eager to spend another winter in the ice, sent Ipirvik north with orders for the Tyson and Chester: return to the ship at once.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=165}} The men were forced to abandon the boats and walk {{convert|20|mi}} back to the ''Polaris''. Now three of the ship's precious lifeboats were lost, and a fourth\u2014the small scow\u2014would be crushed by ice in July after being carelessly left out overnight. The expedition had failed in its main objective of reaching the North Pole.\n\nFrom Tyson's journal entries it appears he, Chester, and Bessels were among those with the strongest inclination to keep on pushing north. Disappointed, on August&nbsp;1, he wrote: \"What opportunities have been lost! And the expedition is to be carried back only to report a few geographical discoveries&nbsp;[...] with patience we might have worked up beyond [[Newman Bay]], and there is no telling how much farther.\"{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=192}} Exasperated by his companions' apathy and very much aware of the fact that they may never again find themselves presented with an opportunity as good as the one were currently facing, Tyson added: \"{{as written|Some one}} will some day reach the pole, and I envy not those who have prevented ''Polaris'' having that chance.\"{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=192}}\n\n=== Fate of the ''Polaris'' and journeys home ===\nWith the expedition's main goal abandoned, the ''Polaris'' turned south for home. In Smith Sound, west of the [[Humboldt Glacier]], she ran aground on a shallow iceberg and could not be freed. On the night of October 15, with an iceberg threatening the ship, Schuman reported that water was coming in and the pumps could not keep up.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=396}} Budington ordered cargo to be thrown onto the ice to buoy the ship. Men began throwing goods overboard, as Tyson put it, \"with no care taken as to how or where these things were thrown.\"{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=126}} Much of the jettisoned cargo was lost.\n\n[[File:Nnpeussp41.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The breaking up of the ice pack]]\nA number of the crew were out on the surrounding ice during the night when a break-up of the pack occurred. When morning came, the group, consisting of Tyson, Meyer, six of the seamen, the cook, the steward, and all of the Inuit, found themselves stranded on an [[Drift ice|ice floe]].{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=199\u2013200}} The castaways could see the ''Polaris'' {{convert|8|to|10|mi|km|spell=in}} away, but attempts to attract the ship's attention with a large black cloth were futile.\n\nResigned to the ice, the Inuit soon had igloo shelters built, and Tyson estimated that they had {{convert|1900|lb}} of food.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=398}} They also had the ship's two whaleboats, and two kayaks, although one kayak was soon lost during a breakup of the ice.{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=526\u2013527}} Meyer reckoned that they were drifting on the Greenland side of the [[Davis Strait]] and would soon be within rowing distance of [[Disko Island]]. He was incorrect; the men were actually on the Canadian side of the strait. The error caused the men to reject Tyson's plans for conserving. The seamen soon broke up one of the whaleboats for firewood, making a safe escape to land unlikely.\n\nOne night in November, the men went on an eating binge, consuming a large quantity of the food stores.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=398}} The group drifted over {{convert|1800|mi}} on the ice floe for the next six months,{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=152}} before being rescued off the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] by the whaler {{USS|Tigress|1871|2}} on April 30, 1873.{{sfn|Davis|1876|p=572}} All probably would have perished had the group not included the skilled Inuit hunters Ipirvik and Hendrik, who were able to kill seal on a number of occasions.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=399}}\n\nOn October 16, 1872, with the ship's coal stores running low, Budington decided to run the ''Polaris'' aground near [[Etah, Greenland|Etah]]. Having lost much of their bedding, clothing, and food when it was haphazardly jettisoned from the ship on October 12, the remaining 14 men were in poor condition to face another winter. They built a hut from lumber salvaged from the ship, and on October 24, extinguished the ship's boilers to conserve coal. The bilge pumps stopped for good, and the ship heeled over on her side, half out of the water.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Fortunately, the Etah Inuit helped the men survive the winter.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=155}} After wintering ashore, the crew built two boats from salvaged wood from the ship, and on June 3, 1873, the crew sailed south. They were spotted and rescued by the whaler {{SS|Ravenscraig||2}} in July, and returned home via Scotland.{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=511\u2013519}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n=== Inquiry ===\n[[File:Emil Bessels 1880 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Based on circumstantial evidence, [[Emil Bessels]] is nevertheless strongly suspected of having killed Hall by means of [[arsenic poisoning]]]]\nOn June 5, 1873, a [[United States Navy]] board of inquiry began. At this time, the crew and Inuit families had been rescued from the ice floe, however, the fate of Budington, Bessels, and the remainder of the crew was still unknown. The board consisted of Admiral [[Louis M. Goldsborough]], Navy Secretary [[George M. Robeson]], Commodore [[William Reynolds (naval officer)|William Reynolds]], Army Captain [[Henry W. Howgate]], and [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]].{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=265}}\n\nTyson was the first to appear for questioning and related the friction between Hall, Budington, and Bessels, and Hall's deathbed accusations of poisoning.{{sfn|Blake|1874|p=472}} The board also inquired about the whereabouts of Hall's journals and records. Tyson responded that while Hall was delirious, he instructed Budington to burn some of the papers, and the rest had disappeared.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=266\u2013267}} Later, journals of other crew members were discovered at the site of the ''Polaris'' wreck, but these had the sections regarding Hall's death cut out.{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=156}} Meyer testified to Budington's drinking, saying that the sailing master was \"drunk most always while we were going southward\".{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=269}} \n\nSteward John Herron testified that he had not made the coffee that Hall had suspected of being laced with poison; he explained that the cook made the coffee and that he had not kept track of how many people had touched the cup before it was brought to Hall.{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=272}} After Budington and the remainder of the crew were rescued and returned to the United States, the board of inquiry continued. Budington attacked Tyson's credibility, disputing Tyson's claim that he had obstructed Hall's efforts to sail the ship further north. He also disputed reports of his drinking, saying that he \"[made] it a practice to drink but very little\".{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=285}} \n\nBessels was questioned about Hall's cause of death. Bessels stated that \"My idea of the cause of the first attack is that he had been exposed to very low temperature during the time that he was on the sledge journey. He came back and entered a warm cabin without taking off his heavy fur clothing, and then took a warm cup of coffee. And anyone knows what the consequences of that might be.\"{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=290}} Bessels testified that Hall was \"taken by [[hemiplegia]]\", and his left arm and side were paralyzed, and that he had injected Hall with [[quinine]] to correct his elevated temperature before he died.{{sfn|Parry|2009|pp=291\u2013292}}\n\nFaced with conflicting testimony, lack of official records and journals, and no body for an autopsy, no charges were laid in connection with Hall's death. In the inquiry's final report, the surgeons general of the Army and Navy wrote: \"From the circumstances and symptoms detailed by him, and comparing them with the medical testimony of all the witnesses, we are conclusively of the opinion that Captain Hall died from natural causes\u2014''viz.'', apoplexy\u2014and that the treatment of the case by Dr.&nbsp;Bessels was the best practicable under the circumstances.\"{{sfn|Davis|1876|pp=182\u2013183}}\n\n=== Controversy ===\nThere has been speculation as to why Budington and the men aboard the ''Polaris'' did not attempt a rescue of those stranded on the ice floe. Tyson was perplexed as to why the ship could not see them {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} distant, a group of men and supplies waving a dark-colored flag in a sea of white.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=133}} The day after the storm was clear and calm and the men on the floe could see the ship was under both steam and sail. Aboard the ship, first mate Chester reported that he could see \"provisions and stores\" on a distant floe,{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=133}} however there were never any orders to retrieve the stores or search for the castaways.\n\n[[File:The Burial of Captain Hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''The Burial of Captain Hall'']]\nBudington's decision to beach the ''Polaris'' is equally controversial. Budington said that he \"believed the propeller was smashed and the rudder broke\".{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=154}} The official report of the expedition states that the vessel should have been abandoned because \"there was only coal enough to keep the fires alive for a few days.\"{{sfn|Davis|1876|p=442}}\n\nHowever, the same report states that the propeller and rudder were in fact discovered to be intact after the ship was run aground, and the ship's boiler and sails were available.{{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=154}} Even if she ran out of coal, the ship was perfectly able to travel under sail alone. In defense of Budington's decision, when low tide exposed the ship's hull, the men found that the [[Stem (ship)|stem]] had completely broken away at the six-foot mark, taking iron sheeting and planking with it. Budington wrote in his journal that he \"called the officer's attention to it, {{as written|who only wondered she had kept afloat so long\".}}{{sfn|Parry|2009|p=211}}\n\nRegarding Hall's fate, the official investigation that followed ruled the cause of death was [[apoplexy]] (an early term for stroke).{{sfn|Henderson|2001|p=280}} Some of Hall's symptoms\u2014partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium\u2014certainly fit that diagnosis.{{sfn|Henderson|2001|p=85}} Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke.{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=138}}\n\nHowever, in 1968, while working on Hall's biography, ''Weird and Tragic Shores'', [[Chauncey C. Loomis]] became sufficiently intrigued by the possibility that Hall might have been poisoned, and applied for a permit to visit [[Thank God Harbor]] to exhume Hall's body and to perform an autopsy.{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=537}} Because of the [[permafrost]], Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing, and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails, and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of [[arsenic trioxide|arsenic]] in the last two weeks of his life.{{sfn|Barr|2016|pp=538\u2013539}}\n\nAcute [[arsenic poisoning]] appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, dehydration, stupor, and [[mania]].{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=390}} Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach.{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=140}} It also appears that at least three of the crew\u2014Budington, Meyer, and Bessels\u2014expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=392}} In ''The Arctic Grail'', [[Pierre Berton]] suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time.{{sfn|Berton|1988|pp=380\u2013392}} \n\nHowever, it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition; possibly Bessels, who was in near-constant attendance of Hall after he had taken sick. Furthermore, Bessels and Hall appear to have vied for the attention of sculptor [[Vinnie Ream]] \u2013 Bessels more so than Hall, the latter of whom Ream evidently preferred.{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=541}} While the ''Polaris'' was outfitted in Washington and New York, both were known to sometimes associate with Ream.{{sfn|Cooper|2004|p=160}} Just before their departure to the Arctic, Bessels expressed his desire to see Ream again in a letter.{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=541}} Envy towards Hall over Ream's affections could be construed as motive. No charges were ever filed, however.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=392}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Arctic expeditions]]\n** The [[Second Grinnell Expedition|Second Grinnell expedition]] of 1853\u20131855: set out to determine the fate of [[Franklin's lost expedition|Franklin's expedition]]\n** The [[Frederick Schwatka#Search for Franklin's expedition|Schwatka expedition]] of 1878\u20131880: conclusively determined the fate of Franklin's expedition\n** The [[Jeannette Expedition|''Jeannette'' expedition]] of 1879\u20131881: ill-fated attempt to reach the North Pole via the [[Bering Strait]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|15em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n |last         = Barr\n |first        = W.\n |authorlink   = William Barr (Arctic historian)\n |date         = 2016\n |title        = Polaris: The Chief Scientist's Recollections of the American North Pole Expedition\n |url          = https://press.ucalgary.ca/books/9781552388754\n |publisher    = [[UCalgary Press]]\n |isbn         = 9781552388754\n |ref          = harv\n}} {{open access}}\n*{{cite book\n |last         = Berton\n |first        = P.

One measure of the debt burden is its size relative to GDP, called the \"[[debt-to-GDP ratio]].\" Mathematically, this is the debt divided by the GDP amount. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] includes historical budget and debt tables along with its annual \"Budget and Economic Outlook.\" Debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP rose from 34.7% GDP in 2000 to 40.5% in 2008 and 67.7% in 2011.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42905 CBO \u2013 The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022 \u2013 See Historical Budget Data Supplement], Cbo.gov, January 2012.</ref>\n\nMathematically, the ratio can decrease even while debt grows if the rate of increase in GDP (which also takes account of inflation) is higher than the rate of increase of debt. Conversely, the debt to GDP ratio can increase even while debt is being reduced, if the decline in GDP is sufficient.\n\nAccording to the ''CIA World Factbook'', during 2015, the U.S. debt to GDP ratio of 73.6% was the 39th highest in the world. This was measured using \"debt held by the public.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html|title=The World Factbook |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref> However, $1 trillion in additional borrowing since the end of FY 2015 has raised the ratio to 76.2% as of April 2016 [See Appendix#National debt for selected years]. Also, this number excludes state and local debt. According to the OECD, general government gross debt (federal, state, and local) in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $22.5 trillion (125% of GDP); subtracting out $5.25 trillion for intergovernmental federal debt to count only federal \"debt held by the public\" gives 96% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web|author=OECD |url=http://stats.oecd.org/ |title=OECD Statistics |website=Stats.oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>\n\nThe ratio is higher if the total national debt is used, by adding the \"intragovernmental debt\" to the \"debt held by the public.\" For example, on April 29, 2016, debt held by the public was approximately $13.84 trillion or about 76% of GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5.35 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of $19.19 trillion. U.S. GDP for the previous 12 months was approximately $18.15 trillion, for a total debt to GDP ratio of approximately 106%.<ref>Multiple references:\n* [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np Debt to the Penny (Daily History Search Application)]\n* [http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass_roundup/2012/09/us-national-debt.html US national debt surpasses $16 trillion] \u2013 Boston Business Journal\n* United States Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (December 2010).

However, there is complexity in the budgetary computations that can make the deficit figure commonly reported in the media (the \"total deficit\") considerably different from the annual increase in the debt. The major categories of differences are the treatment of the Social Security program, Treasury borrowing, and supplemental appropriations outside the budget process.<ref name=CBO_2009/>\n\nSocial Security payroll taxes and benefit payments, along with the net balance of the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]], are considered \"off-budget\", while most other expenditure and receipt categories are considered \"on-budget\". The total federal deficit is the sum of the on-budget deficit (or surplus) and the off-budget deficit (or surplus). Since FY1960, the federal government has run on-budget deficits except for FY1999 and FY2000, and total federal deficits except in FY1969 and FY1998\u2013FY2001.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls Table 1.1 \u2013 Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789\u20132017] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706102517/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls |date=July 6, 2012 }}, Whitehouse.gov; accessed August 24, 2016.</ref>\n\nFor example, in January 2009 the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] reported that for fiscal year 2008 (FY2008) the \"on-budget deficit\" was $638 billion, offset by an \"off-budget surplus\" (mainly due to Social Security revenue in excess of payouts) of $183 billion, for a \"total deficit\" of $455 billion. This latter figure is the one commonly reported in the media. However, an additional $313 billion was required for \"the Treasury actions aimed at stabilizing the financial markets,\" an unusually high amount due to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].  This meant that the \"debt held by the public\" increased by $768 billion ($455B + $313B = $768B). The \"off-budget surplus\" was borrowed and spent (as is typically the case), increasing the \"intra-governmental debt\" by $183 billion. So the total increase in the \"National debt\" in FY2008 was $768B +$183B = $951 billion.<ref name=CBO_2009>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41753|title=CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2009\u20132019|website=CBO|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref> The Treasury Department reported an increase in the National Debt of $1,017B for FY2008.<ref name=TreasuryDirect_2008>{{cite web|url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo5.htm|title=TreasuryDirect Historical Debt Outstanding|website=Treasury Direct|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}</ref> The $66 billion difference is likely due to \"supplemental appropriations\" for the War on Terror, some of which were outside the budget process entirely until President Obama began including most of them in his FY2010 budget.<ref name=Politifact_Suppl>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/161/end-the-abuse-of-supplemental-budgets-for-war/|title=Money in budgets, but supplementals aren't going away|website=Politifact|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn other words, spending the \"off budget\" Social Security surplus adds to the total national debt (by increasing the intragovernmental debt) while the \"off-budget\" surplus reduces the \"total\" deficit reported in the media. Certain spending called \"supplemental appropriations\" is outside the budget process entirely but adds to the national debt. Funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was accounted for this way prior to the Obama administration.<ref name=Politifact_Suppl/> Certain stimulus measures and [[earmark (politics)|earmarks]] were also outside the budget process.

By contrast, if Social Security benefits were limited to the amounts payable from revenues received by the Social Security trust funds, debt in 2049 would reach 106 percent of GDP, still well above its current level.</blockquote>\n\nOver the long-term, the CBO projects that interest expense and mandatory spending categories (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) will continue to grow relative to GDP, while discretionary categories (e.g., Defense and other Cabinet Departments) continue to fall relative to GDP.

The federal debt at the end of the 2018/19 fiscal year (ended September 30, 2019) was $22.7 trillion. The portion that is held by the public was $16.8 trillion.

The CBO analyzes net interest as a percentage of GDP, with a higher percentage indicating a higher interest payment burden. During 2015, this was 1.3% GDP, close to the record low 1.2% of the 1966\u20131968 era. The average from 1966 to 2015 was 2.0% of GDP.<ref>[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51384 CBO-Updated Budget Projections 2016\u20132026], cbo.gov; retrieved May 11, 2016.</ref> However, the CBO estimated in 2016 that the interest amounts and % GDP will increase significantly over the following decade as both interest rates and debt levels rise: \"Interest payments on that debt represent a large and rapidly growing expense of the federal government. CBO's baseline shows net interest payments more than tripling under current law, climbing from $231 billion in 2014, or 1.3 percent of GDP, to $799 billion in 2024, or 3.0 percent of GDP\u2014the highest ratio since 1996.\"<ref>[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45684 CBO-Projection of Federal Interest Payments], cbo.gov, September 3, 2014.</ref>\n\n===Definition of public debt===\nEconomists also debate the definition of public debt. Krugman argued in May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use, while Reinhart has testified to the President's Fiscal Reform Commission that gross debt is the appropriate measure.<ref name=\"krugman.blogs.nytimes.com\"/> The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] (CBPP) cited research by several economists supporting the use of the lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden, disagreeing with these Commission members.<ref name=\"cbpp.org\">Horney, James R.

By contrast, intragovernmental debt (the other component of the gross debt) has no such effects because it is simply money the federal government owes (and pays interest on) to itself.\"<ref name=\"cbpp.org\"/>\n\nHowever, if the U.S. government continues to run \"on budget\" deficits as projected by the CBO and OMB for the foreseeable future, it will have to issue marketable Treasury bills and bonds (i.e., debt held by the public) to pay for the projected shortfall in the Social Security program. This will result in \"debt held by the public\" replacing \"intragovernmental debt\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11580/07-01-SSOptions_forWeb.pdf|title=CBO-Social Security Policy Options-July 2010|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576510660976229354|title=A Short Primer on the National Debt|first=John Steele|last=Gordon|authorlink=John Steele Gordon|website=Wsj.com|accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>\n\n===Intergenerational equity===\n{{See also|Intergenerational equity}}\n[[File:1979 $10,000 Treasury Bond .jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|1979 $10,000 Treasury Bond]]\nOne debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity. For example, if one generation is receiving the benefit of government programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt accumulation, to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose risks and costs on future generations? There are several factors to consider:\n* For every dollar of debt held by the public, there is a government obligation (generally marketable Treasury securities) counted as an asset by investors.

Adjustments that reduce future deficits in these programs may also apply costs to future generations, via higher taxes or lower program spending.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nKrugman wrote in March 2013 that by neglecting public investment and failing to create jobs, we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt: \"Fiscal policy is, indeed, a moral issue, and we should be ashamed of what we're doing to the next generation's economic prospects. But our sin involves investing too little, not borrowing too much.\" Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result.

Fiscal years 1950\u20132010 GDP measurements were derived from December 2010 Bureau of Economic Analysis figures which also tend to be subject to revision, especially more recent years. Afterwards the OMB figures were revised back to 2004 and the BEA figures (in a revision dated July 31, 2013) were revised back to 1947.\n\nRegarding estimates recorded in the GDP column (the last column) marked with a \"~\" symbol, absolute differences from advance (one month after) BEA reports of GDP percent change to current findings (as of November 2013) found in revisions are stated to be 1.3% \u00b1 2.0% or a 95% probability of being within the range of 0.0\u20133.3%, assuming the differences to occur according to standard deviations from the average absolute difference of 1.3%. E.g. with an advance report of a $400&nbsp;billion increase of a $10&nbsp;trillion GDP, for example, one could be 95% confident that the range in which the exact GDP dollar amount lies would be 0.0 to 3.3% different than 4.0% (400 \u00f7 10,000) or within the range of $0 to $330&nbsp;billion different than the hypothetical $400&nbsp;billion (a range of $70\u2013730 billion). Two months after, with a revised value, the range of potential difference from the stated estimate shrinks, and three months after with another revised value the range shrinks again.\n\nFiscal years 1940\u20131970 begin July 1 of the previous year (for example, Fiscal Year 1940 begins July 1, 1939 and ends June 30, 1940); fiscal years 1980\u20132010 begin October 1 of the previous year.

The terms \"national deficit\" and \"national surplus\" usually refer to the federal [[government budget balance]] from year to year, not the cumulative amount of debt. A deficit year increases the debt, while a surplus year decreases the debt as more money is received than spent.\n\nThere are two components of gross national debt:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/debtbasics.html#largefeddebt|title=Federal debt basics \u2013 How large is the federal debt? |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]]|accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref>\n* \"Debt held by the public\" \u2013 such as Treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government, including those held by individuals, corporations, the [[Federal Reserve System]], and foreign, state and local governments.\n* \"Debt held by government accounts or intragovernmental debt\" \u2013 are non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts of programs administered by the federal government, such as the [[Social Security Trust Fund]]. Debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings, of various government programs that have been invested in Treasury securities.\n\nIn general, government debt increases as a result of government spending, and decreases from tax or other receipts, both of which fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year. In practice, Treasury securities are not issued or redeemed on a day-by-day basis,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf|title=Historical Tables \u2013 Table 1.2 \u2013 Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-) as Percentages of GDP: 1930\u20132017|publisher=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|accessdate=April 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417053737/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf|archivedate=April 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and may also be issued or redeemed as part of the federal government's macroeconomic management operations.\n\nHistorically, the US public debt as a share of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) has increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined. The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease as a result of a government surplus or due to growth of GDP and inflation. For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 35 years.

One measure of the debt burden is its size relative to GDP, called the \"[[debt-to-GDP ratio]].\" Mathematically, this is the debt divided by the GDP amount. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] includes historical budget and debt tables along with its annual \"Budget and Economic Outlook.\" Debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP rose from 34.7% GDP in 2000 to 40.5% in 2008 and 67.7% in 2011.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42905 CBO \u2013 The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022 \u2013 See Historical Budget Data Supplement], Cbo.gov, January 2012.</ref>\n\nMathematically, the ratio can decrease even while debt grows if the rate of increase in GDP (which also takes account of inflation) is higher than the rate of increase of debt. Conversely, the debt to GDP ratio can increase even while debt is being reduced, if the decline in GDP is sufficient.\n\nAccording to the ''CIA World Factbook'', during 2015, the U.S. debt to GDP ratio of 73.6% was the 39th highest in the world. This was measured using \"debt held by the public.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html|title=The World Factbook |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref> However, $1 trillion in additional borrowing since the end of FY 2015 has raised the ratio to 76.2% as of April 2016 [See Appendix#National debt for selected years]. Also, this number excludes state and local debt. According to the OECD, general government gross debt (federal, state, and local) in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $22.5 trillion (125% of GDP); subtracting out $5.25 trillion for intergovernmental federal debt to count only federal \"debt held by the public\" gives 96% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web|author=OECD |url=http://stats.oecd.org/ |title=OECD Statistics |website=Stats.oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>\n\nThe ratio is higher if the total national debt is used, by adding the \"intragovernmental debt\" to the \"debt held by the public.\" For example, on April 29, 2016, debt held by the public was approximately $13.84 trillion or about 76% of GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5.35 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of $19.19 trillion. U.S. GDP for the previous 12 months was approximately $18.15 trillion, for a total debt to GDP ratio of approximately 106%.<ref>Multiple references:\n* [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np Debt to the Penny (Daily History Search Application)]\n* [http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass_roundup/2012/09/us-national-debt.html US national debt surpasses $16 trillion] \u2013 Boston Business Journal\n* United States Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (December 2010).

However, there is complexity in the budgetary computations that can make the deficit figure commonly reported in the media (the \"total deficit\") considerably different from the annual increase in the debt. The major categories of differences are the treatment of the Social Security program, Treasury borrowing, and supplemental appropriations outside the budget process.<ref name=CBO_2009/>\n\nSocial Security payroll taxes and benefit payments, along with the net balance of the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]], are considered \"off-budget\", while most other expenditure and receipt categories are considered \"on-budget\". The total federal deficit is the sum of the on-budget deficit (or surplus) and the off-budget deficit (or surplus). Since FY1960, the federal government has run on-budget deficits except for FY1999 and FY2000, and total federal deficits except in FY1969 and FY1998\u2013FY2001.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls Table 1.1 \u2013 Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789\u20132017] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706102517/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls |date=July 6, 2012 }}, Whitehouse.gov; accessed August 24, 2016.</ref>\n\nFor example, in January 2009 the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] reported that for fiscal year 2008 (FY2008) the \"on-budget deficit\" was $638 billion, offset by an \"off-budget surplus\" (mainly due to Social Security revenue in excess of payouts) of $183 billion, for a \"total deficit\" of $455 billion. This latter figure is the one commonly reported in the media. However, an additional $313 billion was required for \"the Treasury actions aimed at stabilizing the financial markets,\" an unusually high amount due to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].  This meant that the \"debt held by the public\" increased by $768 billion ($455B + $313B = $768B). The \"off-budget surplus\" was borrowed and spent (as is typically the case), increasing the \"intra-governmental debt\" by $183 billion. So the total increase in the \"National debt\" in FY2008 was $768B +$183B = $951 billion.<ref name=CBO_2009>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41753|title=CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2009\u20132019|website=CBO|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref> The Treasury Department reported an increase in the National Debt of $1,017B for FY2008.<ref name=TreasuryDirect_2008>{{cite web|url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo5.htm|title=TreasuryDirect Historical Debt Outstanding|website=Treasury Direct|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}</ref> The $66 billion difference is likely due to \"supplemental appropriations\" for the War on Terror, some of which were outside the budget process entirely until President Obama began including most of them in his FY2010 budget.<ref name=Politifact_Suppl>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/161/end-the-abuse-of-supplemental-budgets-for-war/|title=Money in budgets, but supplementals aren't going away|website=Politifact|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn other words, spending the \"off budget\" Social Security surplus adds to the total national debt (by increasing the intragovernmental debt) while the \"off-budget\" surplus reduces the \"total\" deficit reported in the media.

Funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was accounted for this way prior to the Obama administration.<ref name=Politifact_Suppl/> Certain stimulus measures and [[earmark (politics)|earmarks]] were also outside the budget process.

That projection incorporates CBO\u2019s central estimates of various factors, such as productivity growth and interest rates on federal debt. CBO\u2019s analysis indicates that even if values for those factors differed from the agency\u2019s projections, debt several decades from now would probably be much higher than it is today.<ref name=cbo2019LTO>[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55331 CBO The 2019 Long-Term Budget Outlook], cbo.gov; accessed June 25, 2019.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFurthermore, under alternative scenarios:\n<blockquote>If lawmakers changed current laws to maintain certain major policies now in place\u2014most significantly, if they prevented a cut in discretionary spending in 2020 and an increase in individual income taxes in 2026\u2014then debt held by the public would increase even more, reaching 219 percent of GDP by 2049. By contrast, if Social Security benefits were limited to the amounts payable from revenues received by the Social Security trust funds, debt in 2049 would reach 106 percent of GDP, still well above its current level.</blockquote>\n\nOver the long-term, the CBO projects that interest expense and mandatory spending categories (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) will continue to grow relative to GDP, while discretionary categories (e.g., Defense and other Cabinet Departments) continue to fall relative to GDP. Debt is projected to continue rising relative to GDP under the above two scenarios, although the CBO did also offer other scenarios that involved austerity measures that would bring the debt to GDP ratio down.<ref name=cbo2019LTO/>\n\n==Risks and debates==\n[[File:Historical and projected US Federal Government revenues and spending 2018 GAO financial report.png|thumb|Historical and projected US Federal Government revenues and spending from 2018 GAO financial report]]\n{{See also|Political debates about the United States federal budget|Deficit reduction in the United States}}\n\n===CBO risk factors===\nThe CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication:\n* A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt, rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers, leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur;\n* If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs, savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged;\n* Rising interest costs would force reductions in government programs;\n* Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges; and\n* An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis, in which investors demand higher interest rates.<ref name=\"Huntley, Jonathan 2010\">Huntley, Jonathan (July 27, 2010).

The federal debt at the end of the 2018/19 fiscal year (ended September 30, 2019) was $22.7 trillion. The portion that is held by the public was $16.8 trillion.

Fiscal years 1950\u20132010 GDP measurements were derived from December 2010 Bureau of Economic Analysis figures which also tend to be subject to revision, especially more recent years. Afterwards the OMB figures were revised back to 2004 and the BEA figures (in a revision dated July 31, 2013) were revised back to 1947.\n\nRegarding estimates recorded in the GDP column (the last column) marked with a \"~\" symbol, absolute differences from advance (one month after) BEA reports of GDP percent change to current findings (as of November 2013) found in revisions are stated to be 1.3% \u00b1 2.0% or a 95% probability of being within the range of 0.0\u20133.3%, assuming the differences to occur according to standard deviations from the average absolute difference of 1.3%. E.g. with an advance report of a $400&nbsp;billion increase of a $10&nbsp;trillion GDP, for example, one could be 95% confident that the range in which the exact GDP dollar amount lies would be 0.0 to 3.3% different than 4.0% (400 \u00f7 10,000) or within the range of $0 to $330&nbsp;billion different than the hypothetical $400&nbsp;billion (a range of $70\u2013730 billion). Two months after, with a revised value, the range of potential difference from the stated estimate shrinks, and three months after with another revised value the range shrinks again.\n\nFiscal years 1940\u20131970 begin July 1 of the previous year (for example, Fiscal Year 1940 begins July 1, 1939 and ends June 30, 1940); fiscal years 1980\u20132010 begin October 1 of the previous year.
