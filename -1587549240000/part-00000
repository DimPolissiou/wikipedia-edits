He was to become prominent as a [[railroad]] builder and developer, Confederate General, leader of Virginia's short-lived [[Readjuster Party]], and a United States Senator.\n\nOn May 10, 1863, [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Lieutenant General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson died of complications from [[pneumonia]] at the Chandler plantation in [[Guinea, Virginia|Guinea Station]] (also known as Guiney's Station), in the unincorporated Caroline County community of Woodford.

Just as the Civil War was concluding in April 1865, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] was assassinated in [[Washington, DC]] as part of a conspiracy to kill the leaders of the United States. As the conspirators fled, a manhunt was launched. After 10 days, in the wee hours of April 26, federal troops tracked down [[John Wilkes Booth]], Lincoln's  [[assassination|assassin]], and fellow conspirator [[David E. Herold]] at Garrett's farm about 3 miles west of Port Royal. Booth was fatally shot during their capture by federal troops. Herold was returned to Washington, where he was executed by hanging with 3 co-conspirators on July 7, 1865.\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1958, [[Richard and Mildred Loving]] challenged [[miscegenation]] laws in the state when they married. Although they married in Washington, DC, they returned to live in Caroline County, where they were arrested and charged under the state's anti-miscegenation statute, the [[Racial Integrity Act]] of 1924. Their case went to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which in 1967 found anti-miscegenation statutes to be unconstitutional in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''.\n\nAt the southern edge of the county, The Meadow, a farm originally established in 1810, became a premier facility for breeding, raising and training Thoroughbred race horses. In 1972, [[Riva Ridge]], raised at The Meadow, won the [[Kentucky Derby]] and the [[Belmont Stakes]], two of the three events of the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]]. The following year, [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]], born at The Meadow, won the famous [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] for the Chenery family's Meadow Stable.\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2003, The State Fair of Virginia purchased Meadow Farm for development as a new site for the annual Virginia State Fair. Long held at locations in the capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and Henrico County, the fair was increasingly squeezed out by expanding development around it and the growth of the event.

They are:\n\n*[[Bowling Green, Virginia|Bowling Green]]\n*[[Port Royal, Virginia|Port Royal]]\n\n===Bowling Green===\nThe town of Bowling Green was earlier known as New Hope Village. One of the earliest stage roads in the colony ran through the area from Richmond to the [[Potomac River]], where a ferry crossing was operated to [[Charles County, Maryland]]. One of the first stage lines in America to maintain a regular schedule operated along this road. New Hope Tavern was built along the road prior to 1700, and the area around it became known as New Hope Village.<ref name=\"History\">[http://town.bowling-green.va.us/history.htm History<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818042520/http://town.bowling-green.va.us/history.htm |date=2007-08-18 }}</ref>\n\nThe town was renamed for \"Bowling Green\", the plantation of town founder, Colonel John Hoomes. He donated considerable land when the community became the [[county seat]] in 1803. The Bowling Green estate took its name from the Hoomes family's ancestral seat in [[England]], \"Bolling Green\". Such naming was a tradition in the Colony of Virginia. The Bowling Green estate was the site of one of the first tracks for [[horse racing]] in North America.<ref name=\"Acknowledgment For Codification\">[http://town.bowling-green.va.us/code%20book/historical%20sketch.htm Acknowledgment For Codification<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051112231621/http://town.bowling-green.va.us/code%20book/historical%20sketch.htm |date=2005-11-12 }}</ref>\n\nThe manor home of the Hoomes family, built on plantation land patented by Major Thomas Hoomes in 1667, was constructed in 1741. A prominent town landmark, it is one of the oldest residences in original condition in Virginia.<ref name=\"History\"/> Bowling Green Farm is now on the Virginia Landmarks Register and the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"Acknowledgment For Codification\"/>\n\nThe present Caroline County Court House was built in 1835, and Bowling Green was incorporated as a town in 1837. The town is best known as the \"cradle of American [[horse racing]]\". It also is the site of the second oldest [[Masonic Lodge]] in the nation.{{which|date=January 2013}}<ref>[http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Caroline/284-0015_Townfield_1994_Final_Nomination.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224211255/http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Caroline/284-0015_Townfield_1994_Final_Nomination.pdf |date=2016-12-24 }}, see Sect. 8 page 5, or page 10 of 19.</ref>\n\nThe [[Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad]] (chartered in 1834) was built through nearby [[Milford, Virginia|Milford]] (just west of town) and reached [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] by 1837. This important rail link between several major northern [[railroad]]s at [[Washington, D.C.]] and other major southern railroads at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was partially owned by the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] for years. It was purchased by [[CSX Transportation]] in the 1990s. A major freight railroad line for north-south traffic, the corridor also carries many [[Amtrak]] trains. Although the closest [[Virginia Railway Express]] (VRE) commuter passenger rail service to [[Northern Virginia]] is accessed at Spotsylvania,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2015/10/26/vres-spotsylvania-station-to-open-next-month/ |title=VRE\u2019s Spotsylvania station to open next month |newspaper=Washington Post |last=Lazo |first=Luz |date=26 October 2015 |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref> future VRE extensions southward may include service at Milford. This would increase convenience for Bowling Green and the surrounding area.\n\nBowling Green is located along [[Route 2 (Virginia)|Virginia State Route 2]], one of the two earlier highways between [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]. In later years, [[U.S. Route 301 in Virginia|U.S. Route 301]] was built through the area, connecting Richmond with [[Baltimore, Maryland]] by what was effectively an eastern bypass of the [[Washington, D.C.]] area. A new road, [[Route 207 (Virginia)|Virginia State Route 207]], was established from Bowling Green west to [[Carmel Church, Virginia|Carmel Church]]. It intersects [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]] and [[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|U.S. Route 1]], major north-south highways.\n\nIn 1941, the United States government acquired {{convert|77000|acre|km2}} of Caroline County to the north and east of Bowling Green. It established the A.P. Hill Military Reservation. Known in modern times as [[Fort A.P. Hill]], the facility was named for Virginia military hero of the [[United States Army]] and later [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] General [[A.P. Hill|Ambrose Powell Hill]]. Thousands of regular military and reserve troops undergo training at the complex each year. It was also the site of national Jamboree gatherings of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] for 29 years between 1981 and 2010.<ref>[http://www.aphill.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp Fort AP Hill, Va \u2022 History<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409024054/http://www.aphill.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp |date=2007-04-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Port Royal===\nPort Royal is one of the area's more historic towns. It was first established in 1652 as a port on a navigable portion of the [[Rappahannock River]] during an era when waterways were the major method of transportation of people and property in the British [[Colony of Virginia]]. It was an important point for export of tobacco, Virginia's [[cash crop]].\n\nLocal tradition holds that Port Royal was named after the Roy family. Dorothy Roy and her husband John owned a warehouse chartered by the crown, a [[ferry]] service across the Rappahannock River to [[King George County, Virginia|King George County]] and a tavern. In the 21st century, the chimneys of the Roy house are preserved landmarks in the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicportroyal.com/|title=Historic Port Royal|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nPort Royal was incorporated as a town in 1744. The \"town green\", upon which stands today the Town Hall and the firehouse, was forever reserved \"for public and civic use\".<ref>[http://www.co.caroline.va.us/portroyal.html Welcome to Historic Port Royal!<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218170735/http://www.co.caroline.va.us/portroyal.html |date=2007-12-18 }}</ref>\n\nShipping of property from the port began to decline after completion of railroads which began in Virginia in the 1830s. The last scheduled passenger ship service ended in 1932, supplanted by highways. However, Port Royal was served by the new highways which became [[U.S. Route 17 in Virginia|U.S. Route 17]] and [[U.S. Route 301 in Virginia|U.S. Route 301]], with their crossroads at Port Royal.\n\n===Census-designated places===\nThere are two unincorporated [[census-designated place]]s in Caroline County:\n\n*[[Lake Caroline, Virginia|Lake Caroline]]\n*[[Lake Land'Or, Virginia|Lake Land'Or]]\n\n==Notable people==\n* Henry Tompkins Anderson, (1812\u20131872), a [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] [[clergyman]] who translated the ''[[New Testament]]'' and ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]''<ref name=\"Marquis 1607-1896\">{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607\u20131896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | location = Chicago | year = 1963}}</ref>\n* [[George Armistead]], commander of [[Fort McHenry]] during the [[Battle of Baltimore]]<ref name=\"Marquis 1607-1896\"/>\n* Col.

Just as the Civil War was concluding in April 1865, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] was assassinated in [[Washington, DC]] as part of a conspiracy to kill the leaders of the United States. As the conspirators fled, a manhunt was launched. After 10 days, in the wee hours of April 26, federal troops tracked down [[John Wilkes Booth]], Lincoln's  [[assassination|assassin]], and fellow conspirator [[David E. Herold]] at Garrett's farm about 3 miles west of Port Royal. Booth was fatally shot during their capture by federal troops. Herold was returned to Washington, where he was executed by hanging with 3 co-conspirators on July 7, 1865.\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1958, [[Richard and Mildred Loving]] challenged [[miscegenation]] laws in the state when they married. Although they married in Washington, DC, they returned to live in Caroline County, where they were arrested and charged under the state's anti-miscegenation statute, the [[Racial Integrity Act]] of 1924. Their case went to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which in 1967 found anti-miscegenation statutes to be unconstitutional in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''.\n\nAt the southern edge of the county, The Meadow, a farm originally established in 1810, became a premier facility for breeding, raising and training Thoroughbred race horses. In 1972, [[Riva Ridge]], raised at The Meadow, won the [[Kentucky Derby]] and the [[Belmont Stakes]], two of the three events of the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]]. The following year, [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]], born at The Meadow, won the famous [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] for the Chenery family's Meadow Stable.\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2003, The State Fair of Virginia purchased Meadow Farm for development as a new site for the annual Virginia State Fair. Long held at locations in the capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and Henrico County, the fair was increasingly squeezed out by expanding development around it and the growth of the event.

One of the earliest stage roads in the colony ran through the area from Richmond to the [[Potomac River]], where a ferry crossing was operated to [[Charles County, Maryland]]. One of the first stage lines in America to maintain a regular schedule operated along this road. New Hope Tavern was built along the road prior to 1700, and the area around it became known as New Hope Village.<ref name=\"History\">[http://town.bowling-green.va.us/history.htm History<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818042520/http://town.bowling-green.va.us/history.htm |date=2007-08-18 }}</ref>\n\nThe town was renamed for \"Bowling Green\", the plantation of town founder, Colonel John Hoomes. He donated considerable land when the community became the [[county seat]] in 1803. The Bowling Green estate took its name from the Hoomes family's ancestral seat in [[England]], \"Bolling Green\". Such naming was a tradition in the Colony of Virginia. The Bowling Green estate was the site of one of the first tracks for [[horse racing]] in North America.<ref name=\"Acknowledgment For Codification\">[http://town.bowling-green.va.us/code%20book/historical%20sketch.htm Acknowledgment For Codification<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051112231621/http://town.bowling-green.va.us/code%20book/historical%20sketch.htm |date=2005-11-12 }}</ref>\n\nThe manor home of the Hoomes family, built on plantation land patented by Major Thomas Hoomes in 1667, was constructed in 1741.

The town is best known as the \"cradle of American [[horse racing]]\". It also is the site of the second oldest [[Masonic Lodge]] in the nation.{{which|date=January 2013}}<ref>[http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Caroline/284-0015_Townfield_1994_Final_Nomination.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224211255/http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Caroline/284-0015_Townfield_1994_Final_Nomination.pdf |date=2016-12-24 }}, see Sect. 8 page 5, or page 10 of 19.</ref>\n\nThe [[Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad]] (chartered in 1834) was built through nearby [[Milford, Virginia|Milford]] (just west of town) and reached [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] by 1837. This important rail link between several major northern [[railroad]]s at [[Washington, D.C.]] and other major southern railroads at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was partially owned by the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] for years. It was purchased by [[CSX Transportation]] in the 1990s. A major freight railroad line for north-south traffic, the corridor also carries many [[Amtrak]] trains. Although the closest [[Virginia Railway Express]] (VRE) commuter passenger rail service to [[Northern Virginia]] is accessed at Spotsylvania,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2015/10/26/vres-spotsylvania-station-to-open-next-month/ |title=VRE\u2019s Spotsylvania station to open next month |newspaper=Washington Post |last=Lazo |first=Luz |date=26 October 2015 |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref> future VRE extensions southward may include service at Milford. This would increase convenience for Bowling Green and the surrounding area.\n\nBowling Green is located along [[Route 2 (Virginia)|Virginia State Route 2]], one of the two earlier highways between [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]. In later years, [[U.S. Route 301 in Virginia|U.S. Route 301]] was built through the area, connecting Richmond with [[Baltimore, Maryland]] by what was effectively an eastern bypass of the [[Washington, D.C.]] area. A new road, [[Route 207 (Virginia)|Virginia State Route 207]], was established from Bowling Green west to [[Carmel Church, Virginia|Carmel Church]]. It intersects [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]] and [[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|U.S. Route 1]], major north-south highways.\n\nIn 1941, the United States government acquired {{convert|77000|acre|km2}} of Caroline County to the north and east of Bowling Green. It established the A.P. Hill Military Reservation. Known in modern times as [[Fort A.P. Hill]], the facility was named for Virginia military hero of the [[United States Army]] and later [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] General [[A.P. Hill|Ambrose Powell Hill]]. Thousands of regular military and reserve troops undergo training at the complex each year. It was also the site of national Jamboree gatherings of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] for 29 years between 1981 and 2010.<ref>[http://www.aphill.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp Fort AP Hill, Va \u2022 History<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409024054/http://www.aphill.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp |date=2007-04-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Port Royal===\nPort Royal is one of the area's more historic towns. It was first established in 1652 as a port on a navigable portion of the [[Rappahannock River]] during an era when waterways were the major method of transportation of people and property in the British [[Colony of Virginia]]. It was an important point for export of tobacco, Virginia's [[cash crop]].\n\nLocal tradition holds that Port Royal was named after the Roy family. Dorothy Roy and her husband John owned a warehouse chartered by the crown, a [[ferry]] service across the Rappahannock River to [[King George County, Virginia|King George County]] and a tavern. In the 21st century, the chimneys of the Roy house are preserved landmarks in the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicportroyal.com/|title=Historic Port Royal|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nPort Royal was incorporated as a town in 1744.

The last scheduled passenger ship service ended in 1932, supplanted by highways. However, Port Royal was served by the new highways which became [[U.S. Route 17 in Virginia|U.S. Route 17]] and [[U.S. Route 301 in Virginia|U.S. Route 301]], with their crossroads at Port Royal.\n\n===Census-designated places===\nThere are two unincorporated [[census-designated place]]s in Caroline County:\n\n*[[Lake Caroline, Virginia|Lake Caroline]]\n*[[Lake Land'Or, Virginia|Lake Land'Or]]\n\n==Notable people==\n* Henry Tompkins Anderson, (1812\u20131872), a [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] [[clergyman]] who translated the ''[[New Testament]]'' and ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]''<ref name=\"Marquis 1607-1896\">{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607\u20131896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | location = Chicago | year = 1963}}</ref>\n* [[George Armistead]], commander of [[Fort McHenry]] during the [[Battle of Baltimore]]<ref name=\"Marquis 1607-1896\"/>\n* Col.

It is bounded on the south by the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and on the east by the [[Chickahominy River]].\n\nThe area that would become Charles City County was first established as \"Charles Cittie\" by the [[Virginia Company]] in 1619.  It was one of the first four \"boroughs\" of Virginia, and was named in honor of Prince Charles, who would later become King [[Charles I of England]].  After Virginia became a royal colony, the borough was changed to \"Charles City Shire\" in 1634, as one of the five original [[Shires of Virginia]]. It acquired the present name of Charles City County in 1643.\n\nIn the 21st century, Charles City County is part of the [[Greater Richmond Region]] of the state of Virginia.

In 1619 the Virginia Company established [[Charles City (Virginia Company)|Charles Cittie]] (sic) as one of the first four \"boroughs\" or \"incorporations\" in the region.  West of James County, it was named for Prince Charles, second son of King [[James I of England]], who became the Prince of Wales and [[heir apparent]] after the death of his older brother Henry in 1612. After his father's death, he became King [[Charles I of England]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History|website=Web.archive.org|url=http://www.charlescity.org/history.shtml|access-date=2016-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529214721/http://www.charlescity.org/history.shtml|archive-date=2016-05-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n1619 marked the arrival of the first [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] [[Africans]] in the Tidewater area. They had been captured from a Spanish ship and were taken to [[Weyanoke, Virginia|Weyanoke]] Peninsula. They were treated as indentured servants in the colony, and at least one later became a landowner after gaining his freedom.  They created the first African community in what became the United States. [[Weyanoke, Virginia]] continues as a small, unincorporated community.\n\nThe Virginia Company lost its charter in 1624 under King James I, and Virginia became a [[royal colony]]. [[Charles City Shire]] was formed in 1634 in the [[Virginia Colony]] by order of the King. Its name was changed to Charles City County in 1643. It is one of the five original [[Shires of Virginia|shires in Virginia]] that are extant in essentially the same political entity (county) as they were originally formed in 1634. Colonists developed the land as tobacco [[plantations]] and produced this commodity crop for export.\n\nCultivation and processing of this crop required intensive labor. The wealthier planters recruited [[indentured servants]] from the British Isles and Africa, and later purchased numerous [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved Africans]]. In Virginia and the Upper South, historians have classified persons holding 20 or more slaves as planters.\n\nThe original central city of the county was Charles City Point, located south of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] at the confluence of the [[Appomattox River]]. The first Charles City County courthouses were located along the James River at [[Westover Plantation|Westover]] on the north side and at [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]] on the south side. The latter's name was shortened from Charles City Point.[[Image:EnteringCharlesCityCountyonStateRoute106.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Crossing the James River on [[Benjamin Harrison Bridge]] from the South to enter Charles City County]]\n\n===Breaking off other counties===\nIn 1634, Charles City Shire became one of the eight original [[Shires of Virginia]] established by the British in the [[Virginia Colony]].<ref name=shireFounding>{{cite web|last1=Henrico County|title=Henrico Becomes a Shire|url=http://henrico.us/about-henrico/history/ourhistory/henrico-becomes-a-shire/|website=Henrico.us}}</ref> Since then, five counties: [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George County]], Brunswick, Dinwiddie, Amelia, and Prince Edward; and three independent cities: Hopewell, Petersburg and ; have been formed from the original territory of Charles City Shire.<ref name=HistoricalSociety>{{cite web|last1=Henrico Historical Society|title=Henrico History|url=http://www.henricohistoricalsociety.org/henricohistory.html|website=Henricohistoricalsociety.org}}</ref> The most significant division was the organization of Prince George County in 1703, which took in all the land south of the James River formerly assigned to Charles City County. The later divisions of Prince George County yielded most of those other counties and independent cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimfamhistory.net/Virginia/virgin02.htm|title=Notes on Virginia Counties|website=Wimfamhistory.net|accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref> Charles City County was one of the original Virginia shires of 1634. As the population increased, several other counties were formed from this territory. Beginning in 1703, all of the original area of Charles City County south of the James River was severed to form [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George]]. This in turn was later divided, in a pattern typical of colonial development, into several other counties. The [[incorporated town]] of [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]], then in Prince George County, was annexed by the [[independent city]] of [[Hopewell, Virginia|Hopewell]] in 1923. Prince George County was later divided: Brunswick County was organized in 1732; Amelia County in 1735; and Prince Edward County in 1754, all from territory at one time within the very large Charles City County.\n\nAfter 1703, Charles City County was limited to land on the north bank of the James River, between James City County (another of the original shires) to its east and Henrico County, another original shire, to its west. On the west, Chesterfield County was organized from Henrico in 1749. Charles City County is bordered by New Kent County to its north and Henrico County to its north-west.\n\nNorth of the river, the area remained Charles City County. During the late 19th century, numerous crossroads communities developed among the plantations to serve the religious, educational and mercantile needs of the citizenry of rural Charles City County.  Crossroad communities, such as Adkins Store, Cedar Grove, Binns Hall, Parrish Hill, Ruthville and Wayside, typically included a store, church and school.  (Public schools were not established until after the Civil War, when the Reconstruction legislature founded the system.)  As in other parts of the Tidewater, common planters and merchants of Charles City County were attracted by the appeal of [[Methodist]] and [[Baptist]] preachers in the [[Second Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  Several Methodist and Baptist churches were established in the early 19th century, mostly in the upland areas of the county. The county also had numerous [[Quaker]] settlers. The elite planters of the James River plantations tended to remain Anglican; the United States Episcopal Church was founded after the American Revolution.\n\nThe county has no \"City\", or any centralized city or town.  Charles City Court House, which has a Charles City postal address, is the focal point of government. The building that served as the courthouse was constructed in the 1730s.  Used until 2007, it was one of only five courthouses in America that was in continuous use for judicial purposes since before the Revolutionary War.<ref>[http://www.charlescity.org/1county.php  \"Charles City County\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124162112/http://www.charlescity.org/1county.php |date=November 24, 2005 }}, Charles City County Website</ref> A new courthouse has since been built.\n\n===Indians===\nThe English named the Weyanoke Peninsula after the [[Weyanoc]], Indians whom they encountered in the area.  The Weyanoc were gradually displaced by colonial encroachment. They merged with other, larger tribes about the time of [[Bacon's Rebellion]], in which colonists purposefully attacked friendly Indians.\n\nThe [[Chickahominy River]], which forms much of the county's eastern and northern borders, is named after another tribe of Algonquian-speaking Indians whom English colonists encountered in this area.  Their descendants still inhabit the region. ''Chickahominy'' means \"coarse-pounded corn people\" in their [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]]. At the time of the earliest English settlement, the independent Chickahominy people occupied territory surrounded by numerous tribes of the powerful [[Powhatan|Powhatan Confederacy]], but they were not part of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewebtribe.com/NACulture/chickahominy.htm|title=Chickahominy Information|website=Ewebtribe.com|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Chickahominy (tribe)|Chickahominy]] and [[Eastern Chickahominy (tribe)|Eastern Chickahominy]] tribes are among seven tribes officially recognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and, since January 2018, among the six in the state recognized by the federal government. Many of their descendants still live in the county. The Chickahominy are the second-largest Indian tribe in Virginia, with just under one thousand members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charlescity.org/chickahominy.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630045453/http://charlescity.org/chickahominy.php |archivedate=2006-06-30 }}</ref> The Eastern Chickahominy tribe has about 130 members.\n\n===European Americans===\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2012}}\nThe majority of European colonists were English people who arrived as indentured servants and who owed labor time, often up to seven years, to wealthier patrons who had paid for their passage in order to gain land and laborers.  The English government provided land grants to such patrons under a [[headright]] system, to encourage the settlement of more people in the colony.  During the 17th century, hard economic times in England encouraged workers to risk going to the North American colonies.  While in the early years the Chesapeake Bay Colony had a high ratio of men to women, gradually more women entered the colony, and people started creating families.\n\nSome indentured servants paid off their passage and eventually owned land of their own.  While some became planters (owning 20 slaves or more), they tended to have property in the upland section of the county.  By the time most indentured workers had earned freedom and some rose to common planter status, the wealthiest planter families in the county already controlled the valuable riverfront property.  This gave them ready access to the waterways, the transportation system for trade and travel.\n\n===African-Americans===\nWith the growth of tobacco as a cash crop, demand for workers increased. Twenty-three African slaves were known to have been brought to Charles City County before 1660.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlescity.org/saf/|title=Charles City County \u2013 Slave Ancestor File|website=Charlescity.org|accessdate=27 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221154111/http://www.charlescity.org/saf/|archive-date=21 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the late 1600s and early 1700s, African slave labor rapidly supplanted European indentured servants. By the eighteenth century, slaves had become the major source of agricultural labor in the [[Virginia Colony]], then devoted primarily to the labor-intensive commodity crop of tobacco.\n\nThe earliest record of a free black living in Charles City County is the September 16, 1677 petition for freedom by a woman named Susannah.  The [[Lott Cary Birth Site|Lott Cary House]] in the county has long been honored as the birth site of [[Lott Cary]], a slave who purchased his freedom and that of his children.<ref name=\"auto\">Charles City County Historical Markers.

Some free [[mixed-race]] families, established before the [[American Revolution]], were formed by descendants of unions or marriages between white [[indentured]] or free women and African men, indentured, slave or free. Colonial law and the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]],'' provided that children were born into the status of their mother. Thus, the mixed-race children of white women were born free. If illegitimate, they had to serve time in lengthy apprenticeships, but freedom gave them an important step forward.<ref>[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1999\u20132005]  Freeafricanamercians.com</ref>\n\nIn the first two decades after the American Revolution, numerous planters in Charles City County freed their slaves, persuaded by Quaker, Baptist and Methodist abolitionists.<ref name=\"CCity\">{{cite web |url=http://www.charlescity.org/fnr/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505202003/http://www.charlescity.org/fnr/index.php |archivedate=2006-05-05 }}, Charles City County Website</ref> Many free blacks settled together in today's [[Ruthville, Virginia]], a crossroads and one of the first free-black communities in present-day Charles City County and the state of Virginia.<ref name=\"CCity\"/> The unincorporated town of [[Ruthville, Virginia|Ruthville]] was the center of the county's free black population for many years.

Two Charles City farmers have won the National Wheat Growers First Place, producing 140+ bushels per acre  (9.4 t/ha) of soft red winter wheat.\n\nCharles City County farmers have also helped develop the leading technology for controlling runoff from grain cultivation. Fully 90% of crop land in Charles City County is in a never-till cropping system.  When [[Hurricane Floyd]] in 1999 dropped approximately 19&nbsp;inches (480&nbsp;mm) of rain in 24 hours on some long-term never-till fields, visual observation showed virtually no erosion. A scientific study conducted in 2000 on one long-term never-till field demonstrated a 99.9% reduction in sediment runoff compared to conventional tillage, and a 95% reduction of runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus. This new technology could become a primary strategy to achieve a healthy [[Chesapeake Bay]].\n\n==Education==\nCharles City County Public Schools employs a staff of approximately 235 persons to meet the needs of approximately 1000 students in its three schools.

The county is situated southeast of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and west of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. It is bounded on the south by the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and on the east by the [[Chickahominy River]].\n\nThe area that would become Charles City County was first established as \"Charles Cittie\" by the [[Virginia Company]] in 1619.  It was one of the first four \"boroughs\" of Virginia, and was named in honor of Prince Charles, who would later become King [[Charles I of England]].  After Virginia became a royal colony, the borough was changed to \"Charles City Shire\" in 1634, as one of the five original [[Shires of Virginia]]. It acquired the present name of Charles City County in 1643.\n\nIn the 21st century, Charles City County is part of the [[Greater Richmond Region]] of the state of Virginia. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the county population was 7,256; it is still relatively rural and one of smaller counties in Virginia by population.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51036.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 1, 2014|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/601I6HXPq?url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51036.html|archive-date=July 8, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its [[county seat]] is the community of [[Charles City, Virginia|Charles City]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-31 }}</ref>\n\nNotable natives include the [[List of Presidents of the United States|9th]] and 10th [[President of the United States|Presidents of the United States]], [[William Henry Harrison]] and [[John Tyler]].\n\n==History==\n===Native Americans===\nVarious [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribes]] had used this area for thousands of years.  When the region was explored by the English in the 17th century, the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Chickahominy people|Chickahominy]] tribe inhabited areas along the river that was later named for them by English colonists. The [[Paspahegh]] lived in [[Sandy Point, Charles City County, Virginia|Sandy Point]], and the [[Weanoc]] lived in the Weyanoke Neck area. The latter two tribes were part of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]].  These three were all Algonquian-speaking tribes, the language family of the varied peoples who occupied the Tidewater and low country in Virginia and along the East Coast from Canada to south of the Carolinas.<ref name=\"findings\">[http://www.co.charles-city.va.us/vertical/Sites/%7B5140D83F-6014-4EC8-875E-081F6AF51220%7D/uploads/%7B7922A8EF-D04D-4C94-8FF2-DAA200166438%7D.PDF \"Archeological Findings\"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Charles City County Community Plan Draft, Nov 2008, p. 2-7, accessed 23 February 2009</ref>\n\nAlgonquian was one of the three major language family groups of American Indians in Virginia. Other tribes located on lands in the interior spoke [[Siouan language|Siouan]] and [[Iroquoian languages]].\n\n===English colonization===\nThe English began to colonize the area under the auspices of the [[Virginia Company]], a private company formed to support this effort and gain profits from expected development and trade. In 1619 the Virginia Company established [[Charles City (Virginia Company)|Charles Cittie]] (sic) as one of the first four \"boroughs\" or \"incorporations\" in the region.  West of James County, it was named for Prince Charles, second son of King [[James I of England]], who became the Prince of Wales and [[heir apparent]] after the death of his older brother Henry in 1612. After his father's death, he became King [[Charles I of England]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History|website=Web.archive.org|url=http://www.charlescity.org/history.shtml|access-date=2016-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529214721/http://www.charlescity.org/history.shtml|archive-date=2016-05-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n1619 marked the arrival of the first [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] [[Africans]] in the Tidewater area. They had been captured from a Spanish ship and were taken to [[Weyanoke, Virginia|Weyanoke]] Peninsula. They were treated as indentured servants in the colony, and at least one later became a landowner after gaining his freedom.  They created the first African community in what became the United States. [[Weyanoke, Virginia]] continues as a small, unincorporated community.\n\nThe Virginia Company lost its charter in 1624 under King James I, and Virginia became a [[royal colony]]. [[Charles City Shire]] was formed in 1634 in the [[Virginia Colony]] by order of the King. Its name was changed to Charles City County in 1643. It is one of the five original [[Shires of Virginia|shires in Virginia]] that are extant in essentially the same political entity (county) as they were originally formed in 1634. Colonists developed the land as tobacco [[plantations]] and produced this commodity crop for export.\n\nCultivation and processing of this crop required intensive labor. The wealthier planters recruited [[indentured servants]] from the British Isles and Africa, and later purchased numerous [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved Africans]]. In Virginia and the Upper South, historians have classified persons holding 20 or more slaves as planters.\n\nThe original central city of the county was Charles City Point, located south of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] at the confluence of the [[Appomattox River]]. The first Charles City County courthouses were located along the James River at [[Westover Plantation|Westover]] on the north side and at [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]] on the south side. The latter's name was shortened from Charles City Point.[[Image:EnteringCharlesCityCountyonStateRoute106.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Crossing the James River on [[Benjamin Harrison Bridge]] from the South to enter Charles City County]]\n\n===Breaking off other counties===\nIn 1634, Charles City Shire became one of the eight original [[Shires of Virginia]] established by the British in the [[Virginia Colony]].<ref name=shireFounding>{{cite web|last1=Henrico County|title=Henrico Becomes a Shire|url=http://henrico.us/about-henrico/history/ourhistory/henrico-becomes-a-shire/|website=Henrico.us}}</ref> Since then, five counties: [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George County]], Brunswick, Dinwiddie, Amelia, and Prince Edward; and three independent cities: Hopewell, Petersburg and ; have been formed from the original territory of Charles City Shire.<ref name=HistoricalSociety>{{cite web|last1=Henrico Historical Society|title=Henrico History|url=http://www.henricohistoricalsociety.org/henricohistory.html|website=Henricohistoricalsociety.org}}</ref> The most significant division was the organization of Prince George County in 1703, which took in all the land south of the James River formerly assigned to Charles City County. The later divisions of Prince George County yielded most of those other counties and independent cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimfamhistory.net/Virginia/virgin02.htm|title=Notes on Virginia Counties|website=Wimfamhistory.net|accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref> Charles City County was one of the original Virginia shires of 1634. As the population increased, several other counties were formed from this territory. Beginning in 1703, all of the original area of Charles City County south of the James River was severed to form [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George]]. This in turn was later divided, in a pattern typical of colonial development, into several other counties. The [[incorporated town]] of [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]], then in Prince George County, was annexed by the [[independent city]] of [[Hopewell, Virginia|Hopewell]] in 1923. Prince George County was later divided: Brunswick County was organized in 1732; Amelia County in 1735; and Prince Edward County in 1754, all from territory at one time within the very large Charles City County.\n\nAfter 1703, Charles City County was limited to land on the north bank of the James River, between James City County (another of the original shires) to its east and Henrico County, another original shire, to its west. On the west, Chesterfield County was organized from Henrico in 1749. Charles City County is bordered by New Kent County to its north and Henrico County to its north-west.\n\nNorth of the river, the area remained Charles City County. During the late 19th century, numerous crossroads communities developed among the plantations to serve the religious, educational and mercantile needs of the citizenry of rural Charles City County.  Crossroad communities, such as Adkins Store, Cedar Grove, Binns Hall, Parrish Hill, Ruthville and Wayside, typically included a store, church and school.  (Public schools were not established until after the Civil War, when the Reconstruction legislature founded the system.)  As in other parts of the Tidewater, common planters and merchants of Charles City County were attracted by the appeal of [[Methodist]] and [[Baptist]] preachers in the [[Second Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  Several Methodist and Baptist churches were established in the early 19th century, mostly in the upland areas of the county. The county also had numerous [[Quaker]] settlers. The elite planters of the James River plantations tended to remain Anglican; the United States Episcopal Church was founded after the American Revolution.\n\nThe county has no \"City\", or any centralized city or town.  Charles City Court House, which has a Charles City postal address, is the focal point of government. The building that served as the courthouse was constructed in the 1730s.  Used until 2007, it was one of only five courthouses in America that was in continuous use for judicial purposes since before the Revolutionary War.<ref>[http://www.charlescity.org/1county.php  \"Charles City County\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124162112/http://www.charlescity.org/1county.php |date=November 24, 2005 }}, Charles City County Website</ref> A new courthouse has since been built.\n\n===Indians===\nThe English named the Weyanoke Peninsula after the [[Weyanoc]], Indians whom they encountered in the area.  The Weyanoc were gradually displaced by colonial encroachment. They merged with other, larger tribes about the time of [[Bacon's Rebellion]], in which colonists purposefully attacked friendly Indians.\n\nThe [[Chickahominy River]], which forms much of the county's eastern and northern borders, is named after another tribe of Algonquian-speaking Indians whom English colonists encountered in this area.  Their descendants still inhabit the region. ''Chickahominy'' means \"coarse-pounded corn people\" in their [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]]. At the time of the earliest English settlement, the independent Chickahominy people occupied territory surrounded by numerous tribes of the powerful [[Powhatan|Powhatan Confederacy]], but they were not part of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewebtribe.com/NACulture/chickahominy.htm|title=Chickahominy Information|website=Ewebtribe.com|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Chickahominy (tribe)|Chickahominy]] and [[Eastern Chickahominy (tribe)|Eastern Chickahominy]] tribes are among seven tribes officially recognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and, since January 2018, among the six in the state recognized by the federal government. Many of their descendants still live in the county. The Chickahominy are the second-largest Indian tribe in Virginia, with just under one thousand members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charlescity.org/chickahominy.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630045453/http://charlescity.org/chickahominy.php |archivedate=2006-06-30 }}</ref> The Eastern Chickahominy tribe has about 130 members.\n\n===European Americans===\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2012}}\nThe majority of European colonists were English people who arrived as indentured servants and who owed labor time, often up to seven years, to wealthier patrons who had paid for their passage in order to gain land and laborers.  The English government provided land grants to such patrons under a [[headright]] system, to encourage the settlement of more people in the colony.  During the 17th century, hard economic times in England encouraged workers to risk going to the North American colonies.  While in the early years the Chesapeake Bay Colony had a high ratio of men to women, gradually more women entered the colony, and people started creating families.\n\nSome indentured servants paid off their passage and eventually owned land of their own.  While some became planters (owning 20 slaves or more), they tended to have property in the upland section of the county.  By the time most indentured workers had earned freedom and some rose to common planter status, the wealthiest planter families in the county already controlled the valuable riverfront property.  This gave them ready access to the waterways, the transportation system for trade and travel.\n\n===African-Americans===\nWith the growth of tobacco as a cash crop, demand for workers increased. Twenty-three African slaves were known to have been brought to Charles City County before 1660.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlescity.org/saf/|title=Charles City County \u2013 Slave Ancestor File|website=Charlescity.org|accessdate=27 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221154111/http://www.charlescity.org/saf/|archive-date=21 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the late 1600s and early 1700s, African slave labor rapidly supplanted European indentured servants. By the eighteenth century, slaves had become the major source of agricultural labor in the [[Virginia Colony]], then devoted primarily to the labor-intensive commodity crop of tobacco.\n\nThe earliest record of a free black living in Charles City County is the September 16, 1677 petition for freedom by a woman named Susannah.  The [[Lott Cary Birth Site|Lott Cary House]] in the county has long been honored as the birth site of [[Lott Cary]], a slave who purchased his freedom and that of his children.<ref name=\"auto\">Charles City County Historical Markers.

Some free [[mixed-race]] families, established before the [[American Revolution]], were formed by descendants of unions or marriages between white [[indentured]] or free women and African men, indentured, slave or free. Colonial law and the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]],'' provided that children were born into the status of their mother. Thus, the mixed-race children of white women were born free. If illegitimate, they had to serve time in lengthy apprenticeships, but freedom gave them an important step forward.<ref>[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1999\u20132005]  Freeafricanamercians.com</ref>\n\nIn the first two decades after the American Revolution, numerous planters in Charles City County freed their slaves, persuaded by Quaker, Baptist and Methodist abolitionists.<ref name=\"CCity\">{{cite web |url=http://www.charlescity.org/fnr/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505202003/http://www.charlescity.org/fnr/index.php |archivedate=2006-05-05 }}, Charles City County Website</ref> Many free blacks settled together in today's [[Ruthville, Virginia]], a crossroads and one of the first free-black communities in present-day Charles City County and the state of Virginia.<ref name=\"CCity\"/> The unincorporated town of [[Ruthville, Virginia|Ruthville]] was the center of the county's free black population for many years.

Local farmers have won national contests in bushel per acre grain production.  A Charles City farmer has been the National Corn Grower in three years, producing 300+ bushels of corn per acre (18.8 t/ha) in the \"no-till non-irrigated\" category.  Two Charles City farmers have won the National Wheat Growers First Place, producing 140+ bushels per acre  (9.4 t/ha) of soft red winter wheat.\n\nCharles City County farmers have also helped develop the leading technology for controlling runoff from grain cultivation. Fully 90% of crop land in Charles City County is in a never-till cropping system.  When [[Hurricane Floyd]] in 1999 dropped approximately 19&nbsp;inches (480&nbsp;mm) of rain in 24 hours on some long-term never-till fields, visual observation showed virtually no erosion. A scientific study conducted in 2000 on one long-term never-till field demonstrated a 99.9% reduction in sediment runoff compared to conventional tillage, and a 95% reduction of runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus. This new technology could become a primary strategy to achieve a healthy [[Chesapeake Bay]].\n\n==Education==\nCharles City County Public Schools employs a staff of approximately 235 persons to meet the needs of approximately 1000 students in its three schools.
