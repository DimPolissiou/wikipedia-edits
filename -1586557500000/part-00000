He lived and worked in [[Puconci]], near [[Murska Sobota]].\n\nThe whereabouts of his birth are unknown. He taught in a school in [[Rajka]] and later moved to the Mura March. In 1833 he translated a textbook from German into [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and the local [[Prekmurje Slovene]] dialect. One of the topics of this book is the Mura March, which he calls ''Szlovenszka kraina'' in his native language because the inhabitants of the region called themselves ''szloveni'' (Slovenes).

There are over 200 ethnic languages.\n\nFrench is generally the medium of instruction in schools. English is taught as a compulsory foreign language in Secondary and High School around the country. It is a required subject in the Faculty of Economics at major universities around the country and there are numerous language schools in the country that teach it.

Immigration is seen to be very diverse in nature, with refugees and asylum-seekers - products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the Great Lakes Region - constituting an important subset of the population in the country.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\"/>\n\nAdditionally, the country\u2019s large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond and there is considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied. Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role. Immigration in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[International Organization for Migration]], the number of [[immigration|immigrants]] in the DRC has declined from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Valid figures are not available on migrant workers in particular, partly due to the predominance of the [[informal economy]] in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring country ethnic links to nationals of the DRC, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon in the country.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\">{{Cite document|url=http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=41_42&products_id=592|publisher=International Organization for Migration|title=Migration en R\u00e9publique D\u00e9mocratique du Congo: Profil national 2009|year=2009|accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref>\n\nFigures on the number of Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of which live within [[Africa]] and to a lesser extent in [[Europe]]; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimates on 2000 data. Most Congolese emigrants however, remain in Africa, with new destination countries including [[South Africa]] and various points en route to Europe.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\"/>\n\nIn addition to being a host country, the DRC has also produced a considerable number of [[refugees]] and [[asylum-seekers]] located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to [[UNHCR]], there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of which were living in other African countries.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\"/>\n\n===Religions===\n:Roman Catholic 50%, Protestant 20%, Kimbanguist 10%, Muslim 10%, other (includes syncretic sects and indigenous beliefs) 10%\n\n===[[Dependency ratio]]s===\n:total dependency ratio: 97.5 (2015 est.)\n:youth dependency ratio: 91.5 (2015 est.)\n:elderly dependency ratio: 6 (2015 est.)\n:[[potential support ratio]]: 16.8 (2015 est.)\n\n===Gender ratio===\n:At birth: 1.03 male(s)/female\n:Under 15 years: 1.01 male(s)/female\n:15\u201364 years: 0.99 male(s)/female\n:65 years and over: 0.69 male(s)/female\n:Total population: 0.99 male(s)/female (2011 est.)\n\n===Life expectancy at birth===\n:total population: 58.1 years (2018 est.)

There are over 200 ethnic languages.\n\nFrench is generally the medium of instruction in schools. English is taught as a compulsory foreign language in Secondary and High School around the country. It is a required subject in the Faculty of Economics at major universities around the country and there are numerous language schools in the country that teach it. In the town of Beni, for instance, there is a Bilingual University that offer courses in both French and English. President Kabila himself is fluent in both English and French, as was his father.\n\n==Religions==\nA survey conducted by the [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] program in 2013-2014 indicated that Christians constituted 93.7% of the population (Catholics 29.7%, Protestants 26.8%, and other Christians 37.2%).

Immigration is seen to be very diverse in nature, with refugees and asylum-seekers - products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the Great Lakes Region - constituting an important subset of the population in the country.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\"/>\n\nAdditionally, the country\u2019s large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond and there is considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied. Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role. Immigration in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[International Organization for Migration]], the number of [[immigration|immigrants]] in the DRC has declined from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Valid figures are not available on migrant workers in particular, partly due to the predominance of the [[informal economy]] in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring country ethnic links to nationals of the DRC, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon in the country.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\">{{Cite document|url=http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=41_42&products_id=592|publisher=International Organization for Migration|title=Migration en R\u00e9publique D\u00e9mocratique du Congo: Profil national 2009|year=2009|accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref>\n\nFigures on the number of Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of which live within [[Africa]] and to a lesser extent in [[Europe]]; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimates on 2000 data. Most Congolese emigrants however, remain in Africa, with new destination countries including [[South Africa]] and various points en route to Europe.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\"/>\n\nIn addition to being a host country, the DRC has also produced a considerable number of [[refugees]] and [[asylum-seekers]] located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to [[UNHCR]], there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of which were living in other African countries.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\"/>\n\n===Religions===\n:Roman Catholic 50%, Protestant 20%, Kimbanguist 10%, Muslim 10%, other (includes syncretic sects and indigenous beliefs) 10%\n\n===[[Dependency ratio]]s===\n:total dependency ratio: 97.5 (2015 est.)\n:youth dependency ratio: 91.5 (2015 est.)\n:elderly dependency ratio: 6 (2015 est.)\n:[[potential support ratio]]: 16.8 (2015 est.)\n\n===Gender ratio===\n:At birth: 1.03 male(s)/female\n:Under 15 years: 1.01 male(s)/female\n:15\u201364 years: 0.99 male(s)/female\n:65 years and over: 0.69 male(s)/female\n:Total population: 0.99 male(s)/female (2011 est.)\n\n===Life expectancy at birth===\n:total population: 58.1 years (2018 est.)

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech may also be introduced using special prosody. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.  \n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech may also be introduced using special prosody. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.  \n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.
