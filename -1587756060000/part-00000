The first mention by name of the Woodhall manor was in about 1130 when it was held by Ralph de Watton.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/>\n\nDerman's great nephew [[Henry fitz Ailwin]], the first Mayor of London, inherited the Watton manor in 1165. He built a hermitage chapel in what is now Chapel Wood and possibly built a new manor house in what is now Well Wood.<ref name=\"Village Guide\"/> At about this time, perhaps as a consequence of Henry fitz Ailwin's new buildings, a new manor called Crowborough emerged from the Watton manor. Crowborough was first referenced in 1266 when it was held by Alice de Rivers.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/> Crowborough Hall stood at Watton Green and the moat which surrounded it can still be seen to this day.<ref name=\"Village Guide\"/>\n\nHugh Bardolf inherited Watton manor in 1287, later it was held by [[John Bardolf, 3rd Baron Bardolf|John Bardolf]] and [[Thomas Bardolf, 5th Baron Bardolf|Thomas Bardolf]] with the Bardolf family owning the Watton and Crowborough manors at various times until 1562. During this period the house and chapel in Well Wood and Chapel Wood were abandoned, and so in circa 1520 the Watton manor was renamed Bardolf manor and the manor house moved to what is now Bardolphs Farm.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/> A new manor called Watkins Hall was created and was first known to be held by Thomas Munden in about 1540.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/>\n\nPhilip Boteler (Butler) inherited the Woodhall estate in about 1375 and later descendants to have the title included [[Philip Butler]] and [[John Boteler, 1st Baron Boteler of Brantfield|John Boteler]] who held the Watton, Woodhall and Crowborough manors. The three estates were in possession of the Botelers (Butlers) until as late as 1780.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/>\n\nIn 1662 brothers [[Maurice Thomson]] and [[William Thompson (1614-1681)|Sir William Thompson]], who had grown up in the village, founded Watton's first free school for 20 poor children.<ref name=\"Village Guide\"/>\n\nAfter Woodhall was mostly destroyed by fire in 1771, from which an elderly John Boteler was able to escape, building of the new house began in 1775. The notorious [[Thomas Rumbold]] took possession of Woodhall in 1777, followed by [[Paul Benfield]] in 1793. The estate was then bought in 1801 by [[Samuel Smith (1754-1834)|Samuel Smith]] and the Smith family later combined the Watton, Woodhall and Crowborough manors into one and still holds it today.<ref name=\"Village Guide\"/>\n\nIn later years, the natural springs in the area once made the village a popular [[spa town]].<ref>name=\"herts_landscape\"</ref> The village has a number of dwellings dating from early [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]], such as ''Watton Place'', through to late [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] constructions.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/>\n\n== Church of St Mary and St Andrew ==\nThe [[parish church]] is dedicated to St Andrew and St Mary.

The manor was worth \u00a35 and it had a mill, woodland with 100 pigs and a meadow.

The first mention by name of the Woodhall manor was in about 1130 when it was held by Ralph de Watton.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/>\n\nDerman's great nephew [[Henry fitz Ailwin]], the first Mayor of London, inherited the Watton manor in 1165. He built a hermitage chapel in what is now Chapel Wood and possibly built a new manor house in what is now Well Wood.<ref name=\"Village Guide\"/> At about this time, perhaps as a consequence of Henry fitz Ailwin's new buildings, a new manor called Crowborough emerged from the Watton manor. Crowborough was first referenced in 1266 when it was held by Alice de Rivers.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/> Crowborough Hall stood at Watton Green and the moat which surrounded it can still be seen to this day.<ref name=\"Village Guide\"/>\n\nHugh Bardolf inherited Watton manor in 1287, later it was held by [[John Bardolf, 3rd Baron Bardolf|John Bardolf]] and [[Thomas Bardolf, 5th Baron Bardolf|Thomas Bardolf]] with the Bardolf family owning the Watton and Crowborough manors at various times until 1562. During this period the house and chapel in Well Wood and Chapel Wood were abandoned, and so in circa 1520 the Watton manor was renamed Bardolf manor and the manor house moved to what is now Bardolphs Farm.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/> A new manor called Watkins Hall was created and was first known to be held by Thomas Munden in about 1540.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/>\n\nPhilip Boteler (Butler) inherited the Woodhall estate in about 1375 and later descendants to have the title included [[Philip Butler]] and [[John Boteler, 1st Baron Boteler of Brantfield|John Boteler]] who held the Watton, Woodhall and Crowborough manors. The three estates were in possession of the Botelers (Butlers) until as late as 1780.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/>\n\nIn 1662 brothers [[Maurice Thomson]] and [[William Thompson (1614-1681)|Sir William Thompson]], who had grown up in the village, founded Watton's first free school for 20 poor children.<ref name=\"Village Guide\"/>\n\nAfter Woodhall was mostly destroyed by fire in 1771, from which an elderly John Boteler was able to escape, building of the new house began in 1775. The notorious [[Thomas Rumbold]] took possession of Woodhall in 1777, followed by [[Paul Benfield]] in 1793. The estate was then bought in 1801 by [[Samuel Smith (1754-1834)|Samuel Smith]] and the Smith family later combined the Watton, Woodhall and Crowborough manors into one and still holds it today.<ref name=\"Village Guide\"/>\n\nIn later years, the natural springs in the area once made the village a popular [[spa town]].<ref>name=\"herts_landscape\"</ref> The village has a number of dwellings dating from early [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]], such as ''Watton Place'', through to late [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] constructions.<ref name=\"herts_history\"/>\n\n== Church of St Mary and St Andrew ==\nThe [[parish church]] is dedicated to St Andrew and St Mary.

If this belief is true, ''Mushika-vamsha'' is the earliest known historical Sanskrit ''[[mahakavya]]'', pre-dating [[Kalhana]]'s ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' by a few decades.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=vi}}\n\nIndologist [[A. K. Warder]] classifies Atula's style as ''[[Vidarbha|Vaidarbhi]]'', and believes that he was influenced by the 6th century poet [[Bharavi]], among others.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=52}}\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Origin of the dynasty ===\n\n{{Quote box |width=25em |align=right |salign = right\n|quote=<poem>\n...you should not take your own unhappy life,\nNor yet ought you to obstruct this offspring\nleft like this in you by your husband.\n</poem>\n|source = ''Mushika-vamsha'' introductory verse, describing how the royal preceptor dissuaded the queen from committing suicide{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=33}}\n}}\n\nAtula provides a mythological origin of the Mushika dynasty, tracing its descent to a [[Heheya Kingdom|Heheya]] queen, whose family was killed during [[Parashurama]]'s slaughter of the [[Kshatriya]] rulers.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xiii}} The pregnant queen initially wanted to commit suicide, but her family preceptor dissuaded her from doing so, encouraging her not to destroy her unborn baby.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|pp=1-2}}{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=33}} With the help of the preceptor, the queen fled southwards, and came to the coastal region that later became the Mushika kingdom.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xiii}} There, she was attacked by a huge rat (''mushika''), who was actually the divine spirit of the Eli mountain ([[Ezhimala Hill|Ezhimala]]), and had been cursed by the sage [[Kaushika]] to become a rat. The queen burned the rat to ashes with the flame emitted from her eyes: the rat was thus redeemed, and became transformed into its original form.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|pp=xiii-xiv}}{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=34}}\n\n=== Rama, the dynasty's founder ===\n\nAt the request of the divine spirit, the queen started living in a cave of the mountain, protected from Parashurama.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=34}} There, she gave birth to a boy, who received education from the preceptor. By the time the prince grew up, Parashurama had wiped the Kshatriyas from the earth 21 times. Feeling sorry for their widows, he decided to perform a ritual sacrifice to absolve himself from the sin of killing the Kshatriyas at the Eli mountain. For one of the sacrificial ceremonies, he needed a Kshatriya prince.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=34}} The divine spirit of the mountain brought to him the Heheya prince, who belonged to the [[lunar dynasty]].{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=35}} After the end of Parashurama's ceremony, the prince was crowned as a king, and thus, became the founder of the Mushika dynasty. Since Parashurama performed his consecration with the holy water from a ''ghata'' (earthen pot), the king came to be known as Rama-ghata-mushika.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xiv}}\n\nThe first six cantos deal with the exploits of Rama. He established a council of ministers, and his favourite minister was Mahanavika (\"great sailor\"), a member of the trading class (''Shreshti'') of [[Mahishmati]].{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xiv}}{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=35}} Rama also established the fortified city of Kolam, and the Mushika rulers came to be known as Kolabhupas.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xiv}} Once, he visited the hermitage of Parashurama, who gave him an invincible bow called ''Ajita'' and several divine missiles. Meanwhile, he received the news that his ancestral Heheya kingdom had been conquered by the [[Magadha]]s. Rama wanted to march against Magadha, but his ministers advised him to subjugated the southern kingdoms first.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xv}} After consolidating his rule in southern India, Rama crossed the [[Vindhyas|Vindhya mountain]], and asked the Magadha ruler Suvarman to hand over the former Heheya territory to him. When Suvarman refused, the two kings fought a battle in which Suvarman used divine missiles, but Rama could counter him without use of Parashurama's divine missiles. Ultimately, Rama defeated and killed him in a duel.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|pp=xv-xvi}} The vassals of Magadha accepted his suzerainty. He married Suvarman's daughter, and restored the Magadha territory to Suvarman's son.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xvi}}\n\nGradually, Rama conquered the entire [[Names of India|Bharata]] (India) and \"the islands\", and became a [[Chakravartin]] (universal emperor).{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=38}} He appointed his elder son Vatu as the ruler of the Heheya kingdom, and returned to Kola with his younger son Nandana.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xvi}} At Kola, he performed a [[ashvamedha|horse sacrifice]], and after a long time, [[sannyasa|retired to penance]], crowning Nandana as the new king of the Mushika kingdom.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xvi}}{{sfn|A. K.

K. Warder|1992|p=40}}\n}}\n\nThe Cantos 7-10 describe the \"amorous exploits\" of Nandana: the poet describes him as a mighty and glorious monarch, but does not describe his achievements as a king. Nandana was succeeded by Ugra; Canto 11 lists the names of the next 51 rulers (all patrilineal descendants).{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxi}}\n\nUgrasena, the sixth successor of Nandana, repulsed an invasion from the [[Kerala Kingdom]]. His successor Chitrasena was killed by a lion during a hunting expedition. The next ruler Shatasoma, described as a descendant of the [[solar dynasty]], performed a hundred [[ashvamedha|horse sacrifices]]. On the advice of sage [[Agastya]], he visited [[Mount Kailash|Kailasha]] and brought a sacred idol of the god [[Shiva]]. This idol was installed in a [[Rajarajeshwara Temple|newly-constructed shrine]] at Celera (also known as Cellura, [[Taliparamba]] or Lakshmipura).{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxiii}}\n\nShatasoma's descendant Sharmadatta obtained the boon of living as long as he wished from Shiva, for himself and his 20 descendants. His descendant Vatukavarman built the large [[Vadeshwaram Temple|Vatukeshvara Shiva temple]] at Alashuddhi. His successor Ahirana built the Ahiraneshvara Shiva temple on the western bank of the P\u1e5bthana river{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=42}} (identified as [[Valapattanam River|Valapattanam]]).{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxiii}} Ahirana's son Ranabhara was attracted some girls while chasing elephants in the [[Sahyadri|Sahya]] mountains. He followed them into a big cave, spent some days with a thousand cave girls, and then brought them to his kingdom using an [[elixir]]. After the birth of his son Aryagupta, he entered the cave once again, accompanied by many women.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=42}}{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxiv}}\t\n\nAryagupta's son Achala built the city of Achalapattana on the Eli mountain. His younger son Vikramasena ascended the throne after expelling the elder son Ashvasena from the kingdom. Vikramasena's son Vinayavarman ruled by ''[[dharma]]'', and the next ruler Rajavarman built a Buddhist monastery ([[vihara]]) called Rajavihara.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=43}}\n\nAshvasena's son Jayamanin I became the next ruler with the help of an army from the [[Pandya kingdom]]. Jayamanin's grandson Udayavarman patronized [[Brahmin]]s. The next ruler Virochana I killed a [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] king, and married his daughter Harini. Two of his descendants - Shashidatta and Janavrata - killed each other in order to seize the throne. Nothing is known about the last 38 kings mentioned in the Canto 11, except their names.{{sfn|A. K.

Menon|1999|p=xxiv}} His son Ishanavarman married Nandini, the daughter of a [[Chedi Kingdom|Chedi]] king who had been dethroned. Ishanavarman led an army to Chedi, and restored the throne to his father-in-law.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxv}} Upon his return to the Mushika kingdom, he faced an invasion from the [[Kerala Kingdom|Kerala]] king Jayaraga.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=44}} The warring kings decided to engage in a personal combat, but the Kerala prince Goda and Ishanavarman's nephew negotiated a peace treaty between the two kingdoms.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxvi}} Ishanavarman and Nandini did not have any children, so he married a [[Chola]] princess, with whom he had a son named Nrparama (or Nrpavarman).{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxvi}}{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=45}}\n\n=== Nandini's descendants ===\n\nAn upset Nandini prayed to the goddess [[Bhadrakali]] (or Chandika),{{sfn|A. K.

Menon|1999|p=xxvi}} (The manuscript is mutilated here, but it is clear that the Goddess says something about women: the editor theorized that the goddess talks about matrilineal descent, which is what effectively happens in the subsequent portions of the text.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=47}}) Sometime later, she gave birth to a son named Palaka, and a daughter named Nandini (II).{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxvi}} To avoid a war of succession between Nrparama and Palaka, Ishanavarman sent Palaka to the Chedi kingdom. Ishanavarman patronized scholars, and built several Shiva temples. Towards the end of his life, he suffered from a severe fever, and died after performing a ''[[sixteen great gifts|Mahadana]]'' (\"Great Donation\") ceremony.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxvii}}\n\nThe ministers then appointed Nrparama as the new king,{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=45}} whose infant son Chandravarman became the titular ruler after his death. Taking advantage of this situation, the Kerala king invaded the Mushika kingdom, whose ministers recalled Palaka from Chedi. Palaka repulsed the invasion, slaughtered the enemies on the battlefield, and became the king. He was succeeded by Validhara, the son of his sister.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxvii}}{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=46}}\n\nValidhara defended his kingdom against the [[Western Ganga dynasty|Ganga]] invaders, and was succeeded by his maternal nephews, first Ripurama, and then Vikramarama. Vikramarama build a huge wall of large rocks to prevent a Buddha (''Jina'') shrine from being swalloed by the [[Arabian Sea]].{{sfn|K. P. A.

His younger brother and successor Kundavarman built the Narayananapura city and a [[Vishnu]] temple in that city. The next ruler Palaka was a son of a sister of Kundavarman. At the time of his death, Palaka did not have an adult younger brother or a maternal nephew. He was succeeded by Ripurama, a chieftain of Bhatasthali. After a glorious reign, Ripurama was succeeded by Gambhira, a son of Palaka's sister. Gambhira was a strong ruler, who crushed a revolt by the subordinate chief of Marupura, and burnt down that city.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxix}}\n\n=== Vallabha II ===\n\nJayamani (Jayamanin III), the successor and younger brother of Gambhira, became a renowned ruler. During the last years of his reign, he was assisted in administration by his nephew, the crown prince Valabha II.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xxix}} Valabha II, said to be an [[avatar|incarnation]], partially that of [[Shiva]] and partially that of [[Vishnu]], made grants to the Vedic ''[[agrahara]]'' of Cellura. This ''agrahara'' is described as a hermitage with a variety of trees.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=48}}\n\nAt Cellura, there were two head [[brahmins|brahmanas]] (priests) named Bhava and Nandin, said to have descended from the heavens. They are compared to [[Shukra]] and [[Brihaspati]] (the teachers of the [[Asura]] and [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] respectively, in Hindu mythology). Vallabha visited the \"cities\" (shrines) of [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], the latter of which had been built by the earlier king Shatasoma, and paid obeisance to the deities. He commissioned repairs to these two temples, which had decayed with age, and gave benedictions to the brahmanas before leaving.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1992|p=49}}\n\nJayamani made Vallabha his [[heir apparent]], and then asked him to march to aid the [[Kerala Kingdom|Kerala]] king, who was preparing to attack the [[Chola]] king. Vallabha had to abandon the march midway, when a loyal subject told him that Jayamani had died, and an enemy named Ramavikrama had usurped the throne. Vallabha sent an envoy to the Kerala king, and then turned back towards the Mushika capital. On the way back, he visited the [[Sri Mulavasam|Mulavasa]] shrine, and paid obeisance to the [[Buddha]].{{sfn|A. K.

Vallabha built the city of [[Madayi|Marahi]], an international commercial port, at the mouth of the [[Kuppam River|Killa]] river. He also built the [[Valapattanam|Vallabhapatnam]] fort, named after himself. He installed a statue of [[Shiva]] at the Vatukeshvara temple. His army crossed the ocean, and conquered many islands.{{sfn|A. K.

Shrikantha seems to have restored the temples in the aftermath of this first Chola invasion, as described in the Mushika-vamsha and the Eramam inscription. The Kerala kingdom subsequently rebelled against Rajendra's overlordship, leading to a second Chola invasion around 1028, in which both the Kerala king and Kandan were killed.{{sfn|A. K.

Menon|1999|p=xiv}}\n\nThe first six cantos deal with the exploits of Rama.

Rama wanted to march against Magadha, but his ministers advised him to subjugated the southern kingdoms first.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|p=xv}} After consolidating his rule in southern India, Rama crossed the [[Vindhyas|Vindhya mountain]], and asked the Magadha ruler Suvarman to hand over the former Heheya territory to him. When Suvarman refused, the two kings fought a battle in which Suvarman used divine missiles, but Rama could counter him without use of Parashurama's divine missiles. Ultimately, Rama defeated and killed him in a duel.{{sfn|K. P. A. Menon|1999|pp=xv-xvi}} The vassals of Magadha accepted his suzerainty. He married Suvarman's daughter, and restored the Magadha territory to Suvarman's son.{{sfn|K. P. A.

On the advice of sage [[Agastya]], he visited [[Mount Kailash|Kailasha]] and brought a sacred idol of the god [[Shiva]].

Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] and many other cartoon characters.\n\n''Looney Tunes''{{'}} name was inspired by [[Walt Disney]]'s musical series ''[[Silly Symphonies]]''. They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as [[Bosko]] and, after losing him, [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, following their addition of directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. From 1942 to 1964, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.<ref name=\"AniUSA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros. Studio biography|publisher=AnimationUSA.com|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Looney Tunes'' has since become a worldwide media franchise, spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides, as well as serving as Warner Bros.' flagship franchise. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements. The most famous ''Looney Tunes'' character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a [[cultural icon]], struggling rapist, and has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"Hollywood\">{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Several ''Looney Tunes'' films are considered among the greatest animated cartoons of all time (e.g. ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''; All three ''Merrie Melodies''), and five (three ''Merrie Melodies'': ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'' and ''[[Birds Anonymous]]''; and two ''Looney Tunes'': ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' and ''[[For Scent-imental Reasons]]'') have won [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/24/greatest-cartoons-all-time-tv-guide-list/ | work=[[Fox News]] | title=TV Guide magazine's 60 greatest cartoons of all time | date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn the inception, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' drew their storylines from Warner's vast music library. Between 1934 and 1943, ''Merrie Melodies'' were produced in color and ''Looney Tunes'' in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. cartoon characters. By 1937, the theme music for ''Looney Tunes'' was \"[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]\" by [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Dave Franklin]], and the theme music for ''Merrie Melodies'' was an adaptation of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]\" by [[Charles Tobias]], Murray Mencher and [[Eddie Cantor]].\n\n===1930\u20131933: Harman and Ising era===\nIn 1929, to compete against [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse short cartoons]], Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired [[Brunswick Records]] along with four music publishers for US$28&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|28|1930|fmt=c}} million in {{currentyear}}) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with [[Leon Schlesinger]] to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired [[Rudolf Ising]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman's and Ising's 1929 pilot cartoon, ''[[Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid]]''. The first ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'' starring [[Bosko]], which was released in 1930.<ref name=bcdb />\n\n[[File:Clampett-Porky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|[[Porky Pig]] in the intro to one of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts in the late 1930s and early 1940s]]\n\n=== 1933\u20131936 ===\nWhen Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters and cartoons they had created. A new character called [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]] became the only star of the ''Looney Tunes'' series for a couple of years.\n\nNew directors including [[Tex Avery]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Bob Clampett]] were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery's unit housed in a bungalow the animators dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]].\" In 1935 they debuted the first major ''Looney Tunes'' star, [[Porky Pig]], along with [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans the Cat]] in the ''Merrie Melodie'' cartoon ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon ''[[Golddiggers of '49]]'', but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of ''I Haven't Got a Hat'', such as Oliver Owl, and twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts, but Beans and Porky proved much more popular. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.\n\n=== 1936\u20131944: More star characters and switch to color ===\nThe debuts of other memorable ''Looney Tunes'' stars followed: [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), [[Elmer Fudd]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), and [[Bugs Bunny]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bugsbunnyfiftyye0000adam}}</ref>\n\nBugs initially starred in the color ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts following the success of 1940's ''A Wild Hare'', and formally joined the ''Looney Tunes'' series with the release of ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color ''Looney Tunes'' with the 1942 cartoon ''[[The Hep Cat]]''. The final black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Puss n' Booty]]'' in 1943 directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner's decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the ''[[Blue Ribbon Classic]]s'' series of ''Merrie Melodies''. Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon ''Crazy Cruise'' and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'', which marked Bugs' only official appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.\n\n=== 1944\u20131964: Golden Age ===\nMore popular ''Looney Tunes'' characters were created (most of which first appeared in ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons) such as [[Tweety]] (debuted in 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]''), [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Life with Feathers]]''), [[Yosemite Sam]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Hare Trigger]]''), [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''), [[Foghorn Leghorn]] (debuted in 1946's ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]''), [[Marvin the Martian]] (debuted in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''), [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] (debuted in 1949's ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]''), [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (debuted in 1950's ''[[Canary Row]]''), [[Speedy Gonzales]] (debuted in 1953's ''[[Cat-Tails for Two|Cat Tails for Two]]''), [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]''), and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Devil May Hare]]'').\n\n=== 1964\u20131969: DePatie\u2013Freleng and Seven Arts era ===\nDuring the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (and [[Format Films|Format Productions]]) (1964\u20131967) and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] (1967\u20131969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized [[limited animation]] and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by [[William Lava]], of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\". The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves.\n\nThe original ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being ''[[Bugged by a Bee]]'', by [[Robert McKimson]]).<ref name=bcdb />\n\n=== 1970\u20131999 ===\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on network and [[syndicated television]] in the 1950s, under various titles and formats. However, the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were edited, removing scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters doing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), racial and ethnic caricatures (including stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans, Mexicans, Jews, Native Americans, Asians, and Germans as Nazis), and questionable vices (such as smoking cigarettes, ingesting pills, and drinking alcohol).\n\nTheatrical animated shorts went dormant until 1987, when new shorts were made to introduce ''Looney Tunes'' to a new generation of audiences. [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)|New shorts]] have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many of them have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gotten theatrical releases with movies.\n\nIn the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and [[television specials]] were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. In 1976, the ''Looney Tunes'' characters made their way into the amusement business when they became the mascots for the two Marriott's Great America theme parks (Gurnee and Santa Clara). After the Gurnee park was sold to [[Six Flags]], they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which they continue to do presently. In 1988, several ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in cameo roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The more notable cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which ''Looney Tunes'' characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)\u2014particularly in the scenes where Bugs and [[Mickey Mouse]] are skydiving, and when Daffy and [[Donald Duck]] are performing their \"Dueling Pianos\" sequence.\n\nIn 1988, [[Nickelodeon]] aired all the unaired cartoons in a show called ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' until 1999. To date, ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' is the longest-airing [[animated series]] on the network that was not a [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoon]].

The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters ([[Plucky Duck]], [[Hamton J.

Immediately prior to this decision, ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were airing on several networks at once: on Cartoon Network, on Nickelodeon (as ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon''), and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''). The latter two had been particularly long-running series, and the Warner Bros. decision forced the two networks to cancel the programs. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. Although the film wasn't financially successful,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''.] ''Boxofficemojo.com''.

With their retained Bosko rights Harman and Ising began making cartoons at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1934, until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. They proceeded to form their own studio to create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoons]]. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising's estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros.

Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] and many other cartoon characters.\n\n''Looney Tunes''{{'}} name was inspired by [[Walt Disney]]'s musical series ''[[Silly Symphonies]]''. They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as [[Bosko]] and, after losing him, [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, following their addition of directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. From 1942 to 1964, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.<ref name=\"AniUSA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros. Studio biography|publisher=AnimationUSA.com|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Looney Tunes'' has since become a worldwide media franchise, spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides, as well as serving as Warner Bros.' flagship franchise. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements. The most famous ''Looney Tunes'' character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a [[cultural icon]] and has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"Hollywood\">{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Several ''Looney Tunes'' films are considered among the greatest animated cartoons of all time (e.g. ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''; All three ''Merrie Melodies''), and five (three ''Merrie Melodies'': ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'' and ''[[Birds Anonymous]]''; and two ''Looney Tunes'': ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' and ''[[For Scent-imental Reasons]]'') have won [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/24/greatest-cartoons-all-time-tv-guide-list/ | work=[[Fox News]] | title=TV Guide magazine's 60 greatest cartoons of all time | date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn the inception, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' drew their storylines from Warner's vast music library. Between 1934 and 1943, ''Merrie Melodies'' were produced in color and ''Looney Tunes'' in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. cartoon characters. By 1937, the theme music for ''Looney Tunes'' was \"[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]\" by [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Dave Franklin]], and the theme music for ''Merrie Melodies'' was an adaptation of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]\" by [[Charles Tobias]], Murray Mencher and [[Eddie Cantor]].\n\n===1930\u20131933: Harman and Ising era===\nIn 1929, to compete against [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse short cartoons]], Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired [[Brunswick Records]] along with four music publishers for US$28&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|28|1930|fmt=c}} million in {{currentyear}}) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with [[Leon Schlesinger]] to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired [[Rudolf Ising]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman's and Ising's 1929 pilot cartoon, ''[[Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid]]''. The first ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'' starring [[Bosko]], which was released in 1930.<ref name=bcdb />\n\n[[File:Clampett-Porky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|[[Porky Pig]] in the intro to one of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts in the late 1930s and early 1940s]]\n\n=== 1933\u20131936 ===\nWhen Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters and cartoons they had created. A new character called [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]] became the only star of the ''Looney Tunes'' series for a couple of years.\n\nNew directors including [[Tex Avery]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Bob Clampett]] were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery's unit housed in a bungalow the animators dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]].\" In 1935 they debuted the first major ''Looney Tunes'' star, [[Porky Pig]], along with [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans the Cat]] in the ''Merrie Melodie'' cartoon ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon ''[[Golddiggers of '49]]'', but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of ''I Haven't Got a Hat'', such as Oliver Owl, and twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts, but Beans and Porky proved much more popular. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.\n\n=== 1936\u20131944: More star characters and switch to color ===\nThe debuts of other memorable ''Looney Tunes'' stars followed: [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), [[Elmer Fudd]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), and [[Bugs Bunny]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bugsbunnyfiftyye0000adam}}</ref>\n\nBugs initially starred in the color ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts following the success of 1940's ''A Wild Hare'', and formally joined the ''Looney Tunes'' series with the release of ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color ''Looney Tunes'' with the 1942 cartoon ''[[The Hep Cat]]''. The final black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Puss n' Booty]]'' in 1943 directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner's decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the ''[[Blue Ribbon Classic]]s'' series of ''Merrie Melodies''. Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon ''Crazy Cruise'' and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'', which marked Bugs' only official appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.\n\n=== 1944\u20131964: Golden Age ===\nMore popular ''Looney Tunes'' characters were created (most of which first appeared in ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons) such as [[Tweety]] (debuted in 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]''), [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Life with Feathers]]''), [[Yosemite Sam]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Hare Trigger]]''), [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''), [[Foghorn Leghorn]] (debuted in 1946's ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]''), [[Marvin the Martian]] (debuted in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''), [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] (debuted in 1949's ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]''), [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (debuted in 1950's ''[[Canary Row]]''), [[Speedy Gonzales]] (debuted in 1953's ''[[Cat-Tails for Two|Cat Tails for Two]]''), [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]''), and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Devil May Hare]]'').\n\n=== 1964\u20131969: DePatie\u2013Freleng and Seven Arts era ===\nDuring the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (and [[Format Films|Format Productions]]) (1964\u20131967) and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] (1967\u20131969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized [[limited animation]] and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by [[William Lava]], of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\". The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves.\n\nThe original ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being ''[[Bugged by a Bee]]'', by [[Robert McKimson]]).<ref name=bcdb />\n\n=== 1970\u20131999 ===\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on network and [[syndicated television]] in the 1950s, under various titles and formats. However, the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were edited, removing scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters doing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), racial and ethnic caricatures (including stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans, Mexicans, Jews, Native Americans, Asians, and Germans as Nazis), and questionable vices (such as smoking cigarettes, ingesting pills, and drinking alcohol).\n\nTheatrical animated shorts went dormant until 1987, when new shorts were made to introduce ''Looney Tunes'' to a new generation of audiences. [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)|New shorts]] have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many of them have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gotten theatrical releases with movies.\n\nIn the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and [[television specials]] were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. In 1976, the ''Looney Tunes'' characters made their way into the amusement business when they became the mascots for the two Marriott's Great America theme parks (Gurnee and Santa Clara). After the Gurnee park was sold to [[Six Flags]], they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which they continue to do presently. In 1988, several ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in cameo roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The more notable cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which ''Looney Tunes'' characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)\u2014particularly in the scenes where Bugs and [[Mickey Mouse]] are skydiving, and when Daffy and [[Donald Duck]] are performing their \"Dueling Pianos\" sequence.\n\nIn 1988, [[Nickelodeon]] aired all the unaired cartoons in a show called ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' until 1999. To date, ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' is the longest-airing [[animated series]] on the network that was not a [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoon]].

The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters ([[Plucky Duck]], [[Hamton J.

Immediately prior to this decision, ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were airing on several networks at once: on Cartoon Network, on Nickelodeon (as ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon''), and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''). The latter two had been particularly long-running series, and the Warner Bros. decision forced the two networks to cancel the programs. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. Although the film wasn't financially successful,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''.] ''Boxofficemojo.com''.

With their retained Bosko rights Harman and Ising began making cartoons at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1934, until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. They proceeded to form their own studio to create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoons]]. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising's estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros.

Article III, Section 1 of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]], adopted in 1968, defines the role of the legislature and how it is to be constituted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes#A3S01|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature|access-date=June 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208105533/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=constitution&submenu=3&tab=statutes#A3S01|archive-date=December 8, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The legislature is composed of 160 state legislators (120 in the House and 40 in the Senate). The primary purpose of the legislature is to enact new laws and amend or repeal existing laws. It meets in the [[Florida State Capitol]] building in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/reference/faq#Question1|title= FAQ|publisher=Florida Senate}}</ref>\n\n==Titles==\nMembers of the Senate are referred to as senators and members of the House of Representatives are referred to as representatives. Because this shadows the terminology used to describe [[member of Congress|members of Congress]], constituents and the news media, using [[AP Stylebook|''The Associated Press Stylebook'']], often refer to legislators as state senators or state representatives to avoid confusion with their federal counterparts.\n\n==Florida Senate==\n{{Main|Florida Senate}}\nThe Senate is the upper house of the state legislature. Its members are elected on a partisan basis for four-year terms. The Senate consists of 40 members elected from single-member election districts. Legislative districts are drawn on the basis of population figures through the federal decennial census. Senators' terms begin immediately upon their election. The Senate Chamber is located in the State Capitol building. As of 2018, [[Republican Party of Florida|Republicans]] hold the majority in the Senate with 23 seats; [[Florida Democratic Party|Democrats]] are in the minority with 17 seats.\n\n==Florida House of Representatives==\n{{Main|Florida House of Representatives}}\nThe House of Representatives is the lower house of the state legislature. Its members are elected on a partisan basis for two-year terms. The House of Representatives consists of 120 members who are elected from single-member election districts. Legislative districts are drawn on the basis of population figures through the federal decennial census. Representatives' terms begin immediately upon their election. The House of Representatives Chamber is located in the State Capitol building. As of 2019 [[Republican Party of Florida|Republicans]] hold the majority in the House of Representatives with 73 seats, and [[Florida Democratic Party|Democrats]] hold 46 seats. One seat is vacant.\n\n==Terms==\nArticle III, of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]], defines the terms for state legislators. Legislators take office immediately upon election.\n\n===Senate===\nThe Constitution requires state senators from odd-numbered districts to be elected in the years that end in numbers of which are multiples of four. Senators from even-numbered districts are required to be elected in even-numbered years the numbers of which are not multiples of four.\n\nTo reflect the results of the U.S. Census and the redrawing of district boundaries, all seats are up for election in redistricting years, with some terms truncated as a result. Thus, senators in even-numbered districts were elected to two-year terms in 2012 (following the 2010 Census), and senators in odd-numbered districts will be elected to two-year terms in 2022 (following the 2020 Census).\n\nAll terms were truncated again in 2016, with all 40 Senate seats up for election, due to court-ordered redistricting.<ref name=\"Florida Legislature\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3|title= CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\n===House of Representatives===\nMembers of the House of Representatives are elected for terms of two years in each even-numbered year.<ref name=\"Florida Legislature\"/>\n\n==Term limits==\nOn November 3, 1992, almost 77 percent of Florida voters backed Amendment 9, the Florida Term Limits Amendment, which amended the State Constitution, to enact eight year term limits on federal and state officials. Under the Amendment, former members can be elected again after a two-year break.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-10-27/news/9202250950_1_term-limits-national-constitutional-amendment-state-ballots|title=Vote Yes On Amendment No. 9 To Begin Limiting Political Terms|publisher=Sun-Sentinel}}</ref> In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could not enact congressional term limits, but ruled that the state level term limits remain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sunshinestatenews.com/story/florida-backs-article-v-convention-constitutional-amendment-congressional-term-limits|title=Florida Backs Article V Convention for Constitutional Amendment on Congressional Term Limits|publisher=Sunshine State News}}</ref>\n\n==Qualifications==\nEach legislator shall be at least twenty-one years of age, an elector and resident of the District from which elected and shall have resided in the state for a period of two years prior to election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative Session==\nEach year during which the Legislature meets constitutes a new Legislative Session.\n\n===Committee weeks===\nLegislators start Committee activity in September of the year prior to the Regular Legislative Session. Because Florida is a part-time legislature, this is necessary to allow legislators time to work their bills through the Committee process, prior to the Regular Legislative Session.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20140118/OPINION04/301180001/Paula-Dockery-Advice-Legislature-Pursue-limited-agenda|title=Editorial:Advice to Legislature:Pursue limited agenda |publisher=Florida Today}}</ref>\n\n===Regular legislative session===\nThe Florida Legislature meets in a 60-day Regular Legislative Session each year. Regular Legislative Sessions in odd-numbered years must begin on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March and on the second Tuesday after the first Monday in January of each even-numbered year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3#A3S03|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1991, the Regular Legislative Session began in April. Senate Joint Resolution 380 (1989) proposed to the voters a Constitutional Amendment (approved November 1990) that shifted the starting date of Regular Legislative Session from April to February. Subsequently, Senate Joint Resolution 2606 (1994) proposed to the voters a Constitutional Amendment (approved November 1994) shifting the start date to March, where it remains. The reason for the \"first Tuesday after the first Monday\" requirement stems back to the time when Regular Legislative Session began in April. Regular Legislative Session could start any day from April 2 through April 8, but never on April 1 \u2013 April Fool's Day. In recent years, the Legislature has opted to start in January in order to allow lawmakers to be home with their families during school spring breaks, and to give more time ahead of the legislative elections in the Fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridapolitics.com/archives/202114-proposal-to-move-2018-session-to-january-heads-to-house-floor|title=Proposal to move 2018 session to January heads House floor|last = Buzzacco-Foerster|first=Jenna|date=2016-02-18|work=Florida Politics|access-date=2016-02-18}}</ref>\n\n===Organizational session===\nOn the fourteenth day following each General Election, the Legislature meets for an Organizational Session to organize and select officers.\n\n===Special session===\nSpecial Legislative Sessions may be called by the Governor, by a joint proclamation of the Senate President and House Speaker, or by a three-fifths vote of all Legislators. During any Special Session the Legislature may only address legislative business that is within the purview of the purpose or purposes stated in the Special Session Proclamation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0000-0099/0011/Sections/0011.011.html|title=The Florida Constitution|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and process==\n{{Politics of Florida}}\nThe Florida Legislature is authorized by the [[Florida Constitution]] to create and amend the laws of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]], subject to the Governor's power to veto legislation. To do so, Legislators propose legislation in the forms of bills drafted by a nonpartisan, professional staff. Successful legislation must undergo Committee review, three [[Reading (legislature)|readings]] on the floor of each house, with appropriate voting majorities, as required, and either be signed into law by the Governor or enacted through a veto override approved by two-thirds of the membership of each legislative house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/PublishedContent/ADMINISTRATIVEPUBLICATIONS/handbook.pdf|title=The Florida Senate Handbook|publisher=Florida Senate}}</ref>\n\nIts statutes, called \"chapter laws\" or generically as \"[[slip law]]s\" when printed separately, are compiled into the ''[[Laws of Florida]]'' and are called \"[[session laws]]\".<ref name=\"sunshine\">{{cite web|title=Statutes & Constitution: Online Sunshine|publisher=Florida Legislature|accessdate=26 September 2013|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Tab=statutes&submenu=-1}}</ref> The ''[[Florida Statutes]]'' are the [[codification (law)|codified]] statutory laws of the state.<ref name=\"sunshine\"/>\n\nIn 2009, legislators filed 2,138 bills for consideration.

Article III, Section 1 of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]], adopted in 1968, defines the role of the legislature and how it is to be constituted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes#A3S01|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature|access-date=June 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208105533/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=constitution&submenu=3&tab=statutes#A3S01|archive-date=December 8, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The legislature is composed of 160 state legislators (120 in the House and 40 in the Senate). The primary purpose of the legislature is to enact new laws and amend or repeal existing laws. It meets in the [[Florida State Capitol]] building in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/reference/faq#Question1|title= FAQ|publisher=Florida Senate}}</ref>\n\n==Titles==\nMembers of the Senate are referred to as senators and members of the House of Representatives are referred to as representatives. Because this shadows the terminology used to describe [[member of Congress|members of Congress]], constituents and the news media, using [[AP Stylebook|''The Associated Press Stylebook'']], often refer to legislators as state senators or state representatives to avoid confusion with their federal counterparts.\n\n==Florida Senate==\n{{Main|Florida Senate}}\nThe Senate is the upper house of the state legislature. Its members are elected on a partisan basis for four-year terms. The Senate consists of 40 members elected from single-member election districts. Legislative districts are drawn on the basis of population figures through the federal decennial census. Senators' terms begin immediately upon their election. The Senate Chamber is located in the State Capitol building. As of 2018, [[Republican Party of Florida|Republicans]] hold the majority in the Senate with 23 seats; [[Florida Democratic Party|Democrats]] are in the minority with 17 seats.\n\n==Florida House of Representatives==\n{{Main|Florida House of Representatives}}\nThe House of Representatives is the lower house of the state legislature. Its members are elected on a partisan basis for two-year terms. The House of Representatives consists of 120 members who are elected from single-member election districts. Legislative districts are drawn on the basis of population figures through the federal decennial census. Representatives' terms begin immediately upon their election. The House of Representatives Chamber is located in the State Capitol building. As of 2019 [[Republican Party of Florida|Republicans]] hold the majority in the House of Representatives with 73 seats, and [[Florida Democratic Party|Democrats]] hold 46 seats. One seat is vacant.\n\n==Terms==\nArticle III, of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]], defines the terms for state legislators. Legislators take office immediately upon election.\n\n===Senate===\nThe Constitution requires state senators from odd-numbered districts to be elected in the years that end in numbers of which are multiples of four. Senators from even-numbered districts are required to be elected in even-numbered years the numbers of which are not multiples of four.\n\nTo reflect the results of the U.S. Census and the redrawing of district boundaries, all seats are up for election in redistricting years, with some terms truncated as a result. Thus, senators in even-numbered districts were elected to two-year terms in 2012 (following the 2010 Census), and senators in odd-numbered districts will be elected to two-year terms in 2022 (following the 2020 Census).\n\nAll terms were truncated again in 2016, with all 40 Senate seats up for election, due to court-ordered redistricting.<ref name=\"Florida Legislature\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3|title= CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\n===House of Representatives===\nMembers of the House of Representatives are elected for terms of two years in each even-numbered year.<ref name=\"Florida Legislature\"/>\n\n==Term limits==\nOn November 3, 1992, almost 77 percent of Florida voters backed Amendment 9, the Florida Term Limits Amendment, which amended the State Constitution, to enact eight year term limits on federal and state officials. Under the Amendment, former members can be elected again after a two-year break.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-10-27/news/9202250950_1_term-limits-national-constitutional-amendment-state-ballots|title=Vote Yes On Amendment No. 9 To Begin Limiting Political Terms|publisher=Sun-Sentinel}}</ref> In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could not enact congressional term limits, but ruled that the state level term limits remain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sunshinestatenews.com/story/florida-backs-article-v-convention-constitutional-amendment-congressional-term-limits|title=Florida Backs Article V Convention for Constitutional Amendment on Congressional Term Limits|publisher=Sunshine State News}}</ref>\n\n==Qualifications==\nEach legislator shall be at least twenty-one years of age, an elector and resident of the District from which elected and shall have resided in the state for a period of two years prior to election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA|publisher=Florida Legislature}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative Session==\nEach year during which the Legislature meets constitutes a new Legislative Session.\n\n===Committee weeks===\nLegislators start Committee activity in September of the year prior to the Regular Legislative Session. Because Florida is a part-time legislature, this is necessary to allow legislators time to work their bills through the Committee process, prior to the Regular Legislative Session.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20140118/OPINION04/301180001/Paula-Dockery-Advice-Legislature-Pursue-limited-agenda|title=Editorial:Advice to Legislature:Pursue limited agenda |publisher=Florida Today}}</ref>\n\n===Regular legislative session===\nThe Florida Legislature meets in a 60-day Regular Legislative Session each year.

Senate Joint Resolution 380 (1989) proposed to the voters a Constitutional Amendment (approved November 1990) that shifted the starting date of Regular Legislative Session from April to February. Subsequently, Senate Joint Resolution 2606 (1994) proposed to the voters a Constitutional Amendment (approved November 1994) shifting the start date to March, where it remains. The reason for the \"first Tuesday after the first Monday\" requirement stems back to the time when Regular Legislative Session began in April. Regular Legislative Session could start any day from April 2 through April 8, but never on April 1 \u2013 April Fool's Day. In recent years, the Legislature has opted to start in January in order to allow lawmakers to be home with their families during school spring breaks, and to give more time ahead of the legislative elections in the Fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridapolitics.com/archives/202114-proposal-to-move-2018-session-to-january-heads-to-house-floor|title=Proposal to move 2018 session to January heads House floor|last = Buzzacco-Foerster|first=Jenna|date=2016-02-18|work=Florida Politics|access-date=2016-02-18}}</ref>\n\n===Organizational session===\nOn the fourteenth day following each General Election, the Legislature meets for an Organizational Session to organize and select officers.\n\n===Special session===\nSpecial Legislative Sessions may be called by the Governor, by a joint proclamation of the Senate President and House Speaker, or by a three-fifths vote of all Legislators.

To do so, Legislators propose legislation in the forms of bills drafted by a nonpartisan, professional staff. Successful legislation must undergo Committee review, three [[Reading (legislature)|readings]] on the floor of each house, with appropriate voting majorities, as required, and either be signed into law by the Governor or enacted through a veto override approved by two-thirds of the membership of each legislative house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/PublishedContent/ADMINISTRATIVEPUBLICATIONS/handbook.pdf|title=The Florida Senate Handbook|publisher=Florida Senate}}</ref>\n\nIts statutes, called \"chapter laws\" or generically as \"[[slip law]]s\" when printed separately, are compiled into the ''[[Laws of Florida]]'' and are called \"[[session laws]]\".<ref name=\"sunshine\">{{cite web|title=Statutes & Constitution: Online Sunshine|publisher=Florida Legislature|accessdate=26 September 2013|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Tab=statutes&submenu=-1}}</ref> The ''[[Florida Statutes]]'' are the [[codification (law)|codified]] statutory laws of the state.<ref name=\"sunshine\"/>\n\nIn 2009, legislators filed 2,138 bills for consideration.

The '''double horn in F/B{{music|flat}}''' (technically a variety of [[German horn]]) is the horn most often used by players in professional orchestras and bands. A musician who plays a horn is known as a [[list of horn players|horn player]] or hornist.\n\nPitch is controlled through the combination of the following factors: speed of air through the instrument (controlled by the player's lungs and [[thoracic diaphragm]]); diameter and tension of lip aperture (by the player's lip muscles\u2014the [[embouchure]]) in the mouthpiece; plus, in a modern horn, the operation of [[Brass instrument valve|valves]] by the left hand, which route the air into extra sections of tubing. Most horns have lever-operated [[rotary valve]]s, but some, especially older horns, use [[piston valve]]s (similar to a [[trumpet]]'s) and the [[Vienna horn]] uses double-piston valves, or [[Brass instrument valve#Double-piston valve|pumpenvalves]]. The backward-facing orientation of the bell relates to the perceived desirability to create a subdued sound in concert situations, in contrast to the more piercing quality of the trumpet.  A horn without valves is known as a natural horn, changing pitch along the natural [[harmonics]] of the instrument (similar to a [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]]). Pitch may also be controlled by the position of the hand in the bell, in effect reducing the bell's diameter. The pitch of any note can easily be raised or lowered by adjusting the hand position in the bell.<ref name=\"Whitener\">{{Cite book |title=A complete guide to brass : instruments and pedagogy |last=Whitener |first=Scott and Cathy L. |publisher=Schirmer Books |year=1990 |isbn=978-0028728612 |location=New York |pages=40, 44 |oclc=19128016}}</ref> The key of a natural horn can be changed by adding different crooks of different lengths.\n\nThree valves control the flow of air in the ''single horn'', which is tuned to F or less commonly B{{music|flat}}. The more common ''double horn'' has a fourth, trigger valve, usually operated by the thumb, which routes the air to one set of tubing tuned to F or another tuned to B{{music|flat}} which expands the horn range to over four [[octaves]] and blends with flutes or [[clarinet]]s in a [[woodwind ensemble]]. Triple horns with five valves are also made, usually tuned in F, B{{music|flat}}, and a [[descant]] E{{music|flat}} or F. There are also double horns with five valves tuned in B{{music|flat}}, descant E{{music|flat}} or F, and a stopping valve, which greatly simplifies the complicated and difficult hand-stopping technique,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://poperepair.com/alexander-107-descant-w-stopping-valve-7800 |title=Alexander 107 Descant w/Stopping Valve - $7800 |last=Pope |first=Ken |website=Pope Instrument Repair |language=en |access-date=2018-02-22}}</ref> though these are rarer. Also common are ''descant'' doubles, which typically provide B{{music|flat}} and alto F branches.\n\nA crucial element in playing the horn deals with the mouthpiece. Most of the time, the mouthpiece is placed in the exact center of the lips, but, because of differences in the formation of the lips and teeth of different players, some tend to play with the mouthpiece slightly off center.<ref name=\"AOFHP\">{{Cite book |title=The art of French horn playing : a treatise on the problems and techniques of French Horn playing \u2026 |last=Farkas |first=Philip |date=1956 |publisher=Summy-Birchard  |isbn=978-0874870213 |location=Evanston, Il. |pages=6, 21, 65 |oclc=5587694}}</ref> Although the exact side-to-side placement of the mouthpiece varies for most horn players, the up-and-down placement of the mouthpiece is generally two-thirds on the upper lip and one-third on the lower lip.<ref name=\"AOFHP\" /> When playing higher notes, the majority of players exert a small degree of additional pressure on the lips using the mouthpiece. However, this is undesirable from the perspective of both endurance and tone: excessive mouthpiece pressure makes the horn sound forced and harsh, and decreases player's stamina due to the resulting constricted flow of blood to the lips and lip muscles.<ref name=\"AOFHP\" />\n\n==Name==\nThe name \"French horn\" is found only in English, first coming into use in the late 17th century.  At that time, French makers were preeminent in the manufacture of hunting horns, and were credited with creating the now-familiar, circular \"hoop\" shape of the instrument. As a result, these instruments were often called, even in English, by their French names: ''trompe de chasse'' or ''cor de chasse'' (the clear modern distinction between ''trompes'', trumpets, and ''cors'', horns, did not exist at that time).<ref name=\"Beakes\" />\n\nGerman makers first devised ''crooks'' to make such horns playable in different keys\u2014so musicians came to use \"French\" and \"German\" to distinguish the simple hunting horn from the newer horn with crooks, which in England was also called by the Italian name ''corno cromatico'' (chromatic horn).<ref name=\"Beakes\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zpOAnQEACAAJ |title=The Horn Parts in Handel's Operas and Oratorios and the Horn Players who Performed in These Works |last=Beakes |first=Jennifer |date=2007 |publisher=City University of New York |pages=50, 116\u201318, 176, 223\u201325, 439\u201340, 444\u201345 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, \"French horn\" is often used colloquially, though the adjective has normally been avoided when referring to the European orchestral horn, ever since the German horn began replacing the French-style instrument in British orchestras around 1930.<ref name=\"Del Mar\">{{Cite book |title=Anatomy of the orchestra |last=Del Mar |first= Norman |date=1983 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0520045002 |edition=2nd print., with revisions |location=Berkeley |pages=215 |oclc=10561390}}</ref> The [[International Horn Society]] has recommended since 1971 that the instrument be simply called the ''horn''.<ref name=\"Meek1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hornsociety.org/home/ihs-news/26-people/honorary/61-harold-meek-1914-1998 |title=Harold Meek (1914\u20131998) |last=Meek |first=Harold |website=International Horn Society |access-date=2018-09-04 |quote=Harold Meek is described by everyone as a gentleman, a perfectionist, and one who loved the horn.

It retains the narrow bell-throat and mouthpipe crooks of the orchestral hand horn of the late 18th century, and most often has an \"ascending\" third valve. This is a whole-tone valve arranged so that with the valve in the \"up\" position the valve loop is engaged, but when the valve is pressed the loop is cut out, raising the pitch by a whole tone.<ref name=\"Baines\">{{Cite book |title=Brass instruments : their history and development |last=Baines |first=Anthony |date=1976 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-0684152295 |location=New York |pages=221\u201323 |oclc=3795926}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Horn (instrument)}}\n[[File:French-horn.png|left|thumb|250px|Horn with three [[piston valve|Perinet valves]]]]\n[[File:How to shout and blow Horns Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus Fifteenth Century.png|thumb|right|\"How to shout and blow horns.\"\u2014Facsimile of a miniature in a manuscript of the hunting manual of [[Gaston III of Foix-B\u00e9arn|Gaston Phoebus]] (15th century)]]\n\nAs the name indicates, humans originally used to blow on the actual [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s of animals before starting to emulate them in metal. This original usage survives in the [[shofar]], a ram's horn, which plays an important role in [[Judaism|Jewish religious rituals]].\n\nEarly metal horns were less complex than modern horns, consisting of brass tubes with a slightly flared opening (the bell) wound around a few times. These early \"hunting\" horns were originally played on a hunt, often while mounted, and the sound they produced was called a recheat. Change of pitch was controlled entirely by the lips (the horn not being equipped with valves until the 19th century). Without valves, only the notes within the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] are available.  By combining a long length with a narrow bore, the French horn's design allows the player to easily reach the higher overtones which differ by whole tones or less, thus making it capable of playing melodies before valves were invented.<ref name=\"AOFHP\" />\n\nEarly horns were commonly pitched in B{{music|flat}} alto, A, A{{music|flat}}, G, F, E, E{{music|flat}}, D, C, and B{{music|flat}} basso. Since the only notes available were those on the harmonic series of one of those pitches, they had no ability to play in different keys. The remedy for this limitation was the use of [[Crook (music)|crooks]], i.e., sections of tubing of differing length that, when inserted, altered the length of the instrument, and thus its pitch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://omeka1.grinnell.edu/MusicalInstruments/items/show/193|title=Grinell College Musical|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-18th century, horn players began to insert the right hand into the bell to change the length of the instrument, adjusting the tuning up to the distance between two adjacent harmonics depending on how much of the opening was covered.\n\nIn 1818 the German makers [[Heinrich St\u00f6lzel]] and Friedrich Bl\u00fcmel patented the first valved horn, using rotary valves. Piston valves were introduced in France about 1839 by Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rinet.<ref name=\"Meek3\">{{Cite book |title=Horn and conductor : reminiscences of a practitioner with a few words of advice |last=Meek |first=Harold L. |date=1997 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |isbn=978-1878822833 |location=Rochester, NY |pages=33 |oclc=35636932}}</ref> Valves were initially intended to overcome problems associated with changing crooks during a performance. Valves' unreliability, musical taste, and players' distrust, among other reasons, slowed their adoption into mainstream. Many traditional conservatories and players refused to use them at first, claiming that the valveless horn, or ''natural horn'', was a better instrument. Some musicians who specialize in period instruments use a natural horn to play in original performance styles, to try to recapture the sound of an older piece's original performances.<ref>See, e.g., the performance of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Mass in B Minor]]'' as performed by the [[Proms]] of London in the movement from 45:40 onward in {{cite web\n|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F7TVM8m95Y\n|title = Mass in B Minor\n|magazine = You Tube\n|date = 2012\n|accessdate = 2013-11-29\n}}</ref>\n\nThe use of [[brass instrument valve|valves]], however, opened up a great deal more flexibility in playing in different keys; in effect, the horn became an entirely different instrument, fully chromatic for the first time. Valves were originally used primarily as a means to play in different keys without crooks, not for harmonic playing. That is reflected in compositions for horns, which only began to include chromatic passages in the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018|Speculation=The extremely high horn playing from the baroque and early classical periods would allow the horn to play almost completely chromatically due to the tiny differences in harmonics. This may have caused the name to develop as nobody was to know then that true chromaticism would happen in the next century. Examples include anything in a high register from that period, e.g. the horn solo from Bach's B-Minor Mass}}<!--If this is true, then what was the \"corno chromatico\" of the late 18th century, and why was it so called?-->  When valves were invented, generally, the French made smaller horns with piston valves and the Germans made larger horns with rotary valves.{{Clarify|reason=German brass players had (and many still have) a preference towards rotary valves. This is commonly seen as a holdover today as a huge amount of German and Austrian orchestras use rotary trumpets, while the majority of the rest of the world use piston trumpets.

This allows for simplicity of use and a much lighter weight. They are usually in the keys of F or B{{music|flat}}, although many F horns have longer slides to tune them to E{{music|flat}}, and almost all B{{music|flat}} horns have a valve to put them in the key of A. The problem with single horns is the inevitable choice between accuracy or tone \u2013 while the F horn has the \"typical\" horn sound, above third-space C accuracy is a concern for the majority of players because, by its nature, one plays high in the horn's harmonic series where the overtones are closer together. This led to the development of the B{{music|flat}} horn, which, although easier to play accurately, has a less desirable sound in the mid and especially the low register where it is not able to play all of the notes.  The solution has been the development of the double horn, which combines the two into one horn with a single lead pipe and bell.  Both main types of single horns are still used today as student models because they are cheaper and lighter than double horns.  In addition, the single B{{music|flat}} horns are sometimes used in solo and chamber performances and the single F survives orchestrally as the Vienna horn. Additionally, single F alto and B{{music|flat}} alto descants are used in the performance of some baroque horn concertos and F, B{{music|flat}} and F alto singles are occasionally used by [[jazz]] performers.\n\n[[Dennis Brain]]'s benchmark recordings of the Mozart Horn Concerti were made on a single B{{music|flat}} instrument by [[Gebr. Alexander]], now on display at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London.\n\n===Double horn===\n[[File:French horn detail.jpg|frame|right|The [[rotary valve|valves]] of a [[Conn-Selmer|Conn]] 6D double horn. The three lever keys (above the large valves) can be depressed toward the large outer tube.

An early solution was simply to use a horn of higher pitch\u2014usually B{{music|flat}}. The use of the F versus the B{{music|flat}} horn was extensively debated among horn players of the late 19th century, until the German horn maker Ed. Kruspe (namesake of [[Ed. Kruspe|his family's brass instrument firm]]) produced a prototype of the \"double horn\" in 1897.\n\nThe double horn also combines two instruments into a single frame: the original horn in F, and a second, higher horn keyed in B{{music|flat}}. By using a fourth valve (usually operated by the thumb), the horn player can quickly switch from the deep, warm tones of the F horn to the higher, brighter tones of the B{{music|flat}} horn, or vice versa, as the horn player may choose to have the horn set into B{{music|flat}} by default by making a simple adjustment to the valves. The two sets of tones are commonly called \"sides\" of the horn. Using the fourth valve not only changes the basic length (and thus the harmonic series and pitch) of the instrument, it also causes the three main valves to use proportionate slide lengths.<ref>Backus, John, ''The Acoustical Foundations of Music'', 2nd ed. (New York: W. W. Norton, 1977),{{Page needed|date=June 2015}} {{ISBN|0-393-09096-5}}.</ref>\n\nIn the US, the two most common styles (\"wraps\") of double horns are named Kruspe and Geyer/Knopf, after the first instrument makers who developed and standardized them. The Kruspe wrap locates the B{{music|flat}} change valve above the first valve, near the thumb. The Geyer wrap has the change valve behind the third valve, near the little finger (although the valve's trigger is still played with the thumb). In effect, the air flows in a completely different direction on the other model. Kruspe wrap horns tend to be larger in the bell throat than the Geyer wrap horns. Typically, Kruspe models are constructed from [[nickel silver]] (also called German silver, an alloy of copper, nickel and zinc, containing no actual silver) while Geyer horns tend to be of yellow brass. Both models have their own strengths and weaknesses, and while the choice of instrument is very personal, an orchestral horn section is usually found to have either one or the other, owing to the differences in tone color, response, and projection of the two different styles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn Europe the most popular horns are arguably those made by Gebr. Alexander, of Mainz (particularly the Alexander 103), and those made by [[Paxman Musical Instruments|Paxman]] in London. In Germany and the [[Benelux]] countries, the Alex 103 is extremely popular. These horns do not fit strictly into the Kruspe or Knopf camps, but have features of both. Alexander prefers the traditional medium bell size, which they have produced for many years, whereas Paxman do offer their models in a range of bell throat sizes. In the United States, the [[Conn-Selmer|Conn]] 8D, a mass-produced instrument based on the Kruspe design, has been extremely popular in many areas (New York, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Philadelphia). Since roughly the early 1990s, however, for reasons ranging from changing tastes to a general dislike of Conn's newer 8Ds, orchestras have been moving away from the popular Conn 8D. Geyer model horns (by Carl Geyer, Karl Hill, Keith Berg, Steve Lewis, Jerry Lechniuk, [[Daniel Rauch|Dan Rauch]], and Ricco-Kuhn) are used in other areas (San Francisco, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Boston, Houston). The CF Schmidt double, with its unique piston change valve, is occasionally found in sections playing Geyer/Knopf model equipment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Detachable bell===\nThe horn, although not large, is awkward in its shape and does not lend itself well to transport where space is shared or limited, especially on planes. To compensate, horn makers can make the bell detachable; this allows for smaller and more manageable horn cases.\n\n==Related horns==\n{{Main|Horn (instrument)}}\nThe variety in horn history necessitates consideration of the natural horn, Vienna horn, mellophone, marching horn, and Wagner tuba.\n\n===Natural horn===\n[[File:Natural Horn (instrument).JPG|left|thumb|A natural horn has no valves, but can be tuned to a different key by inserting different tubing, as during a rest period.]]\n{{Main|Natural horn}}\nThe [[natural horn]] is the ancestor of the modern horn. It is essentially descended from hunting horns, with its pitch controlled by air speed, aperture (opening of the lips through which air passes) and the use of the right hand moving around, as well as in and out of the bell. Although a few recent composers have written specifically for the natural horn (e.g., [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]]'s ''[[Hamburg Concerto]]''), today it is played primarily as a [[Historically informed performance|period instrument]]. The natural horn can only play from a single harmonic series at a time because there is only one length of tubing available to the horn player. A proficient player can indeed alter the pitch by partially muting the bell with the right hand, thus enabling the player to reach some notes that are not part of the instrument's natural harmonic series \u2013 of course this technique also affects the quality of the tone. The player has a choice of key by using crooks to change the length of tubing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Musical instruments of the world|last=Diagram Group.|date=1976|publisher=Published for Unicef by Facts On File|isbn=0871963205|location=|pages=68|oclc=223164947}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2019}}<!--It seems unlikely that a book of this nature would mention everything in this paragraph (especially Ligeti's use of the instrument).-->\n\n===Vienna horn===\n[[File:Viennese horn.jpg|thumb|300px|Vienna horn]]\n{{Main|Vienna horn}}\nThe [[Vienna horn]] is a special horn used primarily in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. Instead of using [[rotary valve]]s or [[piston valve]]s, it uses the pumpenvalve (or Vienna valve), which is a double-piston operating inside the valve slides, and usually situated on the opposite side of the corpus from the player's left hand, and operated by a long pushrod. Unlike the modern horn, which has grown considerably larger internally (for a bigger, broader, and louder tone), and considerably heavier (with the addition of valves and tubing in the case of the double horn) the Vienna horn very closely mimics the size and weight of the natural horn, (although the valves do add some weight, they are lighter than rotary valves) even using crooks in the front of the horn, between the mouthpiece and the instrument. Although instead of the full range of keys, Vienna horn players usually use an F crook and it is looked down upon to use others, though switching to an A or B{{music|flat}} crook for higher pitched music does happen on occasion. Vienna horns are often used with funnel shaped mouthpieces similar to those used on the natural horn, with very little (if any) backbore and a very thin rim. The Viennese horn requires very specialized technique and can be quite challenging to play, even for accomplished players of modern horns. The Vienna horn has a warmer, softer sound than the modern horn. Its pumpenvalves facilitate a continuous transition between notes ([[glissando]]); conversely, a more precise operating of the valves is required to avoid notes that sound out of tune.\n\n===Mellophone===\n{{Main|Mellophone}}\nTwo instruments are called a ''mellophone''. The first is an instrument shaped somewhat like a horn, in that it is formed in a circle. It has piston valves and is played with the right hand on the valves. Manufacturing of this instrument sharply decreased in the middle of the 20th century, and this mellophone (or mellophonium) rarely appears today.\n\nThe second instrument is used in modern brass bands and marching bands, and is more accurately called a \"marching mellophone\" or mellophone. A derivative of the F [[alto horn]], it is keyed in F. It is shaped like a flugelhorn, with piston valves played with the right hand and a forward-pointing bell. These horns are generally considered better [[marching instrument]]s than regular horns because their position is more stable on the mouth, they project better, and they weigh less. It is primarily used as the middle voice of [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]]. Though they are usually played with a V-cup cornet-like mouthpiece, their range overlaps the common playing range of the horn. This mouthpiece switch makes the mellophone louder, less mellow, and more brassy and brilliant, making it more appropriate for marching bands. Often now with the use of converters, traditional conical horn mouthpieces are used to achieve the more mellow sound of a horn to make the marching band sound more like a concert band.\n\nAs they are pitched in F or G and their range overlaps that of the horn, mellophones can be used in place of the horn in brass and marching band settings. Mellophones are, however, sometimes unpopular with horn players because the mouthpiece change can be difficult and requires a different [[embouchure]]. Mouthpiece adapters are available so that a horn mouthpiece can fit into the mellophone lead pipe, but this does not compensate for the many differences that a horn player must adapt to. The \"feel\" of the mellophone can be foreign to a horn player. Another unfamiliar aspect of the mellophone is that it is designed to be played with the right hand instead of the left (though it can be played with the left). Intonation can also be an issue with the mellophone.{{Why|date=July 2016}}\n\nWhile horn players may be asked to play the mellophone, it is unlikely that the instrument was ever intended as a substitute for the horn, mainly because of the fundamental differences described.<ref>{{cite web | title= The History of the Mellophone | url= http://www.alsmiddlebrasspages.com/mellophone/history.html | last= Monks | first= Greg | date= 2006-01-06 | publisher= Al's Mellophone Page | accessdate= 2008-07-29}}</ref> As an instrument it compromises between the ability to sound like a horn, while being used like a trumpet or flugelhorn, a tradeoff that sacrifices acoustic properties for ergonomics.\n\n===Marching horn===\nThe marching horn is quite similar to the mellophone in shape and appearance, but is pitched in the key of B{{music|flat}}, the same as the B{{music|flat}} side of a double horn. It is also available in F alto, one octave above the F side of a double horn. The marching horn is also played with a horn mouthpiece (unlike the mellophone, which needs an adapter to fit the horn mouthpiece). These instruments are primarily used in marching bands so the sound comes from a forward-facing bell, as dissipation of the sound from the backward-facing bell becomes a concern in open-air environments. Many college marching bands and drum corps, however, use mellophones instead, which, with many marching bands, better balance the tone of the other brass instruments; additionally, mellophones require less special training of trumpeters, who considerably outnumber horn players.<ref>Mellophones, as indicated, use the same fingering as trumpets and are operated by the right hand.</ref>\n\n===Wagner tuba===\n{{Main|Wagner tuba}}\nThe Wagner tuba is a rare brass instrument that is essentially a horn modified to have a larger bell throat and a vertical bell. Despite its name, it is generally not considered part of the [[tuba]] family. Invented for [[Richard Wagner]] specifically for his work ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', it has since been written for by various other composers, including [[Bruckner]], [[Stravinsky]] and [[Richard Strauss]]. It uses a horn mouthpiece and is available as a single tuba in B{{music|flat}} or F, or, more recently, as a double tuba similar to the double horn. Its common range is similar to that of the [[euphonium]], but its possible range is the same as that of the horn, extending from low F{{music|sharp}}, below the bass clef staff to high C above the treble staff when read in F. These low pedals are substantially easier to play on the Wagner tuba than on the horn. Wagner viewed the regular horn as a woodwind rather than a brass instrument, evidenced by his placing of the horn parts in his orchestral scores in the woodwind group and not in their usual place above the trumpets in the brass section.\n\n==Repertoire==\n[[File:Paxman-horns.jpg|thumb|left|Paxman horns]]\n{{See also|List of compositions for horn}}\n\nDiscussion of the repertoire of horns must recognize the different needs of orchestras and concert bands in contrast to marching bands, as above, but also the use of horns in a wide variety of music, including chamber music and jazz.\n\n===Orchestra and concert band===\nThe horn is most often used as an orchestral and concert band instrument, with its singular tone being employed by composers to achieve specific effects. [[Leopold Mozart]], for example, used horns to signify the hunt, as in his ''[[Jagdsinfonie]]'' (hunting symphony). [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] wrote much for the horn, and it features prominently in the work of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''Brandenburg Concerto no. 1''. Once the technique of [[hand-stopping]] had been developed, allowing fully chromatic playing, composers began to write seriously for the horn. [[Gustav Mahler]] made great use of the horn's uniquely haunting and distant sound in his symphonies, notably the famous ''Nachtmusik'' (serenade) section of his [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 7]].\n\nMany composers have written works that have become favorites in the horn repertoire. These include [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] (''Elegie'') and [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] (''Morceau de Concert for horn and orchestra'', op. 94 and ''Romance'', op. 36). Others, particularly [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], whose friend [[Joseph Leutgeb]] was a noted horn player, wrote extensively for the instrument, including [[concerto|concerti]] and other solo works. Mozart's ''[[A Musical Joke]]'' satirizes the limitations of contemporary horn playing, including the risk of selecting the wrong crook by mistake.\n\nThe development of the valve horn was exploited by romantic composers such as [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], [[Mahler]], and [[Richard Strauss]], whose father was a well-known professional horn player. Strauss's ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' contains one of the best known horn solos from this period, relying on the chromatic facility of the valved horn. [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''Konzertst\u00fcck'' for four horns and orchestra is a notable three-movement work. Brahms had a lifelong love-affair with the instrument, with many prominently featured parts throughout his four symphonies. However players today typically play Brahms on modern valved instruments.\n\n===Chamber music===\nThere is an abundance of chamber music repertoire for horn. It is a standard member of the [[wind quintet]] and [[brass quintet]], and often appears in other configurations, such as Brahms' [[Horn Trio (Brahms)|Horn Trio]] for violin, horn and piano (for which, however, Brahms specified the natural horn). Also, the horn can be used by itself in a horn ensemble or \"horn choir\". The horn choir is especially practical because the extended range of the horn provides the composer or arranger with more possibilities, registerally, sonically, and contrapuntally.\n\n==Orchestral and concert band horns==\n[[File:DSC 8763 (7084102945).jpg|thumb|300px|A horn section in a military [[concert band]]]]\nA classical orchestra usually has at least two French horn players. Typically, the first horn played a high part and the second horn played a low part. Composers from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] (early 1800s) onwards commonly used four horns. Here, the first and second horns played as a pair (first horn being high, second horn being low), and the third and fourth horns played as another pair (third horn being high, fourth horn being low).\n\nMusic written for the modern horn follows a similar pattern with the first and third horns being high and the second and fourth horns being low. This configuration serves multiple purposes. It is easier to play high when the adjacent player is playing low and vice versa. Pairing makes it easier to write for horns, as the third and fourth horns can take over from the first and second horns or play contrasting material.

The '''double horn in F/B{{music|flat}}''' (technically a variety of [[German horn]]) is the horn most often used by players in professional orchestras and bands. A musician who plays a horn is known as a [[list of horn players|horn player]] or hornist.\n\nPitch is controlled through the combination of the following factors: speed of air through the instrument (controlled by the player's lungs and [[thoracic diaphragm]]); diameter and tension of lip aperture (by the player's lip muscles\u2014the [[embouchure]]) in the mouthpiece; plus, in a modern horn, the operation of [[Brass instrument valve|valves]] by the left hand, which route the air into extra sections of tubing. Most horns have lever-operated [[rotary valve]]s, but some, especially older horns, use [[piston valve]]s (similar to a [[trumpet]]'s) and the [[Vienna horn]] uses double-piston valves, or [[Brass instrument valve#Double-piston valve|pumpenvalves]]. The backward-facing orientation of the bell relates to the perceived desirability to create a subdued sound in concert situations, in contrast to the more piercing quality of the trumpet.  A horn without valves is known as a natural horn, changing pitch along the natural [[harmonics]] of the instrument (similar to a [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]]). Pitch may also be controlled by the position of the hand in the bell, in effect reducing the bell's diameter. The pitch of any note can easily be raised or lowered by adjusting the hand position in the bell.<ref name=\"Whitener\">{{Cite book |title=A complete guide to brass : instruments and pedagogy |last=Whitener |first=Scott and Cathy L. |publisher=Schirmer Books |year=1990 |isbn=978-0028728612 |location=New York |pages=40, 44 |oclc=19128016}}</ref> The key of a natural horn can be changed by adding different crooks of different lengths.\n\nThree valves control the flow of air in the ''single horn'', which is tuned to F or less commonly B{{music|flat}}. The more common ''double horn'' has a fourth, trigger valve, usually operated by the thumb, which routes the air to one set of tubing tuned to F or another tuned to B{{music|flat}} which expands the horn range to over four [[octaves]] and blends with flutes or [[clarinet]]s in a [[woodwind ensemble]]. Triple horns with five valves are also made, usually tuned in F, B{{music|flat}}, and a [[descant]] E{{music|flat}} or F. There are also double horns with five valves tuned in B{{music|flat}}, descant E{{music|flat}} or F, and a stopping valve, which greatly simplifies the complicated and difficult hand-stopping technique,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://poperepair.com/alexander-107-descant-w-stopping-valve-7800 |title=Alexander 107 Descant w/Stopping Valve - $7800 |last=Pope |first=Ken |website=Pope Instrument Repair |language=en |access-date=2018-02-22}}</ref> though these are rarer. Also common are ''descant'' doubles, which typically provide B{{music|flat}} and alto F branches.\n\nA crucial element in playing the horn deals with the mouthpiece. Most of the time, the mouthpiece is placed in the exact center of the lips, but, because of differences in the formation of the lips and teeth of different players, some tend to play with the mouthpiece slightly off center.<ref name=\"AOFHP\">{{Cite book |title=The art of French horn playing : a treatise on the problems and techniques of French Horn playing \u2026 |last=Farkas |first=Philip |date=1956 |publisher=Summy-Birchard  |isbn=978-0874870213 |location=Evanston, Il. |pages=6, 21, 65 |oclc=5587694}}</ref> Although the exact side-to-side placement of the mouthpiece varies for most horn players, the up-and-down placement of the mouthpiece is generally two-thirds on the upper lip and one-third on the lower lip.<ref name=\"AOFHP\" /> When playing higher notes, the majority of players exert a small degree of additional pressure on the lips using the mouthpiece. However, this is undesirable from the perspective of both endurance and tone: excessive mouthpiece pressure makes the horn sound forced and harsh, and decreases player's stamina due to the resulting constricted flow of blood to the lips and lip muscles.<ref name=\"AOFHP\" />\n\n==Name==\nThe name \"French horn\" is found only in English, first coming into use in the late 17th century.  At that time, French makers were preeminent in the manufacture of hunting horns, and were credited with creating the now-familiar, circular \"hoop\" shape of the instrument. As a result, these instruments were often called, even in English, by their French names: ''trompe de chasse'' or ''cor de chasse'' (the clear modern distinction between ''trompes'', trumpets, and ''cors'', horns, did not exist at that time).<ref name=\"Beakes\" />\n\nGerman makers first devised ''crooks'' to make such horns playable in different keys\u2014so musicians came to use \"French\" and \"German\" to distinguish the simple hunting horn from the newer horn with crooks, which in England was also called by the Italian name ''corno cromatico'' (chromatic horn).<ref name=\"Beakes\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zpOAnQEACAAJ |title=The Horn Parts in Handel's Operas and Oratorios and the Horn Players who Performed in These Works |last=Beakes |first=Jennifer |date=2007 |publisher=City University of New York |pages=50, 116\u201318, 176, 223\u201325, 439\u201340, 444\u201345 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, \"French horn\" is often used colloquially, though the adjective has normally been avoided when referring to the European orchestral horn, ever since the German horn began replacing the French-style instrument in British orchestras around 1930.<ref name=\"Del Mar\">{{Cite book |title=Anatomy of the orchestra |last=Del Mar |first= Norman |date=1983 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0520045002 |edition=2nd print., with revisions |location=Berkeley |pages=215 |oclc=10561390}}</ref> The [[International Horn Society]] has recommended since 1971 that the instrument be simply called the ''horn''.<ref name=\"Meek1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hornsociety.org/home/ihs-news/26-people/honorary/61-harold-meek-1914-1998 |title=Harold Meek (1914\u20131998) |last=Meek |first=Harold |website=International Horn Society |access-date=2018-09-04 |quote=Harold Meek is described by everyone as a gentleman, a perfectionist, and one who loved the horn.

In this sense, \"French horn\" refers to a narrow-bore instrument ({{cvt|10.8|-|11.0|mm|in|disp=sqbr}}) with three P\u00e9rinet (piston) valves. It retains the narrow bell-throat and mouthpipe crooks of the orchestral hand horn of the late 18th century, and most often has an \"ascending\" third valve. This is a whole-tone valve arranged so that with the valve in the \"up\" position the valve loop is engaged, but when the valve is pressed the loop is cut out, raising the pitch by a whole tone.<ref name=\"Baines\">{{Cite book |title=Brass instruments : their history and development |last=Baines |first=Anthony |date=1976 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-0684152295 |location=New York |pages=221\u201323 |oclc=3795926}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Horn (instrument)}}\n[[File:French-horn.png|left|thumb|250px|Horn with three [[piston valve|Perinet valves]]]]\n[[File:How to shout and blow Horns Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus Fifteenth Century.png|thumb|right|\"How to shout and blow horns.\"\u2014Facsimile of a miniature in a manuscript of the hunting manual of [[Gaston III of Foix-B\u00e9arn|Gaston Phoebus]] (15th century)]]\n\nAs the name indicates, humans originally used to blow on the actual [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s of animals before starting to emulate them in metal. This original usage survives in the [[shofar]], a ram's horn, which plays an important role in [[Judaism|Jewish religious rituals]].\n\nEarly metal horns were less complex than modern horns, consisting of brass tubes with a slightly flared opening (the bell) wound around a few times. These early \"hunting\" horns were originally played on a hunt, often while mounted, and the sound they produced was called a recheat. Change of pitch was controlled entirely by the lips (the horn not being equipped with valves until the 19th century). Without valves, only the notes within the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] are available.  By combining a long length with a narrow bore, the French horn's design allows the player to easily reach the higher overtones which differ by whole tones or less, thus making it capable of playing melodies before valves were invented.<ref name=\"AOFHP\" />\n\nEarly horns were commonly pitched in B{{music|flat}} alto, A, A{{music|flat}}, G, F, E, E{{music|flat}}, D, C, and B{{music|flat}} basso. Since the only notes available were those on the harmonic series of one of those pitches, they had no ability to play in different keys. The remedy for this limitation was the use of [[Crook (music)|crooks]], i.e., sections of tubing of differing length that, when inserted, altered the length of the instrument, and thus its pitch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://omeka1.grinnell.edu/MusicalInstruments/items/show/193|title=Grinell College Musical|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-18th century, horn players began to insert the right hand into the bell to change the length of the instrument, adjusting the tuning up to the distance between two adjacent harmonics depending on how much of the opening was covered.\n\nIn 1818 the German makers [[Heinrich St\u00f6lzel]] and Friedrich Bl\u00fcmel patented the first valved horn, using rotary valves. Piston valves were introduced in France about 1839 by Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rinet.<ref name=\"Meek3\">{{Cite book |title=Horn and conductor : reminiscences of a practitioner with a few words of advice |last=Meek |first=Harold L. |date=1997 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |isbn=978-1878822833 |location=Rochester, NY |pages=33 |oclc=35636932}}</ref> Valves were initially intended to overcome problems associated with changing crooks during a performance. Valves' unreliability, musical taste, and players' distrust, among other reasons, slowed their adoption into mainstream. Many traditional conservatories and players refused to use them at first, claiming that the valveless horn, or ''natural horn'', was a better instrument. Some musicians who specialize in period instruments use a natural horn to play in original performance styles, to try to recapture the sound of an older piece's original performances.<ref>See, e.g., the performance of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Mass in B Minor]]'' as performed by the [[Proms]] of London in the movement from 45:40 onward in {{cite web\n|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F7TVM8m95Y\n|title = Mass in B Minor\n|magazine = You Tube\n|date = 2012\n|accessdate = 2013-11-29\n}}</ref>\n\nThe use of [[brass instrument valve|valves]], however, opened up a great deal more flexibility in playing in different keys; in effect, the horn became an entirely different instrument, fully chromatic for the first time. Valves were originally used primarily as a means to play in different keys without crooks, not for harmonic playing. That is reflected in compositions for horns, which only began to include chromatic passages in the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018|Speculation=The extremely high horn playing from the baroque and early classical periods would allow the horn to play almost completely chromatically due to the tiny differences in harmonics. This may have caused the name to develop as nobody was to know then that true chromaticism would happen in the next century. Examples include anything in a high register from that period, e.g. the horn solo from Bach's B-Minor Mass}}<!--If this is true, then what was the \"corno chromatico\" of the late 18th century, and why was it so called?-->  When valves were invented, generally, the French made smaller horns with piston valves and the Germans made larger horns with rotary valves.{{Clarify|reason=German brass players had (and many still have) a preference towards rotary valves. This is commonly seen as a holdover today as a huge amount of German and Austrian orchestras use rotary trumpets, while the majority of the rest of the world use piston trumpets. An example is seen at the very start of this performance by the Berlin Philharmonic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwQumQpug_E|date=February 2018}}<!--What, like horns in F, as opposed to horns in B-flat basso or alto?-->\n\n==Types==\nHorns may be classified in single horn, double horn, compensating double horn, and triple horn as well as the versatility of detachable bells.\n[[File:Yamaha Horn YHR-314II.tif|thumb|250px|right|Single horn in F, student model.]]\n\n===Single horn===\nSingle horns use a single set of tubes connected to the valves. This allows for simplicity of use and a much lighter weight. They are usually in the keys of F or B{{music|flat}}, although many F horns have longer slides to tune them to E{{music|flat}}, and almost all B{{music|flat}} horns have a valve to put them in the key of A. The problem with single horns is the inevitable choice between accuracy or tone \u2013 while the F horn has the \"typical\" horn sound, above third-space C accuracy is a concern for the majority of players because, by its nature, one plays high in the horn's harmonic series where the overtones are closer together. This led to the development of the B{{music|flat}} horn, which, although easier to play accurately, has a less desirable sound in the mid and especially the low register where it is not able to play all of the notes.  The solution has been the development of the double horn, which combines the two into one horn with a single lead pipe and bell.  Both main types of single horns are still used today as student models because they are cheaper and lighter than double horns.  In addition, the single B{{music|flat}} horns are sometimes used in solo and chamber performances and the single F survives orchestrally as the Vienna horn. Additionally, single F alto and B{{music|flat}} alto descants are used in the performance of some baroque horn concertos and F, B{{music|flat}} and F alto singles are occasionally used by [[jazz]] performers.\n\n[[Dennis Brain]]'s benchmark recordings of the Mozart Horn Concerti were made on a single B{{music|flat}} instrument by [[Gebr. Alexander]], now on display at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London.\n\n===Double horn===\n[[File:French horn detail.jpg|frame|right|The [[rotary valve|valves]] of a [[Conn-Selmer|Conn]] 6D double horn. The three lever keys (above the large valves) can be depressed toward the large outer tube.

An early solution was simply to use a horn of higher pitch\u2014usually B{{music|flat}}. The use of the F versus the B{{music|flat}} horn was extensively debated among horn players of the late 19th century, until the German horn maker Ed. Kruspe (namesake of [[Ed. Kruspe|his family's brass instrument firm]]) produced a prototype of the \"double horn\" in 1897.\n\nThe double horn also combines two instruments into a single frame: the original horn in F, and a second, higher horn keyed in B{{music|flat}}. By using a fourth valve (usually operated by the thumb), the horn player can quickly switch from the deep, warm tones of the F horn to the higher, brighter tones of the B{{music|flat}} horn, or vice versa, as the horn player may choose to have the horn set into B{{music|flat}} by default by making a simple adjustment to the valves. The two sets of tones are commonly called \"sides\" of the horn. Using the fourth valve not only changes the basic length (and thus the harmonic series and pitch) of the instrument, it also causes the three main valves to use proportionate slide lengths.<ref>Backus, John, ''The Acoustical Foundations of Music'', 2nd ed. (New York: W. W. Norton, 1977),{{Page needed|date=June 2015}} {{ISBN|0-393-09096-5}}.</ref>\n\nIn the US, the two most common styles (\"wraps\") of double horns are named Kruspe and Geyer/Knopf, after the first instrument makers who developed and standardized them. The Kruspe wrap locates the B{{music|flat}} change valve above the first valve, near the thumb. The Geyer wrap has the change valve behind the third valve, near the little finger (although the valve's trigger is still played with the thumb). In effect, the air flows in a completely different direction on the other model. Kruspe wrap horns tend to be larger in the bell throat than the Geyer wrap horns. Typically, Kruspe models are constructed from [[nickel silver]] (also called German silver, an alloy of copper, nickel and zinc, containing no actual silver) while Geyer horns tend to be of yellow brass. Both models have their own strengths and weaknesses, and while the choice of instrument is very personal, an orchestral horn section is usually found to have either one or the other, owing to the differences in tone color, response, and projection of the two different styles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn Europe the most popular horns are arguably those made by Gebr. Alexander, of Mainz (particularly the Alexander 103), and those made by [[Paxman Musical Instruments|Paxman]] in London. In Germany and the [[Benelux]] countries, the Alex 103 is extremely popular. These horns do not fit strictly into the Kruspe or Knopf camps, but have features of both. Alexander prefers the traditional medium bell size, which they have produced for many years, whereas Paxman do offer their models in a range of bell throat sizes. In the United States, the [[Conn-Selmer|Conn]] 8D, a mass-produced instrument based on the Kruspe design, has been extremely popular in many areas (New York, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Philadelphia). Since roughly the early 1990s, however, for reasons ranging from changing tastes to a general dislike of Conn's newer 8Ds, orchestras have been moving away from the popular Conn 8D. Geyer model horns (by Carl Geyer, Karl Hill, Keith Berg, Steve Lewis, Jerry Lechniuk, [[Daniel Rauch|Dan Rauch]], and Ricco-Kuhn) are used in other areas (San Francisco, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Boston, Houston). The CF Schmidt double, with its unique piston change valve, is occasionally found in sections playing Geyer/Knopf model equipment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Detachable bell===\nThe horn, although not large, is awkward in its shape and does not lend itself well to transport where space is shared or limited, especially on planes. To compensate, horn makers can make the bell detachable; this allows for smaller and more manageable horn cases.\n\n==Related horns==\n{{Main|Horn (instrument)}}\nThe variety in horn history necessitates consideration of the natural horn, Vienna horn, mellophone, marching horn, and Wagner tuba.\n\n===Natural horn===\n[[File:Natural Horn (instrument).JPG|left|thumb|A natural horn has no valves, but can be tuned to a different key by inserting different tubing, as during a rest period.]]\n{{Main|Natural horn}}\nThe [[natural horn]] is the ancestor of the modern horn. It is essentially descended from hunting horns, with its pitch controlled by air speed, aperture (opening of the lips through which air passes) and the use of the right hand moving around, as well as in and out of the bell. Although a few recent composers have written specifically for the natural horn (e.g., [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]]'s ''[[Hamburg Concerto]]''), today it is played primarily as a [[Historically informed performance|period instrument]]. The natural horn can only play from a single harmonic series at a time because there is only one length of tubing available to the horn player. A proficient player can indeed alter the pitch by partially muting the bell with the right hand, thus enabling the player to reach some notes that are not part of the instrument's natural harmonic series \u2013 of course this technique also affects the quality of the tone. The player has a choice of key by using crooks to change the length of tubing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Musical instruments of the world|last=Diagram Group.|date=1976|publisher=Published for Unicef by Facts On File|isbn=0871963205|location=|pages=68|oclc=223164947}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2019}}<!--It seems unlikely that a book of this nature would mention everything in this paragraph (especially Ligeti's use of the instrument).-->\n\n===Vienna horn===\n[[File:Viennese horn.jpg|thumb|300px|Vienna horn]]\n{{Main|Vienna horn}}\nThe [[Vienna horn]] is a special horn used primarily in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. Instead of using [[rotary valve]]s or [[piston valve]]s, it uses the pumpenvalve (or Vienna valve), which is a double-piston operating inside the valve slides, and usually situated on the opposite side of the corpus from the player's left hand, and operated by a long pushrod. Unlike the modern horn, which has grown considerably larger internally (for a bigger, broader, and louder tone), and considerably heavier (with the addition of valves and tubing in the case of the double horn) the Vienna horn very closely mimics the size and weight of the natural horn, (although the valves do add some weight, they are lighter than rotary valves) even using crooks in the front of the horn, between the mouthpiece and the instrument. Although instead of the full range of keys, Vienna horn players usually use an F crook and it is looked down upon to use others, though switching to an A or B{{music|flat}} crook for higher pitched music does happen on occasion. Vienna horns are often used with funnel shaped mouthpieces similar to those used on the natural horn, with very little (if any) backbore and a very thin rim. The Viennese horn requires very specialized technique and can be quite challenging to play, even for accomplished players of modern horns. The Vienna horn has a warmer, softer sound than the modern horn. Its pumpenvalves facilitate a continuous transition between notes ([[glissando]]); conversely, a more precise operating of the valves is required to avoid notes that sound out of tune.\n\n===Mellophone===\n{{Main|Mellophone}}\nTwo instruments are called a ''mellophone''. The first is an instrument shaped somewhat like a horn, in that it is formed in a circle. It has piston valves and is played with the right hand on the valves. Manufacturing of this instrument sharply decreased in the middle of the 20th century, and this mellophone (or mellophonium) rarely appears today.\n\nThe second instrument is used in modern brass bands and marching bands, and is more accurately called a \"marching mellophone\" or mellophone. A derivative of the F [[alto horn]], it is keyed in F. It is shaped like a flugelhorn, with piston valves played with the right hand and a forward-pointing bell. These horns are generally considered better [[marching instrument]]s than regular horns because their position is more stable on the mouth, they project better, and they weigh less. It is primarily used as the middle voice of [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]]. Though they are usually played with a V-cup cornet-like mouthpiece, their range overlaps the common playing range of the horn. This mouthpiece switch makes the mellophone louder, less mellow, and more brassy and brilliant, making it more appropriate for marching bands. Often now with the use of converters, traditional conical horn mouthpieces are used to achieve the more mellow sound of a horn to make the marching band sound more like a concert band.\n\nAs they are pitched in F or G and their range overlaps that of the horn, mellophones can be used in place of the horn in brass and marching band settings. Mellophones are, however, sometimes unpopular with horn players because the mouthpiece change can be difficult and requires a different [[embouchure]]. Mouthpiece adapters are available so that a horn mouthpiece can fit into the mellophone lead pipe, but this does not compensate for the many differences that a horn player must adapt to. The \"feel\" of the mellophone can be foreign to a horn player. Another unfamiliar aspect of the mellophone is that it is designed to be played with the right hand instead of the left (though it can be played with the left). Intonation can also be an issue with the mellophone.{{Why|date=July 2016}}\n\nWhile horn players may be asked to play the mellophone, it is unlikely that the instrument was ever intended as a substitute for the horn, mainly because of the fundamental differences described.<ref>{{cite web | title= The History of the Mellophone | url= http://www.alsmiddlebrasspages.com/mellophone/history.html | last= Monks | first= Greg | date= 2006-01-06 | publisher= Al's Mellophone Page | accessdate= 2008-07-29}}</ref> As an instrument it compromises between the ability to sound like a horn, while being used like a trumpet or flugelhorn, a tradeoff that sacrifices acoustic properties for ergonomics.\n\n===Marching horn===\nThe marching horn is quite similar to the mellophone in shape and appearance, but is pitched in the key of B{{music|flat}}, the same as the B{{music|flat}} side of a double horn. It is also available in F alto, one octave above the F side of a double horn. The marching horn is also played with a horn mouthpiece (unlike the mellophone, which needs an adapter to fit the horn mouthpiece). These instruments are primarily used in marching bands so the sound comes from a forward-facing bell, as dissipation of the sound from the backward-facing bell becomes a concern in open-air environments. Many college marching bands and drum corps, however, use mellophones instead, which, with many marching bands, better balance the tone of the other brass instruments; additionally, mellophones require less special training of trumpeters, who considerably outnumber horn players.<ref>Mellophones, as indicated, use the same fingering as trumpets and are operated by the right hand.</ref>\n\n===Wagner tuba===\n{{Main|Wagner tuba}}\nThe Wagner tuba is a rare brass instrument that is essentially a horn modified to have a larger bell throat and a vertical bell. Despite its name, it is generally not considered part of the [[tuba]] family. Invented for [[Richard Wagner]] specifically for his work ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', it has since been written for by various other composers, including [[Bruckner]], [[Stravinsky]] and [[Richard Strauss]]. It uses a horn mouthpiece and is available as a single tuba in B{{music|flat}} or F, or, more recently, as a double tuba similar to the double horn. Its common range is similar to that of the [[euphonium]], but its possible range is the same as that of the horn, extending from low F{{music|sharp}}, below the bass clef staff to high C above the treble staff when read in F. These low pedals are substantially easier to play on the Wagner tuba than on the horn. Wagner viewed the regular horn as a woodwind rather than a brass instrument, evidenced by his placing of the horn parts in his orchestral scores in the woodwind group and not in their usual place above the trumpets in the brass section.\n\n==Repertoire==\n[[File:Paxman-horns.jpg|thumb|left|Paxman horns]]\n{{See also|List of compositions for horn}}\n\nDiscussion of the repertoire of horns must recognize the different needs of orchestras and concert bands in contrast to marching bands, as above, but also the use of horns in a wide variety of music, including chamber music and jazz.\n\n===Orchestra and concert band===\nThe horn is most often used as an orchestral and concert band instrument, with its singular tone being employed by composers to achieve specific effects. [[Leopold Mozart]], for example, used horns to signify the hunt, as in his ''[[Jagdsinfonie]]'' (hunting symphony). [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] wrote much for the horn, and it features prominently in the work of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''Brandenburg Concerto no. 1''. Once the technique of [[hand-stopping]] had been developed, allowing fully chromatic playing, composers began to write seriously for the horn. [[Gustav Mahler]] made great use of the horn's uniquely haunting and distant sound in his symphonies, notably the famous ''Nachtmusik'' (serenade) section of his [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 7]].\n\nMany composers have written works that have become favorites in the horn repertoire. These include [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] (''Elegie'') and [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] (''Morceau de Concert for horn and orchestra'', op. 94 and ''Romance'', op. 36). Others, particularly [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], whose friend [[Joseph Leutgeb]] was a noted horn player, wrote extensively for the instrument, including [[concerto|concerti]] and other solo works. Mozart's ''[[A Musical Joke]]'' satirizes the limitations of contemporary horn playing, including the risk of selecting the wrong crook by mistake.\n\nThe development of the valve horn was exploited by romantic composers such as [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], [[Mahler]], and [[Richard Strauss]], whose father was a well-known professional horn player. Strauss's ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' contains one of the best known horn solos from this period, relying on the chromatic facility of the valved horn. [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''Konzertst\u00fcck'' for four horns and orchestra is a notable three-movement work. Brahms had a lifelong love-affair with the instrument, with many prominently featured parts throughout his four symphonies. However players today typically play Brahms on modern valved instruments.\n\n===Chamber music===\nThere is an abundance of chamber music repertoire for horn. It is a standard member of the [[wind quintet]] and [[brass quintet]], and often appears in other configurations, such as Brahms' [[Horn Trio (Brahms)|Horn Trio]] for violin, horn and piano (for which, however, Brahms specified the natural horn). Also, the horn can be used by itself in a horn ensemble or \"horn choir\". The horn choir is especially practical because the extended range of the horn provides the composer or arranger with more possibilities, registerally, sonically, and contrapuntally.\n\n==Orchestral and concert band horns==\n[[File:DSC 8763 (7084102945).jpg|thumb|300px|A horn section in a military [[concert band]]]]\nA classical orchestra usually has at least two French horn players. Typically, the first horn played a high part and the second horn played a low part. Composers from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] (early 1800s) onwards commonly used four horns. Here, the first and second horns played as a pair (first horn being high, second horn being low), and the third and fourth horns played as another pair (third horn being high, fourth horn being low).\n\nMusic written for the modern horn follows a similar pattern with the first and third horns being high and the second and fourth horns being low. This configuration serves multiple purposes. It is easier to play high when the adjacent player is playing low and vice versa. Pairing makes it easier to write for horns, as the third and fourth horns can take over from the first and second horns or play contrasting material. For example, if the piece is in C minor, the first and second horns might be in C, the tonic major key, which could get most of the notes, and the third and fourth horns might be in E{{music|flat}}, the relative major key, to fill in the gaps.\n\nMany orchestral horn sections in the 2010s also have an assistant<ref>Ericson, John. [http://hornmatters.com/2010/03/horn-sections-with-and-without-an-associate-principal/ \"Horn Sections With and Without an Associate Principal\"] 28 March 2010. Retrieved 14 January 2012</ref> who doubles the first horn part for selected passages, joining in loud parts, playing instead of the principal if there is a first horn solo approaching, or alternating with the principal if the part is tiring to play.<ref>Bacon, Thomas. [http://www.hornplanet.com/hornpage/museum/articles/associate.html \"The Horn Section\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081850/http://www.hornplanet.com/hornpage/museum/articles/associate.html |date=March 4, 2016 }} Retrieved 14 January 2012</ref> Often the assistant is asked to play a passage after resting a long time. Also, he or she may be asked to enter in the middle of a passage, exactly matching the sound, articulation, and overall interpretation of the principal, thus enabling the principal horn to rest a bit.\n\n==In jazz==\n{{See also|Category:Jazz horn players|French horn in jazz}}\nThe French horn was at first rarely used in [[jazz]] music (Note that colloquially in jazz, the word \"horn\" refers to any wind instrument). Notable exponents, however, began including French horn in jazz pieces and ensembles. These include composer/arranger [[Gil Evans]] who included the French horn as an ensemble instrument from the 1940s, first in [[Claude Thornhill]]'s groups, and later with the pioneering [[cool jazz]] nonet (nine-piece group) led by trumpeter [[Miles Davis]], and in many other projects that sometimes also featured Davis, as well as [[Don Ellis]], a trumpet player from [[Stan Kenton]]'s jazz band. Notable works of Ellis' jazz French horn include \"Strawberry Soup\" and other songs on the album ''[[Tears of Joy (album)|Tears of Joy]]''. Notable improvising horn players in jazz include [[Julius Watkins]], [[Willie Ruff]], [[John Graas]], [[David Amram]], [[John Clark (musician)|John Clark]], [[Vincent Chancey]], Giovanni Hoffer, [[Arkady Shilkloper]], Adam Unsworth, and [[Tom Varner]].\n\n==Notable horn players==\n{{See also|List of horn players}}\n<!-- We do not need any more examples on this page.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division.

Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems.

The artist eschewed his traditional training and instead of creating smooth, well-thrown glazed vessels he started to work gesturally with raw clay, frequently marring his work with gashes and punctures.<ref name=\"Sorkin\"/>\n\nIn 1954, after founding the art ceramics department at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]], called the Los Angeles County Art Institute, his work rapidly became abstract and sculptural.<ref name=\"sfgate 2872173\"/> In 1959, he presented for the first time his heavy ceramics during the exhibition at the Landau Gallery in Los Angeles. This created a seismic reaction in the ceramics world, both for the grotesquerie of the sculptures' shapes and the genius marriage of arts and craft, and accelerated his transfer to UC Berkeley.<ref name=\"nyt-obit\"/>\n\nIt is all fake. the summary is i dont know im cant find stuff so.. could we add stuff\n\n==Work==\n[[Image:'Noodle', stoneware sculpture by Peter Voulkos, 1996, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Peter Voulkos, ''Noodle.'' [[stoneware]] [[sculpture]], 1996, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n===Description===\nWhile his early work was fired in electric and gas kilns, later in his career he primarily fired in the [[anagama]] kiln of Peter Callas, who had helped to introduce Japanese wood-firing aesthetics in the United States. Peter Voulkos is also among those who raised ceramics to the non-utilitarian, aesthetic sphere. While setting up the ceramics department at UC Berkeley, his students were authorized to make a teapot, \"only if it didn't work\". Voulkos started this new trend while in Los Angeles in the 1950s, saying, \"there was a certain energy around L.A. at the time\".<ref>[https://damonmoon.design/and-then-came-funk/ And then came Funk], ''Damonmoon.design'', 1 August 2009</ref> He is most commonly identified as an Abstract Expressionist ceramist.<ref name=\"nyt-obit\"/>\n\nVoulkos's sculptures are known for their visual weight, their freely-formed construction, and their aggressive and energetic decoration. During shaping, he would vigorously tear, pound, and gouge their surfaces. At some points in his career, he cast sculptures in bronze; and in early periods his ceramic works were glazed or painted and/or finished with painted brushstrokes.\n\nPeter Voulkos is also memorable for the live ceramics-sculpting sessions he would lead in front of his students, demonstrating live the hard work being his ceramics style, and his talent throughout this process.<ref name=\"sfgate 2872173\"/><ref name=\"nyt-obit\"/> His creativity quest sometimes led to the use of commercial dough-mixing machines to mix the clay, and the development of a prototype for an electric potter's wheel.<ref name=\"nyt-obit\"/>\n\nIn 1979 he was introduced to the use of wood firing in [[anagama kiln]]s by Peter Callas, who became his collaborator for the next 23 years. Most of Voulkos's late work was wood-fired in Callas's ''anagama'', which was located at first in [[Piermont, New York]], and later, in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]]. This unique partnership and the resulting work is considered by many curators and collectors to be the most exuberant period of Voulkos's career {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n===Sculptures===\n*''Hall of justice'', 1971, bronze<ref>[https://www.wescover.com/p/sculptures-by-peter-voulkos-at-hall-of-justice-san-francisco--PSkDrWbD6PXW Hall of Justice - 1971], ''Wescover.com''</ref>\n*''Mr. Ishi'', 1970, bronze, \n*''Untitled (Stack)'', 1980, stoneware, exhibited at the [[Oakland Museum of California]]<ref>\"[https://www.famsf.org/blog/framework-untitled-stack-peter-voulkos Untitled (Stack) by Peter Voulkos]\" (February 1, 2012).

[[stoneware]] [[sculpture]], 1996, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n===Description===\nWhile his early work was fired in electric and gas kilns, later in his career he primarily fired in the [[anagama]] kiln of Peter Callas, who had helped to introduce Japanese wood-firing aesthetics in the United States. Peter Voulkos is also among those who raised ceramics to the non-utilitarian, aesthetic sphere. While setting up the ceramics department at UC Berkeley, his students were authorized to make a teapot, \"only if it didn't work\". Voulkos started this new trend while in Los Angeles in the 1950s, saying, \"there was a certain energy around L.A. at the time\".<ref>[https://damonmoon.design/and-then-came-funk/ And then came Funk], ''Damonmoon.design'', 1 August 2009</ref> He is most commonly identified as an Abstract Expressionist ceramist.<ref name=\"nyt-obit\"/>\n\nVoulkos's sculptures are known for their visual weight, their freely-formed construction, and their aggressive and energetic decoration. During shaping, he would vigorously tear, pound, and gouge their surfaces. At some points in his career, he cast sculptures in bronze; and in early periods his ceramic works were glazed or painted and/or finished with painted brushstrokes.\n\nPeter Voulkos is also memorable for the live ceramics-sculpting sessions he would lead in front of his students, demonstrating live the hard work being his ceramics style, and his talent throughout this process.<ref name=\"sfgate 2872173\"/><ref name=\"nyt-obit\"/> His creativity quest sometimes led to the use of commercial dough-mixing machines to mix the clay, and the development of a prototype for an electric potter's wheel.<ref name=\"nyt-obit\"/>\n\nIn 1979 he was introduced to the use of wood firing in [[anagama kiln]]s by Peter Callas, who became his collaborator for the next 23 years. Most of Voulkos's late work was wood-fired in Callas's ''anagama'', which was located at first in [[Piermont, New York]], and later, in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]]. This unique partnership and the resulting work is considered by many curators and collectors to be the most exuberant period of Voulkos's career {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n===Sculptures===\n*''Hall of justice'', 1971, bronze<ref>[https://www.wescover.com/p/sculptures-by-peter-voulkos-at-hall-of-justice-san-francisco--PSkDrWbD6PXW Hall of Justice - 1971], ''Wescover.com''</ref>\n*''Mr. Ishi'', 1970, bronze, \n*''Untitled (Stack)'', 1980, stoneware, exhibited at the [[Oakland Museum of California]]<ref>\"[https://www.famsf.org/blog/framework-untitled-stack-peter-voulkos Untitled (Stack) by Peter Voulkos]\" (February 1, 2012).

At the same tournament he \"did the double\" by winning the pairs competition with his playing partner [[Tony Eccles]] and also was runner up in the inaugural EDO England Matchplay.<ref name=\"duzzadarts.com\"/>  After adding the 2012 Jersey Open, Durrant retained the England Classic in 2013.<ref name=\"duzzadarts.com\"/>\n\nDurrant made his debut at the World Championship in 2014 as a seeded player. He defeated qualifier [[Mike Day (darts player)|Mike Day]] 3-0 in the first round before losing 4-1 to Norris.\n\nDurrant reached the semi-finals of the Masters in 2014. He survived six match darts en route including four against [[Scott Mitchell (darts player)|Scott Mitchell]] in the quarter-finals (the other two were against [[Brian Dawson (darts player)|Brian Dawson]] in a previous round), before losing in a deciding leg against eventual champion [[Martin Phillips (darts player)|Martin Phillips]] having missed one match dart at the bullseye. Durrant then lost to Mitchell in the final of the Jersey Open, televised on Eurosport, having led 5-3 in a race to six and missed three match darts.\n\n===2015-2019===\nDurrant's reached the last four of the 2015 World Championship, maintaining a 90+ average in each of his first three wins over [[Karel Sedl\u00e1\u010dek]], [[Jamie Hughes (darts player)|Jamie Hughes]] and [[Darryl Fitton]]. In the semi-final, [[Martin Adams]] defeated Durrant 6-5, despite Durrant having led 5-4 and missing one match dart to win 6-4, and then leading the deciding set 2-0 in legs and missing two further match darts. The match was lauded as one of the best in the history of the tournament as Durrant averaged 99.57 to Adams` 97.92 and they hit 12 ton+ finishes between them. After the world championships Glen approached renowned sports mind coach Stephen McKibben from Northern Ireland, who was accredited with leading Scott Mitchell to world glory. He has worked with Stephen ever since and it has enabled him to win his majors and dominate the BDO world tour.\n\nDurrant had a fine 2015 on the BDO Circuit and has picked up the English Classic, English Matchplay, Welsh Open, Denmark Open and Isle of Man classic titles, and was finalist in the Scottish Open, Isle of Man Open, English Open and British Classic. He also helped his country to win the WDF World Cup team title.\n\nDurrant won his first major title with the [[2015 World Masters (darts)|2015 World Masters]] title, after showing superb form throughout the tournament. He defeated the former [[World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]] champion, [[Larry Butler (darts player)|Larry Butler]], 7-3 in the final. Glen mentioned about how much working with Stephen has changed him from a nearly man to a major winner.\n\nHis second major BDO title came in December when he won the 2015 [[Zuiderduin Masters]], beating [[Martin Adams]] 5-2 in sets in the final and averaging 100.69.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.findermasters.nl/?p=533 |title=Finder Darts Masters kampioenen, Glen Durrant, Fallon Sherrock en Justin van Tergouw &#124; Finder Darts Masters |website=Findermasters.nl |date=6 December 2015 |accessdate=15 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104021624/http://www.findermasters.nl/?p=533 |archive-date=4 January 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDurrant entered the 2016 World Championship as the favourite to win the tournament, and won his first two matches without dropping a set, defeating [[Dean Reynolds (darts player)|Dean Reynolds]] and [[Larry Butler (darts player)|Larry Butler]].

Glen had a pressure filled tournament, and contacted his mind coach Stephen McKibben after a near miss against [[Paul Hogan (darts player)|Paul Hogan]]. Durrant excelled in the rest of the tournament, dominating his remaining games.\n\nDurrant experienced his most successful season to date as he reached final of every major, successfully defending the [[2018 BDO World Darts Championship|BDO World Darts Championship]].

On 18 May 2019, Durrant clinched his second PDC title at Players Championship 15 after a series of impressive performances on the day, beating [[Darius Labanauskas]] 8-1 in the final, having already dismissed World number 1 [[Michael van Gerwen]] 7-2 in the semi final.

He is also a 2-time [[World Masters (darts)|World Masters]] and 3-time [[Finder Darts Masters]] champion.\n\n==Darts career==\n\n===Early career===\nAlthough he began playing in 1985, Durrant's first major appearance was in the 2004 [[Winmau World Masters]], where he lost out in the early stages to [[Dietmar Burger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=274|title=2004 World Masters Results|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>  He would have more success the following year however.   Two consecutive 3-0 wins put him in the last 32 and this was followed by a 3-1 win over Anthony Miera, to set up a last 16 match against [[Martin Adams]]. Durrant almost pulled off a famous victory but lost out 2-3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=131|title=2005 World Masters Results|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nDurrant has appeared in the PDC's [[UK Open (darts)|UK Open]] on three occasions.  In [[2005 UK Open|2005]] he won his opening match against Darren Moulsley before losing a deciding leg against [[Ray Cornibert]] in the last 64.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=45|title=2005 UK Open Results|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>  In [[2009 UK Open|2009]] Durrant defeated Graham Usher and John McGuirk before losing out to [[Terry Jenkins]] 1-9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=1957|title=2009 UK Open Results|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> Durrant also qualified for the PDC's UK Open in [[2012 UK Open|2012]] by winning the Riley's qualifier in Middlesbrough.   He drew a fellow Riley's qualifier in Stephen Bunting and lost 0-4 in the preliminary round.\n\n===2011-2014===\nIn 2011 he made his third appearance in the Winmau World Masters.  Four consecutive wins and dropping only 3 legs put him into the televised stages of the tournament, where he defeated Craig Baxter 3-2 in sets in the last 24.  In the last 16 he faced 2000 world champion [[John Walton (darts player)|John Walton]].  A 3-1 win in sets saw an emotional Durrant set up a rematch against Martin Adams, where Adams won 3-1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=3305|title=2011 World Masters Results|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nDurrant came within one match of qualifying for the World Championship in 2012, but was beaten in the final round by [[Alan Norris (darts player)|Alan Norris]] who went on to reach the quarter-finals.\n\nDurrant is a dominant force locally in his own Teesside area and has won the Teesside darts championship 3 times in the last 4 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/teesdarts/ |title=Home - Teesside Darts |website=Freewebs.com |date= |accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nHe threw his first competitive 9 dart finish in the England Darts Organisations Grosvenor Casino Tyneside Classic.

At the same tournament he \"did the double\" by winning the pairs competition with his playing partner [[Tony Eccles]] and also was runner up in the inaugural EDO England Matchplay.<ref name=\"duzzadarts.com\"/>  After adding the 2012 Jersey Open, Durrant retained the England Classic in 2013.<ref name=\"duzzadarts.com\"/>\n\nDurrant made his debut at the World Championship in 2014 as a seeded player. He defeated qualifier [[Mike Day (darts player)|Mike Day]] 3-0 in the first round before losing 4-1 to Norris.\n\nDurrant reached the semi-finals of the Masters in 2014. He survived six match darts en route including four against [[Scott Mitchell (darts player)|Scott Mitchell]] in the quarter-finals (the other two were against [[Brian Dawson (darts player)|Brian Dawson]] in a previous round), before losing in a deciding leg against eventual champion [[Martin Phillips (darts player)|Martin Phillips]] having missed one match dart at the bullseye.

In the semi-final, [[Martin Adams]] defeated Durrant 6-5, despite Durrant having led 5-4 and missing one match dart to win 6-4, and then leading the deciding set 2-0 in legs and missing two further match darts. The match was lauded as one of the best in the history of the tournament as Durrant averaged 99.57 to Adams` 97.92 and they hit 12 ton+ finishes between them. After the world championships Glen approached renowned sports mind coach Stephen McKibben from Northern Ireland, who was accredited with leading Scott Mitchell to world glory. He has worked with Stephen ever since and it has enabled him to win his majors and dominate the BDO world tour.\n\nDurrant had a fine 2015 on the BDO Circuit and has picked up the English Classic, English Matchplay, Welsh Open, Denmark Open and Isle of Man classic titles, and was finalist in the Scottish Open, Isle of Man Open, English Open and British Classic. He also helped his country to win the WDF World Cup team title.\n\nDurrant won his first major title with the [[2015 World Masters (darts)|2015 World Masters]] title, after showing superb form throughout the tournament. He defeated the former [[World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]] champion, [[Larry Butler (darts player)|Larry Butler]], 7-3 in the final. Glen mentioned about how much working with Stephen has changed him from a nearly man to a major winner.\n\nHis second major BDO title came in December when he won the 2015 [[Zuiderduin Masters]], beating [[Martin Adams]] 5-2 in sets in the final and averaging 100.69.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.findermasters.nl/?p=533 |title=Finder Darts Masters kampioenen, Glen Durrant, Fallon Sherrock en Justin van Tergouw &#124; Finder Darts Masters |website=Findermasters.nl |date=6 December 2015 |accessdate=15 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104021624/http://www.findermasters.nl/?p=533 |archive-date=4 January 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDurrant entered the 2016 World Championship as the favourite to win the tournament, and won his first two matches without dropping a set, defeating [[Dean Reynolds (darts player)|Dean Reynolds]] and [[Larry Butler (darts player)|Larry Butler]]. In the quarter final, the 2013 world champion and eventual winner, [[Scott Waites]], defeated Durrant 5-4, despite Durrant leading 3-1 and 4-2 in sets and being 2-0 up in legs during the seventh set.\n\nDurrant entered the [[2017 BDO World Darts Championship]] as the number 1 seed and won the tournament for the first time, beating [[Danny Noppert]] in the final 7-3. Glen had a pressure filled tournament, and contacted his mind coach Stephen McKibben after a near miss against [[Paul Hogan (darts player)|Paul Hogan]]. Durrant excelled in the rest of the tournament, dominating his remaining games.\n\nDurrant experienced his most successful season to date as he reached final of every major, successfully defending the [[2018 BDO World Darts Championship|BDO World Darts Championship]]. Through the year he won the [[2018 BDO World Trophy|BDO World Trophy]] for the first time, lost in the final of the [[2018 World Masters (darts)|Winmau World Masters]] and won the [[Finder Darts Masters]].\n\nDespite being the reigning Lakeside champion.

He is the only player since [[Eric Bristow]] to win the championship 3 years in a row.\n\n==PDC==\n\n===2019-present===\n\nDurrant announced on 15 November 2018 his intentions to enter the PDC Q-School in January regardless of his performance in the [[2019 BDO World Darts Championship|BDO World Championship]] due to there being no penalties from the BDO, unlike previous years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/11/glen-durrant-one-eye-pdc-q-school-ahead-lakeside-plenty-bdo-stars-8234234/ |title=Glen Durrant has one eye on PDC Q School ahead of Lakeside, and so do plenty more BDO stars |website=Metro |date=11 December 2018}}</ref> He lost in the last 128 round at the first two days of Q School to Darren Herewini and Vince Tipple, collecting two points on the Q School Order or Merit. Durrant did better on the third day, but lost at the final hurdle to [[Reece Robinson (darts player)|Reece Robinson]].\n\nOn Sunday 21 January, Durrant survived match darts from [[Matthew Dennant]] before going on to reach the last 32 and seal his two-year PDC Tour Card via the UK Q-School Order of Merit.\n\nFollowing [[Gary Anderson (darts player)|Gary Anderson]]'s withdrawal from the [[2019 Premier League Darts|2019 Premier League]], Durrant was selected as one of nine 'contenders' to replace him. He would play a one-off match against [[Daryl Gurney]] on night two in [[Glasgow]] which he lost 7-3.\n\nAt the second PDC Players Championship event in 2019, Durrant made his first PDC final after he beat [[Joe Cullen (darts player)|Joe Cullen]] 7\u20134 in the Semi-Final. He hit a 170 checkout to stay in the match against [[Dave Chisnall]], but eventually lost the final 8\u20137. The following week, Durrant would claim his first PDC title in just his fourth Pro Tour event, dispatching [[Dimitri Van den Bergh]] 8-3 in the final.

Burmese pythons have been found to select broad-leafed and low-flooded habitats. Broad-leafed habitats comprise cypress, overstory, and coniferous forest. Though aquatic marsh environments would be a great source for prey, the pythons seem to prioritize morphological and behavioral camouflage to be protected from predators. Also, the Burmese pythons in Florida have been found to prefer elevated habitats, since this provides the optimal conditions for nesting. In addition to elevated habitats, edge habitats are common places where  Burmese pythons are found for thermoregulation, nesting, and hunting purposes.<ref name=\":1\">Walters, T. M., Mazzotti, F.

While the behavior has similar benefits, specifically to endure the winter without moving, it also involves preparation of both male and female reproductive organs for the upcoming breeding season.

They remain with the eggs until they hatch, wrapping around them and twitching their muscles in such a way as to raise the ambient temperature around the eggs by several degrees. Once the hatchlings use their [[egg tooth]] to cut their way out of their eggs, no further maternal care is given. The newly hatched babies often remain inside their eggs until they are ready to complete their first shedding of skin, after which they hunt for their first meal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Anwiksha|title=Burmese Python|url=http://www.animalspot.net/burmese-python.html|publisher=AnimalSpot.net|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Diet==\nLike all snakes, the Burmese python is [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]. Its diet consists primarily of appropriately sized birds and mammals. The snake uses its sharp, rearward-pointing teeth to seize its prey, then wraps its body around the prey, at the same time contracting its muscles, killing the prey by [[constriction]]. It is often found near human habitation due to the presence of rats, mice, and other [[vermin]] as a food source. However, its equal affinity for domesticated birds and mammals means it is often treated as a pest. In captivity, its diet consists primarily of commercially available appropriately sized rats, graduating to larger prey such as rabbits and [[poultry]] as it grows. Exceptionally large pythons may even require larger food items such as pigs or goats, and are known to have attacked and eaten [[alligator]]s and adult [[deer]] in Florida, where they are an invasive species.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/10/photo-in-the-news-python-bursts-after-eating-gator-update/|title=Photo in the News: Python Bursts After Eating Gator (Update)|author=|date=5 September 2006|website=National Geographic News|access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksee24.com/news/local/Large-Python-Captured-Killed-After-Devouring-Adult-Deer-132922183.html |title=Large Python Captured, Killed After Devouring Adult Deer &#124; KSEE 24 News - Central Valley's News Station: Fresno-Visalia - News, Sports, Weather &#124; Local News |publisher=Ksee24.com |date=2011-10-31 |access-date=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731060837/http://www.ksee24.com/news/local/Large-Python-Captured-Killed-After-Devouring-Adult-Deer-132922183.html |archivedate=2012-07-31 }}</ref>\n\n===Digestion===\nThe digestive response of Burmese pythons to such large prey has made them a model species for digestive physiology.

Also, \"labyrinth\" specimens with maze-like patterns, khaki-colored \"green\", and \"granite\" with many small angular spots are available. Breeders have recently begun working with an island lineage of Burmese pythons. Early reports indicate that these  [[dwarf Burmese python]]s have slightly different coloring and pattern from their mainland relatives and do not grow much over {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length. One of the most sought-after of these variations is the [[leucistic]] Burmese. This particular variety is very rare, being entirely bright white with no pattern and blue eyes, and has only recently (2008/2009) been reproduced in captivity as the [[homozygous]] form (referred to as \"super\" by reptile keepers) of the co-dominant [[hypomelanistic]] trait. The caramel Burmese python has a caramel-colored pattern with \"milk-chocolate\" eyes.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Inclusion body disease]], a viral disease affecting pythons\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book | author=Mattison, Chris | title=Snake| publisher=DK Publishing| year=1999 | isbn=978-0-7894-4660-2}}\n* [http://www.anapsid.org/burm.html Anapsid.org: Burmese Python]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bryan Christy: ''The Lizard King: The True Crimes and Passions of the World's Greatest Reptile Smugglers''.

Burmese pythons have been found to select broad-leafed and low-flooded habitats. Broad-leafed habitats comprise cypress, overstory, and coniferous forest. Though aquatic marsh environments would be a great source for prey, the pythons seem to prioritize morphological and behavioral camouflage to be protected from predators. Also, the Burmese pythons in Florida have been found to prefer elevated habitats, since this provides the optimal conditions for nesting. In addition to elevated habitats, edge habitats are common places where  Burmese pythons are found for thermoregulation, nesting, and hunting purposes.<ref name=\":1\">Walters, T. M., Mazzotti, F.

While the behavior has similar benefits, specifically to endure the winter without moving, it also involves preparation of both male and female reproductive organs for the upcoming breeding season.

They remain with the eggs until they hatch, wrapping around them and twitching their muscles in such a way as to raise the ambient temperature around the eggs by several degrees. Once the hatchlings use their [[egg tooth]] to cut their way out of their eggs, no further maternal care is given. The newly hatched babies often remain inside their eggs until they are ready to complete their first shedding of skin, after which they hunt for their first meal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Anwiksha|title=Burmese Python|url=http://www.animalspot.net/burmese-python.html|publisher=AnimalSpot.net|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Diet==\nLike all snakes, the Burmese python is [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]. Its diet consists primarily of appropriately sized birds and mammals. The snake uses its sharp, rearward-pointing teeth to seize its prey, then wraps its body around the prey, at the same time contracting its muscles, killing the prey by [[constriction]]. It is often found near human habitation due to the presence of rats, mice, and other [[vermin]] as a food source. However, its equal affinity for domesticated birds and mammals means it is often treated as a pest. In captivity, its diet consists primarily of commercially available appropriately sized rats, graduating to larger prey such as rabbits and [[poultry]] as it grows. Exceptionally large pythons may even require larger food items such as pigs or goats, and are known to have attacked and eaten [[alligator]]s and adult [[deer]] in Florida, where they are an invasive species.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/10/photo-in-the-news-python-bursts-after-eating-gator-update/|title=Photo in the News: Python Bursts After Eating Gator (Update)|author=|date=5 September 2006|website=National Geographic News|access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksee24.com/news/local/Large-Python-Captured-Killed-After-Devouring-Adult-Deer-132922183.html |title=Large Python Captured, Killed After Devouring Adult Deer &#124; KSEE 24 News - Central Valley's News Station: Fresno-Visalia - News, Sports, Weather &#124; Local News |publisher=Ksee24.com |date=2011-10-31 |access-date=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731060837/http://www.ksee24.com/news/local/Large-Python-Captured-Killed-After-Devouring-Adult-Deer-132922183.html |archivedate=2012-07-31 }}</ref>\n\n===Digestion===\nThe digestive response of Burmese pythons to such large prey has made them a model species for digestive physiology.

Important reasons for the decline are trade for skins and for food; habitat degradation may be a problem in some upland areas.<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nIn Hong Kong, it is a [[List of protected species in Hong Kong|protected species]] under Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap 170.\n\n==Captivity==\nBurmese pythons are often sold as pets, and are made popular by their attractive coloration and apparently easy-going nature. However, these animals have a rapid growth rate, and often exceed {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length in a year if cared for and fed properly. By age four, they will have reached their adult size, though they continue growing very slowly throughout their lives, which may exceed 20 years.\n\n[[File:Burmese python in Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|A coiled Burmese python at the [[Berlin Zoo]]]]\nAlthough this species has a reputation for docility, they are very powerful animals \u2013 capable of inflicting severe bites, even killing adult, professional, or multiple keepers by constriction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2622427/Python-kills-careless-student-zookeeper-in-Caracas.html|title=Python Kills Careless Student Zookeeper in Caracas|last=|first=|date=2008-08-26|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-02-18|agency=AP|location=London|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiszar|first=David|last2=Smith|first2=Hobart M.|last3=Petkus|first3=Albert|last4=Dougherty|first4=Joseph|date=1993|title=A Fatal Attack on a Teenage Boy by a Captive Burmese Python (''Python molurus bivittatus'') in Colorado|url=http://www.chicagoherp.org/bulletin/28(12).pdf|journal=The Bulletin of the Chicago Herpetological Society|type=|publisher=Chicago Herpetological Society|volume=28|issue=#12|page=261|issn=0009-3564|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anapsid.org/coloburm.html|title=The Keeping of Large Pythons: Realities and Responsibilities|last=Kaplan|first=Melissa|date=1994|website=www.anapsid.org|series=Herp Care Collection|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/python-caused-death-in-ontario-home-in-1992-case-1.1328205|title=Python Caused Death in Ontario Home in 1992 Case|last=|first=|date=2013-04-13|work=CBC News|access-date=2019-02-17|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Commission|agency=Canadian Press|department=Toronto News|location=Toronto|type=|format=|issn=0708-9392|quote=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/python-linked-deaths-raise-questions-over-exotic-animal-laws-1.1349119|title=Python-linked Deaths Raise Questions over Exotic Animal Laws|last=Davison|first=Janet|date=2013-08-07|work=CBC News|access-date=2019-02-17|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|agency=|department=News|location=Toronto|type=|format=|issn=0708-9392}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/748680/pages/nevilles-p1-normal.gif|title=Dr. D.

Violators could be imprisoned for more than seven years or fined $500,000 if convicted.\n\nBurmese pythons are opportunistic feeders; they eat almost any time food is offered, and often act hungry even when they have recently eaten. As a result, they are often overfed, causing [[obesity]]-related problems to be common in captive Burmese pythons.\n\nLike the much smaller [[ball python]], Burmese pythons are known to be easygoing or timid creatures, which means that if cared for properly, they can easily adjust to living near humans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gbif.org/species/144100053|title=Python bivittatus (Kuhl, 1820)|author=|date=|website=www.gbif.org|access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Handling===\n[[Image:Reptilia audience members handling burmese python dsc 0083.jpg|thumb|l|Audience volunteers holding an adult Burmese python]]\nAlthough pythons are typically afraid of people due to their high stature, and generally avoid humans, special care is still required when handling them. Given their adult strength, multiple handlers (up to one person per meter of snake) are usually recommended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anapsid.org/handling.html|title=Playing with the Big Boys: Handling Large Constrictors|website=www.anapsid.org|access-date=8 September 2017}}</ref> Some jurisdictions require owners to hold special licenses, and as with any wild animal being kept in captivity, treating them with the respect an animal of this size commands is important.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aldf.org/focus_area/captive-animals/|title=Captive Animals - Most states have no laws governing captive wild animals.|author=|date=|website=Animal Legal Defense Fund|access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Variations===\n[[Image:Caramel burmese python.JPG|left|thumb|Caramel Burmese python]]\nThe Burmese python is frequently captive-bred for color, pattern, and more recently, size. Its [[albino]] form is especially popular and is the most widely available morph. They are white with patterns in butterscotch yellow and burnt orange. Also, \"labyrinth\" specimens with maze-like patterns, khaki-colored \"green\", and \"granite\" with many small angular spots are available. Breeders have recently begun working with an island lineage of Burmese pythons. Early reports indicate that these  [[dwarf Burmese python]]s have slightly different coloring and pattern from their mainland relatives and do not grow much over {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length. One of the most sought-after of these variations is the [[leucistic]] Burmese. This particular variety is very rare, being entirely bright white with no pattern and blue eyes, and has only recently (2008/2009) been reproduced in captivity as the [[homozygous]] form (referred to as \"super\" by reptile keepers) of the co-dominant [[hypomelanistic]] trait. The caramel Burmese python has a caramel-colored pattern with \"milk-chocolate\" eyes.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Inclusion body disease]], a viral disease affecting pythons\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book | author=Mattison, Chris | title=Snake| publisher=DK Publishing| year=1999 | isbn=978-0-7894-4660-2}}\n* [http://www.anapsid.org/burm.html Anapsid.org: Burmese Python]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bryan Christy: ''The Lizard King: The True Crimes and Passions of the World's Greatest Reptile Smugglers''.
