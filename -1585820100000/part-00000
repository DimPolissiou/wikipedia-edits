One \"seed of the future\" exists already in Britain, for example, where a company called F. International Ltd. (the \"F\" stands for Freelance) employs 400 part-time computer programmers, all but a handful of whom work in their own homes.

One \"seed of the future\" exists already in Britain, for example, where a company called F. International Ltd. (the \"F\" stands for Freelance) employs 400 part-time computer programmers, all but a handful of whom work in their own homes.

The first scientifically documented stegosaur remains were recovered from [[Early Cretaceous]] [[Stratum (geology)|strata]] in [[England]] during the mid-[[:Category:19th century in paleontology|19th century]].<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-intro-343\" /> However, they would not be recognized as a distinct group of dinosaurs until [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] described the new [[genus]] and species ''[[Stegosaurus armatus]]'' in [[1877 in paleontology|1877]], which he regarded as the founding member of the Stegosauria.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-344-345\" /> This new taxon originally included all [[Thyreophora|armored dinosaurs]]. It was not until [[1927 in paleontology|1927]] that [[Alfred Sherwood Romer]] implemented the modern use of the name Stegosauria as specifically pertaining to the plate-backed and spike-tailed dinosaurs.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-intro-343\" />\n\nFrom the time of their earliest description, the chief mystery surrounding stegosaurs was the function of their distinctive back plates. Marsh originally interpreted them as being plates of armor that would protect against predators. In [[1910 in paleontology|1910]], [[Richard Swann Lull]] would agree with this hypothesis. [[Charles Whitney Gilmore]] disagreed in [[1914 in paleontology|1914]] and argued that the only protection a stegosaur could gain from its plates was to appear intimidatingly larger to potential predators. Nearly forty years later, [[Davitashvili]] argued that the plates were too fragile to be used for defense and instead used to attract mates and signal the stegosaur's rank in a social hierarchy.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-paleoecobehav-361\" />\n\nIn the late [[:Category:1970s in paleontology|1970s]], [[James O.

Instead they argued that these were display structures that helped stegosaurs recognize and acquire mates of their own species. The researchers also examined the histology of stegosaur plates. They found that during development the plates and spikes grew mainly from their bases and the structure of their interiors changed significantly as the animal matured. They hypothesized that stegosaur plates evolved by greatly expanding the raised keel of bone that ran the length of the nodules of bone embedded in the skin of armored dinosaurs. They concluded that processes of growth are the main reason why stegosaur plates showed so many signs of the presence of blood vessels instead of using the blood vessels to absorb or shed heat. They also noticed that structures in other dinosaur groups and even modern mammals like [[artiodactyls]] unrelated to heat regulation like horns and frills often show similar amount of vasculature to stegosaur plates.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-paleoecobehav-362\" />\n\n'''[[2001 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">2001</span>]]'''{{anchor|2001}}\n* [[Paul Michael Barrett]] found further anatomical support for the hypothesis that stegosaur jaws were only capable of opening and closing in a straight up-an-down fashion that precluded the complex chewing motions seen in some other herbivorous dinosaur groups.

The first scientifically documented stegosaur remains were recovered from [[Early Cretaceous]] [[Stratum (geology)|strata]] in [[England]] during the mid-[[:Category:19th century in paleontology|19th century]].<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-intro-343\" /> However, they would not be recognized as a distinct group of dinosaurs until [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] described the new [[genus]] and species ''[[Stegosaurus armatus]]'' in [[1877 in paleontology|1877]], which he regarded as the founding member of the Stegosauria.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-344-345\" /> This new taxon originally included all [[Thyreophora|armored dinosaurs]]. It was not until [[1927 in paleontology|1927]] that [[Alfred Sherwood Romer]] implemented the modern use of the name Stegosauria as specifically pertaining to the plate-backed and spike-tailed dinosaurs.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-intro-343\" />\n\nFrom the time of their earliest description, the chief mystery surrounding stegosaurs was the function of their distinctive back plates. Marsh originally interpreted them as being plates of armor that would protect against predators. In [[1910 in paleontology|1910]], [[Richard Swann Lull]] would agree with this hypothesis. [[Charles Whitney Gilmore]] disagreed in [[1914 in paleontology|1914]] and argued that the only protection a stegosaur could gain from its plates was to appear intimidatingly larger to potential predators. Nearly forty years later, [[Davitashvili]] argued that the plates were too fragile to be used for defense and instead used to attract mates and signal the stegosaur's rank in a social hierarchy.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-paleoecobehav-361\" />\n\nIn the late [[:Category:1970s in paleontology|1970s]], [[James O. Farlow]] and others would propose that the thin, [[blood vessel]]-rich plates helped absorb or lose body heat, depending on the animal's own [[Dinosaur physiology|physiological]] requirements.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-paleoecobehav-362\" /> This hypothesis was put forth in a broader context of scientists considering the possibility that dinosaurs may have maintained body temperatures and activity levels similar to those of modern [[birds]] and [[mammals]],<ref name=\"chinsamy-hillenius-intro-643\" /> in which case the plates may have served primarily to shed heat rather than gain it. In the late [[:Category: 1980s in paleontology|1980s]] [[Buffrenil]] and others revived the idea that stegosaur plates were display structures, an interpretation that would continue to find favor from researchers like Main and colleagues into the [[:Category: 21st century in paleontology|21st century]].<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-paleoecobehav-362\" />\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:Regnosaurus.jpg|thumb|right|upright|150px|''[[Regnosaurus]]'' jaw fragments.]]\n[[File:Hul - Dacentrurus armatus.jpg|thumb|right|upright|150px|Type specimen of ''[[Omosaurus armatus]]''.]]\n\n===1840s===\n'''[[1841 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1841</span>]]'''{{anchor|1841}}\n* [[Gideon Mantell]] described the new [[genus]] and [[species]] ''[[Regnosaurus northamptoni]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-345\" />\n\n===1870s===\n[[File:Stego-marsh-1896-US geological survey.png|thumb|right|upright|225px|Othniel Charles Marsh's reconstruction of ''[[Stegosaurus]]''.]]\n'''[[1874 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1874</span>]]'''{{anchor|1874}}\n* [[Harry Govier Seeley]] described the new genus and species ''[[Craterosaurus pottonensis]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-344\" />\n\n'''[[1875 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1875</span>]]'''{{anchor|1875}}\n* [[Sir Richard Owen]] described the new genus and species ''[[Omosaurus armatus]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-344\" />\n\n'''[[1876 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1876</span>]]'''{{anchor|1876}}\n* Owen described the new species ''[[Anthodon serrarius]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-345\" />\n\n'''[[1877 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1877</span>]]'''{{anchor|1877}}\n* [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] described the new genus and species ''[[Stegosaurus armatus]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-345\" />\n* Marsh named the [[Stegosauria]].<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-344\" />\n* Owen described the new species ''[[Omosaurus hastiger]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-344\" />\n\n'''[[1878 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1878</span>]]'''{{anchor|1878}}\n* [[Edward Drinker Cope]] described the new genus and species ''[[Hypsirhophus discurus]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-345\" />\n\n'''[[1878 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1879</span>]]'''{{anchor|1879}}\n* Cope described the new species ''[[Hypsirhophus seeleyanus]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-345\" />\n\n===1880s===\n[[File:Dacentrurus holotype.jpg|thumb|right|upright|150px|Holotype of ''[[Omosaurus]]'' (now ''[[Dacentrurus]]'') ''[[Dacentrurus|armatus]]'', from [[Sir Richard Owen]]'s 1875 monograph.]]\n[[File:Stenops.jpg|thumb|right|upright|250px|Holotype of ''[[Stegosaurus stenops]]''.]]\n'''[[1880 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1880</span>]]'''{{anchor|1880}}\n* Marsh named the [[Stegosauridae]].<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-344\" />\n* Marsh interpreted the plates of Stegosaurus as an armored covering and its spines as natural weapons.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-paleoecobehav-361\" />\n* Marsh described the new species ''[[Stegosaurus affinis]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-345\" />\n\n'''[[1881 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1881</span>]]'''{{anchor|1881}}\n* Marsh described the new genus and species ''[[Diracodon laticeps]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-345\" />\n\n'''[[1884 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1884</span>]]'''{{anchor|1884}}\n* [[Hulke]] reported a Cretaceous stegosaur pubis from England.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-intro-343\" />\n\n'''[[1887 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1887</span>]]'''{{anchor|1887}}\n* Hulke described the new species ''[[Omosaurus durobrivensis]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-344\" />\n* Marsh described the new species ''[[Stegosaurus sulcatus]]''.<ref name=\"galton-upchurch-table-345\" />\n* Marsh described the new species ''[[Stegosaurus duplex]]''.

Mihail Gerdzhikov was one of the founders of the [[Federation of Anarcho-Communists in Bulgaria]] (FACB) on June 1919 in Sofia. When the Ninth Revolution was carried out in 1923, he left Bulgaria and lived in emigration - [[Constantinople]], [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]] (1924 - 1931). He supported the idea of a split with IMRO, and in 1928 - 1929 together with [[Georgi Zankov]] and a group of adherents, they seceded as a national revolutionary wing and formed [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]]. Gerdzhikov met in Berlin several times with [[Georgi Dimitrov]]. At that time he maintained close links with the Vienna Center of the Comintern and with the BCP's overseas office.\n\nHe participated in the ''Constantinople Conference of the IMRO'' in 1930 and was a member of the Central Committee as a member of the Foreign Office. <Ref name = \"Gerdjikov 14\"> Pandev, Konstantin.

On the eve and during the Second World War, 1939-1945, due to his advanced age, he was mainly engaged in journalism. He has collaborated on a number of periodicals. Although some of his associates were involved in the resistance movement, Gerdzhikov remained aloof, although he maintained ties with them. Following the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|September 9 coup]], he signed in Sofia \"[[Appeal to Macedonians in Bulgaria]]\". <ref> [http://mk.wikibooks.org/wiki/Apel_to_Macedonians_to_Bugaritsa_-_1944 Apel to Macedonians in Bulgaria - 1944, mk.wikibooks.org] </ref> After September 9, 1944, he addressed his comrades from the Macedonian-Adrian movement in the Zarya newspaper with a call to support the struggle and to call for the celebration of the new socialist system. However, he soon retired from active public activity, frustrated by the new rulers of the [[Peoples Republic of Bulgaria]]. In 1946, he categorically refused to be included in the list of nominees for the award of the [[Preobrazhenie Uprising]].

Mihail Gerdzhikov was one of the founders of the [[Federation of Anarcho-Communists in Bulgaria]] (FACB) on June 1919 in Sofia. When the Ninth Revolution was carried out in 1923, he left Bulgaria and lived in emigration - [[Constantinople]], [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]] (1924 - 1931). He supported the idea of a split with IMRO, and in 1928 - 1929 together with [[Georgi Zankov]] and a group of adherents, they seceded as a national revolutionary wing and formed [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]]. Gerdzhikov met in Berlin several times with [[Georgi Dimitrov]]. At that time he maintained close links with the Vienna Center of the Comintern and with the BCP's overseas office.\n\nHe participated in the ''Constantinople Conference of the IMRO'' in 1930 and was a member of the Central Committee as a member of the Foreign Office. <Ref name = \"Gerdjikov 14\"> Pandev, Konstantin.

On the eve and during the Second World War, 1939-1945, due to his advanced age, he was mainly engaged in journalism. He has collaborated on a number of periodicals. Although some of his associates were involved in the resistance movement, Gerdzhikov remained aloof, although he maintained ties with them. Following the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|September 9 coup]], he signed in Sofia \"[[Appeal to Macedonians in Bulgaria]]\". <ref> [http://mk.wikibooks.org/wiki/Apel_to_Macedonians_to_Bugaritsa_-_1944 Apel to Macedonians in Bulgaria - 1944, mk.wikibooks.org] </ref> After September 9, 1944, he addressed his comrades from the Macedonian-Adrian movement in the Zarya newspaper with a call to support the struggle and to call for the celebration of the new socialist system. However, he soon retired from active public activity, frustrated by the new rulers of the [[Peoples Republic of Bulgaria]]. In 1946, he categorically refused to be included in the list of nominees for the award of the [[Preobrazhenie Uprising]]. He died on March 18, 1947 in Sofia\n\n\n==Sources==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gerdzhikov, Mihail}}\n[[Category:1877 births]]\n[[Category:1947 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Plovdiv]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian revolutionaries]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian educators]]\n[[Category:Members of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]\n[[Category:Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United) members]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian anarchists]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian military personnel of the Balkan Wars]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian military personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Thracian Bulgarians]]\n[[Category:Burials at Central Sofia Cemetery]]\n", "name_user": "Jingiby", "label": "safe", "comment": "Internal link.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihail_Gerdzhikov"}
