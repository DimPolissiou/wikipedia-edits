A black man was convicted and sentenced to prison on charges of trespassing on a long abandoned plantation. One member of Bogle\u2019s group protested in court over the case, but was immediately arrested, angering the crowd further. He was rescued moments later when Bogle and his men took to the market square and retaliated. The police were severely beaten and forced to retreat.<ref>Heuman, ''The Killing Time'', pp. 80-2.</ref>\n\nOn Monday, October 9, 1865, warrants were issued against Bogle and a number of others for riot and assault. The police arrived in Stony Gut to arrest Bogle but met with stiff resistance from the residents. They fought the police, forcing them to retreat to Morant Bay.\n\nA few days later on October 11, 1865, there was a vestry meeting in the Court House. That day Bogle led hundreds of followers, armed with sticks and machetes, on a protest march to the court house. The authorities had mustered a volunteer militia, who fired into the protesters after stones were thrown, killing seven men. The protesters set fire to the Court House and nearby buildings. When officials tried to leave, several were killed by the angry mob outside; a total of 25 on both sides died that day.<ref name=\"hutton\"/>\n\nBlack peasants rose up and took control of the parish for two days. The governor quickly retaliated, declaring [[martial law]] and ordering troops to capture the rebels and suppress the rebellion. The troops destroyed Stony Gut and Bogle's chapel, killing more than 400 persons outright across the parish, including women and children. They arrested more than 300 persons, including Bogle. The [[Jamaican Maroons]] from [[Moore Town]] captured Bogle on behalf of the British military, and delivered him to the colonial authorities.<ref>Gad Heuman, ''The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994).</ref> He was tried under martial law and quickly executed, as were many others.<ref name=\"History of War\" /><ref name=Gleaner /> Others, including women, and brought back to Morant Bay to be tried under martial law.<ref name=\"hutton\"/> Gordon was convicted of conspiracy and hanged on 23 October.<ref name=\"hutton\"/>\n\nBack in Britain there was public outcry, and increased opposition from liberals against Eyre's handling of the situation, with accusations against him of murder. Supporters praised the governor for acting quickly in the crisis to suppress a potentially larger rebellion.<ref>Heuman, ''The Killing Time'', pp. 164-182.</ref>.Bogle was later hanged on October 24,1865\n\n==Aftermath==\nBy the end of 1865 the \"Governor Eyre Case\" had become the subject of widespread national debate. In January 1866, a Royal Commission was sent to investigate the events. Governor Eyre was suspended and recalled to England and eventually dismissed. The national government changed that of Jamaica. The House of Assembly resigned its charter, and Jamaica was made a [[Crown Colony]], governed directly from England.<ref>Heuman, ''The Killing Time'', pp. 164-182.</ref>\n\nThe \"Eyre Controversy\" turned into a long and increasingly public issue, dividing well-known figures of the day. It may have contributed to the fall of the government.

Most notably, [[dancehall]] performer [[Bogle (dancer)|Gerald Levy]]'s [[stage name]] was \"Bogle\" (also \"Mr Bogle\" and \"Father Bogle\").\n\n[[Third World (band)|Third World]] produced a song about Bogle's execution.<ref>Heuman, The Killing Time, p. 186.</ref> Other [[reggae]] artists who have named and written songs in tribute to Paul Bogle include [[Lee Scratch Perry]] and a co-production between [[The Aggrovators]], and [[the Revolutionaries]].\n\nBogle is mentioned in songs by [[Burning Spear]], [[Brigadier Jerry]], [[The Cimarons]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Prince Far I]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Third World]] and [[General Trees]].\n\nIn \"So Much Things to Say\", by Bob Marley & The Wailers (and subsequently covered by [[Lauryn Hill]]), Marley mentions Bogle in the same breath as Jesus Christ and [[Marcus Garvey]], concluding, \"I'll never forget no way they turned their backs on Paul Bogle, so don't you forget no youth who you are and where you stand in the struggle.\"\n\nPaul Bogle is mentioned in the songs \"See them a come\" and \"Innocent blood\" by the [[reggae]] band [[Culture (band)|Culture]]. [[Tarrus Riley]] also mentions Paul Bogle in the song \"Shaka Zulu Pickney\", alluding his ancestry as a freedom fighter.\n\nPaul Bogle and the events outlined above are the theme of \"Ballard of 65\" by General Trees.\n\nThe British rapper [[Akala (rapper)|Akala]] references Bogle on the track \"Maangamizi\" from his album ''The Thieves Banquet'', saying: \"Probably don't know the [[Haitian revolution]] caused the French to sell half of America, nor know the role that Africans played in the Civil War for that same America. If you ain't heard of [[Nanny of the Maroons]] or Bogle, you probably believe what they told you\".\n\nJamaican reggae and dancehall musician [[Junior Reid]] mentions Paul Bogle in the song \"Same Boat\", which recalls the era of slavery, by saying \"Paul Bogle haffi run like Usain Bolt\".\n\nBoth [[George William Gordon]] and Paul Bogle are mentioned in [[Horace Andy]]'s \"Our Jamaican National Heroes\", while [[Ruddy Thomas]]' \"Grandfather Bogle\" is a Bogle tribute.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Mary Dixon, ''The Morant Bay Rebellion: The Story of George William Gordon and Paul Bogle'', Birmingham, UK: Handprint, 1990, 20 pp.\n* Gad Heuman, ''\"The Killing Time\": The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica'', University of Tennessee Press, 1995, 222 pp.\n\n== External links ==\n* Dugdale-Pointon, T., [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/people_bogle_paul.html \"Paul Bogle, 1822-1865\"].

His face was also depicted on the Jamaican two-dollar bill, from 1969 until 1989, when the two-dollar bill was phased out.<ref name=\"History of War\" />\n\nThe Paul Bogle High School in the parish of his birth is named after him.\n\nHe is referred to together with [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]], leader of the [[Haitian Revolution]], in the name of the London-based publishing company [[Bogle-L'Ouverture]].<ref>[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=13731&inst_id=118&nv1=search&nv2= AIM25.]</ref>\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nAs a national hero, Paul Bogle is referenced in many works of Jamaican culture. Most notably, [[dancehall]] performer [[Bogle (dancer)|Gerald Levy]]'s [[stage name]] was \"Bogle\" (also \"Mr Bogle\" and \"Father Bogle\").\n\n[[Third World (band)|Third World]] produced a song about Bogle's execution.<ref>Heuman, The Killing Time, p. 186.</ref> Other [[reggae]] artists who have named and written songs in tribute to Paul Bogle include [[Lee Scratch Perry]] and a co-production between [[The Aggrovators]], and [[the Revolutionaries]].\n\nBogle is mentioned in songs by [[Burning Spear]], [[Brigadier Jerry]], [[The Cimarons]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Prince Far I]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Third World]] and [[General Trees]].\n\nIn \"So Much Things to Say\", by Bob Marley & The Wailers (and subsequently covered by [[Lauryn Hill]]), Marley mentions Bogle in the same breath as Jesus Christ and [[Marcus Garvey]], concluding, \"I'll never forget no way they turned their backs on Paul Bogle, so don't you forget no youth who you are and where you stand in the struggle.\"\n\nPaul Bogle is mentioned in the songs \"See them a come\" and \"Innocent blood\" by the [[reggae]] band [[Culture (band)|Culture]]. [[Tarrus Riley]] also mentions Paul Bogle in the song \"Shaka Zulu Pickney\", alluding his ancestry as a freedom fighter.\n\nPaul Bogle and the events outlined above are the theme of \"Ballard of 65\" by General Trees.\n\nThe British rapper [[Akala (rapper)|Akala]] references Bogle on the track \"Maangamizi\" from his album ''The Thieves Banquet'', saying: \"Probably don't know the [[Haitian revolution]] caused the French to sell half of America, nor know the role that Africans played in the Civil War for that same America. If you ain't heard of [[Nanny of the Maroons]] or Bogle, you probably believe what they told you\".\n\nJamaican reggae and dancehall musician [[Junior Reid]] mentions Paul Bogle in the song \"Same Boat\", which recalls the era of slavery, by saying \"Paul Bogle haffi run like Usain Bolt\".\n\nBoth [[George William Gordon]] and Paul Bogle are mentioned in [[Horace Andy]]'s \"Our Jamaican National Heroes\", while [[Ruddy Thomas]]' \"Grandfather Bogle\" is a Bogle tribute.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Mary Dixon, ''The Morant Bay Rebellion: The Story of George William Gordon and Paul Bogle'', Birmingham, UK: Handprint, 1990, 20 pp.\n* Gad Heuman, ''\"The Killing Time\": The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica'', University of Tennessee Press, 1995, 222 pp.\n\n== External links ==\n* Dugdale-Pointon, T., [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/people_bogle_paul.html \"Paul Bogle, 1822-1865\"].
