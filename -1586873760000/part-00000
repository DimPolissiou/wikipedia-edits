Achilles leads his [[Myrmidons]] along with the rest of the Greek army invading the historical city of [[Troy]], defended by Hector's Trojan army. The end of the film (the sack of Troy) is not taken from the ''Iliad'', but rather from [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]'s ''[[Posthomerica]]'' as the ''Iliad'' concludes with Hector's death and funeral.\n\nTroy made over $497 million worldwide, temporarily placing it in the #60 spot of top box office hits of all time. It received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]] and was the [[2004 in film#Highest-grossing films|8th highest-grossing film of 2004]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2004&p=.htm |title=2004 Worldwide Grosses |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA battle between the armies of King [[Agamemnon]] of [[Mycenae]] and King [[Triopas]] of [[Thessaly]] is averted when the great warrior [[Achilles]], fighting for Agamemnon, defeats Boagrius, Triopas' champion, in single combat. Thessaly joins Agamemnon's loose alliance of all the Greek kingdoms.\n\nPrince [[Hector]] of [[Troy]] and his younger brother [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] negotiate a peace treaty with [[Menelaus]], King of [[Sparta]]. However, Paris is having an affair with Menelaus' wife, Queen [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], and smuggles her aboard their home-bound vessel. Upon learning of this, Menelaus meets with Agamemnon, his elder brother, and asks him to help take Troy. Agamemnon agrees, as conquering Troy will give him control of the [[Aegean Sea]]. Agamemnon has [[Odysseus]], King of [[Ithaca]], persuade Achilles to join them. Achilles, who strongly dislikes Agamemnon, eventually decides to go after his mother [[Thetis]] tells him that though he will die, he will be forever glorified.\n\nIn Troy, King [[Priam]] is dismayed when Hector and Paris introduce Helen, but welcomes her and decides to prepare for war. The Greeks eventually invade and take the Trojan beach, thanks largely to Achilles and his [[Myrmidons]]. Achilles has the temple of [[Apollo]] sacked, and claims [[Briseis]] \u2014 a priestess and the cousin of Paris and Hector \u2014 as a prisoner. He is angered when Agamemnon spitefully takes her from him, and decides that he will not aid Agamemnon in the siege.\n\nThe Trojan and Greek armies meet outside the walls of Troy; during a parley, Paris offers to duel Menelaus personally for Helen's hand in exchange for the city being spared. Agamemnon, intending to take the city regardless of the outcome, accepts. Menelaus wounds Paris, causing him to cower behind Hector; when Menelaus attempts to kill Paris despite his victory, he himself is killed by Hector. In the ensuing battle, Hector kills [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and many Greek soldiers fall to the Trojan defenses. On Odysseus' insistence, Agamemnon gives the order to fall back. He gives Briseis to the Greek soldiers for their amusement, but Achilles saves her. Later that night, Briseis sneaks into Achilles' quarters to kill him; instead, she falls for him and they become lovers. Achilles then resolves to leave Troy, much to the dismay of [[Patroclus]], his cousin and prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nDespite Hector's objections, Priam orders him to retake the Trojan beach and force the Greeks home; the attack unifies the Greeks and the Myrmidons enter the battle. Hector duels a man he believes to be Achilles and kills him, only to discover it was actually Patroclus. Distraught, both armies agree to stop fighting for the day. Achilles is informed of his cousin's death and vows revenge. Wary of Achilles, Hector shows his wife [[Andromache]] a secret tunnel beneath Troy; should he die and the city fall, he instructs her to take their child and any survivors out of the city to [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]].\n\nThe next day, Achilles arrives outside Troy and challenges Hector; the two duel until Hector is killed, and Achilles drags his corpse back to the Trojan beach. Priam, in disguise, sneaks into the camp and implores Achilles to return Hector's body for a proper funeral. Ashamed of his actions, Achilles agrees and allows Briseis to return to Troy with Priam, promising a twelve-day truce so that Hector's funeral rites may be held in peace. He also orders his men to return home without him.\n\nAgamemnon declares that he will take Troy regardless of the cost. Concerned, Odysseus concocts a plan to infiltrate the city: he has the Greeks build a [[Trojan Horse|gigantic wooden horse]] as a peace offering and abandon the Trojan beach, hiding their ships in a nearby cove. Despite objections from Paris who requests for it to be burned down, Priam orders the horse be brought into the city after Archeptolemus views it as a gift intended for calming the gods. That night, Greeks hiding inside the horse emerge and open the city gates for the Greek army, commencing the [[Sack of Troy]]. While Andromache and Helen guide the Trojans to safety through the tunnel, Paris gives the Sword of Troy to a young boy named [[Aeneas]], instructing him to protect the Trojans and find them [[Rome|a new home]]. Agamemnon kills Priam and captures Briseis, who then kills Agamemnon. Achilles fights his way through the city and reunites with Briseis. Paris, seeking to avenge his brother, shoots an arrow through [[Achilles' heel]] and then several into his body. Achilles extracts all the arrows but the one in his heel.  He then bids farewell to Briseis, and watches her flee with Paris before dying.\n\nIn the aftermath, Troy is finally taken by the Greeks and a funeral is held for Achilles, where Odysseus personally cremates his body.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus Boagrius named in plot summary, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Achilles]], Greece's greatest warrior and leader of the Myrmidons\n* [[Eric Bana]] as [[Hector]], Crown Prince of Troy and commander of the Trojan armies\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], Prince of Troy and Hector's younger brother\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], former Queen of Sparta who became a Princess of Troy\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as [[Agamemnon]], King of the united Greek city-states\n* [[Sean Bean]] as [[Odysseus]], King of Ithaca\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as [[Menelaus]], King of Sparta and younger brother of Agamemnon\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as [[Andromache]], Hector's wife and Crown Princess of Troy\n* [[Julie Christie]] as [[Thetis]], Achilles' mother\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Priam]], King of Troy\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as [[Briseis]], priestess of the Trojan Temple of Apollo\n* [[Garrett Hedlund]] as [[Patroclus]], Achilles' younger cousin\n* [[John Shrapnel]] as [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], Agemememnon's advisor\n* [[Nigel Terry]] as Archeptolemus, the Trojan high priest\n* [[James Cosmo]] as [[Glaucus (soldier)|Glaucus]], second-in command of the Trojan armies\n* [[Julian Glover]] as [[Triopas]], King of Thessaly\n* [[Vincent Regan]] as [[Eudorus]], Achilles' right-hand man of the Myrmdions\n* [[Trevor Eve]] as Velior\n* [[Tyler Mane]] as [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]]\n* [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] as Boagrius, Triopas' champion\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe city of Troy was built in the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Malta]] at [[Fort Ricasoli]] from April to June 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,633152,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=MEN AND MYTHS | date=May 2004 | accessdate=2012-02-20 | first1=Gillian | last1=Flynn}}</ref>  Other important scenes were shot in [[Mellie\u0127a]], a small town in the north of [[Malta]], and on the small island of [[Comino]].

However, the reactions at test screenings which used an incomplete version of the score were negative, and in less than a day Yared was off the project without a chance to fix or change his music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thescreamonline.com/film/film4-3/yared.html |title=The Score of Troy - A Mystery Unveiled: by Gabriel Yared |publisher=TheScreamOnline.com |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> [[James Horner]] composed a replacement score in about four weeks. He used Carovska's vocals again and also included traditional Eastern Mediterranean music and brass instruments. Horner also collaborated with American singer-songwriter [[Josh Groban]] and lyricist [[Cynthia Weil]] to write an original song for the film's end credits. The product of this collaboration, \"Remember\" was performed by Groban with additional vocals by Carovska.\n\nThe soundtrack for the film was released on May 11, 2004 through [[Reprise Records]].\n\n==Director's cut==\n''Troy: Director's Cut'' was screened at the [[57th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 17, 2007 and received a [[limited release]] in [[Germany]] in April 2007. [[Warner Home Video]] reportedly spent more than $1 million for the [[director's cut]], which includes \"at least 1,000 new cuts\" or almost 30 minutes extra footage (with a new running time of 196 minutes). The DVD was released on September 18, 2007 in the US. The score of the film was changed dramatically, with many of the female vocals being cut. An addition to the music is the use of [[Danny Elfman]]'s theme for ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' during the pivotal fight between Hector and Achilles in front of the Gates of Troy.\n\nVarious shots were recut and extended. For instance, the love scene between Helen and Paris was reframed to include more nudity of Diane Kruger. The love scene between Achilles and Briseis is also extended. Only one scene was removed: the scene where Helen tends to the wound of Paris is taken out. The battle scenes were also extended, showing much more of Ajax's bloody rampage on the Trojans during the initial attack by the Greek Army. Perhaps most significant was the sacking of Troy, barely present in the theatrical cut, but shown fully here, depicting the soldiers raping women and murdering babies. Characters were given more time to develop, specifically [[Priam]] and [[Odysseus]], the latter being given a humorous introduction scene. Lastly, bookend scenes were added: the beginning being a soldier's dog finding its dead master and the end including a sequence where the few surviving Trojans escape to [[Mount Ida]]. In one of the commentary sequences, the film's writer, David Benioff, said that when it came to deciding whether to follow ''The Iliad'' or to do what was best for the film, they always decided with what was best for the film.\n\n== Home media ==\nTroy was released on DVD on January 4, 2005<ref>{{Citation|last=Petersen|first=Wolfgang|title=Troy|date=2005-01-04|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Two-Disc-Widescreen-Brad-Pitt/dp/B0002Z0EYK|publisher=Warner Home Video|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> The Director's  cut was released on Blu-Ray & DVD on September 18, 2007<ref>{{Citation|last=Petersen|first=Wolfgang|title=Troy: Director's Cut|date=2007-09-18|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Directors-Cut-Special-Blu-ray/dp/B000TGGJKU/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_74_t_1/140-4514335-5977559?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=WW2ZD1VV7DTFXNZZ0V42|publisher=Warner Brothers|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Troy|date=2007-09-18|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Directors-Cut-Ultimate-Collectors/dp/B000TGJ8IU/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1515020966&sr=1-2&keywords=Troy++Directors+Cut&refinements=p_n_format_browse-bin:2650304011|publisher=Warner Home Video|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>  The Directors Cut is the only edition of the film available on Blu-Ray, however the theatrical cut was released on HD-DVD.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Commercial performance===\nWhen the film was completed, total production costs were approximately $185 million.

Thessaly joins Agamemnon's loose alliance of all the Greek kingdoms.\n\nPrince [[Hector]] of [[Troy]] and his younger brother [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] negotiate a peace treaty with [[Menelaus]], King of [[Sparta]]. However, Paris is having an affair with Menelaus' wife, Queen [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], and smuggles her aboard their home-bound vessel. Upon learning of this, Menelaus meets with Agamemnon, his elder brother, and asks him to help take Troy. Agamemnon agrees, as conquering Troy will give him control of the [[Aegean Sea]]. Agamemnon has [[Odysseus]], King of [[Ithaca]], persuade Achilles to join them. Achilles, who strongly dislikes Agamemnon, eventually decides to go after his mother [[Thetis]] tells him that though he will die, he will be forever glorified.\n\nIn Troy, King [[Priam]] is dismayed when Hector and Paris introduce Helen, but welcomes her and decides to prepare for war. The Greeks eventually invade and take the Trojan beach, thanks largely to Achilles and his [[Myrmidons]]. Achilles has the temple of [[Apollo]] sacked, and claims [[Briseis]] \u2014 a priestess and the cousin of Paris and Hector \u2014 as a prisoner. He is angered when Agamemnon spitefully takes her from him, and decides that he will not aid Agamemnon in the siege.\n\nThe Trojan and Greek armies meet outside the walls of Troy; during a parley, Paris offers to duel Menelaus personally for Helen's hand in exchange for the city being spared. Agamemnon, intending to take the city regardless of the outcome, accepts. Menelaus wounds Paris, causing him to cower behind Hector; when Menelaus attempts to kill Paris despite his victory, he himself is killed by Hector. In the ensuing battle, Hector kills [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and many Greek soldiers fall to the Trojan defenses. On Odysseus' insistence, Agamemnon gives the order to fall back. He gives Briseis to the Greek soldiers for their amusement, but Achilles saves her. Later that night, Briseis sneaks into Achilles' quarters to kill him; instead, she falls for him and they become lovers. Achilles then resolves to leave Troy, much to the dismay of [[Patroclus]], his cousin and prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nDespite Hector's objections, Priam orders him to retake the Trojan beach and force the Greeks home; the attack unifies the Greeks and the Myrmidons enter the battle. Hector duels a man he believes to be Achilles and kills him, only to discover it was actually Patroclus. Distraught, both armies agree to stop fighting for the day. Achilles is informed of his cousin's death and vows revenge. Wary of Achilles, Hector shows his wife [[Andromache]] a secret tunnel beneath Troy; should he die and the city fall, he instructs her to take their child and any survivors out of the city to [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]].\n\nThe next day, Achilles arrives outside Troy and challenges Hector; the two duel until Hector is killed, and Achilles drags his corpse back to the Trojan beach. Priam, in disguise, sneaks into the camp and implores Achilles to return Hector's body for a proper funeral. Ashamed of his actions, Achilles agrees and allows Briseis to return to Troy with Priam, promising a twelve-day truce so that Hector's funeral rites may be held in peace. He also orders his men to return home without him.\n\nAgamemnon declares that he will take Troy regardless of the cost. Concerned, Odysseus concocts a plan to infiltrate the city: he has the Greeks build a [[Trojan Horse|gigantic wooden horse]] as a peace offering and abandon the Trojan beach, hiding their ships in a nearby cove. Despite objections from Paris who requests for it to be burned down, Priam orders the horse be brought into the city after Archeptolemus views it as a gift intended for calming the gods. That night, Greeks hiding inside the horse emerge and open the city gates for the Greek army, commencing the [[Sack of Troy]]. While Andromache and Helen guide the Trojans to safety through the tunnel, Paris gives the Sword of Troy to a young boy named [[Aeneas]], instructing him to protect the Trojans and find them [[Rome|a new home]]. Agamemnon kills Priam and captures Briseis, who then kills Agamemnon. Achilles fights his way through the city and reunites with Briseis. Paris, seeking to avenge his brother, shoots an arrow through [[Achilles' heel]] and then several into his body. Achilles extracts all the arrows but the one in his heel.  He then bids farewell to Briseis, and watches her flee with Paris before dying.\n\nIn the aftermath, Troy is finally taken by the Greeks and a funeral is held for Achilles, where Odysseus personally cremates his body.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus Boagrius named in plot summary, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Achilles]], Greece's greatest warrior and leader of the Myrmidons\n* [[Eric Bana]] as [[Hector]], Crown Prince of Troy and commander of the Trojan armies\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], Prince of Troy and Hector's younger brother\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], former Queen of Sparta who became a Princess of Troy\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as [[Agamemnon]], King of the united Greek city-states\n* [[Sean Bean]] as [[Odysseus]], King of Ithaca\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as [[Menelaus]], King of Sparta and younger brother of Agamemnon\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as [[Andromache]], Hector's wife and Crown Princess of Troy\n* [[Julie Christie]] as [[Thetis]], Achilles' mother\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Priam]], King of Troy\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as [[Briseis]], priestess of the Trojan Temple of Apollo\n* [[Garrett Hedlund]] as [[Patroclus]], Achilles' younger cousin\n* [[John Shrapnel]] as [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], Agemememnon's advisor\n* [[Nigel Terry]] as Archeptolemus, the Trojan high priest\n* [[James Cosmo]] as [[Glaucus (soldier)|Glaucus]], second-in command of the Trojan armies\n* [[Julian Glover]] as [[Triopas]], King of Thessaly\n* [[Vincent Regan]] as [[Eudorus]], Achilles' right-hand man of the Myrmdions\n* [[Trevor Eve]] as Velior\n* [[Tyler Mane]] as [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]]\n* [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] as Boagrius, Triopas' champion\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe city of Troy was built in the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Malta]] at [[Fort Ricasoli]] from April to June 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,633152,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=MEN AND MYTHS | date=May 2004 | accessdate=2012-02-20 | first1=Gillian | last1=Flynn}}</ref>  Other important scenes were shot in [[Mellie\u0127a]], a small town in the north of [[Malta]], and on the small island of [[Comino]].

The role eventually went to Rose Byrne.\n\nThe lead Brad Pitt years later expressed disappointment with the film saying \u201cI had to do ''Troy'' because [...] I pulled out of another movie and then had to do something for the studio. So I was put in ''Troy.'' It wasn\u2019t painful, but I realized that the way that movie was being told was not how I wanted it to be. I made my own mistakes in it. What am I trying to say about ''Troy''? I could not get out of the middle of the frame. It was driving me crazy. I\u2019d become spoiled working with [[David Fincher]]. It\u2019s no slight on Wolfgang Petersen. ''[[Das Boot]]'' is one of the all-time great films. But somewhere in it, ''Troy'' became a commercial kind of thing. Every shot was like, Here\u2019s the hero! There was no mystery.\u201d<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/09/magazine/brad-pitt-interview.html | newspaper=New York Times Magazine| title=Brad Pitt on the Kind of Leading Man He Doesn't Want to Be | date=December 9, 2019 | first1=David | last1=Marchese}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Troy: Music from the Motion Picture}}\nComposer [[Gabriel Yared]] originally worked on the score for ''Troy'' for over a year, having been hired by the director, Wolfgang Petersen. [[Tanja Carovska]] provided vocals on various portions of the music, as she later would on composer James Horner's version of the soundtrack. However, the reactions at test screenings which used an incomplete version of the score were negative, and in less than a day Yared was off the project without a chance to fix or change his music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thescreamonline.com/film/film4-3/yared.html |title=The Score of Troy - A Mystery Unveiled: by Gabriel Yared |publisher=TheScreamOnline.com |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> [[James Horner]] composed a replacement score in about four weeks. He used Carovska's vocals again and also included traditional Eastern Mediterranean music and brass instruments. Horner also collaborated with American singer-songwriter [[Josh Groban]] and lyricist [[Cynthia Weil]] to write an original song for the film's end credits. The product of this collaboration, \"Remember\" was performed by Groban with additional vocals by Carovska.\n\nThe soundtrack for the film was released on May 11, 2004 through [[Reprise Records]].\n\n==Director's cut==\n''Troy: Director's Cut'' was screened at the [[57th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 17, 2007 and received a [[limited release]] in [[Germany]] in April 2007. [[Warner Home Video]] reportedly spent more than $1 million for the [[director's cut]], which includes \"at least 1,000 new cuts\" or almost 30 minutes extra footage (with a new running time of 196 minutes). The DVD was released on September 18, 2007 in the US. The score of the film was changed dramatically, with many of the female vocals being cut. An addition to the music is the use of [[Danny Elfman]]'s theme for ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' during the pivotal fight between Hector and Achilles in front of the Gates of Troy.\n\nVarious shots were recut and extended. For instance, the love scene between Helen and Paris was reframed to include more nudity of Diane Kruger. The love scene between Achilles and Briseis is also extended. Only one scene was removed: the scene where Helen tends to the wound of Paris is taken out. The battle scenes were also extended, showing much more of Ajax's bloody rampage on the Trojans during the initial attack by the Greek Army. Perhaps most significant was the sacking of Troy, barely present in the theatrical cut, but shown fully here, depicting the soldiers raping women and murdering babies. Characters were given more time to develop, specifically [[Priam]] and [[Odysseus]], the latter being given a humorous introduction scene. Lastly, bookend scenes were added: the beginning being a soldier's dog finding its dead master and the end including a sequence where the few surviving Trojans escape to [[Mount Ida]]. In one of the commentary sequences, the film's writer, David Benioff, said that when it came to deciding whether to follow ''The Iliad'' or to do what was best for the film, they always decided with what was best for the film.\n\n== Home media ==\nTroy was released on DVD on January 4, 2005<ref>{{Citation|last=Petersen|first=Wolfgang|title=Troy|date=2005-01-04|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Two-Disc-Widescreen-Brad-Pitt/dp/B0002Z0EYK|publisher=Warner Home Video|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> The Director's  cut was released on Blu-Ray & DVD on September 18, 2007<ref>{{Citation|last=Petersen|first=Wolfgang|title=Troy: Director's Cut|date=2007-09-18|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Directors-Cut-Special-Blu-ray/dp/B000TGGJKU/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_74_t_1/140-4514335-5977559?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=WW2ZD1VV7DTFXNZZ0V42|publisher=Warner Brothers|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Troy|date=2007-09-18|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Directors-Cut-Ultimate-Collectors/dp/B000TGJ8IU/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1515020966&sr=1-2&keywords=Troy++Directors+Cut&refinements=p_n_format_browse-bin:2650304011|publisher=Warner Home Video|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>  The Directors Cut is the only edition of the film available on Blu-Ray, however the theatrical cut was released on HD-DVD.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Commercial performance===\nWhen the film was completed, total production costs were approximately $185 million.
