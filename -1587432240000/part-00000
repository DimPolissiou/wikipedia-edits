He joined the [[World Hockey Association]] as coach and general manager for the [[Quebec Nordiques]] in 1973\u201374.

Plante was the first NHL goaltender to regularly play the puck outside his [[crease (hockey)|crease]] in support of his team's [[defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]], and he often instructed his teammates from behind the play. Plante was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1978, was chosen as the goaltender of the Canadiens' \"dream team\" in 1985, and was inducted into the Quebec Sports Pantheon in 1994. The Montreal Canadiens retired Plante's jersey, #1, the following year.

In 1932, Plante began to play hockey, skateless and with a tennis ball, using a goaltender's hockey stick his father had carved from a tree root.<ref name=\"1on1\" /> When he was five years old, Plante fell off a ladder and broke his hand. The fracture failed to heal properly and affected his playing style during his early hockey career; he underwent successful corrective surgery as an adult.<ref name=\"OneNineEight\">Plante, R., p. 198.</ref><ref name = \"FortySeven\" /> Plante suffered from asthma starting in early childhood. This prevented him from skating for extended periods, so he gravitated to playing goaltender.<ref name=\"Fourteen\">Plante, R., p. 14.</ref> As his playing progressed, Jacques received his first regulation goaltender's stick for [[Christmas]] of 1936.<ref name=\"Thirteen\" /> His father made Plante's first pads by stuffing potato sacks and reinforcing them with wooden panels.<ref name=\"Thirteen\" /> As a child, Plante played hockey outdoors in the bitterly cold Quebec winters. His mother taught him how to knit his own [[Knit cap#Canadian tuque|tuques]] to protect him from the cold. Plante continued knitting and embroidering throughout his life and wore his hand-knitted tuques while playing and practicing until entering the National Hockey League (NHL).<ref name=\"Thirteen\" />\n\nPlante's first foray into organized hockey came at age 12. He was watching his school's team practice, when the coach ordered the goaltender off the ice after a heated argument over his play, and Plante asked to replace him. The coach permitted him to play, since there was no other available goaltender; it was quickly apparent that Plante could hold his own, despite the other players being many years older than he was.<ref name=\"Fifteen\">Plante, R., p. 15.</ref> He impressed the coach and stayed on as the team's number-one goaltender.<ref name=\"Sixteen\">Plante, R., p. 16.</ref>\n\nTwo years later, Plante was playing for five different teams&nbsp;\u2014 the local factory team, and teams in the midget, juvenile, junior and intermediate categories.<ref name=\"Eighteen\">Plante, R., p. 18.</ref> Plante demanded a salary from the factory team's coach after his father told him that the other players were being paid, because they were company employees. The coach paid Plante 50&nbsp;cents per game to retain him and maintain the team's popularity.<ref name=\"1on1\" /> Afterwards, Plante began to receive various offers from other teams; he was offered $80 per week&nbsp;\u2014 a considerable sum in those days&nbsp;\u2014 to play for a team in [[England]], and a similar offer to play for the [[Providence Reds]] of the [[American Hockey League]]. Plante passed them up, because his parents wanted him to finish high school. He graduated with top honours in 1947.<ref name=\"Nineteen\">Plante, R., p. 19.</ref> Upon graduation, he took a job as a clerk in a Shawinigan factory. A few weeks later, the [[Quebec Citadelles#Other teams with the same name|Quebec Citadels]] offered Plante $85 per week to play for them; he accepted, marking the beginning of his professional career.<ref name=\"Nineteen\" />\n\nHis nickname was \"Jake the Snake\".<ref>[http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p197802&type=Player&page=bio&list=ByName#photo Legends of Hockey \u2013 The Legends \u2013 Honoured Player \u2013 Plante, Jacques \u2013 Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Minor leagues===\n[[File:Citadellesdequebec.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Plante, seated in front in [[tuque]], with the [[Quebec Citadelles#Other teams with the same name|Quebec Citadelles]]]]\nJacques joined the [[Quebec Citadelles#Other teams with the same name|Quebec Citadelles]] in 1947.

Plante played for Montreal's affiliate [[Royal Montreal Hockey Club]], earning $4,500 for the season, and an extra $500 for practicing with the Canadiens.<ref name=\"ThirtyOne\">Plante, R., p. 31.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, he married Jacqueline Gagn\u00e9; they had two sons, Michel and Richard.\n\nIn January 1953, Plante was called up to play for the Canadiens. [[Bill Durnan]], the goaltender who played for Montreal when Plante first began, had retired, and [[Gerry McNeil]], their top goaltender, had fractured his jaw.<ref name=\"1on1\"/> Plante played three games, but in that short time, he generated controversy.

On March 13, 1955, with only four games left in the season, an on-ice brawl resulted in the suspension of Montreal's leading scorer, [[Maurice Richard]], for the rest of the season and the playoffs. Four nights later, playing in Montreal in front of an angry crowd, Plante was witness to the [[Richard Riot|riot]] that followed. The Canadiens subsequently lost to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the finals.<ref>Irvin (1991), p. 125.</ref>\n\nFor the [[1955\u201356 NHL season|1955\u201356 season]], Plante was the unchallenged starting goaltender of the Canadiens; [[Gerry McNeil]] had not played the previous season and was sent to the [[Royal Montreal Hockey Club|Montreal Royals]].

Plante's asthma was getting worse. He sustained a concussion with just a few weeks left in the season and missed three games of the playoffs.<ref name=\"SeventyOne\">Plante, R., p. 71.</ref> In the sixth game of the Stanley Cup finals, Plante's asthma was making him dizzy, and he was having difficulty concentrating; he collapsed at the end of the game after teammate [[Doug Harvey (ice hockey)|Doug Harvey]] scored the series-winning goal.<ref name=\"SeventyThree\">Plante, R., p. 73.</ref> The Canadiens went on to win the Stanley Cup again at the close of the [[1958-59 NHL season|1958\u201359 season]].\n\n====Goalie mask====\n[[File:Plante Mask.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Plante's original fibreglass mask|alt=the mask is white and of solid construction with egg-sized oval cutouts for the eyes and a rectangular cutout from the base of the nose to below the lower lip]]\nDuring the [[1959\u201360 NHL season|1959\u201360 season]], Plante wore a [[goaltender mask]] for the first time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in practice since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a [[sinusitis]] operation,<ref name=\"Legends HHOF\"/> head coach [[Toe Blake]] was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play.<ref name=\"Fischler27\">Fischler, S., pp. 27\u201328.</ref> However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by [[Andy Bathgate]] three minutes into a game against the [[New York Rangers]], and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed.<ref name=\"Fischler27\"/> The Canadiens won the game 3\u20131. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it.<ref name=\"Eighty\">Plante, R., p. 80.</ref> The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games.<ref name=\"Hunter119\">Hunter, D., p.\u00a0119.</ref> Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3\u20130, and the mask returned for good the next night.<ref name=\"EightyOne\">Plante, R., p.\u00a081.</ref> That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.<ref name=\"VIIIV\">Adrahtas, p.\u00a085.</ref>\n\nPlante subsequently designed his own and other goaltenders' masks.<ref name=\"TwoZeroFive\">Plante, R., p.\u00a0205.</ref> He was not the first NHL goaltender known to wear a face mask.

He began shouting directions to his teammates during games in his first stint in the minor leagues (the goaltender usually has the best view of the game). He kept extensive notes on opposing players and teams throughout his career.<ref>Irvin (1995), p.\u00a0124.</ref> He made his debut in the broadcasting booth during his first retirement in the 1960s as a colour commentator for broadcasts of [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League#History|Quebec Junior League]] games alongside [[Danny Gallivan]] of [[Hockey Night in Canada]] fame.<ref>Irvin (1991), p.\u00a0299.</ref> [[T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada|Radio Canada]], the French language branch of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], brought Plante aboard as on-air analyst for its television broadcasts of the [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] between the national team of the [[Soviet Union]] and a Canadian team made up of professional players from the NHL. Plante was one of the few North American analysts who dissented from the widely held belief in the superiority of the Canadian team.<ref>Plante, R., p.\u00a0174.</ref>\n\nPlante also wrote extensively on hockey.

His seminal work, ''Goaltending'', was published in 1972 in English, with the French edition (entitled ''Devant le filet'') published in 1973. In his book, Plante outlined a program of goaltender development that included off-ice exercises, choice of equipment, styles of play, and game-day preparation. He also advised on best coaching methods for both young and advanced goaltenders.<ref>Plante, J., p.\u00a05.</ref> His book remained popular with coaches and players and was reprinted in both French and English in 1997, 25&nbsp;years after it was first published.<ref>Plante, J., p.\u00a04.</ref>\n\nStarting in 1967, Plante was one of the instructors at ''\u00c9cole moderne de hockey,'' a summer hockey school for young players.<ref>Plante, R., p.\u00a0168.</ref> His reputation as a teacher spread, and he traveled to [[Sweden]] in 1972 at the invitation of the Swedish Hockey Federation, teaching the top goaltenders in the country and their coaches and trainers.<ref>Plante, R., p.\u00a0170.</ref> During his first and second retirements, Plante also coached goaltenders and consulted for several NHL teams, including the [[California Golden Seals|Oakland Seals]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]], Montreal Canadiens and St. Louis Blues.<ref name=\"TwoOneFour\"/>\n\n==Retirement and death==\nPlante finally retired from hockey in 1975, after the death of his youngest son.<ref name=\"Hunter121\">Hunter, D., p.\u00a0121.</ref> He moved to [[Switzerland]] with his second wife, Raymonde Udrisard, but remained active on the North American hockey scene as an analyst, adviser, and goaltender trainer.<ref name=\"TwoOneFour\">Plante, R., p.\u00a0214.</ref> He was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1978.<ref name=\"TwoOneFive\">Plante, R. p.\u00a0215.</ref> In the fall of 1985, Plante was diagnosed with terminal [[stomach cancer]].

During a career lasting from 1947 to 1975, he was considered to be one of the most important innovators in hockey. He played for the [[Montreal Canadiens]] from 1953 to 1963; during his tenure, the team won the [[Stanley Cup]] six times, including five consecutive wins. In 2017 Plante was named one of the \"[[100 Greatest NHL Players]]\" in history.<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest NHL Players|url=https://www.nhl.com/fans/nhl-centennial/100-greatest-nhl-players|website=NHL.com|accessdate=January 1, 2017|date=January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=NHL|title=Jacques Plante changed game when he donned mask|date=March 22, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUgAghriljM&list=PL1NbHSfosBuHEp2Bphcgz16OKz0kjnCH6&index=32|accessdate=April 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nPlante retired in 1965 but was persuaded to return to the [[National Hockey League]] to play for the expansion [[St. Louis Blues]] in 1968. He was later traded to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in 1970 and to the [[Boston Bruins]] in 1973. He joined the [[World Hockey Association]] as coach and general manager for the [[Quebec Nordiques]] in 1973\u201374. He then played goal for the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in 1974\u201375, ending his professional career with that team.\n\nPlante was the first NHL goaltender to wear a [[goaltender mask]] in regulation play on a regular {{nowrap|basis.<ref name=srapsnn>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KEIVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HAgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7507%2C3637776 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Masks for goalies gain acceptance |date=November 23, 1969 |page=7, sports }}</ref>}} {{nowrap|He developed}} and tested many versions of the mask (including the forerunner of today's mask/helmet combination) with the assistance of other experts. Plante was the first NHL goaltender to regularly play the puck outside his [[crease (hockey)|crease]] in support of his team's [[defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]], and he often instructed his teammates from behind the play. Plante was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1978, was chosen as the goaltender of the Canadiens' \"dream team\" in 1985, and was inducted into the Quebec Sports Pantheon in 1994. The Montreal Canadiens retired Plante's jersey, #1, the following year. Plante ranks seventh among NHL goalies for all-time career wins with 437.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Jacques Plante 1944-1945.jpg|Jacques Plante in the 1944\u20131945 season, aged 15 or 16|thumb|left|200 px|alt=A teenage Plante assumes the traditional goaltender stance, slightly crouched with legs together, wearing goaltender pads on his legs, his team sweater, and holding a goaltender stick in his right hand with the blade of the stick in front of his feet]]\nPlante was born on a farm near [[Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, Quebec|Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel]], in [[Mauricie]], Quebec, the first of 11 children born to Palma and Xavier Plante.<ref name=\"Thirteen\">Plante, R., p. 13.</ref> The family moved to [[Shawinigan|Shawinigan Falls]], where his father worked in one of the local factories. In 1932, Plante began to play hockey, skateless and with a tennis ball, using a goaltender's hockey stick his father had carved from a tree root.<ref name=\"1on1\" /> When he was five years old, Plante fell off a ladder and broke his hand. The fracture failed to heal properly and affected his playing style during his early hockey career; he underwent successful corrective surgery as an adult.<ref name=\"OneNineEight\">Plante, R., p. 198.</ref><ref name = \"FortySeven\" /> Plante suffered from asthma starting in early childhood. This prevented him from skating for extended periods, so he gravitated to playing goaltender.<ref name=\"Fourteen\">Plante, R., p. 14.</ref> As his playing progressed, Jacques received his first regulation goaltender's stick for [[Christmas]] of 1936.<ref name=\"Thirteen\" /> His father made Plante's first pads by stuffing potato sacks and reinforcing them with wooden panels.<ref name=\"Thirteen\" /> As a child, Plante played hockey outdoors in the bitterly cold Quebec winters. His mother taught him how to knit his own [[Knit cap#Canadian tuque|tuques]] to protect him from the cold. Plante continued knitting and embroidering throughout his life and wore his hand-knitted tuques while playing and practicing until entering the National Hockey League (NHL).<ref name=\"Thirteen\" />\n\nPlante's first foray into organized hockey came at age 12. He was watching his school's team practice, when the coach ordered the goaltender off the ice after a heated argument over his play, and Plante asked to replace him. The coach permitted him to play, since there was no other available goaltender; it was quickly apparent that Plante could hold his own, despite the other players being many years older than he was.<ref name=\"Fifteen\">Plante, R., p. 15.</ref> He impressed the coach and stayed on as the team's number-one goaltender.<ref name=\"Sixteen\">Plante, R., p. 16.</ref>\n\nTwo years later, Plante was playing for five different teams&nbsp;\u2014 the local factory team, and teams in the midget, juvenile, junior and intermediate categories.<ref name=\"Eighteen\">Plante, R., p. 18.</ref> Plante demanded a salary from the factory team's coach after his father told him that the other players were being paid, because they were company employees. The coach paid Plante 50&nbsp;cents per game to retain him and maintain the team's popularity.<ref name=\"1on1\" /> Afterwards, Plante began to receive various offers from other teams; he was offered $80 per week&nbsp;\u2014 a considerable sum in those days&nbsp;\u2014 to play for a team in [[England]], and a similar offer to play for the [[Providence Reds]] of the [[American Hockey League]]. Plante passed them up, because his parents wanted him to finish high school. He graduated with top honours in 1947.<ref name=\"Nineteen\">Plante, R., p. 19.</ref> Upon graduation, he took a job as a clerk in a Shawinigan factory. A few weeks later, the [[Quebec Citadelles#Other teams with the same name|Quebec Citadels]] offered Plante $85 per week to play for them; he accepted, marking the beginning of his professional career.<ref name=\"Nineteen\" />\n\nHis nickname was \"Jake the Snake\".<ref>[http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p197802&type=Player&page=bio&list=ByName#photo Legends of Hockey \u2013 The Legends \u2013 Honoured Player \u2013 Plante, Jacques \u2013 Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Minor leagues===\n[[File:Citadellesdequebec.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Plante, seated in front in [[tuque]], with the [[Quebec Citadelles#Other teams with the same name|Quebec Citadelles]]]]\nJacques joined the [[Quebec Citadelles#Other teams with the same name|Quebec Citadelles]] in 1947. While playing for Quebec, Plante started to play the puck outside his crease,<ref name=\"TwentyFour\">Plante, R., p. 24.</ref> a technique he developed when he recognized that the team's defense was performing poorly. Fans found Plante's unconventional playing style to be exciting,<ref name=\"TwentyThree\">Plante, R., p. 23.</ref> but it angered his managers, who believed that a goaltender should stay in net and let his players recover the puck.<ref name=\"TwentyFour\"/> Plante had come to the conclusion that as long as he was in control of the puck, the opponents could not shoot it at him \u2013 this is now standard practice for goaltenders.<ref name=\"TwentyFive\">Plante, R., p. 25.</ref> The same season, the Citadelles beat the [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]] in the league finals, with Plante being named most valuable player on his team.<ref name=\"TwentySix\">Plante, R., p. 26.</ref> The [[Montreal Canadiens]]' general manager, [[Frank J. Selke]], became interested in acquiring Plante as a member of the team.<ref name=\"TwentySix\"/> In 1948, Plante received an invitation to the Canadiens' training camp. On August 17, 1949, Selke offered Plante a contract. Plante played for Montreal's affiliate [[Royal Montreal Hockey Club]], earning $4,500 for the season, and an extra $500 for practicing with the Canadiens.<ref name=\"ThirtyOne\">Plante, R., p. 31.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, he married Jacqueline Gagn\u00e9; they had two sons, Michel and Richard.\n\nIn January 1953, Plante was called up to play for the Canadiens. [[Bill Durnan]], the goaltender who played for Montreal when Plante first began, had retired, and [[Gerry McNeil]], their top goaltender, had fractured his jaw.<ref name=\"1on1\"/> Plante played three games, but in that short time, he generated controversy. Coach [[Dick Irvin|Dick Irvin, Sr.]] did not wish his players to stand out by any addition to their regular uniforms.<ref name=\"ThirtyEight\">Plante, R., p. 38.</ref> Plante always wore one of his tuques while playing hockey, and after an argument with Irvin, all of Plante's tuques had vanished from the Montreal locker room.<ref name=\"ThirtyNine\">Plante, R., p. 39.</ref> Even without his good luck charm,<ref name=\"ThirtyEight\"/> Plante gave up only four goals in the three games he played, all of them wins.<ref name=\"ThirtyNine\"/>\n\nLater during the [[1952\u201353 NHL season]], Plante played in the playoffs against the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]]. He won his first playoff game with a shutout.<ref name=\"Irvin94\">Irvin (1991), p. 94.</ref> Montreal won that series and eventually the Stanley Cup, and Plante's name was engraved on the Cup for the first time.<ref name=\"Irvin94\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of 1953, McNeil was still the starting goaltender for the Canadiens.<ref name=\"mcneil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=18623|title=Gerry George McNeil|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=March 12, 2008}}</ref> Selke assigned Plante to the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]] of the [[American Hockey League]] so fans in the United States would get to know him.<ref name=\"Forty\">Plante, R., p. 40.</ref> Plante was instantly successful; Fred Hunt, the general manager of the Bisons, told [[Kenny Reardon]], Montreal's recruiting manager, \"he's <nowiki>[Plante]</nowiki> the biggest attraction since the good old days of [[Terry Sawchuk]].\"<ref name=\"Forty\"/>\n\n===Montreal Canadiens===\nBy the end of the [[1953\u201354 NHL season|1953\u201354 season]], Plante was well-entrenched within the NHL.<ref>Adrahtas, p. 52.</ref> In the spring of 1954, he underwent surgery to correct his left hand, which he had broken in his childhood. He could not move the hand well enough to catch high shots and compensated by using the rest of his body. The operation was successful.<ref name=\"FortySeven\">Plante, R., p. 47.</ref>\n\nOn February 12, 1954, Plante was called up to the Canadiens and established himself as their starting goaltender \u2013 he did not return to the minor leagues for many years.<ref name=\"Hunter118\">Hunter, D., p. 118.</ref> Plante was the Canadiens' number one goaltender at the beginning of the [[1954\u201355 NHL season]]. On March 13, 1955, with only four games left in the season, an on-ice brawl resulted in the suspension of Montreal's leading scorer, [[Maurice Richard]], for the rest of the season and the playoffs. Four nights later, playing in Montreal in front of an angry crowd, Plante was witness to the [[Richard Riot|riot]] that followed. The Canadiens subsequently lost to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the finals.<ref>Irvin (1991), p. 125.</ref>\n\nFor the [[1955\u201356 NHL season|1955\u201356 season]], Plante was the unchallenged starting goaltender of the Canadiens; [[Gerry McNeil]] had not played the previous season and was sent to the [[Royal Montreal Hockey Club|Montreal Royals]]. [[Charlie Hodge (ice hockey)|Charlie Hodge]], Plante's backup the previous season, was sent to the [[Seattle_Totems#Seattle_Americans_(1955\u201358)|Seattle Americans]], a Canadiens' farm team.<ref name=\"SixtyTwo\">Plante, R., p. 62.</ref> Later that season, Montreal won the Stanley Cup, the first of what would be five consecutive Stanley Cup championship seasons.<ref>Irvin (1991), p.\u00a0130.</ref> The [[1956\u201357 NHL season|next season]], Plante missed most of November because of chronic [[bronchitis]], a consequence of the asthma that had affected him since childhood.<ref name=\"SixtyFour\">Plante, R., p. 64.</ref> During the [[1957\u201358 NHL season]], the Canadiens won their third straight Stanley Cup despite injuries to Plante and other members of the team. Plante's asthma was getting worse. He sustained a concussion with just a few weeks left in the season and missed three games of the playoffs.<ref name=\"SeventyOne\">Plante, R., p. 71.</ref> In the sixth game of the Stanley Cup finals, Plante's asthma was making him dizzy, and he was having difficulty concentrating; he collapsed at the end of the game after teammate [[Doug Harvey (ice hockey)|Doug Harvey]] scored the series-winning goal.<ref name=\"SeventyThree\">Plante, R., p. 73.</ref> The Canadiens went on to win the Stanley Cup again at the close of the [[1958-59 NHL season|1958\u201359 season]].\n\n====Goalie mask====\n[[File:Plante Mask.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Plante's original fibreglass mask|alt=the mask is white and of solid construction with egg-sized oval cutouts for the eyes and a rectangular cutout from the base of the nose to below the lower lip]]\nDuring the [[1959\u201360 NHL season|1959\u201360 season]], Plante wore a [[goaltender mask]] for the first time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in practice since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a [[sinusitis]] operation,<ref name=\"Legends HHOF\"/> head coach [[Toe Blake]] was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play.<ref name=\"Fischler27\">Fischler, S., pp. 27\u201328.</ref> However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by [[Andy Bathgate]] three minutes into a game against the [[New York Rangers]], and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask.

He kept extensive notes on opposing players and teams throughout his career.<ref>Irvin (1995), p.\u00a0124.</ref> He made his debut in the broadcasting booth during his first retirement in the 1960s as a colour commentator for broadcasts of [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League#History|Quebec Junior League]] games alongside [[Danny Gallivan]] of [[Hockey Night in Canada]] fame.<ref>Irvin (1991), p.\u00a0299.</ref> [[T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada|Radio Canada]], the French language branch of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], brought Plante aboard as on-air analyst for its television broadcasts of the [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] between the national team of the [[Soviet Union]] and a Canadian team made up of professional players from the NHL.

His seminal work, ''Goaltending'', was published in 1972 in English, with the French edition (entitled ''Devant le filet'') published in 1973. In his book, Plante outlined a program of goaltender development that included off-ice exercises, choice of equipment, styles of play, and game-day preparation. He also advised on best coaching methods for both young and advanced goaltenders.<ref>Plante, J., p.\u00a05.</ref> His book remained popular with coaches and players and was reprinted in both French and English in 1997, 25&nbsp;years after it was first published.<ref>Plante, J., p.\u00a04.</ref>\n\nStarting in 1967, Plante was one of the instructors at ''\u00c9cole moderne de hockey,'' a summer hockey school for young players.<ref>Plante, R., p.\u00a0168.</ref> His reputation as a teacher spread, and he traveled to [[Sweden]] in 1972 at the invitation of the Swedish Hockey Federation, teaching the top goaltenders in the country and their coaches and trainers.<ref>Plante, R., p.\u00a0170.</ref> During his first and second retirements, Plante also coached goaltenders and consulted for several NHL teams, including the [[California Golden Seals|Oakland Seals]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]], Montreal Canadiens and St. Louis Blues.<ref name=\"TwoOneFour\"/>\n\n==Retirement and death==\nPlante finally retired from hockey in 1975, after the death of his youngest son.<ref name=\"Hunter121\">Hunter, D., p.\u00a0121.</ref> He moved to [[Switzerland]] with his second wife, Raymonde Udrisard, but remained active on the North American hockey scene as an analyst, adviser, and goaltender trainer.<ref name=\"TwoOneFour\">Plante, R., p.\u00a0214.</ref> He was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1978.<ref name=\"TwoOneFive\">Plante, R. p.\u00a0215.</ref> In the fall of 1985, Plante was diagnosed with terminal [[stomach cancer]].

Prior to 1906, it was known as [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax]] and is one of the oldest defence establishments in Canada, having been established by the Royal Navy during the 18th century as [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax|HM Dockyard]]. While awaiting transfer to Canada, the dockyard fell into disrepair. The dockyard was formally taken over from the British government by Canada in 1910, with no changes to the layout. The dockyard in 1910 comprised a Naval Hospital, a blacksmith shop, workshops, three slipways, five jetties, residences, coal and vitualling stores and 75 other miscellaneous buildings.<ref name=crowdec53>{{cite magazine |title=Gateway to the North Atlantic |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |date=December 1953 |volume=6 |number=2 |pages=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the dockyard underwent significant expansion, acting as headquarters for the Royal Canadian Navy and as the North American headquarters for the Royal Navy. During the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion]], the dockyard was severely damaged, with many of its buildings demolished. New ones were swiftly erected for the war effort. However, following the end of the war in 1918, the number of dockyard staff was reduced significantly.<ref name=crowdec53/>\n\nIn 1939, the dockyard's were extended to the north and south. With the onset of [[World War II]], this was still not large enough and the lands of the French Cable Company in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]] were acquired and integrated into the base. In 1942, the Royal Canadian Navy acquired the Army Ordnance Depot in Dartmouth and an area on the east side of Bedford Basin was turned into an ammunition depot. During the war, new construction replaced nearly every building that had existed prior to the war. HMC Dockyard encompassed 1,255 acres after all the acquisitions. In 1943, the dockyard's lands were augmented with property in [[Renous-Quarryville|Renous, New Brunswick]] and another ammunition depot at [[Newcastle, New Brunswick]]. The Army Gun Wharf in Halifax became the victualling depot and two communications stations were established, one at [[Albro Lake, Nova Scotia|Albro]] and one at [[Newport Corner, Nova Scotia|Newport Corners]]. The barracks building that became {{HMCS|Scotian}} was erected during the war.<ref name=crowdec53/>\n\nIn 1948, the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] was established on the premises of the dockyard. In the 1950s, an Underwater Training Unit, the School of ABCD Warfare and the Damage Control School were under the administration of HMCS ''Stadacona'' and operated out of dockyard facilities. The dockyard maintained a 35-ton lift crane on Jetty 3, a 45-ton lift crane on Jetty 4 and a 50-ton lift crane on the Gun Wharf. In 1953, a seaward defence base was constructed between Pier \"B\" and the yacht anchorage in the south end of Halifax.<ref name=crowdec53/>\n\n===Current status===\nHMC Dockyard Halifax is located on the western side of Halifax Harbour at the southern end of The Narrows.  It hosts the headquarters of [[Maritime Forces Atlantic]] (MARLANT), the formal name for the Atlantic Fleet.  HMC Dockyard Halifax contains berths for Canadian and foreign warships, Formation Supply Facility, Fleet Maintenance Facility Cape Scott, shore-based training facilities as well as operations buildings for MARLANT and other organizations such as [[Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax]] (JRCC Halifax).\n\nHMC Dockyard Halifax also has an adjunct facility directly across the harbour on the [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] shoreline with jetties and various buildings, including [[Defence Research and Development Canada#Centres|Defence Research and Development Canada \u2013 Atlantic]].\n\nHMC Dockyard Halifax maintains exclusive control of several anchorage areas within the limits of Halifax Harbour and prevents civilian vessels from sailing in the vicinity of military facilities; a floating force protection boom system was constructed to prevent small vessels from unauthorized passage near warships and pierside facilities.\n\nThe original Naval Yard clock has been restored and moved to the Halifax Ferry Terminal entrance while the original Naval Yard bell is preserved at the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] in Halifax, a museum which also features a large diorama depicting the Naval Yard in 1813 at its height in the Age of Sail.  The dockyard was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1923,<ref>{{CRHP|16146|Halifax Dockyard National Historic Site of Canada|9 March 2013}}</ref> while Admiralty House was designated a National Historic Site in 1978.<ref>{{CRHP|2629|Admiralty House National Historic Site of Canada|22 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Stadacona==\n\nStadacona, referred to as HMCS ''Stadacona'' before 1968 and frequently referred to as \"Stad\", is an adjunct to HMC Dockyard located west of the waterfront in the [[North End, Halifax|North End]] of the Halifax peninsula. Prior to the arrival of the French, the location that would become Quebec was the home of a small Iroquois village called \"Stadacona\", after which the base is named.<ref>Bumsted, J. M. Canada's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook.

Stadacona is also home to the headquarters of [[Land Force Atlantic Area|5th Canadian Division]] and the [[Maritime Command Museum]].\n\nStadacona was built as the [[British Army]]'s Wellington Barracks, later known as the Nelson Barracks, as part of the Halifax Defence Complex.  The British military forces departed from Canada in 1906.  During the Second World War, the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] appropriated the site from the army and it was transformed into HMCS ''Stadacona''.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:CFB Halifax.jpg|Stadacona Entrance.

Prior to 1906, it was known as [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax]] and is one of the oldest defence establishments in Canada, having been established by the Royal Navy during the 18th century as [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax|HM Dockyard]]. While awaiting transfer to Canada, the dockyard fell into disrepair. The dockyard was formally taken over from the British government by Canada in 1910, with no changes to the layout. The dockyard in 1910 comprised a Naval Hospital, a blacksmith shop, workshops, three slipways, five jetties, residences, coal and vitualling stores and 75 other miscellaneous buildings.<ref name=crowdec53>{{cite magazine |title=Gateway to the North Atlantic |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |date=December 1953 |volume=6 |number=2 |pages=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the dockyard underwent significant expansion, acting as headquarters for the Royal Canadian Navy and as the North American headquarters for the Royal Navy. During the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion]], the dockyard was severely damaged, with many of its buildings demolished. New ones were swiftly erected for the war effort. However, following the end of the war in 1918, the number of dockyard staff was reduced significantly.<ref name=crowdec53/>\n\nIn 1939, the dockyard's were extended to the north and south. With the onset of [[World War II]], this was still not large enough and the lands of the French Cable Company in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]] were acquired and integrated into the base. In 1942, the Royal Canadian Navy acquired the Army Ordnance Depot in Dartmouth and an area on the east side of Bedford Basin was turned into an ammunition depot. During the war, new construction replaced nearly every building that had existed prior to the war. HMC Dockyard encompassed 1,255 acres after all the acquisitions. In 1943, the dockyard's lands were augmented with property in [[Renous-Quarryville|Renous, New Brunswick]] and another ammunition depot at [[Newcastle, New Brunswick]]. The Army Gun Wharf in Halifax became the victualling depot and two communications stations were established, one at [[Albro Lake, Nova Scotia|Albro]] and one at [[Newport Corner, Nova Scotia|Newport Corners]]. The barracks building that became {{HMCS|Scotian}} was erected during the war.<ref name=crowdec53/>\n\nIn 1948, the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] was established on the premises of the dockyard. In the 1950s, an Underwater Training Unit, the School of ABCD Warfare and the Damage Control School were under the administration of HMCS ''Stadacona'' and operated out of dockyard facilities. The dockyard maintained a 35-ton lift crane on Jetty 3, a 45-ton lift crane on Jetty 4 and a 50-ton lift crane on the Gun Wharf. In 1953, a seaward defence base was constructed between Pier \"B\" and the yacht anchorage in the south end of Halifax.<ref name=crowdec53/>\n\n===Current status===\nHMC Dockyard Halifax is located on the western side of Halifax Harbour at the southern end of The Narrows.  It hosts the headquarters of [[Maritime Forces Atlantic]] (MARLANT), the formal name for the Atlantic Fleet.  HMC Dockyard Halifax contains berths for Canadian and foreign warships, Formation Supply Facility, Fleet Maintenance Facility Cape Scott, shore-based training facilities as well as operations buildings for MARLANT and other organizations such as [[Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax]] (JRCC Halifax).\n\nHMC Dockyard Halifax also has an adjunct facility directly across the harbour on the [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] shoreline with jetties and various buildings, including [[Defence Research and Development Canada#Centres|Defence Research and Development Canada \u2013 Atlantic]].\n\nHMC Dockyard Halifax maintains exclusive control of several anchorage areas within the limits of Halifax Harbour and prevents civilian vessels from sailing in the vicinity of military facilities; a floating force protection boom system was constructed to prevent small vessels from unauthorized passage near warships and pierside facilities.\n\nThe original Naval Yard clock has been restored and moved to the Halifax Ferry Terminal entrance while the original Naval Yard bell is preserved at the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] in Halifax, a museum which also features a large diorama depicting the Naval Yard in 1813 at its height in the Age of Sail.  The dockyard was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1923,<ref>{{CRHP|16146|Halifax Dockyard National Historic Site of Canada|9 March 2013}}</ref> while Admiralty House was designated a National Historic Site in 1978.<ref>{{CRHP|2629|Admiralty House National Historic Site of Canada|22 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Stadacona==\n\nStadacona, referred to as HMCS ''Stadacona'' before 1968 and frequently referred to as \"Stad\", is an adjunct to HMC Dockyard located west of the waterfront in the [[North End, Halifax|North End]] of the Halifax peninsula. Prior to the arrival of the French, the location that would become Quebec was the home of a small Iroquois village called \"Stadacona\", after which the base is named.<ref>Bumsted, J. M. Canada's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2003. 35.</ref> Stadacona contains the Canadian Forces Naval Engineering School (with facilities at [[Herring Cove, Nova Scotia|Herring Cove]]/[[York Redoubt]], south of Halifax), the Canadian Forces Naval Operations School, the base hospital, the Canadian Forces Maritime Warfare Centre, and various [[mess]]es. Stadacona is also home to the headquarters of [[Land Force Atlantic Area|5th Canadian Division]] and the [[Maritime Command Museum]].\n\nStadacona was built as the [[British Army]]'s Wellington Barracks, later known as the Nelson Barracks, as part of the Halifax Defence Complex.  The British military forces departed from Canada in 1906.  During the Second World War, the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] appropriated the site from the army and it was transformed into HMCS ''Stadacona''.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:CFB Halifax.jpg|Stadacona Entrance.

DND properties that were formerly aligned to CFB Shearwater, such as the Hartlen Point Golf Course and the Shearwater Jetty, are now part of CFB Halifax.\n\n12 Wing operates from two locations with four squadrons:\n\n* Shearwater Heliport\n**[[406 Maritime Operational Training Squadron]] is an operational training squadron for training all maritime helicopter aircrew in the Canadian Forces.\n**[[423 Maritime Helicopter Squadron]] is an operational squadron at Shearwater Heliport which provides [[CH-148 Cyclone]] helicopters for Maritime Forces Atlantic warships.\n**12 Air Maintenance Squadron provides aircraft maintenance and engineering support to 12 Wing's operational squadrons.\n**Helicopter Operational Evaluation and Test Facility (HOTEF) is responsible for researching and testing state-of-the-art equipment for the CH-148 Cyclone to enable crews to operate efficiently, ashore or while deployed.\n* [[Victoria International Airport|Patricia Bay Heliport]]\n** [[443 Maritime Helicopter Squadron]] is an operational squadron which provides CH-148 Cyclone helicopters for Maritime Forces Pacific warships.\n\n==Royal Artillery Park==\n[[File:Cambridge Military Library Halifax Nova Scotia.jpg|thumbnail|[[Cambridge Military Library]], Royal Artillery Park]]\n[[Royal Artillery Park (Halifax)|Royal Artillery Park]] is a military park, which is part of CFB Halifax. In the far corner of the Royal Artillery Park, is a diminutive red brick building, the [[Cambridge Military Library]]. This building was the social and literary centre of military Halifax. The Library opened in 1817 at Grafton Street, as an alternative to the more notorious choices of city entertainment. It moved to its present location in Royal Artillery Park in 1886 and was renamed Cambridge Military Library in 1902. The library was funded in part from Customs receipts collected by the British Army during its occupation of the port of Castine, Maine, during the War of 1812.\n\n==CFAD Bedford==\nThe Canadian Forces Ammunition Depot Bedford, informally referred to as the \"Bedford Magazine\", is a major Canadian Forces property occupying the entire northern shore of [[Bedford Basin]].  It houses all of the ordnance for MARLANT vessels and has a loading jetty and several nearby anchorages.\n\n==HMCS ''Trinity''==\n\nHMCS ''Trinity'' is the organization housed at Stadacona which is tasked with maintaining MARLANT communications with vessels and other Canadian Forces and allied units, as well as developing strategic and tactical operational intelligence for unit commanders.\n\nHMCS ''Trinity'' operates two remote radio transmitter/receiver stations near Halifax:\n* [[Naval Radio Station Newport Corner]]\n* [[Naval Radio Station Mill Cove]]\n\n==Windsor Park==\nWindsor Park contains the Military Police Department, Health Promotion Services (PSP), The Auto Club, Integrated Personnel Service Centre (IPSC),the Military Family Resource Centre, CFB Curling Club as well as the Canex.\n\n==Housing==\nHousing for CFB Halifax is provided to Canadian Forces personnel and their dependants at Windsor Park, a housing area built by the Department of National Defence in the [[West End, Halifax|West End]] of Halifax.  Stadacona is home to the Atlantic Block, a barracks for single ratings. Base housing also used to be provided at [[Shannon Park, Nova Scotia|Shannon Park]] and [[Wallis Heights, Nova Scotia|Wallis Heights]] in the North End of Dartmouth, however with defence cutbacks in the 1990s, this area has been sold for civilian use. Housing is available at the [[12 Wing Shearwater]] site, which is part of CFB Halifax.  A large number of service personnel own or rent civilian property in the area.\n\n==CFB Halifax Emergency Services==\n\nThe base is equipped with their own fire and rescue service with mostly land based vehicles.<ref>https://truckfax.blogspot.com/2012/09/cfb-halifax-fire-apparatus.html</ref> [[Royal Canadian Navy]] ships are also equipped to fight fires including tugs with the auxiliary branch.\nThe City of Halifax's [[Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency]] can provide additional marine fire support if needed.\n\n==Commemorations and monuments==\n* [[Wallis Heights, Nova Scotia]] and Provo Wallis St. is named after Nova Scotian [[Provo Wallis]]\n* Stadacona is the aboriginal name for Quebec City\n* Monuments in the graveyard to {{HMS|Shannon|1806|6}} and USS ''Chesapeake''\n* Wellington Barracks named after [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], renamed Nelson Barracks named after [[Horatio Nelson]]\n* Shannon Park is named after HMS ''Shannon''\n* the Murray Building (CFNOS) is named after Admiral [[Leonard W.

Since idiolect is unique to an individual, forensic linguistics reflects that it is very unlikely that one of these files was not created by using the other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coulthard|first=Malcolm|date=|title=Author Identification, Idiolect, and Linguistic Uniqueness|url=|journal=Applied Linguistics, 2004|volume=25|pages=431-447|via=}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Detecting Idiolect with Corpora ==\nIdiolect analysis is different for an individual depending on whether the data being analyzed is from a corpus made up entirely from texts or audio files, since written work is more thought out in planning and precise in wording than in (spontaneous) speech, where informal language and conversation fillers (i.e. umm..., you know, and etc.) fill corpus samples.<ref>Chung-Hsien Wu, Chung-Han Lee, Chung-Hau Liang.

This window is kept to 7 - 10 words, with a sample that is being considered as a feature of the idiolect as being possibly +5/-5 words away from the \"head\" word of the window (which is normally in the middle)<ref>Chung-Hsien Wu, Chung-Han Lee, Chung-Hau Liang.

Produced by [[DC Films]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it was developed as <!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU.

Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.--> a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on October 1, 2021.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante.

Where there's something to do in this context with who that guy would be in this world today, and to ground him in all of these broken ways. Because at the end of the day, this guy is doing all of this to deal with trauma in his past.\"<ref name=\"NerdistReeves\" /> Pattinson had avoided major franchises since his ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films, wanting to avoid paparazzi and finding those roles dull, but signed on to play Batman because he found the character's lack of superpowers interesting.<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> He described his Batman as flawed, unlike traditional comic book characters,<ref name=\"PattinsonIGN\" /> and said his voice was inspired by his ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|Lighthouse]]'' costar [[Willem Dafoe]]'s voice in that film.<ref name=\"PattinsonDafoe\" /> In preparation, Pattinson trained in [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] with instructor and ''[[John Wick]]'' alumnus [[Rigan Machado]].<ref name=\"PattinsonJiuJitsu\" /> [[Christian Bale]], who played Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), supported Pattinson,<ref name=\"BaleSupport\" /> encouraging him to \"make [the role] his own\" and ignore critics.<ref name=\"BaleAdvice\" /> Pattinson also received advice from ''The Dark Knight Trilogy''{{'s}} director, [[Christopher Nolan]], whom he worked with on ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]''.<ref name=\"NolanAdvice\" /> [[Ben Affleck]] portrayed the character in previous [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) films<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian\" /> and was set to reprise his role before stepping down in January 2019.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n*[[Jack Griffo]] as [[Dick Grayson|Dick Grayson/Robin]]: A circus acrobat, Dick is adopted by Bruce after Falcone kills his parents in a circus event.

According to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]''. The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good.

Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> [[Greig Fraser]] is serving as cinematographer, reuniting with Reeves after they worked together on ''[[Let Me In (film)|Let Me In]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"FraserDP\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" />\n\nOn March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, with plans to resume once it was safe to do so.<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/> In April, Warner Bros. pushed the release date back until October 1, 2021.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" /> Reeves stated that around a quarter of the film had been shot prior to suspension and that he had been taking time to look over what had already been shot as well as thinking about \"what's to come.\" Reeves said that he was not planning to perform script rewrites in the meantime, but was using the opportunity to explore the film's tone.<ref name=\"DeadlineDailies\" />\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on October 1, 2021. It was originally scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021, but was pushed back as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the consequential suspension of production.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" />\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of ''Variety'' reported that key cast

Produced by [[DC Films]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it was developed as <!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU.

Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.--> a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on October 1, 2021.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante. Batman is around 30 years old in the film and neither an experienced superhero nor a beginning crime fighter.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Director [[Matt Reeves]] stated: \"I just felt like well, what I'd love to do is to get a version of this Batman character where he's not yet fully formed. Where there's something to do in this context with who that guy would be in this world today, and to ground him in all of these broken ways. Because at the end of the day, this guy is doing all of this to deal with trauma in his past.\"<ref name=\"NerdistReeves\" /> Pattinson had avoided major franchises since his ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films, wanting to avoid paparazzi and finding those roles dull, but signed on to play Batman because he found the character's lack of superpowers interesting.<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> He described his Batman as flawed, unlike traditional comic book characters,<ref name=\"PattinsonIGN\" /> and said his voice was inspired by his ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|Lighthouse]]'' costar [[Willem Dafoe]]'s voice in that film.<ref name=\"PattinsonDafoe\" /> In preparation, Pattinson trained in [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] with instructor and ''[[John Wick]]'' alumnus [[Rigan Machado]].<ref name=\"PattinsonJiuJitsu\" /> [[Christian Bale]], who played Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), supported Pattinson,<ref name=\"BaleSupport\" /> encouraging him to \"make [the role] his own\" and ignore critics.<ref name=\"BaleAdvice\" /> Pattinson also received advice from ''The Dark Knight Trilogy''{{'s}} director, [[Christopher Nolan]], whom he worked with on ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]''.<ref name=\"NolanAdvice\" /> [[Ben Affleck]] portrayed the character in previous [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) films<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian\" /> and was set to reprise his role before stepping down in January 2019.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n*[[Jack Griffo]] as [[Dick Grayson|Dick Grayson/Robin]]: A circus acrobat, Dick is adopted by Bruce after Falcone kills his parents in a circus event.

According to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]''. The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through again.\"<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:Robert Pattinson Premiere of The Lost City of Z at Zoo Palast Berlinale 2017 02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Pattinson]] (pictured in 2017) was cast to replace Affleck in May 2019]]\nBy May 2019, [[Robert Pattinson]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Armie Hammer]], and [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] were on the shortlist to replace Affleck as Batman, Pattinson being the frontrunner.<ref name=\"PattinsonFrontrunner\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonEyed\" /><ref name=\"BatmanShortlist\" /> Reeves began to consider Pattinson early in development, but was unsure if he would want to take the part and did not contact him.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Pattinson's avoidance of \"big studio franchise films\" meant he had not appeared in any of rival [[Marvel Studios]]' projects, something that made him desirable to Warner Bros. Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious.

Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros.

It was originally scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021, but was pushed back as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the consequential suspension of production.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\"
