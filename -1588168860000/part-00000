He is currently in his second stint as the head football coach at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he coached from 1988 until departing in 1997 to become coach at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]]. He was recently a college football commentator for [[ESPN]]. In January 2018, Brown was selected to enter the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/22002184|title=Beamer, Brown among 13 to enter Hall of Fame|date=January 8, 2018|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref> In November 2018, Brown took the vacant job at North Carolina, replacing [[Larry Fedora]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://247sports.com/college/north-carolina/Article/Sources-Mack-Brown-Returning-to-UNC-Football-125364206/|title=Sources: Mack Brown Returning to UNC|website=InsideCarolina.com|accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPrior to his head coach position at Texas, Brown was head coach at [[Appalachian State University|Appalachian State]], [[Tulane University|Tulane]], and North Carolina.

During his teenage years, he attended Putnam County High School. Brown's family had a long history with football. His grandfather, Eddie Watson, was an athlete at [[Tennessee Technological University|Tennessee Tech]] and a coach at Putnam County High School for more than three decades. His father, Melvin Brown, was also a coach and an administrator. Mack's older brother [[Watson Brown|Watson]] also coached, and was the head football coach at a total of six Division I football schools, ending his career with their hometown school, [[Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles football|Tennessee Tech]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/2015/12/02/report-watson-brown-tech/76668686/|title=Watson Brown retires as a college football coach|publisher=}}</ref> Mack attended [[Vanderbilt University]] before attending [[Florida State University]] and graduating in 1974. He later received a graduate degree from the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] in 1976.

From 1975 to 1977, he was the wide receivers coach at [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Miss]]. This was followed by a one-year stint as wide receivers coach at [[Memphis Tigers football|Memphis State]].\n\nFor the 1979 season, he joined the staff of [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]], again as a wide receivers coach, before a promotion to [[offensive coordinator]]. In 1980, after going 3\u20138 the year prior, Iowa State improved their record to 6\u20135 in large part due to [[running back]] Dwayne Crutchfield (1,312 yards with 11 TD) and the rest of Brown's offense. The team scored 108 more points that year than they had in 1979. In 1981, the team finished with a 5\u20135\u20131 record, despite starting out with a record of 5\u20131\u20131. RB Dwayne Crutchfield was again a key focal point in Brown's offense and ran for 1,189 yards with 17 TD.\n\nIn 1982, Brown moved to [[Louisiana State Tigers football|LSU]] as the [[quarterback]]s coach. The LSU Tigers improved their record to 8\u20133\u20131 from 3\u20137\u20131 the year prior in large part due to Brown's coaching of [[quarterback]] [[Alan Risher]], who threw for 1,834 yards with 17 TD and 8 INT. He also completed 63.7% of his pass attempts. Risher had thrown 14 TD in the previous two seasons combined before Brown's arrival.\n\n===Appalachian State===\nBrown's first head coaching job came in 1983 when he led [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State]] to a 6\u20135 record. In December 1983, he was seriously considered for the head coaching position at [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] which had been vacated after [[Jerry Stovall]] was fired, but the position instead went to [[Miami Dolphins]] defensive coordinator [[Bill Arnsparger]].\n\n===Oklahoma===\nBrown moved back to a role as offensive coordinator for the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]] during the [[1984 Oklahoma Sooners football team|1984 season]] under head coach [[Barry Switzer]]. Oklahoma would run for 2,376 yards as a team that season, averaging 216 yards a game. QB [[Danny Bradley]] also would throw for nearly 1,000 yards with 8 TD vs 5 INT. RBs [[Lydell Carr]], [[Steve Sewell]], and [[Spencer Tillman]] combined to run for 1,651 yards with 12 TD.\n\n===Tulane===\nBrown's second head coaching position came with [[Tulane Green Wave football|Tulane]] in 1985, where he also became the school's athletic director in the wake of a [[point shaving]] scandal which led to the shutdown of the [[Tulane Green Wave men's basketball|men's basketball]] program. Despite a slow start (a 1\u201310 record in his first year), he made gradual improvement, leading the Green Wave to a 4\u20137 record in 1986 and, in 1987, to a 6\u20136 record and a trip to the [[1987 Independence Bowl|Independence Bowl]], Tulane's fifth bowl game in over 40 years and last until 1998.\n\n===North Carolina===\nIn 1988, Brown was named the head coach at [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]]. Brown's first two teams finished with identical 1\u201310 records, the worst two seasons that the Tar Heels have suffered on the field in modern times.  However, the next two years saw a relatively quick return to respectability. In 1990, the Tar Heels finished 6\u20134\u20131. By comparison, the Tar Heels had won only seven games in the previous three years. Included in the 1990 total was a tie of [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] that proved to be the Yellow Jackets' only non-win [[1990 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|that season]] en route to a share of the national championship. In 1991, the Tar Heels finished 7\u20134, narrowly missing a bowl bid.\n\nEverything finally came together for the Tar Heels in 1992. They finished 8\u20133 in the regular season and second in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], and with a victory over [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]] in the [[Peach Bowl]], they finished the season at 9\u20133. The Peach Bowl was the program's first bowl appearance since 1986 and their first bowl win since 1982. They also notched their first appearance in a final Top 25 poll since 1982.\n\nThe 1992 season was the start of UNC's most successful period since the [[Charlie Justice (American football player)|Charlie Justice]] era in the late 1940s. Brown coached the Tar Heels to five consecutive bowl games, including UNC's only two [[New Year's Day]] bowl games in more than half a century (or three, if one counts the 1992\u201393 Peach Bowl, which was played the day after New Year's to avoid a conflict with the [[Sugar Bowl]]). They were ranked in the AP Top 25 every week from October 1992 through the start of the 1995 season. They finished in the final rankings in four out of five years, including two straight appearances in the top 10. They also won 10 regular-season games in 1993 and 1997, only the second and third times the Tar Heels have accomplished this. Largely due to [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] joining the league in 1992, Brown was unable to win an ACC title\u2014something the Tar Heels haven't done since 1980.\n\nBrown's time at UNC also saw renewed popularity for a team that had long played in the shadow of the school's powerhouse [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|basketball team]]. Games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]] were almost always sold out, the highlight being a [[standing-room only]] crowd of 62,000 that watched the Tar Heels play Florida State in 1997, still the largest crowd to watch a college football game on campus in the state of North Carolina. Brown also spearheaded a major renovation to Kenan Stadium that featured upgraded team facilities and an expansion to 60,000 seats.\n\nNot long after the end of the 1997 season, Brown accepted the head coaching job at Texas. His defensive coordinator, [[Carl Torbush]], coached the Tar Heels in that year's [[1998 Gator Bowl|Gator Bowl]]. North Carolina credits the 1997 regular season to Brown and the Gator Bowl to Torbush.\n\n===Texas===\n{{main|Texas Longhorns football under Mack Brown}}\nIn his early years at UT, Brown was referred to as \"Coach February,\" due to his success in bringing in high talent recruits.<ref name=\"Coach February\">{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2005/12/29/RoseBowl2006/Texas.Brown.Could.Shake.coach.February.Title.Forever-1270005.shtml | title=Texas' Brown could shake \"Coach February\" title forever | work=Daily Texan | publisher=Texas Student Media | date=December 29, 2005 | accessdate=October 31, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> His detractors felt that with all the resources at his disposal at Texas, combined with the talent he was recruiting from high school programs, that he should have more to show for it than appearances in the [[Holiday Bowl]] or [[Cotton Bowl Classic]]. They felt that he should be playing for Big 12 titles or even [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|National Championships]] instead.\n\nIn five&nbsp;of the first seven&nbsp;seasons under Brown, the Longhorns were all but eliminated from either of these two goals due to losses in October to Big 12 rival [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]]. Since the two&nbsp;teams played in the same division of the Big 12, a loss by Texas to Oklahoma meant that Texas could not win the south division of the conference unless Oklahoma lost at least two conference games. However, in 1999 Brown led Texas to their second Big 12 title game where they were beaten by a higher ranked [[1999 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] team that they had beaten earlier in the year. In 2001, Brown took Texas to their 3rd Big 12 title game. In that year's campaign, the Longhorns lost to the [[2001 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Sooners]], but were given another chance when the Sooners lost to both [[2001 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] and [[2001 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]]. Texas lost the [[Big 12 Championship Game]] to [[2001 Colorado Buffaloes football team|Colorado]], a school they had beaten by a substantial margin earlier in the year. Many felt that Texas would have played in the [[BCS National Championship Game|BCS Championship game]] had they beaten Colorado. A similar opportunity presented itself in 2002. After Oklahoma beat Texas, they lost to [[2002 Texas A&M Aggies football team|Texas A&M]] and [[2002 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]]. However, Texas suffered a loss to [[2002 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Texas Tech]], so they did not make the championship game.\n\nIn [[2003 Texas Longhorns football team|2003]], Texas finished the regular season with a 10\u20132 regular season record, and most observers felt they had the resume to reach their first BCS bowl under Brown. However, when South Champion (and #1 ranked) [[2003 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] lost to North Champion [[2003 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]] in the Big 12 championship game, Kansas State received the Big 12 Conference's automatic BCS bid as conference champion and joined Oklahoma in the BCS. The BCS rules specified that no more than two teams from a single conference could receive bids. Texas was frozen out.\n\nAlthough Brown consistently led the Longhorns to a bowl game to cap off each season in his first six years, he was not able to lead them to a [[Bowl Championship Series]] game, having to settle each year for the [[Holiday Bowl]] or [[Cotton Bowl Classic]]. His record in these games was 3\u20133, with two of the three losses coming at the hands of supposedly inferior teams as judged by the rankings headed into the games.\n\n====2004 season====\n{{main|2004 Texas Longhorns football team}}\nIn 2004, the Longhorns began the season with a #7 ranking nationally and had risen to #5 coming into the annual matchup with then #2 Oklahoma in the [[Red River Shootout]]. Oklahoma shutout the Longhorns 12\u20130. Texas dropped to #9, before rebounding with wins over #24 [[2004 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri]], 28\u201320, at #24 Texas Tech, 51\u201321, and at Colorado, 31\u20137. Then Texas set a record for the largest come from-behind-win in school history, beating #19 Oklahoma State, 56\u201335, after falling behind 35\u20137. After this performance, Texas again fell behind against [[2004 Kansas Jayhawks football team|Kansas]], but squeaked out a win 27\u201323. Kansas head coach [[Mark Mangino]] stirred up controversy by claiming that the officials were biased in favor of Texas because the conference wanted a second team in a BCS bowl game and Texas was in position to gain an at-large BCS bid. The series of victories brought Texas back up to #5 in the rankings as they welcomed arch-rival Texas A&M to Austin and won 26\u201313. However, [[2004 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] stood undefeated, which meant the Sooners would represent the Big 12 South in the championship game against a much lower ranked team from the North Division. Once again, the loss to Oklahoma had kept Texas out of playing for a national or conference title, and had seemingly destined them to a non-BCS bowl as well.\n\nWith Texas and [[2004 California Golden Bears football team|California]] both vying for a spot in the [[2005 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]], Brown received criticism for [[BCS controversies#Lobbying for votes|lobbying on behalf of his team]], which many perceived was a factor in UT's Rose Bowl invitation. Cal was denied what would have been their first Rose Bowl bid since 1958. \"I thought it was a little classless how Coach Brown was begging for votes,\" Cal quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] told reporters in Berkeley. \"I think a team's record and the way you play should speak for itself.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2004-12-05-bcs-pairings_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=USC, Oklahoma get Orange Bowl berths; Auburn falls short | first1=Kelly | last1=Whiteside | date=December 6, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> Cal's only loss was a 23\u201317 nailbiter on the road at USC. Cal dominated the game statistically, more than doubling USC in total yardage. The Golden Bears had a first-and-goal from the 9-yard-line with roughly one minute left in the fourth quarter, but could not convert. Meanwhile, Texas' lone loss was a 12\u20130 defeat to Oklahoma on a neutral field. USC and Oklahoma, the teams Cal and Texas lost to, respectively, went on to play in the national championship. USC blew out Oklahoma 55\u201319 in that game. However, Texas fans point to the Holiday Bowl, where Cal was dealt a 45\u201331 loss at the hands of No. 23 Texas Tech, a team which Texas defeated 51\u201321 earlier in the season.\n\nBrown's Longhorns accepted the bid to play in the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]]. It was the first visit by the Longhorns, due mainly to the fact that the Rose Bowl traditionally pitted the winner of the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10]] against the winner of the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]]. Texas' opponent was [[2004 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], whom Texas was playing for the very first time. Texas won the game, 38\u201337, on a last second field goal by kicker [[Dusty Mangum]] in what had been called one of the greatest Rose Bowl games of all time.<ref name=\"Hollywood ending\">{{cite news|url=http://texas.scout.com/2/336787.html |title=Hollywood ending! |publisher=[[College Football News]] |author=Frisbie, Bill |date=January 2, 2006 |accessdate=December 13, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814120551/http://texas.scout.com/2/336787.html |archivedate=August 14, 2007 |df= }}</ref><ref>\"Kicked into Legend: Rose-winning boot elevated Mangum from a footnote,\" ''Austin-American Statesman'', January 9, 2005</ref><ref>\"Mangum's game-winning field goal caps instant classic,\" ''The Daily Texan'', January 18, 2005</ref><ref>\"Texas coach receives unexpected phone call from President,\" ''The Daily Texan'', January 6, 2005</ref><ref>\"Senate pays homage to Horns; Sen.

Led by [[quarterback]] [[Vince Young]], Texas defeated their early opponents easily, including a decisive 45\u201312 victory over [[2005 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]]. That marked the 6th time the Longhorns entered the contest ranked 2nd nationally, and they have won all six times. With the win, Texas started the season 5\u20130 for the first time since 1983. That season was the last time UT had national title hopes, when they ended the regular season 11\u20130 before losing to Georgia in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic]].\n\nAfter a win over previously undefeated Texas Tech, Texas moved into first place in the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) standings for the first time since its creation. However, the following week Texas fell back down to #2 in the BCS poll, while USC moved back into the #1 spot. Both teams won all their remaining games, with USC and Texas remaining ranked #1 and #2 throughout the rest of the regular season.\n\nThe two teams finally met in the BCS National Championship Game at the [[2006 Rose Bowl]] in a highly anticipated matchup. Texas and USC were the only two unbeaten [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-A]] (now FBS) teams (Auburn was also undefeated in 2004), and the game marked the first time two teams averaging over 50 points per game had met. The combined 53-game win streak was an NCAA record for teams playing each other and the game was also the first to have teams ranked first and second in every iteration of the BCS standings. The game also featured USC's two [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman]] winners ([[Reggie Bush]], [[Matt Leinart]]) as well as a Heisman finalist in Vince Young. In an up and down game, Texas eventually defeated USC 41-38, highlighted by a 4th and 5 touchdown run and 2 point conversion by [[Vince Young]] in the final minute, giving the longhorns their first national championship in 34 years.\n\n====2006 season====\n{{main|2006 Texas Longhorns football team}}\nAfter defeating USC the year before in the BCS Championship game to finish with the undisputed #1 ranking, Texas began the 2006 season ranked #2 in the optimistic pre-season polls, having replaced the NFL-departed quarterback Vince Young with freshman [[Colt McCoy]]. The Longhorns however lost convincingly to #1 ranked Ohio State in the second game of the season in Austin. The Horns quickly rebounded to win seven straight games (including a second straight win over nemesis Oklahoma in the Red River Shootout) to climb into the Big 12 South driver's seat and entertain thoughts of a rematch with Ohio State in the national championship, but in the season's 10th game McCoy was injured and Texas was shocked on the road at Kansas State. After the loss, the Horns returned home still needing a final win to clinch the Big 12 South, and even though McCoy returned for the annual matchup Texas was again shocked, losing, 12\u20137, to intrastate rival Texas A&M. The loss snapped UT's six-game winning streak over the Aggies and the horns settled for the Alamo Bowl where Texas defeated a 6\u20136 Iowa team in a close game to cap off a 10 win season.\n\n====2007 season====\n{{main|2007 Texas Longhorns football team}}\nMack Brown entered his 10th season as the head coach of the Texas Longhorns with a record of 93\u201322 setting a new mark above 0.8 winning percentage (.809), the best in Longhorn history.

In the home opener a week later, the Tar Heels defeated the Miami Hurricanes on a last-minute touchdown. Two weeks later, they nearly upset #1 ranked and defending national champion Clemson, but what would have been the go-ahead two-point conversion failed. It proved to be the only close game Clemson had in the regular season.\n\nThe following week, Brown's Tar Heels defeated Georgia Tech 38-22. It was Brown's 72nd win with the Tar Heels, tying [[Dick Crum (American football)|Dick Crum]] as the winningest coach in school history. He broke the record two weeks later with a 20-17 victory over Duke.  On November 30th, UNC defeated NC State 41-10 to become bowl eligible for the first time since 2016.

They lent their name along with legendary UT QB [[James Street (American football)|James Street]] to the First Annual James Street/Mack Brown Golf Tournament benefiting The Rise School.

He is currently in his second stint as the head football coach at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he coached from 1988 until departing in 1997 to become coach at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]]. He was recently a college football commentator for [[ESPN]]. In January 2018, Brown was selected to enter the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/22002184|title=Beamer, Brown among 13 to enter Hall of Fame|date=January 8, 2018|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref> In November 2018, Brown took the vacant job at North Carolina, replacing [[Larry Fedora]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://247sports.com/college/north-carolina/Article/Sources-Mack-Brown-Returning-to-UNC-Football-125364206/|title=Sources: Mack Brown Returning to UNC|website=InsideCarolina.com|accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPrior to his head coach position at Texas, Brown was head coach at [[Appalachian State University|Appalachian State]], [[Tulane University|Tulane]], and North Carolina. Brown is credited with revitalizing the Texas and North Carolina football programs. The Longhorns beat the [[USC Trojans football|University of Southern California]] in the 2006 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] at [[Ohio Stadium|The Horseshoe]] in September 2005, and conference rival [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] in 1998, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2013. The 2005 season was capped off by victories over [[2005 Colorado Buffaloes football team|Colorado]] and [[2005 USC Trojans football team|USC]] to win the [[Big 12 Conference]] and [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national]] championships, respectively.

During his teenage years, he attended Putnam County High School. Brown's family had a long history with football. His grandfather, Eddie Watson, was an athlete at [[Tennessee Technological University|Tennessee Tech]] and a coach at Putnam County High School for more than three decades. His father, Melvin Brown, was also a coach and an administrator. Mack's older brother [[Watson Brown|Watson]] also coached, and was the head football coach at a total of six Division I football schools, ending his career with their hometown school, [[Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles football|Tennessee Tech]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/2015/12/02/report-watson-brown-tech/76668686/|title=Watson Brown retires as a college football coach|publisher=}}</ref> Mack attended [[Vanderbilt University]] before attending [[Florida State University]] and graduating in 1974. He later received a graduate degree from the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] in 1976. During his undergraduate years, Brown was a member of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity.<ref name=SAE>[http://www.sae.net/index.as?r=fraternity&sr=facts&ssr=facts Facts and History]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Sigma Alpha Epsilon.</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nBrown was a three-sport star at Putnam County High School, playing football, basketball and baseball.

From 1975 to 1977, he was the wide receivers coach at [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Miss]]. This was followed by a one-year stint as wide receivers coach at [[Memphis Tigers football|Memphis State]].\n\nFor the 1979 season, he joined the staff of [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]], again as a wide receivers coach, before a promotion to [[offensive coordinator]]. In 1980, after going 3\u20138 the year prior, Iowa State improved their record to 6\u20135 in large part due to [[running back]] Dwayne Crutchfield (1,312 yards with 11 TD) and the rest of Brown's offense. The team scored 108 more points that year than they had in 1979. In 1981, the team finished with a 5\u20135\u20131 record, despite starting out with a record of 5\u20131\u20131. RB Dwayne Crutchfield was again a key focal point in Brown's offense and ran for 1,189 yards with 17 TD.\n\nIn 1982, Brown moved to [[Louisiana State Tigers football|LSU]] as the [[quarterback]]s coach. The LSU Tigers improved their record to 8\u20133\u20131 from 3\u20137\u20131 the year prior in large part due to Brown's coaching of [[quarterback]] [[Alan Risher]], who threw for 1,834 yards with 17 TD and 8 INT. He also completed 63.7% of his pass attempts. Risher had thrown 14 TD in the previous two seasons combined before Brown's arrival.\n\n===Appalachian State===\nBrown's first head coaching job came in 1983 when he led [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State]] to a 6\u20135 record. In December 1983, he was seriously considered for the head coaching position at [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] which had been vacated after [[Jerry Stovall]] was fired, but the position instead went to [[Miami Dolphins]] defensive coordinator [[Bill Arnsparger]].\n\n===Oklahoma===\nBrown moved back to a role as offensive coordinator for the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]] during the [[1984 Oklahoma Sooners football team|1984 season]] under head coach [[Barry Switzer]]. Oklahoma would run for 2,376 yards as a team that season, averaging 216 yards a game. QB [[Danny Bradley]] also would throw for nearly 1,000 yards with 8 TD vs 5 INT. RBs [[Lydell Carr]], [[Steve Sewell]], and [[Spencer Tillman]] combined to run for 1,651 yards with 12 TD.\n\n===Tulane===\nBrown's second head coaching position came with [[Tulane Green Wave football|Tulane]] in 1985, where he also became the school's athletic director in the wake of a [[point shaving]] scandal which led to the shutdown of the [[Tulane Green Wave men's basketball|men's basketball]] program. Despite a slow start (a 1\u201310 record in his first year), he made gradual improvement, leading the Green Wave to a 4\u20137 record in 1986 and, in 1987, to a 6\u20136 record and a trip to the [[1987 Independence Bowl|Independence Bowl]], Tulane's fifth bowl game in over 40 years and last until 1998.\n\n===North Carolina===\nIn 1988, Brown was named the head coach at [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]]. Brown's first two teams finished with identical 1\u201310 records, the worst two seasons that the Tar Heels have suffered on the field in modern times.  However, the next two years saw a relatively quick return to respectability. In 1990, the Tar Heels finished 6\u20134\u20131. By comparison, the Tar Heels had won only seven games in the previous three years. Included in the 1990 total was a tie of [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] that proved to be the Yellow Jackets' only non-win [[1990 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|that season]] en route to a share of the national championship. In 1991, the Tar Heels finished 7\u20134, narrowly missing a bowl bid.\n\nEverything finally came together for the Tar Heels in 1992. They finished 8\u20133 in the regular season and second in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], and with a victory over [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]] in the [[Peach Bowl]], they finished the season at 9\u20133. The Peach Bowl was the program's first bowl appearance since 1986 and their first bowl win since 1982. They also notched their first appearance in a final Top 25 poll since 1982.\n\nThe 1992 season was the start of UNC's most successful period since the [[Charlie Justice (American football player)|Charlie Justice]] era in the late 1940s. Brown coached the Tar Heels to five consecutive bowl games, including UNC's only two [[New Year's Day]] bowl games in more than half a century (or three, if one counts the 1992\u201393 Peach Bowl, which was played the day after New Year's to avoid a conflict with the [[Sugar Bowl]]). They were ranked in the AP Top 25 every week from October 1992 through the start of the 1995 season. They finished in the final rankings in four out of five years, including two straight appearances in the top 10. They also won 10 regular-season games in 1993 and 1997, only the second and third times the Tar Heels have accomplished this. Largely due to [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] joining the league in 1992, Brown was unable to win an ACC title\u2014something the Tar Heels haven't done since 1980.\n\nBrown's time at UNC also saw renewed popularity for a team that had long played in the shadow of the school's powerhouse [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|basketball team]]. Games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]] were almost always sold out, the highlight being a [[standing-room only]] crowd of 62,000 that watched the Tar Heels play Florida State in 1997, still the largest crowd to watch a college football game on campus in the state of North Carolina. Brown also spearheaded a major renovation to Kenan Stadium that featured upgraded team facilities and an expansion to 60,000 seats.\n\nNot long after the end of the 1997 season, Brown accepted the head coaching job at Texas. His defensive coordinator, [[Carl Torbush]], coached the Tar Heels in that year's [[1998 Gator Bowl|Gator Bowl]]. North Carolina credits the 1997 regular season to Brown and the Gator Bowl to Torbush.\n\n===Texas===\n{{main|Texas Longhorns football under Mack Brown}}\nIn his early years at UT, Brown was referred to as \"Coach February,\" due to his success in bringing in high talent recruits.<ref name=\"Coach February\">{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2005/12/29/RoseBowl2006/Texas.Brown.Could.Shake.coach.February.Title.Forever-1270005.shtml | title=Texas' Brown could shake \"Coach February\" title forever | work=Daily Texan | publisher=Texas Student Media | date=December 29, 2005 | accessdate=October 31, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> His detractors felt that with all the resources at his disposal at Texas, combined with the talent he was recruiting from high school programs, that he should have more to show for it than appearances in the [[Holiday Bowl]] or [[Cotton Bowl Classic]]. They felt that he should be playing for Big 12 titles or even [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|National Championships]] instead.\n\nIn five&nbsp;of the first seven&nbsp;seasons under Brown, the Longhorns were all but eliminated from either of these two goals due to losses in October to Big 12 rival [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]]. Since the two&nbsp;teams played in the same division of the Big 12, a loss by Texas to Oklahoma meant that Texas could not win the south division of the conference unless Oklahoma lost at least two conference games. However, in 1999 Brown led Texas to their second Big 12 title game where they were beaten by a higher ranked [[1999 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] team that they had beaten earlier in the year. In 2001, Brown took Texas to their 3rd Big 12 title game. In that year's campaign, the Longhorns lost to the [[2001 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Sooners]], but were given another chance when the Sooners lost to both [[2001 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] and [[2001 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]]. Texas lost the [[Big 12 Championship Game]] to [[2001 Colorado Buffaloes football team|Colorado]], a school they had beaten by a substantial margin earlier in the year. Many felt that Texas would have played in the [[BCS National Championship Game|BCS Championship game]] had they beaten Colorado. A similar opportunity presented itself in 2002. After Oklahoma beat Texas, they lost to [[2002 Texas A&M Aggies football team|Texas A&M]] and [[2002 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]]. However, Texas suffered a loss to [[2002 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Texas Tech]], so they did not make the championship game.\n\nIn [[2003 Texas Longhorns football team|2003]], Texas finished the regular season with a 10\u20132 regular season record, and most observers felt they had the resume to reach their first BCS bowl under Brown. However, when South Champion (and #1 ranked) [[2003 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] lost to North Champion [[2003 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]] in the Big 12 championship game, Kansas State received the Big 12 Conference's automatic BCS bid as conference champion and joined Oklahoma in the BCS. The BCS rules specified that no more than two teams from a single conference could receive bids. Texas was frozen out.\n\nAlthough Brown consistently led the Longhorns to a bowl game to cap off each season in his first six years, he was not able to lead them to a [[Bowl Championship Series]] game, having to settle each year for the [[Holiday Bowl]] or [[Cotton Bowl Classic]]. His record in these games was 3\u20133, with two of the three losses coming at the hands of supposedly inferior teams as judged by the rankings headed into the games.\n\n====2004 season====\n{{main|2004 Texas Longhorns football team}}\nIn 2004, the Longhorns began the season with a #7 ranking nationally and had risen to #5 coming into the annual matchup with then #2 Oklahoma in the [[Red River Shootout]]. Oklahoma shutout the Longhorns 12\u20130. Texas dropped to #9, before rebounding with wins over #24 [[2004 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri]], 28\u201320, at #24 Texas Tech, 51\u201321, and at Colorado, 31\u20137. Then Texas set a record for the largest come from-behind-win in school history, beating #19 Oklahoma State, 56\u201335, after falling behind 35\u20137. After this performance, Texas again fell behind against [[2004 Kansas Jayhawks football team|Kansas]], but squeaked out a win 27\u201323. Kansas head coach [[Mark Mangino]] stirred up controversy by claiming that the officials were biased in favor of Texas because the conference wanted a second team in a BCS bowl game and Texas was in position to gain an at-large BCS bid. The series of victories brought Texas back up to #5 in the rankings as they welcomed arch-rival Texas A&M to Austin and won 26\u201313. However, [[2004 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] stood undefeated, which meant the Sooners would represent the Big 12 South in the championship game against a much lower ranked team from the North Division. Once again, the loss to Oklahoma had kept Texas out of playing for a national or conference title, and had seemingly destined them to a non-BCS bowl as well.\n\nWith Texas and [[2004 California Golden Bears football team|California]] both vying for a spot in the [[2005 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]], Brown received criticism for [[BCS controversies#Lobbying for votes|lobbying on behalf of his team]], which many perceived was a factor in UT's Rose Bowl invitation. Cal was denied what would have been their first Rose Bowl bid since 1958. \"I thought it was a little classless how Coach Brown was begging for votes,\" Cal quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] told reporters in Berkeley. \"I think a team's record and the way you play should speak for itself.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2004-12-05-bcs-pairings_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=USC, Oklahoma get Orange Bowl berths; Auburn falls short | first1=Kelly | last1=Whiteside | date=December 6, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> Cal's only loss was a 23\u201317 nailbiter on the road at USC. Cal dominated the game statistically, more than doubling USC in total yardage. The Golden Bears had a first-and-goal from the 9-yard-line with roughly one minute left in the fourth quarter, but could not convert. Meanwhile, Texas' lone loss was a 12\u20130 defeat to Oklahoma on a neutral field. USC and Oklahoma, the teams Cal and Texas lost to, respectively, went on to play in the national championship. USC blew out Oklahoma 55\u201319 in that game. However, Texas fans point to the Holiday Bowl, where Cal was dealt a 45\u201331 loss at the hands of No. 23 Texas Tech, a team which Texas defeated 51\u201321 earlier in the season.\n\nBrown's Longhorns accepted the bid to play in the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]]. It was the first visit by the Longhorns, due mainly to the fact that the Rose Bowl traditionally pitted the winner of the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10]] against the winner of the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]]. Texas' opponent was [[2004 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], whom Texas was playing for the very first time. Texas won the game, 38\u201337, on a last second field goal by kicker [[Dusty Mangum]] in what had been called one of the greatest Rose Bowl games of all time.<ref name=\"Hollywood ending\">{{cite news|url=http://texas.scout.com/2/336787.html |title=Hollywood ending! |publisher=[[College Football News]] |author=Frisbie, Bill |date=January 2, 2006 |accessdate=December 13, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814120551/http://texas.scout.com/2/336787.html |archivedate=August 14, 2007 |df= }}</ref><ref>\"Kicked into Legend: Rose-winning boot elevated Mangum from a footnote,\" ''Austin-American Statesman'', January 9, 2005</ref><ref>\"Mangum's game-winning field goal caps instant classic,\" ''The Daily Texan'', January 18, 2005</ref><ref>\"Texas coach receives unexpected phone call from President,\" ''The Daily Texan'', January 6, 2005</ref><ref>\"Senate pays homage to Horns; Sen.

Led by [[quarterback]] [[Vince Young]], Texas defeated their early opponents easily, including a decisive 45\u201312 victory over [[2005 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]]. That marked the 6th time the Longhorns entered the contest ranked 2nd nationally, and they have won all six times. With the win, Texas started the season 5\u20130 for the first time since 1983. That season was the last time UT had national title hopes, when they ended the regular season 11\u20130 before losing to Georgia in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic]].\n\nAfter a win over previously undefeated Texas Tech, Texas moved into first place in the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) standings for the first time since its creation. However, the following week Texas fell back down to #2 in the BCS poll, while USC moved back into the #1 spot. Both teams won all their remaining games, with USC and Texas remaining ranked #1 and #2 throughout the rest of the regular season.\n\nThe two teams finally met in the BCS National Championship Game at the [[2006 Rose Bowl]] in a highly anticipated matchup. Texas and USC were the only two unbeaten [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-A]] (now FBS) teams (Auburn was also undefeated in 2004), and the game marked the first time two teams averaging over 50 points per game had met. The combined 53-game win streak was an NCAA record for teams playing each other and the game was also the first to have teams ranked first and second in every iteration of the BCS standings. The game also featured USC's two [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman]] winners ([[Reggie Bush]], [[Matt Leinart]]) as well as a Heisman finalist in Vince Young. In an up and down game, Texas eventually defeated USC 41-38, highlighted by a 4th and 5 touchdown run and 2 point conversion by [[Vince Young]] in the final minute, giving the longhorns their first national championship in 34 years.\n\n====2006 season====\n{{main|2006 Texas Longhorns football team}}\nAfter defeating USC the year before in the BCS Championship game to finish with the undisputed #1 ranking, Texas began the 2006 season ranked #2 in the optimistic pre-season polls, having replaced the NFL-departed quarterback Vince Young with freshman [[Colt McCoy]]. The Longhorns however lost convincingly to #1 ranked Ohio State in the second game of the season in Austin. The Horns quickly rebounded to win seven straight games (including a second straight win over nemesis Oklahoma in the Red River Shootout) to climb into the Big 12 South driver's seat and entertain thoughts of a rematch with Ohio State in the national championship, but in the season's 10th game McCoy was injured and Texas was shocked on the road at Kansas State. After the loss, the Horns returned home still needing a final win to clinch the Big 12 South, and even though McCoy returned for the annual matchup Texas was again shocked, losing, 12\u20137, to intrastate rival Texas A&M. The loss snapped UT's six-game winning streak over the Aggies and the horns settled for the Alamo Bowl where Texas defeated a 6\u20136 Iowa team in a close game to cap off a 10 win season.\n\n====2007 season====\n{{main|2007 Texas Longhorns football team}}\nMack Brown entered his 10th season as the head coach of the Texas Longhorns with a record of 93\u201322 setting a new mark above 0.8 winning percentage (.809), the best in Longhorn history. The [[2007 Texas Longhorns football team]] began play ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage, and were ranked in the Top 10 by [[2007 NCAA Division I-BS football rankings|numerous pre-season polls]].\n\nDespite expectations, prior to and during the season a total of seven&nbsp;UT players were [[2007 Texas Longhorns football suspensions|suspended for various infractions]].<ref name=\"Law Seeks Out\">{{cite news|url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2007/08/03/Sports/Law-Seeks.Out.Texas.Football.Again-2929321.shtml |title=Law seeks out Texas football, again |publisher=The Daily Texan |author=Jankowski, Philip |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184751/http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2007/08/03/Sports/Law-Seeks.Out.Texas.Football.Again-2929321.shtml |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"miss3\">{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2962285 | title=Melton, Kindle to miss first three games of season for DWI charges | publisher=Associated Press | date=August 5, 2007 | accessdate=August 6, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"suspended indefinitely\">{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/longhorns/entries/2007/08/03/jones_suspended_indefinitely.html |title=Jones suspended indefinitely |publisher=Austin American-Statesman |author=Halliburton, Suzanne |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122000/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/longhorns/entries/2007/08/03/jones_suspended_indefinitely.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"In custody\">{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/longhorns/entries/2007/08/03/andre_jones_in_custody_on_robbery_charge.html |title=Andre Jones in custody on robbery charge |author=Trubow, Alan |publisher=Austin American-Statesman |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121829/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/longhorns/entries/2007/08/03/andre_jones_in_custody_on_robbery_charge.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}</ref> Brown said \u201cI am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer.

However, Texas played a maximum of only 11 games per season up until 1975 and only 12 games per season up until 1995 (including conference championship and bowl game).\n*The Longhorns under Brown featured the only 3,000-yard passer, the only 2,000-yard rusher, the only 1,000-yard receivers and the only 1,000-yard passer/rusher in UT history (again, note the longer seasons in recent decades).\n*Brown is one of only three head coaches in FBS history to coach players who recorded a 2,000-yard rushing season, a 1,000-yard receiving season and a 3,000-yard passing season. Also, [[Vince Young]] stands as the first player in NCAA history to rush for 1,000 yards (1,050) and throw for 3,000 yards (3,036) in a single season.\n*Under Brown's tenure, only five&nbsp;players have left the Texas team for the [[NFL Draft]] with any eligibility remaining. The first was [[Kwame Cavil]] who went undrafted.<ref>Cavil was suspended from the team prior to the bowl game in his junior year, for \"violation of team rules\". The nature of the violation was not specified by Brown, Cavil, or the university. It is uncertain if Cavil would have been welcomed back to the team for his senior season if he had not left early, but it was reported at the time that Brown says he never tells players what to do if they are considering entering the NFL draft early, implying that it was in fact an early departure for the draft. Cavil subsequently went undrafted.

It played an important role in the internal conflicts of France and for most of its history was used as a state prison by the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. It was [[storming of the Bastille|stormed]] by a crowd on 14 July 1789, in the [[French Revolution]], becoming an important symbol for the French [[History of the Left in France#19th century|Republican movement]].  It was later demolished and replaced by the [[Place de la Bastille]].\n\nThe Bastille was built to defend the eastern approach to the city of Paris from the English threat in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. It was starting to be built in 1357, but the main construction occurred from 1370 onwards, creating a strong fortress with eight towers that protected the strategic gateway of the [[Porte Saint-Antoine]] on the eastern edge of Paris. The innovative design proved influential in both France and England and was widely copied. The Bastille figured prominently in France's domestic conflicts, including the fighting between the rival factions of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundians]] and the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]] in the 15th century, and the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] in the 16th. The fortress was declared a state prison in 1417; this role was expanded first under the [[Henry V of England|English occupiers]] of the 1420s and 1430s, and then under [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in the 1460s. The defences of the Bastille were fortified in response to the English and [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] threat during the 1550s, with a [[bastion]] constructed to the east of the fortress. The Bastille played a key role in the rebellion of the [[Fronde]] and the [[Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine|battle of the faubourg Saint-Antoine]], which was fought beneath its walls in 1652.\n\n[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] used the Bastille as a prison for upper-class members of French society who had opposed or angered him including, after the [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]], French [[Protestant]]s. From 1659 onwards, the Bastille functioned primarily as a state penitentiary; by 1789, 5,279 prisoners had passed through its gates. Under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI of France|XVI]], the Bastille was used to detain prisoners from more varied backgrounds, and to support the operations of the Parisian police, especially in enforcing government censorship of the printed media. Although inmates were kept in relatively good conditions, criticism of the Bastille grew during the 18th century, fueled by autobiographies written by former prisoners. Reforms were implemented and prisoner numbers were considerably reduced. In 1789 the royal government's financial crisis and the formation of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] gave rise to a swelling of republican sentiments among city-dwellers. On July 14 the Bastille was stormed by a revolutionary crowd, primarily residents of the [[faubourg Saint-Antoine]] who sought to commandeer the valuable gunpowder held within the fortress. Seven remaining prisoners were found and released and the Bastille's governor, [[Bernard-Ren\u00e9 de Launay]], was killed by the crowd. The Bastille was demolished by order of the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|Committee of the H\u00f4tel de Ville]].

One trend was a decline in the number of prisoners sent to the Bastille, with 1,194 imprisoned there during the reign of Louis XV and only 306 under Louis XVI up until the Revolution, annual averages of around 23 and 20 respectively.<ref name=BNF1/>{{refn|Using slightly different accounting methods, Hans-J\u00fcrgen L\u00fcsebrink suggests fractionally lower totals for prisoner numbers between 1660\u20131789.<ref name=LusebrinkP51>L\u00fcsebrink, p. 51.</ref>|group=upper-alpha}} A second trend was a slow shift away from the Bastille's 17th-century role of detaining primarily upper-class prisoners, towards a situation in which the Bastille was essentially a location for imprisoning socially undesirable individuals of all backgrounds \u2013 including aristocrats breaking social conventions, criminals, pornographers, thugs \u2013 and was used to support police operations, particularly those involving censorship, across Paris.<ref>Denis, p. 38; Dutray-Lecoin (2010b), p. 24.</ref> Despite these changes, the Bastille remained a state prison, subject to special authorities, answering to the monarch of the day and surrounded by a considerable and threatening reputation.<ref>Dutray-Lecoin (2010b), p. 24.</ref>\n\nUnder Louis XV, around 250 Catholic [[Convulsionnaires of Saint-M\u00e9dard|convulsionnaires]], often called [[Jansenism|Jansenists]], were detained in the Bastille for their religious beliefs.<ref>Schama, p. 331; Lacam, p. 79.</ref> Many of these prisoners were women and came from a wider range of social backgrounds than the upper-class Calvinists detained under Louis XIV; historian Monique Cottret argues that the decline of the Bastille's social \"mystique\" originates from this phase of detentions.<ref>Cottret, pp. 75\u20136.</ref> By Louis XVI, the background of those entering the Bastille and the type of offences they were detained over had changed markedly. Between 1774 and 1789, the detentions included 54 people accused of robbery; 31 of involvement in the 1775 Famine Revolt; 11 detained for assault; 62 illegal editors, printers and writers \u2013 but relatively few detained over the grander affairs of state.<ref name=LusebrinkP51/>\n\nMany prisoners still continued to come from the upper classes, particularly in those cases termed \"d\u00e9sordres des familles\", or disorders of the family. These cases typically involving members of the aristocracy who had, as historian Richard Andrews notes, \"rejected parental authority, disgraced the family reputation, manifested mental derangement, squandered capital or violated professional codes.\"<ref>Andrews, p. 270; Prade, p. 25.</ref> Their families \u2013 often their parents, but sometimes husbands and wives taking action against their spouses \u2013 could apply for individuals to be detained at one of the royal prisons, resulting in an average imprisonment of between six months and four years.<ref>Andrews, p. 270; Farge, p. 89.</ref> Such a detention could be preferable to facing a scandal or a public trial over their misdemeanours, and the secrecy that surrounded detention at the Bastille allowed personal and family reputations to be quietly protected.<ref>Trout, pp. 141, 143.</ref> The Bastille was considered one of the best prisons for an upper-class prisoner to be detained at, because of the standard of the facilities for the wealthy.<ref>Gillispie, p. 249.</ref> In the aftermath of the notorious \"[[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]]\" of 1786, involving the Queen and accusations of fraud, all the eleven suspects were held in the Bastille, significantly increasing the notoriety surrounding the institution.<ref>L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, pp. 25\u20136.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bastille 1789.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The Bastille and the Porte Saint-Antoine, seen from the east]]\n\nIncreasingly, however, the Bastille became part of the system of wider policing in Paris. Although appointed by the king, the governor reported to the lieutenant general of police: the first of these, [[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]], made only occasional visits to the Bastille, but his successor, [[Marc-Ren\u00e9 de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson (1652\u20131721)|Marquis d'Argenson]], and subsequent officers used the facility extensively and took a close interest in inspections of the prison.<ref>Funck-Brentano, p. 72; Dutray-Lecoin (2010a), p. 136.</ref> The lieutenant general reported in turn to the secretary of the \"[[Maison du Roi]]\", largely responsible for order in the capital; in practice together they controlled the issuing of the \"lettres\" in the king's name.<ref>Denis, p. 37; ''[http://classes.bnf.fr/classes/pages/pdf/Bastille1.pdf La Bastille ou \u00ab l\u2019Enfer des vivants \u00bb?]'', [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], accessed 8 August 2011.</ref> The Bastille was unusual among Parisian prisons in that it acted on behalf of the king \u2013 prisoners could therefore be imprisoned secretly, for longer, and without normal judicial processes being applied, making it a useful facility for the police authorities.<ref>Denis, p .37.</ref> The Bastille was a preferred location for holding prisoners who needed extensive questioning or where a case required the analysis of extensive documents.<ref>Denis, pp. 38\u20139.</ref> The Bastille was also used to store the Parisian police archives; public order equipment such as chains and flags; and illegal goods, seized by order of the crown using a version of the \"lettre de cachet\", such as banned books and illicit printing presses.<ref>Funck-Brentano, p .81; ''[http://classes.bnf.fr/classes/pages/pdf/Bastille1.pdf La Bastille ou \u00ab l\u2019Enfer des vivants \u00bb?]'', [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], accessed 8 August 2011.</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, but particularly in the middle of the 18th century, the Bastille was used by the police to suppress the trade in illegal and seditious books in France.<ref name=BirnP51>Birn, p. 51.</ref> In the 1750s, 40% of those sent to the Bastille were arrested for their role in manufacturing or dealing in banned material; in the 1760s, the equivalent figure was 35%.<ref name=BirnP51/>{{refn|Jane McLeod suggests that the breaching of censorship rules by licensed printers was rarely dealt with by regular courts, being seen as an infraction against the Crown, and dealt with by royal officials.<ref>McLeod, p. 6</ref>|group=upper-alpha}} Seditious writers were also often held in the Bastille, although many of the more famous writers held in the Bastille during the period were formally imprisoned for more anti-social, rather than strictly political, offences.<ref>Schama, p .331; Funck-Brentano, p. 148.</ref> In particular, many of those writers detained under Louis XVI were imprisoned for their role in producing illegal pornography, rather than political critiques of the regime.<ref name=LusebrinkP51/> The writer [[Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle]], the philosopher [[Andr\u00e9 Morellet]] and the historian [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Marmontel]], for example, were formally detained not for their more obviously political writings, but for libellous remarks or for personal insults against leading members of Parisian society.<ref>Funck-Brentano, pp. 156\u20139.</ref>\n\n====Prison regime====\n[[File:Bastille Courtyard 1785.jpg|thumb|A sketch of the main courtyard in 1785{{refn|This picture, by [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]], shows a number of elegantly dressed women; it is uncertain on what occasion the drawing was made, or what they were doing in Bastille at the time.<ref>Dutray-Lecoin (2010c), p. 148.</ref>|group=upper-alpha}}]]\n\nContrary to its later image, conditions for prisoners in the Bastille by the mid-18th century were in fact relatively benign, particularly by the standards of other prisons of the time.<ref>Schama, pp. 331\u20132; L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, pp. 29\u201332.</ref> The typical prisoner was held in one of the octagonal rooms in the mid-levels of the towers.<ref>Schama, pp. 331\u20132.</ref> The calottes, the rooms just under the roof that formed the upper storey of the Bastille, were considered the least pleasant quarters, being more exposed to the elements and usually either too hot or too cold.<ref name=SchamaP331>Schama, p. 331.</ref> The cachots, the underground dungeons, had not been used for many years except for holding recaptured escapees.<ref name=SchamaP331/> Prisoners' rooms each had a stove or a fireplace, basic furniture, curtains and in most cases a window.

In 1889 the continued popularity of the Bastille with the public was illustrated by the decision to build a replica in stone and wood for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] [[World's fair|world fair]] in Paris, manned by actors in period costumes.<ref>Giret, p. 191.</ref>\n\nDue in part to the diffusion of national and Republican ideas across France during the second half of the Third Republic, the Bastille lost an element of its prominence as a symbol by the 20th century.<ref>L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, p. 235.</ref> Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, the symbol of the Bastille was widely evoked by the [[French Resistance]] during the [[Second World War]] and until the 1950s [[Bastille Day]] remained the single most significant French national holiday.<ref>Nora, p. 118; Ayers, p. 188; L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, pp. 232\u20135.</ref>\n\n==Remains==\n[[File:Bd Henri IV- Vestige de la Bastille.JPG|thumb|Remaining stones of the Bastille are still visible now on Boulevard Henri IV.]]\nDue to its destruction after 1789, very little remains of the Bastille in the 21st century.<ref name=DutrayP136/> During the excavations for the [[Bastille (Paris M\u00e9tro)|M\u00e9tro]] underground train system in 1899, the foundations of the Libert\u00e9 Tower were uncovered and moved to the corner of the Boulevard Henri IV and the Quai de Celestins, where they can still be seen today.<ref>Hazan, p. 11; Amalvi, p. 184.</ref> The [[Pont de la Concorde (Paris)|Pont de la Concorde]] contains stones reused from the Bastille.<ref>Ayers, p. 391.</ref>\n\nSome relics of the Bastille survive: the [[Carnavalet Museum]] holds objects including one of the stone models of the Bastille made by [[Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Palloy|Palloy]] and the rope ladder used by [[Jean Henri Latude|Latude]] to escape from the prison roof in the 18th century, while the mechanism and bells of the prison clock are exhibited in [[Mus\u00e9e Europ\u00e9en d'Art Campanaire]] at [[L'Isle-Jourdain, Gers|L'Isle-Jourdain]].<ref>''[http://www.carnavalet.paris.fr/fr/collections/modele-reduit-de-la-bastille Mod\u00e8le r\u00e9duit de la Bastille]'', [[Carnavalet Museum]], accessed 2 September 2011; Berchtold, p. 145; Dutray-Lecoin (2010a), p. 136.</ref> The key to the Bastille was given to [[George Washington]] in 1790 by [[Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] and is displayed in the historic house of [[Mount Vernon]].<ref>''[http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/bastille-key/ Bastille Key]'', [[Mount Vernon|George Washington's Mount Vernon and Historic Gardens]], accessed 2 September 2011.</ref> The Bastille's archives are now held by the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]].<ref>''[http://www.bnf.fr/fr/collections_et_services/anx_fds_col/a.archives_bastille.html Archives de la Bastille] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909092509/http://www.bnf.fr/fr/collections_et_services/anx_fds_col/a.archives_bastille.html |date=September 9, 2011 }}'', [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], accessed 2 September 2011.</ref>\n\nThe [[Place de la Bastille]] still occupies most of the location of the Bastille, and the [[Op\u00e9ra Bastille]] was built on the square in 1989 to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of the storming of the prison.<ref name=\"Burton, p. 40\"/> The surrounding area has largely been redeveloped from its 19th-century industrial past.

[[Hippolyte Taine]] argued in the late 19th century that the crowd consisted of unemployed vagrants, who acted without real thought; by contrast, the post-war left-wing intellectual [[George Rud\u00e9]] argued that the crowd was dominated by relatively prosperous artisan workers.<ref>Kennedy, p. 313; Rud\u00e9 (1959); Taine (1878).</ref> The matter was reexamined by [[Jacques Godechot]] in the post-war years; Godechot showing convincingly that, in addition to some local artisans and traders, at least half the crowd that gathered that day were, like the inhabitants of the surrounding faubourg, recent immigrants to Paris from the provinces.<ref>Godechot (1965); Schama, p. 762; Kennedy, p. 313.</ref> Godechot used this to characterise the taking of the Bastille as a genuinely national event of wider importance to French society.<ref>Kennedy, p. 313.</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s French [[sociology|sociologist]]s, particularly those interested in [[critical theory]], re-examined this historical legacy.<ref name=MuzerelleP170/> The [[Annales School]] conducted extensive research into how order was maintained in pre-revolutionary France, focusing on the operation of the police, concepts of [[deviancy]] and religion.<ref name=MuzerelleP170/> Histories of the Bastille since then have focused on the prison's role in policing, censorship and popular culture, in particular how these impacted on the working classes.<ref name=MuzerelleP170/> Research in West Germany during the 1980s examined the cultural interpretation of the Bastille against the wider context of the French Revolution; Hanse L\u00fcsebrink and Rolf Reichardt's work, explaining how the Bastille came to be regarded as a symbol of despotism, was among the most prominent.<ref>Crook, pp. 245\u20136; L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt (1997).</ref> This body of work influenced historian [[Simon Schama]]'s 1989 book on the Revolution, which incorporated cultural interpretation of the Bastille with a controversial critique of the violence surrounding the storming of the Bastille.<ref>Colley, pp. 12\u20133; Schama (2004).</ref> The [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] held a major exhibition on the legacy of the Bastille between 2010 and 2011, resulting in a substantial edited volume summarising the current academic perspectives on the fortress.<ref>''[http://www.bnf.fr/en/cultural_events/anx_exhibitions/f.bastille_eng.html The \"Bastille\" or \"Living in Hell\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112055927/http://www.bnf.fr/en/cultural_events/anx_exhibitions/f.bastille_eng.html |date=November 12, 2011 }}'', [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], accessed 29 August 2011; Dutray-Lecoin and Muzerelle (eds) (2010).</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of castles in France]]\n{{Portal bar|Architecture|Law|France}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* Alpaugh, Micah. \"A Self-Defining Bourgeoisie in the Early French Revolution: The Milice bourgeoise, the Bastille Days of 1789, and Their Aftermath,\" ''Journal of Social History'' 47, no. 3 (Spring 2014), 696-720.\n* Amalvi, Christian. \"La Bastille dans l'historiographie r\u00e9publicaine du XIXe si\u00e8cle\", in Dutray-Lecoin and Muzerelle (eds) (2010). {{in lang|fr}}\n* Anderson, William (1980).

It played an important role in the internal conflicts of France and for most of its history was used as a state prison by the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. It was [[storming of the Bastille|stormed]] by a crowd on 14 July 1789, in the [[French Revolution]], becoming an important symbol for the French [[History of the Left in France#19th century|Republican movement]].  It was later demolished and replaced by the [[Place de la Bastille]].\n\nThe Bastille was built to defend the eastern approach to the city of Paris from the English threat in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. It was starting to be built in 1357, but the main construction occurred from 1370 onwards, creating a strong fortress with eight towers that protected the strategic gateway of the [[Porte Saint-Antoine]] on the eastern edge of Paris. The innovative design proved influential in both France and England and was widely copied. The Bastille figured prominently in France's domestic conflicts, including the fighting between the rival factions of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundians]] and the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]] in the 15th century, and the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] in the 16th. The fortress was declared a state prison in 1417; this role was expanded first under the [[Henry V of England|English occupiers]] of the 1420s and 1430s, and then under [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in the 1460s. The defences of the Bastille were fortified in response to the English and [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] threat during the 1550s, with a [[bastion]] constructed to the east of the fortress. The Bastille played a key role in the rebellion of the [[Fronde]] and the [[Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine|battle of the faubourg Saint-Antoine]], which was fought beneath its walls in 1652.\n\n[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] used the Bastille as a prison for upper-class members of French society who had opposed or angered him including, after the [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]], French [[Protestant]]s. From 1659 onwards, the Bastille functioned primarily as a state penitentiary; by 1789, 5,279 prisoners had passed through its gates. Under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI of France|XVI]], the Bastille was used to detain prisoners from more varied backgrounds, and to support the operations of the Parisian police, especially in enforcing government censorship of the printed media. Although inmates were kept in relatively good conditions, criticism of the Bastille grew during the 18th century, fueled by autobiographies written by former prisoners. Reforms were implemented and prisoner numbers were considerably reduced. In 1789 the royal government's financial crisis and the formation of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] gave rise to a swelling of republican sentiments among city-dwellers. On July 14 the Bastille was stormed by a revolutionary crowd, primarily residents of the [[faubourg Saint-Antoine]] who sought to commandeer the valuable gunpowder held within the fortress. Seven remaining prisoners were found and released and the Bastille's governor, [[Bernard-Ren\u00e9 de Launay]], was killed by the crowd. The Bastille was demolished by order of the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|Committee of the H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. Souvenirs of the fortress were transported around France and displayed as icons of the overthrow of [[despotism]]. Over the next century, the site and historical legacy of the Bastille featured prominently in French [[July Revolution|revolutions]], political protests and popular fiction, and it remained an important symbol for the French [[History of the Left in France#19th century|Republican movement]].\n\nAlmost nothing is left of the Bastille except some remains of its stone foundation that were relocated to the side of Boulevard Henri IV. Historians were critical of the Bastille in the early 19th century, and believe the fortress to have been a relatively well-administered institution, but deeply implicated in the system of French policing and political control during the 18th century.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===14th century===\n[[File:Bastille reconstruction 1420.jpg|thumb|300px|Historical reconstruction showing the moat below the walls of Paris (left), the Bastille and the [[Porte Saint-Antoine]] (right) in 1420]]\n\nThe Bastille was built in response to a threat to Paris during the [[Hundred Years' War]] between England and France.<ref name=LandsdaleP216>Lansdale, p. 216.</ref> Prior to the Bastille, the main royal castle in Paris was the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]], in the west of the capital, but the city had expanded by the middle of the 14th century and the eastern side was now exposed to an English attack.<ref name=LandsdaleP216/> The situation worsened after the [[Ransom of King John II of France|imprisonment of John II]] in England following the French defeat at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|battle of Poitiers]], and in his absence the [[Provost of Paris]], [[\u00c9tienne Marcel]], took steps to improve the capital's defences.<ref>Bournon, p. 1.</ref> In 1357, Marcel expanded the city walls and protected the [[Porte Saint-Antoine]] with two high stone towers and a {{convert|78|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} ditch.<ref>Viollet, p. 172;

Between 1774 and 1789, the detentions included 54 people accused of robbery; 31 of involvement in the 1775 Famine Revolt; 11 detained for assault; 62 illegal editors, printers and writers \u2013 but relatively few detained over the grander affairs of state.<ref name=LusebrinkP51/>\n\nMany prisoners still continued to come from the upper classes, particularly in those cases termed \"d\u00e9sordres des familles\", or disorders of the family. These cases typically involving members of the aristocracy who had, as historian Richard Andrews notes, \"rejected parental authority, disgraced the family reputation, manifested mental derangement, squandered capital or violated professional codes.\"<ref>Andrews, p. 270; Prade, p. 25.</ref> Their families \u2013 often their parents, but sometimes husbands and wives taking action against their spouses \u2013 could apply for individuals to be detained at one of the royal prisons, resulting in an average imprisonment of between six months and four years.<ref>Andrews, p. 270; Farge, p. 89.</ref> Such a detention could be preferable to facing a scandal or a public trial over their misdemeanours, and the secrecy that surrounded detention at the Bastille allowed personal and family reputations to be quietly protected.<ref>Trout, pp. 141, 143.</ref> The Bastille was considered one of the best prisons for an upper-class prisoner to be detained at, because of the standard of the facilities for the wealthy.<ref>Gillispie, p. 249.</ref> In the aftermath of the notorious \"[[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]]\" of 1786, involving the Queen and accusations of fraud, all the eleven suspects were held in the Bastille, significantly increasing the notoriety surrounding the institution.<ref>L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, pp. 25\u20136.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bastille 1789.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The Bastille and the Porte Saint-Antoine, seen from the east]]\n\nIncreasingly, however, the Bastille became part of the system of wider policing in Paris.

when the moderate Republican [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]] became president in 1879, his new government turned the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille into a national holiday.<ref>L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, p. 229.</ref> The anniversary remained contentious, with hard-line Republicans continuing to use the occasion to protest against the new political order and right-wing conservatives protesting about the imposition of the holiday.<ref>McPhee, p. 259;

[[Alexandre Dumas]], for example, used the Bastille and the legend of the \"Man in the Iron Mask\" extensively in his [[d'Artagnan Romances]]; in these novels the Bastille is presented as both picturesque and tragic, a suitable setting for heroic action.<ref>Sacquin, pp. 186\u20137.</ref> By contrast, in many of Dumas's other works, such as ''Ange Pitou'', the Bastille takes on a much darker appearance, being described as a place in which a prisoner is \"forgotten, bankrupted, buried, destroyed\".<ref>Sacquin, p. 186.</ref> In England, [[Charles Dickens]] took a similar perspective when he drew on popular histories of the Bastille in writing ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', in which Doctor Manette is \"buried alive\" in the prison for 18 years; many historical figures associated with the Bastille are reinvented as fictional individuals in the novel, such as Claude Cholat, reproduced by Dickens as \"Ernest Defarge\".<ref>Glancy, pp. 18, 33; Sacquin, p. 186.</ref> [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 novel ''[[Les Miserables]]'', set just after the Revolution, gave Napoleon's plaster Bastille elephant a permanent place in literary history. In 1889 the continued popularity of the Bastille with the public was illustrated by the decision to build a replica in stone and wood for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] [[World's fair|world fair]] in Paris, manned by actors in period costumes.<ref>Giret, p. 191.</ref>\n\nDue in part to the diffusion of national and Republican ideas across France during the second half of the Third Republic, the Bastille lost an element of its prominence as a symbol by the 20th century.<ref>L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, p. 235.</ref> Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, the symbol of the Bastille was widely evoked by the [[French Resistance]] during the [[Second World War]] and until the 1950s [[Bastille Day]] remained the single most significant French national holiday.<ref>Nora, p. 118; Ayers, p. 188; L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, pp. 232\u20135.</ref>\n\n==Remains==\n[[File:Bd Henri IV- Vestige de la Bastille.JPG|thumb|Remaining stones of the Bastille are still visible now on Boulevard Henri IV.]]\nDue to its destruction after 1789, very little remains of the Bastille in the 21st century.<ref name=DutrayP136/> During the excavations for the [[Bastille (Paris M\u00e9tro)|M\u00e9tro]] underground train system in 1899, the foundations of the Libert\u00e9 Tower were uncovered and moved to the corner of the Boulevard Henri IV and the Quai de Celestins, where they can still be seen today.<ref>Hazan, p. 11; Amalvi, p. 184.</ref> The [[Pont de la Concorde (Paris)|Pont de la Concorde]] contains stones reused from the Bastille.<ref>Ayers, p. 391.</ref>\n\nSome relics of the Bastille survive: the [[Carnavalet Museum]] holds objects including one of the stone models of the Bastille made by [[Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Palloy|Palloy]] and the rope ladder used by [[Jean Henri Latude|Latude]] to escape from the prison roof in the 18th century, while the mechanism and bells of the prison clock are exhibited in [[Mus\u00e9e Europ\u00e9en d'Art Campanaire]] at [[L'Isle-Jourdain, Gers|L'Isle-Jourdain]].<ref>''[http://www.carnavalet.paris.fr/fr/collections/modele-reduit-de-la-bastille Mod\u00e8le r\u00e9duit de la Bastille]'', [[Carnavalet Museum]], accessed 2 September 2011; Berchtold, p. 145; Dutray-Lecoin (2010a), p. 136.</ref> The key to the Bastille was given to [[George Washington]] in 1790 by [[Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] and is displayed in the historic house of [[Mount Vernon]].<ref>''[http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/bastille-key/ Bastille Key]'', [[Mount Vernon|George Washington's Mount Vernon and Historic Gardens]], accessed 2 September 2011.</ref> The Bastille's archives are now held by the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]].<ref>''[http://www.bnf.fr/fr/collections_et_services/anx_fds_col/a.archives_bastille.html Archives de la Bastille] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909092509/http://www.bnf.fr/fr/collections_et_services/anx_fds_col/a.archives_bastille.html |date=September 9, 2011 }}'', [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], accessed 2 September 2011.</ref>\n\nThe [[Place de la Bastille]] still occupies most of the location of the Bastille, and the [[Op\u00e9ra Bastille]] was built on the square in 1989 to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of the storming of the prison.<ref name=\"Burton, p. 40\"/> The surrounding area has largely been redeveloped from its 19th-century industrial past.

[[Hippolyte Taine]] argued in the late 19th century that the crowd consisted of unemployed vagrants, who acted without real thought; by contrast, the post-war left-wing intellectual [[George Rud\u00e9]] argued that the crowd was dominated by relatively prosperous artisan workers.<ref>Kennedy, p. 313; Rud\u00e9 (1959); Taine (1878).</ref> The matter was reexamined by [[Jacques Godechot]] in the post-war years; Godechot showing convincingly that, in addition to some local artisans and traders, at least half the crowd that gathered that day were, like the inhabitants of the surrounding faubourg, recent immigrants to Paris from the provinces.<ref>Godechot (1965); Schama, p. 762; Kennedy, p. 313.</ref> Godechot used this to characterise the taking of the Bastille as a genuinely national event of wider importance to French society.<ref>Kennedy, p. 313.</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s French [[sociology|sociologist]]s, particularly those interested in [[critical theory]], re-examined this historical legacy.<ref name=MuzerelleP170/> The [[Annales School]] conducted extensive research into how order was maintained in pre-revolutionary France, focusing on the operation of the police, concepts of [[deviancy]] and religion.<ref name=MuzerelleP170/> Histories of the Bastille since then have focused on the prison's role in policing, censorship and popular culture, in particular how these impacted on the working classes.<ref name=MuzerelleP170/> Research in West Germany during the 1980s examined the cultural interpretation of the Bastille against the wider context of the French Revolution; Hanse L\u00fcsebrink and Rolf Reichardt's work, explaining how the Bastille came to be regarded as a symbol of despotism, was among the most prominent.<ref>Crook, pp. 245\u20136; L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt (1997).</ref> This body of work influenced historian [[Simon Schama]]'s 1989 book on the Revolution, which incorporated cultural interpretation of the Bastille with a controversial critique of the violence surrounding the storming of the Bastille.<ref>Colley, pp. 12\u20133; Schama (2004).</ref> The [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] held a major exhibition on the legacy of the Bastille between 2010 and 2011, resulting in a substantial edited volume summarising the current academic perspectives on the fortress.<ref>''[http://www.bnf.fr/en/cultural_events/anx_exhibitions/f.bastille_eng.html The \"Bastille\" or \"Living in Hell\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112055927/http://www.bnf.fr/en/cultural_events/anx_exhibitions/f.bastille_eng.html |date=November 12, 2011 }}'', [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], accessed 29 August 2011; Dutray-Lecoin and Muzerelle (eds) (2010).</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of castles in France]]\n{{Portal bar|Architecture|Law|France}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* Alpaugh, Micah. \"A Self-Defining Bourgeoisie in the Early French Revolution: The Milice bourgeoise, the Bastille Days of 1789, and Their Aftermath,\" ''Journal of Social History'' 47, no. 3 (Spring 2014), 696-720.\n* Amalvi, Christian. \"La Bastille dans l'historiographie r\u00e9publicaine du XIXe si\u00e8cle\", in Dutray-Lecoin and Muzerelle (eds) (2010). {{in lang|fr}}\n* Anderson, William (1980).
