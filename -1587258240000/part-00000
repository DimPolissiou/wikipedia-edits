Defunct quarry, Plainville Connecticut]]\nThe Metacomet Ridge is the result of [[rift|continental rifting]] processes that took place 200 million years ago during the [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] periods. The [[basalt]] (also called traprock) crest of the Metacomet Ridge is the product of a series of massive [[lava]] flows hundreds of feet thick that welled up in [[Fault (geology)|faults]] created by the rifting apart of the [[North America]]n continent from [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]]. Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric [[rift valley]] which was once a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that became the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name=\"Raymo\"/>\n\nBasalt is a dark colored [[extrusive]] [[volcanic rock]]. The weathering of [[iron]]-bearing minerals within it results in a rusty brown color when exposed to air and water, lending it a distinct reddish or purple\u2013red hue. Basalt frequently breaks into octagonal and pentagonal columns, creating a unique \"postpile\" appearance. Extensive slopes made of fractured basalt [[Scree|talus]] are visible at the base of many of the cliffs along the Metacomet Ridge.<ref name=\"Raymo\"/>\n\nThe basalt floods of lava that now form much of the Metacomet Ridge took place over a span of 20 million years. [[Erosion]] and [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] occurring between the eruptions deposited layers of sediment between the lava flows which eventually lithified into [[sedimentary rock]] layers within the basalt. The resulting \"layer cake\" of basalt and sedimentary rock eventually faulted and tilted upward (see [[fault-block]]). Subsequent erosion wore away many of the weaker sedimentary layers at a faster rate than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today on the western and northern sides of the ridge.<ref name=\"Raymo\"/> Evidence of this layer-cake structure is visible on [[Mount Norwottuck]] of the [[Holyoke Range]] in Massachusetts. The summit of Norwottuck is made of basalt; directly beneath the summit are the Horse Caves, a deep overhang where the weaker sedimentary layer has worn away at a more rapid rate than the basalt layer above it. [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Franklin County, Massachusetts)|Mount Sugarloaf]], [[Pocumtuck Ridge]], and [[Mount Toby]], also in Massachusetts, together present a larger \"layer cake\" example. The bottom layer is composed of ''[[arkose|arkose sandstone]],'' visible on Mount Sugarloaf. The middle layer is composed of ''[[basalt|volcanic traprock]],'' most visible on the Pocumtuck Ridge. The top layer is composed of a sedimentary [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] known as ''Mount Toby Conglomerate.'' Faulting and [[earthquake]]s during the period of continental rifting tilted the layers diagonally; subsequent erosion and glacial activity exposed the tilted layers of sandstone, basalt, and conglomerate visible today as three distinct mountain masses. Although Mount Toby and Mount Sugarloaf are not composed of traprock, they are part of the Metacomet Ridge by virtue of their origin via the same rifting and uplift processes.<ref name=\"Toby\"/>\n\nOf all the summits that make up the Metacomet Ridge, [[West Rock]], in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], bears special mention because it was not formed by the volcanic flooding that created most of the traprock ridges. Rather, it is the remains of an enormous [[dike (geology)|volcanic dike]] through which the basalt lava floods found access to the surface.<ref name=\"Raymo\"/>\n\nWhile the traprock cliffs remain the most obvious evidence of the prehistoric ''geologic'' processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life in the form of Triassic and Jurassic [[fossil]]s; in particular, [[dinosaur]] tracks. At [[Dinosaur State Park and Arboretum|a state park]] in [[Rocky Hill, Connecticut]], more than 2,000 well preserved early Jurassic prints have been excavated.<ref>[http://www.dinosaurstatepark.org/ Dinosaur State Park].

Dry, hot upper ridges support [[oak savanna]]s, often dominated by [[chestnut oak]] and a variety of understory grasses and ferns. [[Juniperus virginiana|Eastern red-cedar]], a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend to be similar to the adjacent upland plateaus and nearby [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]], containing species common to the [[northern hardwood forest|northern hardwood]] and [[oak-hickory forest]] ecosystem types. [[Tsuga canadensis|Eastern hemlock]] crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in the region. Miles of high cliffs make ideal [[Bird of prey|raptor]] habitat, and the Metacomet Ridge is a seasonal raptor migration corridor. [[Image:Ram's-Head Lady's-Slipper (Cypripedium arietinum).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Ram's-head lady's slipper]]Because the topography of the ridge offers such varied terrain, many species reach the northern or southern limit of their range on the Metacomet Ridge; others are considered rare nationally or globally.

Major tribal groups active in the area included the [[Quinnipiac]], [[Niantic (tribe)|Niantic]], [[Pequot]], [[Pocomtuc]], and [[Mohegan]]. Traprock was used to make tools and arrowheads. Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and fished in local bodies of water around the Metacomet Ridge.

''Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England.'' New York: Hill and Wang.</ref>\nNatives incorporated the natural features of the ridgeline and surrounding geography into their spiritual belief systems. Many Native American stories were in turn incorporated into regional colonial folklore. The giant stone spirit Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a prominent figure in many stories, was credited with diverting the course of the [[Connecticut River]] where it suddenly swings east in [[Middletown, Connecticut]], after several hundred miles of running due south. Hobbomuck is also credited with slaying a giant human-eating [[beaver]] who lived in a great lake that existed in the [[Connecticut River Valley]] of Massachusetts. According to native beliefs as retold by European settlers, the corpse of the beaver remains visible as the Pocumtuck Ridge portion of the Metacomet Ridge. Later, after Hobbomuck diverted the course of the Connecticut River, he was punished to sleep forever as the prominent man-like form of the [[Sleeping Giant (Connecticut)|Sleeping Giant]], part of the Metacomet Ridge in southern Connecticut. There seems to be an element of scientific truth in some of these tales. For instance, the great lake that the giant beaver was said to have inhabited may very well have been the post-glacial [[Lake Hitchcock]], extant 10,000 years ago; the giant beaver may have been an actual prehistoric species of bear\u2013sized beaver, ''[[Castoroides|Castoroides ohioensis]]'', that lived at that time.<ref>Field, Phinehas (1870\u201379). \"Stories, anecdotes, and legends, collected and written down by Deacon Phinehas Field.\" ''History and Proceedings of the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association.''

In response to public interest in the ridge and its surrounding landscapes, more than twenty local non-profit organizations have become involved in conservation efforts on and around the ridge and surrounding region.

Defunct quarry, Plainville Connecticut]]\nThe Metacomet Ridge is the result of [[rift|continental rifting]] processes that took place 200 million years ago during the [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] periods. The [[basalt]] (also called traprock) crest of the Metacomet Ridge is the product of a series of massive [[lava]] flows hundreds of feet thick that welled up in [[Fault (geology)|faults]] created by the rifting apart of the [[North America]]n continent from [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]]. Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric [[rift valley]] which was once a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that became the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name=\"Raymo\"/>\n\nBasalt is a dark colored [[extrusive]] [[volcanic rock]]. The weathering of [[iron]]-bearing minerals within it results in a rusty brown color when exposed to air and water, lending it a distinct reddish or purple\u2013red hue. Basalt frequently breaks into octagonal and pentagonal columns, creating a unique \"postpile\" appearance. Extensive slopes made of fractured basalt [[Scree|talus]] are visible at the base of many of the cliffs along the Metacomet Ridge.<ref name=\"Raymo\"/>\n\nThe basalt floods of lava that now form much of the Metacomet Ridge took place over a span of 20 million years. [[Erosion]] and [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] occurring between the eruptions deposited layers of sediment between the lava flows which eventually lithified into [[sedimentary rock]] layers within the basalt. The resulting \"layer cake\" of basalt and sedimentary rock eventually faulted and tilted upward (see [[fault-block]]). Subsequent erosion wore away many of the weaker sedimentary layers at a faster rate than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today on the western and northern sides of the ridge.<ref name=\"Raymo\"/> Evidence of this layer-cake structure is visible on [[Mount Norwottuck]] of the [[Holyoke Range]] in Massachusetts. The summit of Norwottuck is made of basalt; directly beneath the summit are the Horse Caves, a deep overhang where the weaker sedimentary layer has worn away at a more rapid rate than the basalt layer above it. [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Franklin County, Massachusetts)|Mount Sugarloaf]], [[Pocumtuck Ridge]], and [[Mount Toby]], also in Massachusetts, together present a larger \"layer cake\" example. The bottom layer is composed of ''[[arkose|arkose sandstone]],'' visible on Mount Sugarloaf. The middle layer is composed of ''[[basalt|volcanic traprock]],'' most visible on the Pocumtuck Ridge. The top layer is composed of a sedimentary [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] known as ''Mount Toby Conglomerate.'' Faulting and [[earthquake]]s during the period of continental rifting tilted the layers diagonally; subsequent erosion and glacial activity exposed the tilted layers of sandstone, basalt, and conglomerate visible today as three distinct mountain masses. Although Mount Toby and Mount Sugarloaf are not composed of traprock, they are part of the Metacomet Ridge by virtue of their origin via the same rifting and uplift processes.<ref name=\"Toby\"/>\n\nOf all the summits that make up the Metacomet Ridge, [[West Rock]], in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], bears special mention because it was not formed by the volcanic flooding that created most of the traprock ridges. Rather, it is the remains of an enormous [[dike (geology)|volcanic dike]] through which the basalt lava floods found access to the surface.<ref name=\"Raymo\"/>\n\nWhile the traprock cliffs remain the most obvious evidence of the prehistoric ''geologic'' processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life in the form of Triassic and Jurassic [[fossil]]s; in particular, [[dinosaur]] tracks. At [[Dinosaur State Park and Arboretum|a state park]] in [[Rocky Hill, Connecticut]], more than 2,000 well preserved early Jurassic prints have been excavated.<ref>[http://www.dinosaurstatepark.org/ Dinosaur State Park].

Dry, hot upper ridges support [[oak savanna]]s, often dominated by [[chestnut oak]] and a variety of understory grasses and ferns. [[Juniperus virginiana|Eastern red-cedar]], a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend to be similar to the adjacent upland plateaus and nearby [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]], containing species common to the [[northern hardwood forest|northern hardwood]] and [[oak-hickory forest]] ecosystem types. [[Tsuga canadensis|Eastern hemlock]] crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in the region. Miles of high cliffs make ideal [[Bird of prey|raptor]] habitat, and the Metacomet Ridge is a seasonal raptor migration corridor. [[Image:Ram's-Head Lady's-Slipper (Cypripedium arietinum).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Ram's-head lady's slipper]]Because the topography of the ridge offers such varied terrain, many species reach the northern or southern limit of their range on the Metacomet Ridge; others are considered rare nationally or globally.

Major tribal groups active in the area included the [[Quinnipiac]], [[Niantic (tribe)|Niantic]], [[Pequot]], [[Pocomtuc]], and [[Mohegan]]. Traprock was used to make tools and arrowheads. Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and fished in local bodies of water around the Metacomet Ridge. Tracts of woodland in the river bottoms surrounding the ridges were sometimes burned to facilitate the cultivation of crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[tobacco]], and [[bean]]s.<ref name=\"EF\"/><ref name=\"Cronin\">Cronin, William (2003). ''Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England.'' New York: Hill and Wang.</ref>\nNatives incorporated the natural features of the ridgeline and surrounding geography into their spiritual belief systems. Many Native American stories were in turn incorporated into regional colonial folklore. The giant stone spirit Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a prominent figure in many stories, was credited with diverting the course of the [[Connecticut River]] where it suddenly swings east in [[Middletown, Connecticut]], after several hundred miles of running due south. Hobbomuck is also credited with slaying a giant human-eating [[beaver]] who lived in a great lake that existed in the [[Connecticut River Valley]] of Massachusetts. According to native beliefs as retold by European settlers, the corpse of the beaver remains visible as the Pocumtuck Ridge portion of the Metacomet Ridge. Later, after Hobbomuck diverted the course of the Connecticut River, he was punished to sleep forever as the prominent man-like form of the [[Sleeping Giant (Connecticut)|Sleeping Giant]], part of the Metacomet Ridge in southern Connecticut. There seems to be an element of scientific truth in some of these tales. For instance, the great lake that the giant beaver was said to have inhabited may very well have been the post-glacial [[Lake Hitchcock]], extant 10,000 years ago; the giant beaver may have been an actual prehistoric species of bear\u2013sized beaver, ''[[Castoroides|Castoroides ohioensis]]'', that lived at that time.<ref>Field, Phinehas (1870\u201379). \"Stories, anecdotes, and legends, collected and written down by Deacon Phinehas Field.\" ''History and Proceedings of the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association.''

Photo by [[Ernest Brooks (photographer)|Ernest Brooks]].]]\nThe total number of [[military]] and [[civilian casualties]] in [[World War I]] is estimated to be about 40 million: estimates range from 20.7 to 22&nbsp;million deaths and about 20 to 22&nbsp;million wounded military personnel, ranking it among the [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|deadliest conflicts]] in human history. A man named Wally was one of many to suffer such casualties due to false propaganda. \n\nThe total number of deaths includes about 9 to 11 million [[military personnel]]. The [[civilians|civilian]] death toll was about 11 million, including about 8 million of them which were due to war-related famine and disease and 3 million due to military actions and war crimes. The [[Triple Entente]] (also known as the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]) lost about 6 million military personnel while the [[Central Powers]] lost about 4 million. At least 2&nbsp;million died from diseases and 6&nbsp;million went missing, presumed dead.\n\nAbout three-quarters of military deaths in World War I were in battle, unlike the conflicts that took place in the 19th century, in which the majority of deaths were due to disease.  Nevertheless, disease, including the [[1918 flu pandemic]], and [[prisoners of war|POW]] deaths still caused about one quarter of total military deaths for all belligerents.\n\nOut of all the belligerents of the war, the [[Ottoman Empire]] suffered the highest death toll with over 4 million dead, or around 20 percent of its prewar population.  The [[Russian Empire]] suffered the second highest number of fatalities, with over 3.6 million dead.  The [[British Empire]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[German Empire|Germany]], and neutral [[Qajar Iran|Persia]] also lost over one million dead during the war.\n<!--Please do not change any casualty numbers until it has been suggested/discussed on the talk page.

Photo by [[Ernest Brooks (photographer)|Ernest Brooks]].]]\nThe total number of [[military]] and [[civilian casualties]] in [[World War I]] is estimated to be about 40 million: estimates range from 20.7 to 22&nbsp;million deaths and about 20 to 22&nbsp;million wounded military personnel, ranking it among the [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|deadliest conflicts]] in human history.\n\nThe total number of deaths includes about 9 to 11 million [[military personnel]]. The [[civilians|civilian]] death toll was about 11 million, including about 8 million of them which were due to war-related famine and disease and 3 million due to military actions and war crimes. The [[Triple Entente]] (also known as the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]) lost about 6 million military personnel while the [[Central Powers]] lost about 4 million. At least 2&nbsp;million died from diseases and 6&nbsp;million went missing, presumed dead.\n\nAbout three-quarters of military deaths in World War I were in battle, unlike the conflicts that took place in the 19th century, in which the majority of deaths were due to disease.  Nevertheless, disease, including the [[1918 flu pandemic]], and [[prisoners of war|POW]] deaths still caused about one quarter of total military deaths for all belligerents.\n\nOut of all the belligerents of the war, the [[Ottoman Empire]] suffered the highest death toll with over 4 million dead, or around 20 percent of its prewar population.  The [[Russian Empire]] suffered the second highest number of fatalities, with over 3.6 million dead.  The [[British Empire]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[German Empire|Germany]], and neutral [[Qajar Iran|Persia]] also lost over one million dead during the war.\n<!--Please do not change any casualty numbers until it has been suggested/discussed on the talk page.

The war brought about increased malnutrition and disease caused by the Central Powers [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-boat Campaign]] against the Allies, and the Allied blockades of the Central Powers, both of which disrupted trade and resulted in food shortages. The civilian deaths in the [[Ottoman Empire]] include the [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Assyrian Genocide]], [[Greek Genocide]], deaths due to [[Strategic bombing in World War I|Allied strategic bombing]], and deaths due to famine and disease. Civilian deaths due to the [[Spanish flu]] have been excluded from these figures, whenever possible. The figures do not include deaths during the [[Balkan Wars]], the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Turkish War of Independence]], the [[Heimosodat|Finnish Kinship Wars]], the [[German Revolution of 1918-1919|German Revolution]], the [[Irish War of Independence]], or any of the various wars and [[Revolutions of 1917-1923|revolutions]] that took place in the [[Aftermath of World War I|aftermath of World War I]].\n\n== Casualties in the borders of 1914\u201318 ==\n<!--Please do not change any casualty numbers until it has been suggested/discussed on the talk page.
