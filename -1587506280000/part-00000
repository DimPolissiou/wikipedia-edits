The specific epithet, ''tremuloides'', evokes this trembling behavior and can be literally translated as \"like [[Populus tremula|''(Populus) tremula'']]\", the European trembling aspen.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:2015-03-16 12 22 15 Aspen catkins on Idaho Street (Interstate 80 Business) in Elko, Nevada.JPG|thumb|left|Aspen [[catkin]]s in spring]]\nQuaking aspen is a tall, fast growing tree, usually {{convert|20|-|25|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} at maturity, with a trunk {{convert|20|to|80|cm|ftin|0|abbr=in}} in diameter; records are {{convert|36.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|1.37|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter.\n\nThe bark is relatively smooth, colored greenish-white to gray, and is marked by thick black horizontal scars and prominent black knots. Parallel vertical scars are tell-tale signs of elk, which strip off aspen bark with their front teeth.\n\nThe leaves on mature trees are nearly round, {{convert|4|\u2013|8|cm|frac=4|sp=us|abbr=off}} in diameter with small rounded teeth, and a {{convert|3|\u2013|7|cm|frac=4|adj=on|sp=us|abbr=off}} long, flattened petiole. Young trees and root sprouts have much larger ({{convert|10|\u2013|20|cm|in|0|disp=comma|sp=us}} long) nearly triangular leaves.\n\nSome species of ''Populus'' have [[petiole (botany)|petioles]] flattened partially along their length, while the aspens and some other poplars have them flattened from side to side along the entire length of the petiole.\n\nAspens are [[dioecious]], with separate male and female clones. The flowers are catkins {{convert|4|\u2013|6|cm|frac=4|sp=us}} long, produced in early spring before the leaves. The fruit is a {{convert|10|cm|in|0|adj=mid|-long|abbr=off|sp=us}} pendulous string of {{convert|6|mm|in|frac=16|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} capsules, each capsule containing about ten minute seeds embedded in cottony fluff, which aids wind dispersal of the seeds when they are mature in early summer. Trees as young as 2\u20133 years old may begin seed production, but significant output begins starting at 10 years of age. Best seed production is obtained between the ages of 50\u201370 years.\n\nQuaking aspen grows more slowly in the dry conditions of western North America than it does in the more humid east and also lives longer--ages of 100-120 years are typical in the west with some individuals living 200 years. In the east, stands decay faster, sometimes 60 years or less depending on the region.\n\n== Distribution ==\nQuaking aspen occurs across [[Canada]] in all provinces and territories, with the possible exception of [[Nunavut]]. In the [[United States]], it can be found as far north as the northern foothills of the [[Brooks Range]] in [[Alaska]], where road margins and gravel pads provide islands of well-drained habitat in a region where soils are often waterlogged due to underlying [[permafrost]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=Daniel|last2=Breen|first2=Amy|date=2016-06-06|title=Infrastructure Development Accelerates Range Expansion of Trembling Aspen ( Populus tremuloides, Salicaceae) into the Arctic|url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/4560|journal=ARCTIC|language=en|volume=69|issue=2|pages=130\u2013136|doi=10.14430/arctic4560|issn=1923-1245}}</ref> It occurs at low elevations as far south as northern [[Nebraska]] and central [[Indiana]].

It grows at high altitudes as far south as [[Guanajuato]], Mexico.\n\nQuaking aspen grows in a wide variety of climatic conditions. January and July average temperatures range from {{convert|-30|C|F}} and {{convert|16|C|F}} in the [[Alaska Interior]] to {{convert|-3|C|F}} and {{convert|23|C|F}} in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]].

Each colony is its own clone, and all trees in the clone have identical characteristics and share a single root structure. A clone may turn color earlier or later in the fall than its neighbouring aspen clones. Fall colors are usually bright tones of yellow; in some areas, red blushes may be occasionally seen.

As this accelerated in 2004, word spread and a debate over causes began. No insect, disease, or environmental condition is yet specifically identified as a joint cause. Trees adjacent to one another are often stricken or not. In other instances, entire groves have died.\n\nMany areas of the Western US have experienced increased diebacks which are often attributed to ungulate grazing and [[wildfire suppression]]. At high altitudes where grasses can be rare, [[ungulate]]s can browse young aspen sprouts and prevent those young trees from reaching maturity. As a result, some aspen groves close to cattle or other grazing animals, such as deer or elk, have very few young trees and can be invaded by [[conifers]], which are not typically browsed. Another possible deterrent to aspen regeneration is widespread wildfire suppression. Aspens are vigorous [[resprouter]]s and even though the above-ground portion of the organism may die in a wild-fire, the roots, which are often protected from lethal temperatures during a fire, will sprout new trees soon after a fire. Disturbances such as fires seem to be a necessary ecological event in order for aspens to compete with conifers, which tend to replace aspens over long, disturbance-free intervals. The current dieback in the American West may have roots in the strict fire suppression policy in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haskins|display-authors=etal|title=Impact of fire suppression on aspen populations |journal=Forestry and Wildlife Management |date=2007 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=54\u201357}}</ref> On the other hand, the widespread decimation of conifer forests by the [[mountain pine beetle]] may provide increased opportunities for aspen groves to proliferate under the right conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | url =  | doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2013.01.008 | volume=299 | title=How will aspen respond to mountain pine beetle?

It is especially good for panel products such as [[oriented strand board]] and [[waferboard]]. It is light in weight and is used for furniture, boxes and crates, core stock in plywood, and wall panels.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons and category-inline}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline}}\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/poptre/all.html US Forest Service Fire Effects Information System: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091126010525/http://www.abtreegene.com/trees.html Alberta Forest Genetic Resources Council: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/populus-tremuloides-quaking-aspen-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* {{ITIS |id=195773 |taxon=Populus tremuloides |accessdate=8 August 2006}}\n* Farrar, John Laird.

Yet they are still widely used in campgrounds because they are cheap and plentiful and not widely used in building lumber. Pioneers in the North American west used them to create [[log cabins]] and [[dugout (shelter)|dugouts]], though they were not the preferred species.\n\nThe leaves of the quaking aspen and other [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars|species in the genus ''Populus'' serve as food]] for [[caterpillar]]s of various moths and butterflies.\n\nIn Canada, quaking aspen wood is used mainly for pulp products such as books, newsprint, and fine printing paper. It is especially good for panel products such as [[oriented strand board]] and [[waferboard]]. It is light in weight and is used for furniture, boxes and crates, core stock in plywood, and wall panels.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons and category-inline}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline}}\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/poptre/all.html US Forest Service Fire Effects Information System: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091126010525/http://www.abtreegene.com/trees.html Alberta Forest Genetic Resources Council: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/populus-tremuloides-quaking-aspen-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* {{ITIS |id=195773 |taxon=Populus tremuloides |accessdate=8 August 2006}}\n* Farrar, John Laird.

Infection by kauri dieback can rapidly kill seedlings and trees of all ages. Trees of all size classes are killed in natural forest remnants, amenity garden and park trees, and kauri plantations.<ref name=\"Beever2009\" /><ref name=\"Waipara2013\" /><ref name=\"Bellgard2016\" />\n\n== Identification ==\n''Phytophthora agathidicida'' was first discovered on [[Great Barrier Island]] in 1972, but was initially identified from slides as a different organism, ''P. heveae''.<ref name=\"Gadgil1974\" /><ref name=\"Hill2014\" /> Until 2006, all ''Phytophthora'' in mainland New Zealand kauri trees was considered to be ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]''; this species is extremely destructive in Western Australia, and can also infect kauri trees and produce a dieback syndrome.<ref name=\"Podger1971\" /> However, it is not considered to be as serious an issue for kauri as ''P. agathidicida''.<ref name=\"Shilton2017\" />\n\nIn March 2006, entomologist [[Peter Maddison (entomologist)|Peter Maddison]] noticed a distinctly different infection in mature kauri in the [[Wait\u0101kere Ranges]]. Plant pathologists [[Ross Beever]] and Nick Waipara recognised this as a distinct ''Phytophthora'' species and it was named ''Phytophthora'' 'taxon Agathis' (abbreviated PTA).<ref name=\"ICMP_17021\" /><ref name=\"Beever2006\" /> It was formally named ''Phytophthora agathidicida'' in 2015.<ref name=\"Weir2015\" />\n\n''Phytophthora agathidicida'' is a species in the group of ''Phytophthora'' called \u2018Clade 5\u2019 which is defined by [[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS DNA]] sequences.<ref name=\"Cooke2000\" /> Within Clade 5 ''P. agathidicida'' can be distinguished from the other species by DNA sequence differences and oospores that have a moderately bumpy surface.

Current pathogen distribution knowledge is based on soil sampling, ground-truthing and aerial surveillance, but that has usually been limited to stands of kauri showing symptoms, at a coarse scale. Aerial surveillance has not used multi- or hyperspectral imagery or change detection.<ref name=\"science-plan-2018\" />\n\nAnother study linked infected forests with plantings from the Sweetwater Nursery in [[Waipoua Forest]] by the [[New Zealand Forest Service]] in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Beauchamp2014\" /><ref name=\"Beachman2017\" /> Testing, via observation and soil, has been done in the Wait\u0101kere Ranges and reported on, but the peer review section of the report is left blank.<ref name=\"Auckland-council-2017\" /> An independent review of the epidemiology of the Kauri study, found that \"the Auckland data is of limited use if we want to conduct an analysis to identify factors associated with PTA being present\".<ref name=\"epidemiology-scoping\" />\n\n<!-- separate subheading? === Time line === -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

''P. agathidicida'' spores can be carried in soil the size of a pinhead. The consensus among experts is that the predominant vector for spread of the disease is human activity.<ref name=\"FwrXZ\" /><ref name=\"Ap6XH\" /><ref name=\"Auckland-council-2017-dup\" /> This can be seen as 71% of the infected trees in the [[Wait\u0101kere Ranges]] are within 50 metres of public walking tracks.<ref name=\"White-NZgeo\" />\n\n''Phytophthora'' [[zoospores]] require water to germinate from the [[oospore]], and can migrate by themselves through waterlogged soil. ''P. cinnamomi'' zoospores remain mobile for up to 10 hours, and can swim at speeds of up to 58 centimetres per hour. However, their direction of travel frequently changes, so they disperse no more than 6&nbsp;cm by swimming. Consequently, long-distance dispersal of ''Phytophthora'' depends on other forms of transport.<ref name=\"Carlile1985\" />\n\nFeral pigs have been blamed for the spread of kauri dieback due to their tendency to gnaw on the roots of kauri trees, and to transport infected soil on their snouts and trotters.<ref name=\"Krull2013\" /> Research in 2017 suggests the transport of infected roots via the gut of pigs is a relatively minor vector for the spread of the disease.<ref name=\"Bassett2017\" />\n\nWhile only kauri trees develop the characteristic dieback disease following infection, it appears that seven other native New Zealand forest plants can act as hosts for the pathogen without showing symptoms themselves. These include ''[[Dracophyllum]]'', tanekaha (''[[Phyllocladus trichomanoides]]''), tall mingimingi (''[[Leucopogon fasciculatus]]''), rewarewa (''[[Knightia excelsa]]'') and ''[[Astelia trinervia]]''.<ref name=\"Ryder2016\" /><ref name=\"White-NZgeo\" /> It is thought that the community of [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[mycorrhizal fungi]] living on the roots of healthy kauri trees may help protect them from ''Phytophthora'' infection.<ref name=\"Padamsee2016\" />\n\n<!--\n'''''Peter Gadgil was the scientist who first found PTA in 1971 on Great Barrier.

On 20 February 2018, Auckland Council announced that all forested areas of the Wait\u0101kere Ranges would be closed to the public, as the r\u0101hui had not been effective. At-risk parts of the [[Hunua Ranges]] to the south-east of Auckland were also to be closed as a preventive measure, even though kauri dieback had not yet been recorded there.<ref name=\"Council-votes-to-close\" />\n\n=== Treatment ===\nA number of compounds have been identified which are active ''in vitro'' against the pathogen responsible for kauri dieback, including common broad-spectrum [[antifungal]] agents such as [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]].<ref name=\"Lawrence2017\" /> However, there is as yet no established treatment for infected trees, with the large size of mature kauri trees and the remote location of many infected areas making any treatment challenging. Trials are underway using injections of [[Phosphite anion#Use as fungicides|phosphite]] into infected kauri trees, as this is an established treatment against ''Phytophthora'' ''cinnamomi'' in fruit trees such as [[avocado]]s. Dr Ian Horner at [[Plant & Food Research]] began studying the effectiveness of phosphite in 2010.<ref name=\"White-NZgeo\" /> Phosphite injected directly into the trunk of affected trees has been shown to stop the progress of the disease, halting sap bleeding, enabling new bark to grow and prolonging the tree's life.<ref name=\"White-NZgeo\" /> This treatment is effective on trees of a consistent size, but research continues on effective dosages for trees of different sizes.<ref name=\"Williams2016\" /><ref name=\"right-dose\" /><ref name=\"kauri-rescue-mar-2017\" /><ref name=\"Horner2015\" /><ref name=\"Horgan2017\" /> Phosphite treatment can be effective against individual kauri trees, but will not kill the ''Phytophthora'' pathogen in the soil, potentially allowing it to continue to spread to healthy trees nearby.<ref name=\"Scott2014\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dutch elm disease]]\n*''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' \u2013 potato blight\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1=2|refs=\n<ref name=\"Bradshaw2019\">{{cite journal |last1=Bradshaw |first1=R.

Infection by kauri dieback can rapidly kill seedlings and trees of all ages. Trees of all size classes are killed in natural forest remnants, amenity garden and park trees, and kauri plantations.<ref name=\"Beever2009\" /><ref name=\"Waipara2013\" /><ref name=\"Bellgard2016\" />\n\n''Phytophthora agathidicida'' was first discovered on [[Great Barrier Island]] in 1972, but was initially identified from slides as a different organism, ''P. heveae''.<ref name=\"Gadgil1974\" /><ref name=\"Hill2014\" /> Until 2006, all ''Phytophthora'' in mainland New Zealand kauri trees was considered to be ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]''; this species is extremely destructive in Western Australia, and can also infect kauri trees and produce a dieback syndrome.<ref name=\"Podger1971\" /> However, it is not considered to be as serious an issue for kauri as ''P. agathidicida''.<ref name=\"Shilton2017\" />\n\nIn March 2006, entomologist [[Peter Maddison (entomologist)|Peter Maddison]] noticed a distinctly different infection in mature kauri in the [[Wait\u0101kere Ranges]]. Plant pathologists [[Ross Beever]] and Nick Waipara recognised this as a distinct ''Phytophthora'' species and it was named ''Phytophthora'' 'taxon Agathis' (abbreviated PTA).<ref name=\"ICMP_17021\" /><ref name=\"Beever2006\" /> It was formally named ''Phytophthora agathidicida'' in 2015.<ref name=\"Weir2015\" />\n\n''Phytophthora agathidicida'' is a species in the group of ''Phytophthora'' called \u2018Clade 5\u2019 which is defined by [[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS DNA]] sequences.<ref name=\"Cooke2000\" /> Within Clade 5 ''P. agathidicida'' can be distinguished from the other species by DNA sequence differences and oospores that have a moderately bumpy surface.

Current pathogen distribution knowledge is based on soil sampling, ground-truthing and aerial surveillance, but that has usually been limited to stands of kauri showing symptoms, at a coarse scale. Aerial surveillance has not used multi- or hyperspectral imagery or change detection.<ref name=\"science-plan-2018\" />\n\nAnother study linked infected forests with plantings from the Sweetwater Nursery in [[Waipoua Forest]] by the [[New Zealand Forest Service]] in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Beauchamp2014\" /><ref name=\"Beachman2017\" /> Testing, via observation and soil, has been done in the Wait\u0101kere Ranges and reported on, but the peer review section of the report is left blank.<ref name=\"Auckland-council-2017\" /> An independent review of the epidemiology of the Kauri study, found that \"the Auckland data is of limited use if we want to conduct an analysis to identify factors associated with PTA being present\".<ref name=\"epidemiology-scoping\" />\n\n<!-- separate subheading? === Time line === -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

''P. agathidicida'' spores can be carried in soil the size of a pinhead. The consensus among experts is that the predominant vector for spread of the disease is human activity.<ref name=\"FwrXZ\" /><ref name=\"Ap6XH\" /><ref name=\"Auckland-council-2017-dup\" /> This can be seen as 71% of the infected trees in the [[Wait\u0101kere Ranges]] are within 50 metres of public walking tracks.<ref name=\"White-NZgeo\" />\n\n''Phytophthora'' [[zoospores]] require water to germinate from the [[oospore]], and can migrate by themselves through waterlogged soil. ''P. cinnamomi'' zoospores remain mobile for up to 10 hours, and can swim at speeds of up to 58 centimetres per hour. However, their direction of travel frequently changes, so they disperse no more than 6&nbsp;cm by swimming. Consequently, long-distance dispersal of ''Phytophthora'' depends on other forms of transport.<ref name=\"Carlile1985\" />\n\nFeral pigs have been blamed for the spread of kauri dieback due to their tendency to gnaw on the roots of kauri trees, and to transport infected soil on their snouts and trotters.<ref name=\"Krull2013\" /> Research in 2017 suggests the transport of infected roots via the gut of pigs is a relatively minor vector for the spread of the disease.<ref name=\"Bassett2017\" />\n\nWhile only kauri trees develop the characteristic dieback disease following infection, it appears that seven other native New Zealand forest plants can act as hosts for the pathogen without showing symptoms themselves. These include ''[[Dracophyllum]]'', tanekaha (''[[Phyllocladus trichomanoides]]''), tall mingimingi (''[[Leucopogon fasciculatus]]''), rewarewa (''[[Knightia excelsa]]'') and ''[[Astelia trinervia]]''.<ref name=\"Ryder2016\" /><ref name=\"White-NZgeo\" /> It is thought that the community of [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[mycorrhizal fungi]] living on the roots of healthy kauri trees may help protect them from ''Phytophthora'' infection.<ref name=\"Padamsee2016\" />\n\n<!--\n'''''Peter Gadgil was the scientist who first found PTA in 1971 on Great Barrier. He thinks the Waitakere findings were a complete over reaction to a minor pathogen. And said that the Great Barrier site recovered soon after.

On 20 February 2018, Auckland Council announced that all forested areas of the Wait\u0101kere Ranges would be closed to the public, as the r\u0101hui had not been effective. At-risk parts of the [[Hunua Ranges]] to the south-east of Auckland were also to be closed as a preventive measure, even though kauri dieback had not yet been recorded there.<ref name=\"Council-votes-to-close\" />\n\n=== Treatment ===\nA number of compounds have been identified which are active ''in vitro'' against the pathogen responsible for kauri dieback, including common broad-spectrum [[antifungal]] agents such as [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]].<ref name=\"Lawrence2017\" /> However, there is as yet no established treatment for infected trees, with the large size of mature kauri trees and the remote location of many infected areas making any treatment challenging. Trials are underway using injections of [[Phosphite anion#Use as fungicides|phosphite]] into infected kauri trees, as this is an established treatment against ''Phytophthora'' ''cinnamomi'' in fruit trees such as [[avocado]]s. Dr Ian Horner at [[Plant & Food Research]] began studying the effectiveness of phosphite in 2010.<ref name=\"White-NZgeo\" /> Phosphite injected directly into the trunk of affected trees has been shown to stop the progress of the disease, halting sap bleeding, enabling new bark to grow and prolonging the tree's life.<ref name=\"White-NZgeo\" /> This treatment is effective on trees of a consistent size, but research continues on effective dosages for trees of different sizes.<ref name=\"Williams2016\" /><ref name=\"right-dose\" /><ref name=\"kauri-rescue-mar-2017\" /><ref name=\"Horner2015\" /><ref name=\"Horgan2017\" /> Phosphite treatment can be effective against individual kauri trees, but will not kill the ''Phytophthora'' pathogen in the soil, potentially allowing it to continue to spread to healthy trees nearby.<ref name=\"Scott2014\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dutch elm disease]]\n*''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' \u2013 potato blight\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1=2|refs=\n<ref name=\"Bradshaw2019\">{{cite journal |last1=Bradshaw |first1=R.
