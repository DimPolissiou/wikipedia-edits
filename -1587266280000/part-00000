''Abbott's Bay'' in [[Pembroke, Bermuda|Pembroke]], Bermuda, was named after him (but was renamed ''Clarence Cove'' in 1822, when the surrounding [[Admiralty House, Bermuda|Admiralty House]] property, 'til then known as ''St. John's Hill'', was renamed ''Clarence Hill'' in commemoration of Admiral of the Fleet, Prince William, the [[Duke of Clarence]] (later [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]])).

A treaty was signed (2 June), which secured two-thirds of the spice produce of the [[Molucca Islands]], where the disputes had grown hottest, to the Dutch company, and the remaining third to the English. But this settlement was not a permanent one. In 1620 the Dutch infringed some regulations of the treaty, and Abbot in company with Sir [[Dudley Digges]] went on an embassy to Holland to set matters once again on a surer footing. The commissioners were at first well received (20 November 1620) by the [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]] and the states-general; but the Dutch were unwilling to make any concessions, and pursued the negotiations, according to the English accounts, with too much duplicity to admit of any effectual arrangement.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=21}}\n\nIn February 1621<ref>Dates in this article are using the [[Julian Calendar]] with the start of the year adjusted to 1 January (see [[Old Style and New Style dates]])</ref> Abbot returned to London, and in an audience granted him by [[James I of England|James I]] he bitterly complained of the \"base usage\" to which he had been subjected.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=21}} It was clearly impossible to diminish the active feelings of jealousy that existed between the English and Dutch residents in the East Indies, and Abbot shared the sentiment too heartily to enable him to improve the position of affairs. In 1624 matters became more critical. News reached England that [[Ambon Island|Amboyna]], one of the chief trading depots of the Moluccas, had been the scene of the murder of [[Gabriel Towerson (East India Company)|Gabriel Towerson]] and several other English traders by the Dutch. At the time Abbot was holding the office of governor of the company, to which he had been elected 23 March 1624. Intense excitement prevailed throughout the country, and the greatest anxiety was evinced as to the steps that Abbot would take. He recognised at once the necessity of \"pressing the matter modestly\",{{sfn|Lee|1885|pp=21\u201322}} in order to avoid open war with Holland; but in repeated audiences with James I and in petitions and speeches to the privy council he insisted that demand should be made of the Dutch authorities to bring the perpetrators of the outrage to justice. He spoke of withdrawing from the trade altogether if this measure was not adopted, and after much delay the Dutch agreed to give the desired reparation. But death of James I saw the promise unfulfilled, and Abbot's efforts to pursue the question further proved unavailing.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nAbbot not only took a leading part in the affairs of the East India Company during these years, he was also an influential member of the [[Levant Company]] before 1607, and the English merchant service was, from the beginning of the seventeenth century, largely under his control. In 1614 one of his vessels, named the ''Tiger'', was assaulted and taken by \"M. Mintaine, a Frenchman of the ''Mauritius''\",{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}} and Abbot sought redress for the injury in vain. In 1616 he with others received a bounty for building six new ships. In 1612 he was nominated a director of a newly incorporated company \"of merchants of London, discoverers of the north-west passage\",{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}} and his statement that in 1614 he \"brought to the mint 60 pounds weight of gold for Indian commodities exported\" proves that his own commercial transactions continued for many years on a very large scale.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}} He also expressed himself anxious a few years later to open up trade with [[Persia]], and to wrest from the [[Portuguese East India Company]] the commercial predominance they had acquired there.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nDuring the last twenty years of his life Abbot played a still more active part in public affairs. In 1621 he was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Kingston upon Hull (UK Parliament constituency)|Kingston-upon-Hull]];{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}{{sfn|Willis|1750|pp=229\u2013239}} shortly afterwards was nominated one of the commissioners for equipping merchant vessels to take part in a projected expedition against the pirates of Algiers, and he appears to have been consulted by the king's ministers in every stage of the preparations, which were for a long period under discussion.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nOn 17 November 1621 Abbot became a [[customs farmer]], and in 1623 he was empowered to administer \"oaths to such persons as should either desire to pass the seas from this kingdom or to enter it from abroad\".<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1885|p=22}} cites Rymer, F\u0153dera, xvii. 467.</ref> A few months later he was engaged in personal negotiations with [[James I of England|James I]] and [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] for the remission of part of \u00a320,000. claimed by them from the East India Company.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nIn 1624, when he was again returned to parliament for Kingston-upon-Hull,{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}} Abbot was appointed a member of the council for establishing the [[colony of Virginia]]. It was in the same year that he had been elected governor of the East India Company, an office that he was still holding in 1633, but which he resigned before 1638; and during the time that he sat in parliament he was continually called upon to speak in the company's behalf. On many occasions he complained of the obloquy heaped upon himself and his friends, because it was supposed that their extensive foreign trade deprived this country of the benefit of their wealth, and, with a discrimination far in advance of his age, denounced the \"curiousness\" of the English in forbidding the exportation of specie, and asserted the economic advantages to the state of the company's commerce.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nOn the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1625 Abbot was the first to receive the honour of knighthood from the new king,<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1885|p=22}} cites ''Authentic Documents of the Court of Charles I'', i. 15.</ref> and he represented the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] in the [[Useless Parliament]] (the earliest parliament of the reign), although his old constituency had tried hard to secure his services. He apparently supplied some of the jewellery required for Charles's coronation, and received on 5 July of the same year \"\u00a38,000 for a diamond cut in facets and set in a collet\".{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}} On 15 December 1626 Abbot became [[Alderman]] of the ward of [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge Without]], and a few months later was chosen [[Sheriff of London]].{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nIn 1627 the customs department was reorganised, and Abbot with others received a lease of the customs on wines and currants for three and a half years, in consideration of a fine of \u00a312,000 and a loan to the King of \u00a320,000. But he was no servile agent of the crown. On 16 September 1628 information was sent to the king's council that Abbot was one of the merchants who refused to pay a newly imposed additional tax on the importation of currants, and that, while the quarrel was pending, he had broken into the government warehouse where currants belonging to him had been stored. But the supreme authorities do not appear to have pressed the charge against him.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nIn 1637 he was one of those entrusted by the lords of the admiralty with fitting out ships at the expense of the city of London in accordance with the [[ship money#Three writ attempts|ship-money edict]] of 1636, and the attorney-general and the recorder of London shortly afterwards exhibited an information against him in the exchequer court on the ground that he had not provided sufficient men and ammunition. By order of the king's council, however, the proceedings against Abbot were stayed, and the charge dropped. In 1642 the recorder of London, who took part in the matter in behalf of the crown, was impeached by the parliament for having advised Abbot and others to levy ship-money.{{sfn|Lee|1885|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nIn 1638 Sir Maurice Abbot, who had on 13 September 1631 exchanged the ward of Bridge Without for that of [[Coleman Street]], became [[Lord Mayor of London]].{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=23}}{{sfn|Beaven|1908|pp=47\u201375}} The usual description of the pageant prepared to celebrate his introduction into office was from the pen of [[Thomas Heywood]], the dramatist.

On 7 March Abbot was constituted \"the King's lieutenant within the city and suburbs of London\" during his absence in the north,.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=23}} and was given full authority to arm, if necessary, the inhabitants against the King's enemies, and at the discretion of himself and the aldermen to put in force martial law. In the following months he was frequently admonished by the king's council to keep a strict watch over the manufacturers of shot and other warlike implements, and ordered to make arrests of suspected persons. At times his energy in this direction seems to have been excessive. On 28 May he sent to the Poultry Counter a woman suspected to have distributed during the Whitsuntide holidays a pamphlet by [[John Lilburne]], the famous agitator; but the [[House of Lords]] in the following year reversed Abbot's decision.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1885|p=23}} cites House of Lords MSS., Hist.

But death of James I saw the promise unfulfilled, and Abbot's efforts to pursue the question further proved unavailing.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nAbbot not only took a leading part in the affairs of the East India Company during these years, he was also an influential member of the [[Levant Company]] before 1607, and the English merchant service was, from the beginning of the seventeenth century, largely under his control. In 1614 one of his vessels, named the ''Tiger'', was assaulted and taken by \"M. Mintaine, a Frenchman of the ''Mauritius''\",{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}} and Abbot sought redress for the injury in vain. In 1616 he with others received a bounty for building six new ships. In 1612 he was nominated a director of a newly incorporated company \"of merchants of London, discoverers of the north-west passage\",{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}} and his statement that in 1614 he \"brought to the mint 60 pounds weight of gold for Indian commodities exported\" proves that his own commercial transactions continued for many years on a very large scale.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}} He also expressed himself anxious a few years later to open up trade with [[Persia]], and to wrest from the [[Portuguese East India Company]] the commercial predominance they had acquired there.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nDuring the last twenty years of his life Abbot played a still more active part in public affairs. In 1621 he was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Kingston upon Hull (UK Parliament constituency)|Kingston-upon-Hull]];{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}{{sfn|Willis|1750|pp=229\u2013239}} shortly afterwards was nominated one of the commissioners for equipping merchant vessels to take part in a projected expedition against the pirates of Algiers, and he appears to have been consulted by the king's ministers in every stage of the preparations, which were for a long period under discussion.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nOn 17 November 1621 Abbot became a [[customs farmer]], and in 1623 he was empowered to administer \"oaths to such persons as should either desire to pass the seas from this kingdom or to enter it from abroad\".<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1885|p=22}} cites Rymer, F\u0153dera, xvii. 467.</ref> A few months later he was engaged in personal negotiations with [[James I of England|James I]] and [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] for the remission of part of \u00a320,000. claimed by them from the East India Company.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nIn 1624, when he was again returned to parliament for Kingston-upon-Hull,{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}} Abbot was appointed a member of the council for establishing the [[colony of Virginia]]. It was in the same year that he had been elected governor of the East India Company, an office that he was still holding in 1633, but which he resigned before 1638; and during the time that he sat in parliament he was continually called upon to speak in the company's behalf. On many occasions he complained of the obloquy heaped upon himself and his friends, because it was supposed that their extensive foreign trade deprived this country of the benefit of their wealth, and, with a discrimination far in advance of his age, denounced the \"curiousness\" of the English in forbidding the exportation of specie, and asserted the economic advantages to the state of the company's commerce.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nOn the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1625 Abbot was the first to receive the honour of knighthood from the new king,<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1885|p=22}} cites ''Authentic Documents of the Court of Charles I'', i. 15.</ref> and he represented the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] in the [[Useless Parliament]] (the earliest parliament of the reign), although his old constituency had tried hard to secure his services. He apparently supplied some of the jewellery required for Charles's coronation, and received on 5 July of the same year \"\u00a38,000 for a diamond cut in facets and set in a collet\".{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}} On 15 December 1626 Abbot became [[Alderman]] of the ward of [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge Without]], and a few months later was chosen [[Sheriff of London]].{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nIn 1627 the customs department was reorganised, and Abbot with others received a lease of the customs on wines and currants for three and a half years, in consideration of a fine of \u00a312,000 and a loan to the King of \u00a320,000. But he was no servile agent of the crown. On 16 September 1628 information was sent to the king's council that Abbot was one of the merchants who refused to pay a newly imposed additional tax on the importation of currants, and that, while the quarrel was pending, he had broken into the government warehouse where currants belonging to him had been stored. But the supreme authorities do not appear to have pressed the charge against him.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=22}}\n\nIn 1637 he was one of those entrusted by the lords of the admiralty with fitting out ships at the expense of the city of London in accordance with the [[ship money#Three writ attempts|ship-money edict]] of 1636, and the attorney-general and the recorder of London shortly afterwards exhibited an information against him in the exchequer court on the ground that he had not provided sufficient men and ammunition. By order of the king's council, however, the proceedings against Abbot were stayed, and the charge dropped. In 1642 the recorder of London, who took part in the matter in behalf of the crown, was impeached by the parliament for having advised Abbot and others to levy ship-money.{{sfn|Lee|1885|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nIn 1638 Sir Maurice Abbot, who had on 13 September 1631 exchanged the ward of Bridge Without for that of [[Coleman Street]], became [[Lord Mayor of London]].{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=23}}{{sfn|Beaven|1908|pp=47\u201375}} The usual description of the pageant prepared to celebrate his introduction into office was from the pen of [[Thomas Heywood]], the dramatist.

On 7 March Abbot was constituted \"the King's lieutenant within the city and suburbs of London\" during his absence in the north,.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=23}} and was given full authority to arm, if necessary, the inhabitants against the King's enemies, and at the discretion of himself and the aldermen to put in force martial law. In the following months he was frequently admonished by the king's council to keep a strict watch over the manufacturers of shot and other warlike implements, and ordered to make arrests of suspected persons. At times his energy in this direction seems to have been excessive. On 28 May he sent to the Poultry Counter a woman suspected to have distributed during the Whitsuntide holidays a pamphlet by [[John Lilburne]], the famous agitator; but the [[House of Lords]] in the following year reversed Abbot's decision.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1885|p=23}} cites House of Lords MSS., Hist.

There were subsequently calls for the formation of a unified stock exchange. The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited was incorporated in 1980 and trading on the exchange finally commenced on 2 April 1986. Since 1986, a number of major developments have taken place. The 1987 market crash revealed flaws in the market and led to calls for a complete reform of the Hong Kong securities industry. This led to significant regulatory changes and infrastructural developments. As a result, the [[Securities and Futures Commission]] (SFC) was set up in 1989 as the single statutory securities market regulator.\n\nThe market infrastructure was much improved{{how|date=December 2015}} with the introduction by the exchange of the [[Central Clearing and Settlement System]] (CCASS) in June 1992 and the [[order matching system|Automatic Order Matching and Execution System]] (AMS) in November 1993. Since then, the framework of market rules and regulations, both exchange-administered or otherwise, have been undergoing continuing review and revision to meet changing market needs while ensuring effective market\nregulation.\n\nThe Exchange Listing Rules have been made more comprehensive, and other existing regulations have been improved or new regulations introduced to enhance market development and investor protection. Enhancements were also made to the system infrastructure, including the launch of off-floor trading terminals in brokers\u2019 offices in January 1996. The third generation of the trading system, AMS/3, will be launched in 2000. It will provide enhanced functionality and a platform for a straight-through transaction process.\n\nIn respect of market and product development, there are the listing of the first derivative warrant in February 1988, the listing of the first China-incorporated enterprise (H share) in July 1993; and the introduction of regulated short selling in January 1994 and stock options in September 1995. Furthermore, the exchange introduced the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) in November 1999 to provide fund raising opportunities for growth companies of all sizes from all industries, and to promote the development of technology industries in the region.\n\nAccording to the reform plan announced in March 1999, the Exchange, the Hong Kong Futures Exchange and their clearing houses merged into a new holding company, the [[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkexgroup.com/About-HKEX/Company-Information/About-HKEX/History-of-HKEX-and-its-Market?sc_lang=en|title=History of HKEX and its Market|last=|first=|date=|website=HKEX Group|access-date=2017-07-05}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Brief chronology===\n* On 2 April 1986: a new trading hall is opened.

A Hong Kong stock would not be considered a penny stock unless its price was less than about HK$0.50.\n*Each stock has its own individual board lot size (an online broker will usually display this along with the stock price when you get a quote); purchases in amounts which are not multiples of the board lot size are done in a separate \"odd lot market\".\n*There is a close-in-price rule for [[limit order]]s, which must be within 24 ticks of the current price. Individual brokers may impose an even stricter rule; for instance, [[HSBC]] requires limit orders to be within 10 ticks of the current price. Broker support for triggered order types such as [[Order (exchange)#Market-if-touched order|market-if-touched orders]] would allow placing orders further away, which would be sent to the exchange when the price condition was established.\n\n==Twenty largest stocks by market capitalisation==\n<small>''Source: HKEX, in billions of Hong Kong dollars, Data updated on 14 February 2018''</small>\n\n# [[AIA Group|AIA]]: $6,764.32\n# [[Tencent Holdings]]: $4,118.93\n# [[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]]: $2,877.98\n# [[China Construction Bank]]: $2,167.39\n# [[Bank of China]]: $1,803.12\n# [[PetroChina]]: $1,715.53\n# [[Agricultural Bank of China]]: $1,641.43\n# [[HSBC|HSBC Holdings]]: $1,629.79\n# [[Ping An Insurance]]: $1,547.81\n# [[China Mobile]]: $1,509.04\n# [[China Merchants Bank]]: $991.75\n# [[Bank of Communications]]: $985.55\n# [[China Life Insurance Company]]: $844.57\n# [[Postal Savings Bank of China]]: $676.41\n# [[CNOOC|China National Offshore Oil Corporation]]: $492.91\n# [[China Minsheng Bank]]: $420.11\n# [[Bank of China (Hong Kong)|BOC Hong Kong (Holdings)]]: $412.34\n# [[China Pacific Insurance Company]]: $404.37\n# [[CK Hutchison Holdings]]: $377.47\n# [[CITIC Bank International]]: $367.82\n\n==See also==\n* [[A-share (mainland China)]]\n* [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]]\n* [[Companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange]]\n* [[Economy of Hong Kong]]\n* [[H share]]\n* [[Hang Seng Index]]\n* [[Leading stock]]\n* [[List of companies of Hong Kong]]\n* [[List of East Asian stock exchanges]]\n* [[List of stock exchanges]]\n* [[Stock disasters in Hong Kong]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hong Kong Stock Exchange}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111007230700/http://www.hkex.com.hk/ Official site] {{in lang|en|zh}}\n{{Economy of Hong Kong navbox}}\n{{Economy of China}}\n{{Stock exchanges top 18}}\n{{Hong Kong topics}}\n{{China topics}}\n{{coord|22.28414|114.15768|display=title}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Financial services companies established in 1891]]\n[[Category:Finance in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:1891 establishments in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Stock exchanges in Hong Kong]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the parent company|Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2013}}\n{{primary sources|date=October 2017}}\n}}\n\n{{Use Hong Kong English|date=December 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n{{Infobox exchange\n|name       = Stock Exchange of Hong Kong\n|logo       = \n|logo_caption = \n|image      = Hong Kong Exchange Trade Lobby 2007.jpg\n|image_caption = The now-defunct floor trading lobby in 2007\n|type       = [[Stock exchange]]\n|city       = [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]]\n|country    = [[Hong Kong]]\n|coor       = \n|foundation = {{Start date and age|df=yes|1891|2|3}} (as Association of Stockbrokers in Hong Kong)<br><br>{{Start date and age|df=yes|1914|2|21}} (as Hong Kong Stock Exchange)\n|owner      = [[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing]]|\n|key_people = {{ubl|Li Xiaojia, Charles ([[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]])|[[Laura Cha Shih May-lung|Laura Cha]] ([[Chair (official)|Chairman]])}}\n|currency   = [[Hong Kong dollar]]\n|listings   = 2,315 (2018)<ref name=\"2018 Fact Book\" />\n|mcap       = US$3.9 trillion<br>\n[[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]29.9 trillion (2018)<ref name=\"2018 Fact Book\" />\n|volume     = HK$26.09 trillion (2015)\n|indexes    = [[Hang Seng Index]]\n|homepage   = {{URL|www.hkex.com.hk}}\n|footnotes  = \n}}\n{{Chinese\n|title=Stock Exchange of Hong Kong\n|t=\u9999\u6e2f\u806f\u5408\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\n|y=H\u0113ung g\u00f3ng ly\u00f9hn hahp g\u0101au yihk s\u00f3\n|j=Hoeng1 gong2 lyun4 hap6 gaau1 jik6 so2\n|altname=HKEX\n|t2=\u806f\u4ea4\u6240\n|y2=Ly\u00f9hn g\u0101au s\u00f3\n|j2=Lyun4 gaau1 so2\n}}\n[[File:HKEX logo 2016.svg|thumb|202x202px|Logo of [[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing]], owner of SEHK]]\nThe '''Stock Exchange of Hong Kong''' ('''SEHK''', also known as '''Hong Kong stock exchange''') is a [[stock exchange]] based in Hong Kong.

There were subsequently calls for the formation of a unified stock exchange. The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited was incorporated in 1980 and trading on the exchange finally commenced on 2 April 1986. Since 1986, a number of major developments have taken place. The 1987 market crash revealed flaws in the market and led to calls for a complete reform of the Hong Kong securities industry. This led to significant regulatory changes and infrastructural developments. As a result, the [[Securities and Futures Commission]] (SFC) was set up in 1989 as the single statutory securities market regulator.\n\nThe market infrastructure was much improved{{how|date=December 2015}} with the introduction by the exchange of the [[Central Clearing and Settlement System]] (CCASS) in June 1992 and the [[order matching system|Automatic Order Matching and Execution System]] (AMS) in November 1993. Since then, the framework of market rules and regulations, both exchange-administered or otherwise, have been undergoing continuing review and revision to meet changing market needs while ensuring effective market\nregulation.\n\nThe Exchange Listing Rules have been made more comprehensive, and other existing regulations have been improved or new regulations introduced to enhance market development and investor protection. Enhancements were also made to the system infrastructure, including the launch of off-floor trading terminals in brokers\u2019 offices in January 1996. The third generation of the trading system, AMS/3, will be launched in 2000. It will provide enhanced functionality and a platform for a straight-through transaction process.\n\nIn respect of market and product development, there are the listing of the first derivative warrant in February 1988, the listing of the first China-incorporated enterprise (H share) in July 1993; and the introduction of regulated short selling in January 1994 and stock options in September 1995. Furthermore, the exchange introduced the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) in November 1999 to provide fund raising opportunities for growth companies of all sizes from all industries, and to promote the development of technology industries in the region.\n\nAccording to the reform plan announced in March 1999, the Exchange, the Hong Kong Futures Exchange and their clearing houses merged into a new holding company, the [[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkexgroup.com/About-HKEX/Company-Information/About-HKEX/History-of-HKEX-and-its-Market?sc_lang=en|title=History of HKEX and its Market|last=|first=|date=|website=HKEX Group|access-date=2017-07-05}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Brief chronology===\n* On 2 April 1986: a new trading hall is opened.

It was released by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The plot centers on a newspaper editor named Walter Burns who is about to lose his ace reporter and ex-wife Hildy Johnson, newly engaged to another man. Burns suggests they cover one more story together, getting themselves entangled in the case of murderer Earl Williams as Burns desperately tries to win back his wife. The screenplay was adapted from the play ''[[The Front Page]]'' by [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]]. This was the second time the play had been adapted for the screen, the first occasion being the 1931 film also called ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]''.\n\nThe script was written by [[Charles Lederer]] and Ben Hecht, who is not credited for his contributions. The major change in this version, introduced by Hawks, is that the role of Hildy Johnson is a woman. Filming began in September 1939 and finished in November, seven days behind schedule. Production was delayed because the frequent improvisation and numerous ensemble scenes required many retakes. Hawks encouraged his actors to be aggressive and spontaneous, creating several moments in which the characters break the [[fourth wall]]. ''His Girl Friday'' has been noted for its surprises, comedy, and rapid, overlapping dialogue. Hawks himself was determined to break the record for the fastest film dialogue, at the time held by ''The Front Page''. He used a sound mixer on the set to increase the speed of dialogue and held a showing of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his film was.\n\n''His Girl Friday'' was #19 on [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs|100 Years ... 100 Laughs]] and was selected in 1993 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film is in the [[public domain]] because the copyright was not renewed, though the play it was based on is still under copyright.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jackson |first1=Matthew |title=11 Classic Films in the Public Domain |url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/92931/11-classic-films-public-domain |accessdate=4 January 2019 |work=mentalfloss.com |date=6 March 2017 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:His Girl Friday.webm|thumb|thumbtime=19|left|''His Girl Friday'']]\nWalter Burns ([[Cary Grant]]) is a hard-boiled editor for ''The Morning Post'' who learns his ex-wife and former star reporter, Hildegard \"Hildy\" Johnson ([[Rosalind Russell]]),{{Efn|According to [[Pauline Kael]], all female reporters in newspaper films were based on [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]].{{sfn|Haskell|1974|p=134}}}} is about to marry bland insurance man Bruce Baldwin ([[Ralph Bellamy]]) and settle down to a quiet life as a wife and mother in [[Albany, New York]]. Walter determines to sabotage these plans, enticing the reluctant Hildy to cover one last story, the upcoming execution of Earl Williams ([[John Qualen]]) a shy bookkeeper convicted of murdering an African-American policeman. Walter insists Hildy and her fianc\u00e9 Bruce join him for lunch. At the restaurant, Hildy insists that she and Bruce will be leaving in two hours to take a night train to Albany to be married the following day. Walter attempts to convince Bruce that Hildy is the only one who can write a story to save wrongly convicted Earl Williams. After several attempts through deceit and lies to convince Hildy to stay, Hildy eventually agrees on the condition that Walter buys a $100,000 life insurance policy from Bruce in order to receive the $1,000 commission. In the meantime, Hildy bribes the jail warden to let her interview Earl Williams in jail. Williams explains that he shot the police officer by accident. Hildy uses economic theory to explain the murder of the cop to Williams, insisting that he shot the gun because of [[production for use]].\n\nWalter does everything he can to keep Hildy from leaving, first setting up and accusing Bruce of stealing a watch, forcing Hildy to bail him out of jail. Exasperated, Hildy announces her retirement from her profession; however, when Williams escapes from the bumbling [[sheriff]] ([[Gene Lockhart]]) and practically falls into Hildy's lap, the lure of a big [[Scoop (term)|scoop]] proves too much for her. Walter frames Bruce again, and he is immediately sent back to jail. At this point, she realizes that Walter is behind the shenanigans, yet is powerless to bail him out again. Williams comes to the press room holding a gun to Hildy and accidentally shoots a pigeon in fear. Hildy takes the gun from him. Bruce calls, and she tells him to wait because she has Earl Williams in the press room. Williams's friend Mollie comes looking for him, assuring him that she knows he is innocent. When reporters knock at the door, she hides Williams in a roll-top desk. At this time, the building is surrounded by other reporters and cops looking for Williams. Hildy's stern mother-in-law-to-be ([[Alma Kruger]]) enters berating Hildy for the way she is treating Bruce. Upon being harassed for Williams's whereabouts by the reporters, Mollie jumps out of the window but isn't killed. Annoyed, Walter has his colleague \"Diamond Louie\" ([[Abner Biberman]]) remove Mrs. Baldwin from the room \"temporarily\". Hildy wants to try to get Bruce out of jail, but Walter convinces her that she should focus on her breakthrough story.\n[[File:His Girl Friday 3.jpg|thumb|John Qualen in a scene from the film.]]\nBruce comes into the press room having wired Albany for his bail asking about the whereabouts of his mother, as Hildy is frantically typing out her story. She is so consumed with writing the story that she hardly notices as Bruce realizes his cause is hopeless and leaves to return to Albany on the 9 o'clock train. \"Diamond Louie\" enters the room with torn clothes, revealing that he had hit a police car while driving away with Mrs. Baldwin. Louie reveals that he wasn't sure whether or not she was killed in the accident. The crooked mayor ([[Clarence Kolb]]) and sheriff need the publicity from the execution to keep their jobs in an upcoming election, so when a messenger ([[Billy Gilbert]]) brings them a reprieve from the governor, they try to bribe the man to go away and return later, when it will be too late. Walter and Hildy find out in time to save Williams from the gallows and they use the information to blackmail the mayor and sheriff into dropping Walter's arrest for kidnapping Mrs. Baldwin. Hildy receives one last call from Bruce, again in jail because of having counterfeit money that was unknowingly transferred to him by Hildy from Walter. Hildy breaks down and admits to Walter that she was afraid that Walter was going to let her marry Bruce without a fight. Walter and Hildy send money to bail Bruce out of jail.\n\nAfterward, Walter tells Hildy they're going to remarry, and promises to take her on the honeymoon they never had in [[Niagara Falls]]. But then Walter learns that there is a newsworthy strike in Albany, which is on the way to Niagara Falls by train. Hildy agrees to honeymoon in Albany, accepting that Walter will never change. Walter leads Hildy out of the press room, asking her to carry her own suitcase.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:HisgirlFriday.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Cary Grant]] and [[Rosalind Russell]].]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Walter Burns\n* [[Rosalind Russell]] as Hildy Johnson\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as Bruce Baldwin\n* [[Gene Lockhart]] as Sheriff Hartwell\n* [[Porter Hall]] as Murphy\n* [[Ernest Truex]] as Bensinger\n* [[Cliff Edwards]] as Endicott\n* [[Clarence Kolb]] as the Mayor\n* [[Roscoe Karns]] as McCue\n* [[Frank Jenks]] as Wilson\n* [[Regis Toomey]] as Sanders\n* [[Abner Biberman]] as Louie\n* [[Frank Orth]] as Duffy\n* [[John Qualen]] as Earl Williams \n* [[Helen Mack]] as Mollie Malloy\n* [[Alma Kruger]] as Mrs. Baldwin\n* [[Billy Gilbert]] as Joe Pettibone\n* [[Pat West (actor)|Pat West]] as Warden Cooley\n* [[Edwin Maxwell (actor)|Edwin Maxwell]] as Dr. Eggelhoffer\n* [[Marion Martin]] as Evangeline (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n[[File:Howard Hawks head shot.jpg|thumb|left|Director Howard Hawks.]]\nWhile producing ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (1939), Howard Hawks tried to pitch a remake of ''The Front Page'' to [[Harry Cohn]] of Columbia Pictures. [[Cary Grant]] was almost immediately cast in the film, but Cohn initially intended Grant to play the reporter, with radio commentator [[Walter Winchell]] as the editor.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=278}} Hawks' production that became ''His Girl Friday'' was originally intended to be a straightforward adaptation of ''The Front Page'', with both the editor and reporter being male.{{Efn|A \"[[Girl Friday (idiom)|girl Friday]]\" is an assistant who carries out a variety of chores. The name alludes to \"Friday\", [[Robinson Crusoe]]'s native male [[dogsbody]] in [[Daniel Defoe]]'s novel. According to Merriam-Webster's, the term was first used in 1940 (the year the film was released).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/girl%20friday|title=Girl Friday|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref>}} But during auditions, a woman, Howard Hawks' secretary, read reporter Hildy Johnson's lines. Hawks liked the way the dialogue sounded coming from a woman, resulting in the script being rewritten to make Hildy female and the ex-wife of editor Walter Burns played by Cary Grant.{{sfn|Phillips|2010|p=308}} Cohn purchased the rights for ''The Front Page'' in January 1939.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}}\n\nAlthough Hawks considered the dialogue of ''The Front Page'' to be \"the finest modern dialogue that had been written\", more than half of it was replaced with what Hawks believed to be better lines.{{sfn|Mast|1982|pp=208-209}} Some of the original dialogue was left the same, as were all of the characters' names with two exceptions: Hildy's fianc\u00e9 (now no longer a fianc\u00e9e) was given the name Bruce Baldwin{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}}, and the name of the comic messenger bringing the pardon from the governor was changed from Pincus to Pettibone.{{sfn|Birmingham|1984|p=261}} [[Harry Cohn]] of [[Columbia Pictures]] approved Hawks' idea for the film project. Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, the writers of the original play, were unavailable for screenwriting. Consequently, Hawks considered [[Gene Fowler]] as the screenwriter, but he declined the job because he disliked the changes to the screenplay Hawks intended to make.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} Hawks instead recruited [[Charles Lederer]] who had worked on the adaptation for ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'' to work on the screenplay.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=96}} Though he was not credited, Hecht did assist Lederer in the adaptation.{{sfn|Martin|1985|p=95}} Additions were made at the beginning of the screenplay by Lederer to give the characters a convincing backstory so it was decided that Hildy and Walter would be divorced with Hildy's intentions of remarriage serving as Walter's motivation to win her back.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=97}}\n\nDuring writing, Hawks was in Palm Springs directing ''Only Angels Have Wings'', yet stayed in close contact with Lederer and Hecht.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} Hecht helped Lederer with some organizational revisions and Lederer finished the script on May 22. After two more drafts completed by July, Hawks called [[Morrie Ryskind]] to revise the dialogue and make it more interesting. Ryskind revised the script throughout the summer and finished by the end of September before filming began. More than half of the original dialogue was rewritten.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} The film lacks one of the well-known final lines of the play, \"the son-of-a-bitch stole my watch!\", because films of the time were more censored than [[Pre-code Hollywood]] films and Hawks felt that the line was too overused. Ryskind developed a new ending in which Walter and Hildy start fighting immediately after saying \"I do\" in the wedding, they hold in the newsroom with one of the characters stating, \"I think it's gonna turn out all right this time.\" However, after revealing the ending to a few writers at Columbia one evening, Ryskind was surprised to hear that his ending was filmed on another set a few days later.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=281}} Forced to create another ending, Ryskind ended up thanking the anonymous Columbia writer, because he felt that his ending and one of his final lines, \"I wonder if Bruce can put us up,\" were better than what he had written originally.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=281}} After reviewing the screenplay, the [[Hays Office]] saw no issues with the film, besides a few derogatory comments towards newsmen and some illegal behavior of the characters. During some rewrites for censors, Hawks focused on finding a lead actress for his film.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=281-282}}\n\n[[File:His Girl Friday still 2.jpg|200px|thumb|Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, and Ralph Bellamy in a promotional picture for the film.]]\n\n===Casting===\nHawks had difficulty casting ''His Girl Friday''. While the choice of Cary Grant was almost instantaneous, the casting of Hildy was a more extended process. At first, Hawks wanted [[Carole Lombard]], whom he had directed in the screwball comedy ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1934), but the cost of hiring Lombard in her new status as a freelancer proved to be far too expensive, and Columbia could not afford her. [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Margaret Sullavan]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Irene Dunne]] were offered the role, but turned it down. Dunne rejected the role because she felt the part was too small and needed to be expanded. [[Jean Arthur]] was offered the part, and was suspended by the studio when she refused to take it. [[Joan Crawford]] was reportedly also considered.<ref name=tcmnotes>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=206&category=Notes Notes TCM]</ref> Hawks then turned to Rosalind Russell, who had just finished MGM's ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939).{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=282}} Russell was upset when she discovered from a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article that Cohn was \"stuck\" with her after attempting to cast many other actresses. Before Russell's first meeting with Hawks, to show her apathy, she took a swim and entered his office with wet hair, causing him to do a \"triple take\". Russell confronted him about this casting issue; he dismissed her quickly and asked her to go to wardrobe.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=282}}\n\n===Filming===\nAfter makeup, wardrobe, and photography tests, filming began on September 27. The film had the working title of ''The Bigger They Are''.<ref name=tcmarticle>{{cite web| last=Miller | first=Frank | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=206&category=Articles|title= His Girl Friday}}</ref> In her autobiography, ''Life Is A Banquet'', Russell wrote that she thought her role did not have as many good lines as Grant's, so she hired her own writer to \"punch up\" her dialogue. With Hawks encouraging ad-libbing on the set, Russell was able to slip her personal, paid writer's work into the movie. Only Grant was wise to this tactic and greeted her each morning saying, \"What have you got today?\"<ref>New York : Random House, 1977. {{ISBN|978-0-394-42134-6}} OCLC 3017310</ref> Her ghostwriter gave her some of the lines for the restaurant scene, which is unique to ''His Girl Friday''. It was one of the most complicated scenes to film; because of the rapidity of the dialogue, none of the actors actually eat during the scene despite the fact that there is food in the scene. Hawks shot this scene with one camera a week and a half into production and it took four days to film instead of the intended two.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=285}} The film was shot with some improvisation of lines and actions, with Hawks giving the actors freedom to experiment, as he did with his comedies more than his dramas.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=283}} The film is noted for its rapid-fire repartee, using overlapping dialogue to make conversations sound more realistic, with one character speaking before another finishes. Although overlapping dialog is specified and cued in the 1928 play script by Hecht and MacArthur,<ref>Hecht, Ben, & Charles MacArthur, ''The Front Page'', 1928. Samuel French, Inc.</ref> Hawks told [[Peter Bogdanovich]]:\n\n<blockquote>I had noticed that when people talk, they talk ''over'' one another, especially people who talk fast or who are arguing or describing something. So we wrote the dialogue in a way that made the beginnings and ends of sentences unnecessary; they were there for overlapping.{{sfn|Bogdanovich|1997}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:His Girl Friday 6.jpg|thumb|left|L. to R. : Cary Grant, Frank Jenks, Roscoe Karns, Gene Lockhart, Pat Flaherty, Porter Hall, Alma Kruger, and Rosalind Russell in one of the final scenes of the film.]]\nTo get the effect he wanted, as [[multi-track sound recording]] was not yet available at the time, Hawks had the sound mixer on the set turn the various overhead microphones on and off as required for the scene, as many as 35 times.<ref name=tcmarticle /> Reportedly, the film was sped up because of a challenge Hawks took upon himself to break the record for the fastest dialogue on screen, at the time held by ''The Front Page''.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=283}} Hawks arranged a showing for newsmen of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his dialogue was.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}} Filming was difficult for the cinematographers because the improvisation made it difficult to know what the characters were going to do. Rosalind Russell was also difficult to film because her lack of a sharp jawline required makeup artists to paint and blend a dark line under her jawline while shining a light on her face to simulate a more youthful appearance.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}}\n\nHawks encouraged aggressiveness and unexpectedness in the acting, a few times breaking the [[fourth wall]] in the film. At one point, Grant broke character because of something unscripted that Russell did and looked directly at the camera saying, \"Is she going to do that?\". Hawks decided to leave this scene in the picture.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}} Owing to the numerous ensemble scenes, many retakes were necessary. Having learned from ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), Hawks added some [[straight man|straight]] supporting characters in order to balance out the leading characters.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=285}} [[Arthur Rosson]] worked for three days on [[second unit]] footage at [[Columbia Ranch]]. Filming was completed on November 21, seven days past schedule. Unusually for the time period, the film contains no music besides the music that leads to the final fade out of the film.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=286}}\n\n====Ad-libs by Grant====\nGrant's character describes Bellamy's character by saying \"He looks like that fellow in the movies, you know ... Ralph Bellamy!\" According to Bellamy, the remark was ad-libbed by Grant.<ref name=tcmnotes /> Columbia studio head [[Harry Cohn]] thought it was too cheeky and ordered it removed, but Hawks insisted that it stay. Grant makes several other \"inside\" remarks in the film. When his character is arrested for kidnapping, he describes the horrendous fate suffered by the last person who crossed him: Archie Leach (Grant's birth name).{{sfn|Fetherling|1977|p=85}} Another line that people think is an inside remark is when Earl Williams attempts to get out of the rolltop desk he's been hiding in, Grant says, \"Get back in there, you Mock Turtle.\" The line is a \"cleaned-up\" version of a line from the stage version of ''The Front Page'' (\"Get back in there, you God damned turtle!\") and Grant also played \"The Mock Turtle\" in the 1933 film version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1933 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.<ref name=tcmarticle />\n\n==Release==\nRelease of the film was rushed by Cohn and a sneak preview of the film was held in December, with a press screening on January 3, 1940.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=286}} ''His Girl Friday'' premiered in [[New York City]] at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on January 11, 1940, and went into general American release a week later.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cohn |first1=Herbert |title='His Girl Friday' Makes Gay Music Hall Comedy |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52684151/?terms=%22%27His+Girl+Friday%27+Makes%22 |accessdate=27 June 2018 |newspaper=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle |date=January 12, 1940 |page=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=At the Logan Wednesday |url=https://basic.newspapers.com/image/85484391/?terms=his+girl+friday |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=The Logan Daily News |date=January 22, 1940}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nContemporary reviews from critics were very positive.

The world in this film is not determined by gender, but rather by intelligence and capability. At the beginning of the film Hildy says that she wants to be \"treated like a woman\", but her return to her profession reveals her true desire to live a different life.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=105}} In ''His Girl Friday'', even though the characters remarry, Hawks displays an aversion to marriage, home, and family through his approach to the film. Specific, exclusionary camera work and character control of the frame and the dialogue portray a subtle criticism of domesticity. {{sfn|Danks|2016|pp=35-38}} The subject of domesticity is fairly absent throughout the film. Even among the relationships between Grant and Russell and Bellamy and Russell, the relationships are positioned within a larger frame of the male-dominated newsroom.{{sfn|Danks|2016|pp=35-38}} The film, like many comedies, celebrates difficult, tumultuous love rather than secure, suburban love through its preference for movement and argument rather than silent poise.{{sfn|Haskell|1974|p=126}} Film critic [[Molly Haskell]] wrote that the scene near the end of the film when Hildy sheds tears was not included to expose her femininity, but to express the confusion she felt due to the collision of her professional and feminine natures. The feminine side of Hildy desires to be subservient and sexually relate to men, while the other side of Hildy desires assertion and to forfeit the stereotypical duties of a woman. Her tears represent her emotional helplessness and inability to express anger to a male authority figure.{{sfn|Haskell|1974|pp=133-134}}\n\nA commonality in many Howard Hawks films is the revelation of the amorality of the main character and a failure of that character to change or develop. In ''His Girl Friday'', Walter Burns manipulates, acts selfishly, frames his ex-wife's fianc\u00e9, and orchestrates the kidnapping of an elderly woman. Even at the end of the film, Burns convinces Hildy Johnson to remarry him despite how much she loathes him and his questionable actions. Upon the resumption of their relationship, there is no romance visible between them. They do not kiss, embrace, or even gaze at each other. It is evident that Burns is still the same person he was in their previous relationship as he quickly waves off the plans for the honeymoon that they never had in pursuit of a new story. Additionally, he walks in front of her when exiting the room, forcing her to carry her own suitcase, despite Johnson having already criticized this at the beginning of the film. This hints that the marriage is fated to face the same problems that ended it previously.{{sfn|Dibbern|2016|p=230}}\n\nHawks is known for his use of repeated or intentional gestures in his films. In ''His Girl Friday'', the cigarette in the scene between Hildy and Earl Williams serves several symbolic roles in the film. First, the cigarette establishes a link between the characters when Williams accepts the cigarette even though he does not smoke. However, the fact that he doesn't smoke and they don't share the cigarette shows the difference between and separation of the worlds in which the two characters live.<ref>{{harvnb|Neale|2016|p=110}}; {{harvnb|McElhaney|2006|pp=31\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe film contains two main plots: the romantic and the professional. Walter and Hildy work together to attempt to release wrongly convicted Earl Williams, while the concurrent plot is Walter attempting to win back Hildy. The two plots do not resolve at the same time, but they are interdependent because although Williams is released before Walter and Hildy get back together, he is the reason for their reconciliation.{{sfn|Bordwell|1985|p=158}} The speed of the film results in snappy and overlapping dialogue among interruptions and rapid speech. Gesture, character and camera movement, as well as editing, serve to complement the dialogue in increasing the pace of the film. There is a clear contrast between the fast-talking Hildy and Walter and slow-talking Bruce and Earl which serves to emphasize the gap between the intelligent and the unintelligent in the film. The average word per minute count of the film is 240 while the average American speech is around 140 words per minute. There are nine scenes with at least four words per second and at least two with more than five words per second.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=103}} Hawks attached verbal tags before and after specific script lines so the actors would be able to interrupt and talk over each other without making the necessary dialogue incomprehensible.{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=49}}\n\nFilm theorist and historian [[David Bordwell]] explained the ending of ''His Girl Friday'' as a \"closure effect\" rather than a closure. The ending of the film is rather circular and there is no development of characters, specifically Walter Burns, and the film ends similarly to the way in which it starts. Additionally, the film ends with a brief epilogue in which Walter announces their remarriage and reveals their intention to go cover a strike in Albany on the way to their honeymoon. The fates of the main characters and even some of the minor characters such as Earl William are revealed, although there are minor flaws in the resolution. For example, they do not discuss what happened to Molly Malloy after the conflict is resolved. However, the main characters\u2019 endings were wrapped up so well that it overshadows the need for the minor characters' endings to be wrapped up. This creates a \"closure effect\" or an appearance of closure.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordwell|1985|p=159}}; {{harvnb|Dibbern|2016|p=230}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n''His Girl Friday'' (often along with ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' and ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'') is cited as an archetype of the screwball comedy genre.{{sfn|Brookes|2016|p=2}} In 1993, the [[Library of Congress]] selected ''His Girl Friday'' for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite web| title= U.S. National Film Registry \u2014 Titles| url= https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/Unofficial/Movies/NFR-Titles.html#1993 | work= Clamen's Movie Information Collection| first= Stewart M. |last=Clamen| publisher = [[Carnegie Mellon University]] | accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref> The film ranked 19th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs|100 Years ... 100 Laughs]], a 2000 list of the funniest American comedies.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/laughs100.pdf | title= America's Funniest Movies | publisher= [[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref> Prior to ''His Girl Friday'' the play ''The Front Page'' had been adapted for the screen once before, in the 1931 film, also called ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'', produced by [[Howard Hughes]], with [[Adolphe Menjou]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]] in the starring roles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fristoe |first1=Roger |last2=Nixon |first2=Rob |title=The Front Page (1931) |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/64127%7C0/The-Front-Page.html |website=Film Article |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> In this first film adaptation of the Broadway play of the same title (written by former Chicago newsmen Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur), Hildy Johnson was male.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\n''His Girl Friday'' was dramatized as a one-hour radio play on the September 30, 1940 broadcast of [[Lux Radio Theater]] with [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Fred MacMurray]] and [[Jack Carson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KrRQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kiIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5650%2C6978940&q=%22Theater%22 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Spotlighting the Dial \u2013 Dramatic Programs\n|page=2 (Green Sheet) |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |date=1940-09-30 |accessdate=2018-08-23 }}</ref> It was dramatized again with a half-hour version on [[The Screen Guild Theater]] on March 30, 1941 with Grant and Russell reprising their film roles.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PfUaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YEwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6359%2C2752286 |title=TONIGHT - 7:30 WJAS (advertisement) |page=3 (section 5) |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press |date=1941-03-30 |accessdate=2018-08-23 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ScreenGuildTheater/Sgt_41-03-30_ep080_His_Girl_Friday.mp3|title=Screen Guild Theater|date=March 26, 2007|website=Internet Archive}}</ref> \"The Front Page\" was remade in a [[The Front Page (1974 film)|1974 Billy Wilder movie]] starring Walter Matthau as Walter Burns, Jack Lemmon as Hildy Johnson, and Susan Sarandon as his fianc\u00e9e. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Canby |first1=Vincent |title=Wilder's Uneven Film of 'Front Page' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/19/archives/wilders-uneven-film-of-front-page-the-cast.html |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=December 19, 1974}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Winners and Nominees: The Front Page |url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/film/front-page |website=Golden Globes Awards |publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n''His Girl Friday'' and the original Hecht and MacArthur play were later adapted into another stage play, ''His Girl Friday'', by playwright [[John Guare]].

[[Howard Hawks]] and starring [[Cary Grant]] and [[Rosalind Russell]]. It was released by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The plot centers on a newspaper editor named Walter Burns who is about to lose his ace reporter and ex-wife Hildy Johnson, newly engaged to another man. Burns suggests they cover one more story together, getting themselves entangled in the case of murderer Earl Williams as Burns desperately tries to win back his wife. The screenplay was adapted from the play ''[[The Front Page]]'' by [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]]. This was the second time the play had been adapted for the screen, the first occasion being the 1931 film also called ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]''.\n\nThe script was written by [[Charles Lederer]] and Ben Hecht, who is not credited for his contributions. The major change in this version, introduced by Hawks, is that the role of Hildy Johnson is a woman. Filming began in September 1939 and finished in November, seven days behind schedule. Production was delayed because the frequent improvisation and numerous ensemble scenes required many retakes. Hawks encouraged his actors to be aggressive and spontaneous, creating several moments in which the characters break the [[fourth wall]]. ''His Girl Friday'' has been noted for its surprises, comedy, and rapid, overlapping dialogue. Hawks himself was determined to break the record for the fastest film dialogue, at the time held by ''The Front Page''. He used a sound mixer on the set to increase the speed of dialogue and held a showing of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his film was.\n\n''His Girl Friday'' was #19 on [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs|100 Years ... 100 Laughs]] and was selected in 1993 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film is in the [[public domain]] because the copyright was not renewed, though the play it was based on is still under copyright.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jackson |first1=Matthew |title=11 Classic Films in the Public Domain |url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/92931/11-classic-films-public-domain |accessdate=4 January 2019 |work=mentalfloss.com |date=6 March 2017 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:His Girl Friday.webm|thumb|thumbtime=19|left|''His Girl Friday'']]\nWalter Burns ([[Cary Grant]]) is a hard-boiled editor for ''The Morning Post'' who learns his ex-wife and former star reporter, Hildegard \"Hildy\" Johnson ([[Rosalind Russell]]),{{Efn|According to [[Pauline Kael]], all female reporters in newspaper films were based on [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]].{{sfn|Haskell|1974|p=134}}}} is about to marry bland insurance man Bruce Baldwin ([[Ralph Bellamy]]) and settle down to a quiet life as a wife and mother in [[Albany, New York]]. Walter determines to sabotage these plans, enticing the reluctant Hildy to cover one last story, the upcoming execution of Earl Williams ([[John Qualen]]) a shy bookkeeper convicted of murdering an African-American policeman. Walter insists Hildy and her fianc\u00e9 Bruce join him for lunch. At the restaurant, Hildy insists that she and Bruce will be leaving in two hours to take a night train to Albany to be married the following day. Walter attempts to convince Bruce that Hildy is the only one who can write a story to save wrongly convicted Earl Williams. After several attempts through deceit and lies to convince Hildy to stay, Hildy eventually agrees on the condition that Walter buys a $100,000 life insurance policy from Bruce in order to receive the $1,000 commission. In the meantime, Hildy bribes the jail warden to let her interview Earl Williams in jail. Williams explains that he shot the police officer by accident. Hildy uses economic theory to explain the murder of the cop to Williams, insisting that he shot the gun because of [[production for use]].\n\nWalter does everything he can to keep Hildy from leaving, first setting up and accusing Bruce of stealing a watch, forcing Hildy to bail him out of jail. Exasperated, Hildy announces her retirement from her profession; however, when Williams escapes from the bumbling [[sheriff]] ([[Gene Lockhart]]) and practically falls into Hildy's lap, the lure of a big [[Scoop (term)|scoop]] proves too much for her. Walter frames Bruce again, and he is immediately sent back to jail. At this point, she realizes that Walter is behind the shenanigans, yet is powerless to bail him out again. Williams comes to the press room holding a gun to Hildy and accidentally shoots a pigeon in fear. Hildy takes the gun from him. Bruce calls, and she tells him to wait because she has Earl Williams in the press room. Williams's friend Mollie comes looking for him, assuring him that she knows he is innocent. When reporters knock at the door, she hides Williams in a roll-top desk. At this time, the building is surrounded by other reporters and cops looking for Williams. Hildy's stern mother-in-law-to-be ([[Alma Kruger]]) enters berating Hildy for the way she is treating Bruce. Upon being harassed for Williams's whereabouts by the reporters, Mollie jumps out of the window but isn't killed. Annoyed, Walter has his colleague \"Diamond Louie\" ([[Abner Biberman]]) remove Mrs. Baldwin from the room \"temporarily\". Hildy wants to try to get Bruce out of jail, but Walter convinces her that she should focus on her breakthrough story.\n[[File:His Girl Friday 3.jpg|thumb|John Qualen in a scene from the film.]]\nBruce comes into the press room having wired Albany for his bail asking about the whereabouts of his mother, as Hildy is frantically typing out her story. She is so consumed with writing the story that she hardly notices as Bruce realizes his cause is hopeless and leaves to return to Albany on the 9 o'clock train. \"Diamond Louie\" enters the room with torn clothes, revealing that he had hit a police car while driving away with Mrs. Baldwin. Louie reveals that he wasn't sure whether or not she was killed in the accident. The crooked mayor ([[Clarence Kolb]]) and sheriff need the publicity from the execution to keep their jobs in an upcoming election, so when a messenger ([[Billy Gilbert]]) brings them a reprieve from the governor, they try to bribe the man to go away and return later, when it will be too late. Walter and Hildy find out in time to save Williams from the gallows and they use the information to blackmail the mayor and sheriff into dropping Walter's arrest for kidnapping Mrs. Baldwin. Hildy receives one last call from Bruce, again in jail because of having counterfeit money that was unknowingly transferred to him by Hildy from Walter. Hildy breaks down and admits to Walter that she was afraid that Walter was going to let her marry Bruce without a fight. Walter and Hildy send money to bail Bruce out of jail.\n\nAfterward, Walter tells Hildy they're going to remarry, and promises to take her on the honeymoon they never had in [[Niagara Falls]]. But then Walter learns that there is a newsworthy strike in Albany, which is on the way to Niagara Falls by train. Hildy agrees to honeymoon in Albany, accepting that Walter will never change. Walter leads Hildy out of the press room, asking her to carry her own suitcase.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:HisgirlFriday.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Cary Grant]] and [[Rosalind Russell]].]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Walter Burns\n* [[Rosalind Russell]] as Hildy Johnson\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as Bruce Baldwin\n* [[Gene Lockhart]] as Sheriff Hartwell\n* [[Porter Hall]] as Murphy\n* [[Ernest Truex]] as Bensinger\n* [[Cliff Edwards]] as Endicott\n* [[Clarence Kolb]] as the Mayor\n* [[Roscoe Karns]] as McCue\n* [[Frank Jenks]] as Wilson\n* [[Regis Toomey]] as Sanders\n* [[Abner Biberman]] as Louie\n* [[Frank Orth]] as Duffy\n* [[John Qualen]] as Earl Williams \n* [[Helen Mack]] as Mollie Malloy\n* [[Alma Kruger]] as Mrs. Baldwin\n* [[Billy Gilbert]] as Joe Pettibone\n* [[Pat West (actor)|Pat West]] as Warden Cooley\n* [[Edwin Maxwell (actor)|Edwin Maxwell]] as Dr. Eggelhoffer\n* [[Marion Martin]] as Evangeline (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n[[File:Howard Hawks head shot.jpg|thumb|left|Director Howard Hawks.]]\nWhile producing ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (1939), Howard Hawks tried to pitch a remake of ''The Front Page'' to [[Harry Cohn]] of Columbia Pictures. [[Cary Grant]] was almost immediately cast in the film, but Cohn initially intended Grant to play the reporter, with radio commentator [[Walter Winchell]] as the editor.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=278}} Hawks' production that became ''His Girl Friday'' was originally intended to be a straightforward adaptation of ''The Front Page'', with both the editor and reporter being male.{{Efn|A \"[[Girl Friday (idiom)|girl Friday]]\" is an assistant who carries out a variety of chores. The name alludes to \"Friday\", [[Robinson Crusoe]]'s native male [[dogsbody]] in [[Daniel Defoe]]'s novel. According to Merriam-Webster's, the term was first used in 1940 (the year the film was released).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/girl%20friday|title=Girl Friday|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref>}} But during auditions, a woman, Howard Hawks' secretary, read reporter Hildy Johnson's lines. Hawks liked the way the dialogue sounded coming from a woman, resulting in the script being rewritten to make Hildy female and the ex-wife of editor Walter Burns played by Cary Grant.{{sfn|Phillips|2010|p=308}} Cohn purchased the rights for ''The Front Page'' in January 1939.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}}\n\nAlthough Hawks considered the dialogue of ''The Front Page'' to be \"the finest modern dialogue that had been written\", more than half of it was replaced with what Hawks believed to be better lines.{{sfn|Mast|1982|pp=208-209}} Some of the original dialogue was left the same, as were all of the characters' names with two exceptions: Hildy's fianc\u00e9 (now no longer a fianc\u00e9e) was given the name Bruce Baldwin{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}}, and the name of the comic messenger bringing the pardon from the governor was changed from Pincus to Pettibone.{{sfn|Birmingham|1984|p=261}} [[Harry Cohn]] of [[Columbia Pictures]] approved Hawks' idea for the film project. Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, the writers of the original play, were unavailable for screenwriting. Consequently, Hawks considered [[Gene Fowler]] as the screenwriter, but he declined the job because he disliked the changes to the screenplay Hawks intended to make.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} Hawks instead recruited [[Charles Lederer]] who had worked on the adaptation for ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'' to work on the screenplay.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=96}} Though he was not credited, Hecht did assist Lederer in the adaptation.{{sfn|Martin|1985|p=95}} Additions were made at the beginning of the screenplay by Lederer to give the characters a convincing backstory so it was decided that Hildy and Walter would be divorced with Hildy's intentions of remarriage serving as Walter's motivation to win her back.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=97}}\n\nDuring writing, Hawks was in Palm Springs directing ''Only Angels Have Wings'', yet stayed in close contact with Lederer and Hecht.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} Hecht helped Lederer with some organizational revisions and Lederer finished the script on May 22. After two more drafts completed by July, Hawks called [[Morrie Ryskind]] to revise the dialogue and make it more interesting. Ryskind revised the script throughout the summer and finished by the end of September before filming began. More than half of the original dialogue was rewritten.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=279}} The film lacks one of the well-known final lines of the play, \"the son-of-a-bitch stole my watch!\", because films of the time were more censored than [[Pre-code Hollywood]] films and Hawks felt that the line was too overused. Ryskind developed a new ending in which Walter and Hildy start fighting immediately after saying \"I do\" in the wedding, they hold in the newsroom with one of the characters stating, \"I think it's gonna turn out all right this time.\" However, after revealing the ending to a few writers at Columbia one evening, Ryskind was surprised to hear that his ending was filmed on another set a few days later.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=281}} Forced to create another ending, Ryskind ended up thanking the anonymous Columbia writer, because he felt that his ending and ones of his final lines, \"I wonder if Bruce can put us up,\" were better than what he had written originally.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=281}} After reviewing the screenplay, the [[Hays Office]] saw no issues with the film, besides a few derogatory comments towards newsmen and some illegal behavior of the characters. During some rewrites for censors, Hawks focused on finding a lead actress for his film.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=281-282}}\n\n[[File:His Girl Friday still 2.jpg|200px|thumb|Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, and Ralph Bellamy in a promotional picture for the film.]]\n\n===Casting===\nHawks had difficulty casting ''His Girl Friday''. While the choice of Cary Grant was almost instantaneous, the casting of Hildy was a more extended process. At first, Hawks wanted [[Carole Lombard]], whom he had directed in the screwball comedy ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1934), but the cost of hiring Lombard in her new status as a freelancer proved to be far too expensive, and Columbia could not afford her. [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Margaret Sullavan]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Irene Dunne]] were offered the role, but turned it down. Dunne rejected the role because she felt the part was too small and needed to be expanded. [[Jean Arthur]] was offered the part, and was suspended by the studio when she refused to take it. [[Joan Crawford]] was reportedly also considered.<ref name=tcmnotes>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=206&category=Notes Notes TCM]</ref> Hawks then turned to Rosalind Russell, who had just finished MGM's ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939).{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=282}} Russell was upset when she discovered from a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article that Cohn was \"stuck\" with her after attempting to cast many other actresses. Before Russell's first meeting with Hawks, to show her apathy, she took a swim and entered his office with wet hair, causing him to do a \"triple take\". Russell confronted him about this casting issue; he dismissed her quickly and asked her to go to wardrobe.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=282}}\n\n===Filming===\nAfter makeup, wardrobe, and photography tests, filming began on September 27. The film had the working title of ''The Bigger They Are''.<ref name=tcmarticle>{{cite web| last=Miller | first=Frank | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=206&category=Articles|title= His Girl Friday}}</ref> In her autobiography, ''Life Is A Banquet'', Russell wrote that she thought her role did not have as many good lines as Grant's, so she hired her own writer to \"punch up\" her dialogue. With Hawks encouraging ad-libbing on the set, Russell was able to slip her personal, paid writer's work into the movie. Only Grant was wise to this tactic and greeted her each morning saying, \"What have you got today?\"<ref>New York : Random House, 1977. {{ISBN|978-0-394-42134-6}} OCLC 3017310</ref> Her ghostwriter gave her some of the lines for the restaurant scene, which is unique to ''His Girl Friday''. It was one of the most complicated scenes to film; because of the rapidity of the dialogue, none of the actors actually eat during the scene despite the fact that there is food in the scene. Hawks shot this scene with one camera a week and a half into production and it took four days to film instead of the intended two.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=285}} The film was shot with some improvisation of lines and actions, with Hawks giving the actors freedom to experiment, as he did with his comedies more than his dramas.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=283}} The film is noted for its rapid-fire repartee, using overlapping dialogue to make conversations sound more realistic, with one character speaking before another finishes. Although overlapping dialog is specified and cued in the 1928 play script by Hecht and MacArthur,<ref>Hecht, Ben, & Charles MacArthur, ''The Front Page'', 1928. Samuel French, Inc.</ref> Hawks told [[Peter Bogdanovich]]:\n\n<blockquote>I had noticed that when people talk, they talk ''over'' one another, especially people who talk fast or who are arguing or describing something. So we wrote the dialogue in a way that made the beginnings and ends of sentences unnecessary; they were there for overlapping.{{sfn|Bogdanovich|1997}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:His Girl Friday 6.jpg|thumb|left|L. to R. : Cary Grant, Frank Jenks, Roscoe Karns, Gene Lockhart, Pat Flaherty, Porter Hall, Alma Kruger, and Rosalind Russell in one of the final scenes of the film.]]\nTo get the effect he wanted, as [[multi-track sound recording]] was not yet available at the time, Hawks had the sound mixer on the set turn the various overhead microphones on and off as required for the scene, as many as 35 times.<ref name=tcmarticle /> Reportedly, the film was sped up because of a challenge Hawks took upon himself to break the record for the fastest dialogue on screen, at the time held by ''The Front Page''.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=283}} Hawks arranged a showing for newsmen of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his dialogue was.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}} Filming was difficult for the cinematographers because the improvisation made it difficult to know what the characters were going to do. Rosalind Russell was also difficult to film because her lack of a sharp jawline required makeup artists to paint and blend a dark line under her jawline while shining a light on her face to simulate a more youthful appearance.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}}\n\nHawks encouraged aggressiveness and unexpectedness in the acting, a few times breaking the [[fourth wall]] in the film. At one point, Grant broke character because of something unscripted that Russell did and looked directly at the camera saying, \"Is she going to do that?\". Hawks decided to leave this scene in the picture.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=284}} Owing to the numerous ensemble scenes, many retakes were necessary. Having learned from ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), Hawks added some [[straight man|straight]] supporting characters in order to balance out the leading characters.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=285}} [[Arthur Rosson]] worked for three days on [[second unit]] footage at [[Columbia Ranch]]. Filming was completed on November 21, seven days past schedule. Unusually for the time period, the film contains no music besides the music that leads to the final fade out of the film.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=286}}\n\n====Ad-libs by Grant====\nGrant's character describes Bellamy's character by saying \"He looks like that fellow in the movies, you know ... Ralph Bellamy!\" According to Bellamy, the remark was ad-libbed by Grant.<ref name=tcmnotes /> Columbia studio head [[Harry Cohn]] thought it was too cheeky and ordered it removed, but Hawks insisted that it stay. Grant makes several other \"inside\" remarks in the film. When his character is arrested for kidnapping, he describes the horrendous fate suffered by the last person who crossed him: Archie Leach (Grant's birth name).{{sfn|Fetherling|1977|p=85}} Another line that people think is an inside remark is when Earl Williams attempts to get out of the rolltop desk he's been hiding in, Grant says, \"Get back in there, you Mock Turtle.\" The line is a \"cleaned-up\" version of a line from the stage version of ''The Front Page'' (\"Get back in there, you God damned turtle!\") and Grant also played \"The Mock Turtle\" in the 1933 film version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1933 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.<ref name=tcmarticle />\n\n==Release==\nRelease of the film was rushed by Cohn and a sneak preview of the film was held in December, with a press screening on January 3, 1940.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=286}} ''His Girl Friday'' premiered in [[New York City]] at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on January 11, 1940, and went into general American release a week later.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cohn |first1=Herbert |title='His Girl Friday' Makes Gay Music Hall Comedy |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52684151/?terms=%22%27His+Girl+Friday%27+Makes%22 |accessdate=27 June 2018 |newspaper=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle |date=January 12, 1940 |page=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=At the Logan Wednesday |url=https://basic.newspapers.com/image/85484391/?terms=his+girl+friday |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=The Logan Daily News |date=January 22, 1940}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nContemporary reviews from critics were very positive.

The world in this film is not determined by gender, but rather by intelligence and capability. At the beginning of the film Hildy says that she wants to be \"treated like a woman\", but her return to her profession reveals her true desire to live a different life.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=105}} In ''His Girl Friday'', even though the characters remarry, Hawks displays an aversion to marriage, home, and family through his approach to the film. Specific, exclusionary camera work and character control of the frame and the dialogue portray a subtle criticism of domesticity. {{sfn|Danks|2016|pp=35-38}} The subject of domesticity is fairly absent throughout the film. Even among the relationships between Grant and Russell and Bellamy and Russell, the relationships are positioned within a larger frame of the male-dominated newsroom.{{sfn|Danks|2016|pp=35-38}} The film, like many comedies, celebrates difficult, tumultuous love rather than secure, suburban love through its preference for movement and argument rather than silent poise.{{sfn|Haskell|1974|p=126}} Film critic [[Molly Haskell]] wrote that the scene near the end of the film when Hildy sheds tears was not included to expose her femininity, but to express the confusion she felt due to the collision of her professional and feminine natures. The feminine side of Hildy desires to be subservient and sexually relate to men, while the other side of Hildy desires assertion and to forfeit the stereotypical duties of a woman. Her tears represent her emotional helplessness and inability to express anger to a male authority figure.{{sfn|Haskell|1974|pp=133-134}}\n\nA commonality in many Howard Hawks films is the revelation of the amorality of the main character and a failure of that character to change or develop. In ''His Girl Friday'', Walter Burns manipulates, acts selfishly, frames his ex-wife's fianc\u00e9, and orchestrates the kidnapping of an elderly woman. Even at the end of the film, Burns convinces Hildy Johnson to remarry him despite how much she loathes him and his questionable actions. Upon the resumption of their relationship, there is no romance visible between them. They do not kiss, embrace, or even gaze at each other. It is evident that Burns is still the same person he was in their previous relationship as he quickly waves off the plans for the honeymoon that they never had in pursuit of a new story. Additionally, he walks in front of her when exiting the room, forcing her to carry her own suitcase, despite Johnson having already criticized this at the beginning of the film. This hints that the marriage is fated to face the same problems that ended it previously.{{sfn|Dibbern|2016|p=230}}\n\nHawks is known for his use of repeated or intentional gestures in his films. In ''His Girl Friday'', the cigarette in the scene between Hildy and Earl Williams serves several symbolic roles in the film. First, the cigarette establishes a link between the characters when Williams accepts the cigarette even though he does not smoke. However, the fact that he doesn't smoke and they don't share the cigarette shows the difference between and separation of the worlds in which the two characters live.<ref>{{harvnb|Neale|2016|p=110}}; {{harvnb|McElhaney|2006|pp=31\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe film contains two main plots: the romantic and the professional. Walter and Hildy work together to attempt to release wrongly convicted Earl Williams, while the concurrent plot is Walter attempting to win back Hildy. The two plots do not resolve at the same time, but they are interdependent because although Williams is released before Walter and Hildy get back together, he is the reason for their reconciliation.{{sfn|Bordwell|1985|p=158}} The speed of the film results in snappy and overlapping dialogue among interruptions and rapid speech. Gesture, character and camera movement, as well as editing, serve to complement the dialogue in increasing the pace of the film. There is a clear contrast between the fast-talking Hildy and Walter and slow-talking Bruce and Earl which serves to emphasize the gap between the intelligent and the unintelligent in the film. The average word per minute count of the film is 240 while the average American speech is around 140 words per minute. There are nine scenes with at least four words per second and at least two with more than five words per second.{{sfn|Grindon|2011|p=103}} Hawks attached verbal tags before and after specific script lines so the actors would be able to interrupt and talk over each other without making the necessary dialogue incomprehensible.{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=49}}\n\nFilm theorist and historian [[David Bordwell]] explained the ending of ''His Girl Friday'' as a \"closure effect\" rather than a closure. The ending of the film is rather circular and there is no development of characters, specifically Walter Burns, and the film ends similarly to the way in which it starts. Additionally, the film ends with a brief epilogue in which Walter announces their remarriage and reveals their intention to go cover a strike in Albany on the way to their honeymoon. The fates of the main characters and even some of the minor characters such as Earl William are revealed, although there are minor flaws in the resolution. For example, they do not discuss what happened to Molly Malloy after the conflict is resolved.

The leading jurist were known as ''[[Marja']].''\n\nThe Constitution stresses the importance of the clergy in government, with Article 4 stating  that <blockquote>\u201call civil, criminal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and all other statutes and regulations (must) be keeping with Islamic measures;\u2026the Islamic legal scholars of the watch council (Shura yi Nigahban) will keep watch over this.\u201d<ref name=\"preamble\">{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ir00000_.html|title=ICL - Iran - Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref></blockquote> and the importance of the Supreme Leader. Article 5 states \n<blockquote>\u201cduring the absence of the removed [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] (may God hasten his reappearance) government and leadership of the community in the Islamic Republic of Iran belong to the rightful God fearing\u2026 legal scholar (Faqih) who is recognized and acknowledged as the Islamic leader by the majority of the population.\u201d</blockquote> \nArticle 107 in the constitution mentions Imam Khomeini by name and praises him as the most learned and talented leader for emulation (''marja-i taqlid'').   The responsibilities of the Supreme Leader are vaguely stated in the constitution, thus any \u2018violation\u2019 by the Supreme Leader would be dismissed almost immediately.  As the rest of the clergy governed affairs on a daily basis, the Supreme Leader is capable of mandating a new decision as per the concept of Vilayat-e Faqih. (Halm, 120-121)\n\n===1989===\nShortly before Imam Khomeini's death a change was made in the constitution allowing a lower ranking Shia cleric to become Supreme Leader.

Montazeri was demoted as a marja and Khomeini chose  a new successor, a relatively low-ranking member of the clergy, [[Ali Khamene'i]]. However Article 109 stipulated that the leader be `a source of imitation` (Marja-e taqlid). Khomeini wrote a letter to the president of the Assembly for Revising the Constitution, which was in session at the time, making the necessary arrangements to designate Khamene'i as his successor, and Article 109 was revised accordingly.<ref name=asghar.p73>Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran : politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'' / by Asghar Schirazi, London ; New York : I.B.

According to Ayatollah Khomeini, the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was not [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists#Limited guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|restricted]] to orphans or mental incompetents, but applied to everyone in absence of the [[twelfth Imam]]. Jurists were the only rightful political/governmental leaders because \"God had commanded Islamic government\" and \"no one knew religion better than the [[ulama]]\" (Islamic clergy).<ref name=nasr.p125/> They alone would preserve \"Islamic order\" and keep everyone from deviating from \"the just path of Islam\".<ref>Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution, Writings and Declarations Of Imam Khomeini'' p.54</ref> Prior to the revolution observant Shia Muslims selected their own leading faqih to emulate (known as a ''[[Marja']]-i taqlid'') according to their own decision making. The \u201ccongregation rather than the hierarchy decided how prominent the ayatollah was\u201d thus allowing the public to possibly limit the influence of the Faqih.<ref name=nasr.p125>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W. W. Norton & Company, Apr 17, 2007, p.?</ref>\n\nAfter the revolution Shia Muslims (or at least Iranian Shia) were commanded to show allegiance to the current ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|vali-e faghih]]'', Guardian Jurist or Supreme Leader.   In this new system, the jurist oversaw all governmental affairs.    The complete control exercised by the Faqih was not to be limited to the [[Iranian Revolution]] because the revolution and its Leader had international aspirations. As the constitution of the Islamic Republic states, it \n<blockquote>intends to establish an ideal and model society on the basis of Islamic norms.  ... the Constitution provides the necessary basis for ensuring the continuation of the Revolution at home and abroad.  In particular, in the development of international relations, the Constitution will strive with other Islamic and popular movements to prepare the way for the formation of a single world community (in accordance with the Koranic verse `This your community is a single community, and I am your Lord, so worship Me` [21:92]), and to assure the continuation of the struggle for the liberation of all deprived and oppressed peoples in the world.<ref name=\"preamble\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author Seyyed Vali Nasr, Khomeini appealed to the masses, during the pre-1979 period, by referring to them as the oppressed and with charisma and political ability was tremendously successful. He became a very popular role model for [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] and hoped for the Iranian Revolution to be the first step to a much larger Islamic revolution, transcending Shia Islam, in the same way that [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] wanted [[Russian Revolution|their revolution]] to be a world revolution, not just a [[Russia|Russian]] one.<ref>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W.

According to [[Francis Fukuyama]], the 1979 constitution is a \"hybrid\" of \"theocratic and democratic elements\" with much of it based on the ideas Khomeini presented in his work ''[[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist]]'' (''Hukumat-e Islami'').<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203946904574300374086282670 |date=July 27, 2009 |title=Iran, Islam and the Rule of Law |first=Francis |last=Fukuyama |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] }}</ref> In the work, Khomeini argued that government must be run in accordance with traditional Islamic ''[[sharia]]'', and for this to happen a leading Islamic jurist (''[[faqih]]'') must provide political \"guardianship\" (''wilayat'' or ''velayat'') over the people. The leading jurist were known as ''[[Marja']].''\n\nThe Constitution stresses the importance of the clergy in government, with Article 4 stating  that <blockquote>\u201call civil, criminal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and all other statutes and regulations (must) be keeping with Islamic measures;\u2026the Islamic legal scholars of the watch council (Shura yi Nigahban) will keep watch over this.\u201d<ref name=\"preamble\">{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ir00000_.html|title=ICL - Iran - Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref></blockquote> and the importance of the Supreme Leader. Article 5 states \n<blockquote>\u201cduring the absence of the removed [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] (may God hasten his reappearance) government and leadership of the community in the Islamic Republic of Iran belong to the rightful God fearing\u2026 legal scholar (Faqih) who is recognized and acknowledged as the Islamic leader by the majority of the population.\u201d</blockquote> \nArticle 107 in the constitution mentions Imam Khomeini by name and praises him as the most learned and talented leader for emulation (''marja-i taqlid'').   The responsibilities of the Supreme Leader are vaguely stated in the constitution, thus any \u2018violation\u2019 by the Supreme Leader would be dismissed almost immediately.  As the rest of the clergy governed affairs on a daily basis, the Supreme Leader is capable of mandating a new decision as per the concept of Vilayat-e Faqih. (Halm, 120-121)\n\n===1989===\nShortly before Imam Khomeini's death a change was made in the constitution allowing a lower ranking Shia cleric to become Supreme Leader.

Montazeri was demoted as a marja and Khomeini chose  a new successor, a relatively low-ranking member of the clergy, [[Ali Khamene'i]]. However Article 109 stipulated that the leader be `a source of imitation` (Marja-e taqlid). Khomeini wrote a letter to the president of the Assembly for Revising the Constitution, which was in session at the time, making the necessary arrangements to designate Khamene'i as his successor, and Article 109 was revised accordingly.<ref name=asghar.p73>Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran : politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'' / by Asghar Schirazi, London ; New York : I.B.

According to Ayatollah Khomeini, the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was not [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists#Limited guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|restricted]] to orphans or mental incompetents, but applied to everyone in absence of the [[twelfth Imam]]. Jurists were the only rightful political/governmental leaders because \"God had commanded Islamic government\" and \"no one knew religion better than the [[ulama]]\" (Islamic clergy).<ref name=nasr.p125/> They alone would preserve \"Islamic order\" and keep everyone from deviating from \"the just path of Islam\".<ref>Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution, Writings and Declarations Of Imam Khomeini'' p.54</ref> Prior to the revolution observant Shia Muslims selected their own leading faqih to emulate (known as a ''[[Marja']]-i taqlid'') according to their own decision making. The \u201ccongregation rather than the hierarchy decided how prominent the ayatollah was\u201d thus allowing the public to possibly limit the influence of the Faqih.<ref name=nasr.p125>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W. W. Norton & Company, Apr 17, 2007, p.?</ref>\n\nAfter the revolution Shia Muslims (or at least Iranian Shia) were commanded to show allegiance to the current ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|vali-e faghih]]'', Guardian Jurist or Supreme Leader.   In this new system, the jurist oversaw all governmental affairs.    The complete control exercised by the Faqih was not to be limited to the [[Iranian Revolution]] because the revolution and its Leader had international aspirations. As the constitution of the Islamic Republic states, it \n<blockquote>intends to establish an ideal and model society on the basis of Islamic norms.  ... the Constitution provides the necessary basis for ensuring the continuation of the Revolution at home and abroad.  In particular, in the development of international relations, the Constitution will strive with other Islamic and popular movements to prepare the way for the formation of a single world community (in accordance with the Koranic verse `This your community is a single community, and I am your Lord, so worship Me` [21:92]), and to assure the continuation of the struggle for the liberation of all deprived and oppressed peoples in the world.<ref name=\"preamble\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author Seyyed Vali Nasr, Khomeini appealed to the masses, during the pre-1979 period, by referring to them as the oppressed and with charisma and political ability was tremendously successful. He became a very popular role model for [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] and hoped for the Iranian Revolution to be the first step to a much larger Islamic revolution, transcending Shia Islam, in the same way that [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] wanted [[Russian Revolution|their revolution]] to be a world revolution, not just a [[Russia|Russian]] one.<ref>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W.
