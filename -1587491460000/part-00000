This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production was they need to know how much of the episodes will be story to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell the parts of podcast who entered the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. They also worked to find a way to embed them in psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. The episodes should have a balance so that the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation people would not pay attention to everything at the same time. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Acording Trussell the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]] lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others shows included [[Watership Down]], The Last Unicorn, Liquid Television; Aeon Flux and [[David Lynch]] was a big influence in how when you watch [[Twin Peak]]. <ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, that it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. Acording to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that somewhat was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\" <ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of the promotional action for series, Netflix launched on April 19, 2020 on its YouTube channel a live with a countdown to series. Throughout the live, small portions of the episode were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Coutdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = The Midnight Gospel\n| image                    = File:The Midnight Gospel promotional poster.jpg\n| caption                  = Promotional poster\n| genre                    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Adult animation]]\n* [[Surrealism]]\n* [[Science fantasy]]\n* [[Dark comedy]]\n* [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]]\n* [[Interview]]\n}}\n| director                 = {{Plainlist|\n* Pendleton Ward\n* Mike L.

This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production was they need to know how much of the episodes will be story to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell the parts of podcast who entered the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. They also worked to find a way to embed them in psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. The episodes should have a balance so that the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation people would not pay attention to everything at the same time. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Acording Trussell the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]] lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others shows included [[Watership Down]], The Last Unicorn, Liquid Television; Aeon Flux and David Lynch was a big influence in how when you watch Twin Peak. <ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, that it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. Acording to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that somewhat was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\" <ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of the promotional action for series, Netflix launched on April 19, 2020 on its YouTube channel a live with a countdown to series. Throughout the live, small portions of the episode were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Coutdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "Marxblom", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}

Jochum studied the [[piano]] and [[organ (music)|organ]] in Augsburg, enrolling in its Academy of Music from 1914 to 1922.<ref>Obituary for Eugen Jochum (1987).  ''The Musical Times'', '''128''' (1732): 346.</ref> He then studied at the Munich Conservatory, with his composition teacher being Hermann von Waltershausen; it was there that he changed his focus to conducting, his teacher being [[Siegmund von Hausegger]], who conducted the first performance of the original version of the Ninth Symphony of [[Anton Bruckner]] and made the first recording of it.\n\nJochum's first post was as a rehearsal pianist at [[M\u00f6nchengladbach|M\u00f6nchen-Gladbach]], and then in [[Kiel]]. He made his conducting debut with the [[Munich Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1926 in a program which included [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Seventh Symphony]]. In the same year he was appointed conductor at the [[Opernhaus Kiel|Kiel Opera House]], where he conducted seventeen operas in his first season, including ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]], [[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and ''[[Turandot]].''<ref name=\"Blyth\">[[Alan Blyth|Blyth, Alan]], [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/August%201972/30/855178/Review%20%7C%20EUGEN%20JOCHUM%20%7C Interview and profile of Eugen Jochum] (August 1972).  ''The Gramophone'': p. 319.</ref>\n\nAfter Kiel he went to [[Mannheim]], where [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] praised his conducting. He turned down an offer to conduct twelve concerts with the [[New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra]], believing that his repertory and experience were not yet equal to it. (He did not appear in America until 1958.) His next appointment was as music director in [[Duisburg]], from 1930 to 1932.<ref>Potts, Joseph E., \"European Radio Orchestras: Western Germany\" (September 1955). ''The Musical Times'', '''96''' (1351): 473-475.</ref>  In 1932 he became chief of the Berlin Radio Orchestra, also conducting 16 concerts a season with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]], and at the [[Deutsche Oper]].<ref name=\"Blyth\"/>\n\nIn 1934 Jochum succeeded [[Karl B\u00f6hm]] as musical director of the [[Hamburg State Opera]] and the [[Philharmoniker Hamburg|Hamburg Philharmonic]]. Throughout the [[Nazism|Nazi]] era, Hamburg remained, as Jochum put it, \"reasonably liberal\", and Jochum was even able to keep his post despite not joining the party. He performed music by composers such as [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]] and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] elsewhere banned by the Nazis. In 1944, [[Joseph Goebbels]] included Jochum in the [[Gottbegnadeten list]].\n\nIn the postwar [[denazification]] initiatives, however, British and American authorities had a \"high-level disagreement\" over Jochum that was \"an exception\" to the usual pattern of British authorities following the American lead: after \"initially clearing\" Jochum and selecting him to conduct the [[Munich Philharmonic]] in May 1945, the American authorities temporarily blacklisted him on grounds that he \"had done exceptionally well\" during the war and that his brothers had been \"fanatical\" Nazis; but British authorities \"found no fault\" with Jochum, arguing that he had never been a member of the Nazi party, [[SS]] or [[Sturmabteilung]], had remained a \"convinced Roman Catholic,\" and had \"not compromised his artistic integrity.\" <ref name=\"Toby Thacker 2007 p. 57\">Toby Thacker, Music after Hitler, 1945-1955 (Ashgate, 2007), p. 57</ref> It took until 1948 before the American authorities determined that they could find no evidence of his joining any Nazi organizations.<ref name=\"Toby Thacker 2007 p. 57\"/>\n\nJochum continued to serve at Hamburg until 1949,<ref name=\"Blyth\"/> then left when the newly reconstituted [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] appointed him the founding music director of its new orchestra, the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]]. To build the orchestra, Jochum \"recruited highly qualified musicians,\" including the [[Koeckert Quartet]] as the \"nucleus of the strings\".<ref name=\"Karl Schumann 1989\">Karl Schumann, \"40 Years of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra,\" 1989, booklet notes for the compact disc released on Orfeo 206 891</ref> Jochum remained music director of the orchestra until 1961; with it, he made numerous recordings, mostly for [[Deutsche Grammophon]].<ref name=\"Karl Schumann 1989\"/>\n\nJochum was also a regular guest conductor of the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]], [[Amsterdam]], and served as the orchestra's 'first conductor' (''{{lang|nl|eerste dirigent}}'') from 1941\u20131943, during the chief conductorship of [[Willem Mengelberg]].  From 1961 to 1963, Jochum was joint chief conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra alongside [[Bernard Haitink]].<ref>[[Dyneley Hussey|Hussey, Dyneley]], \"The Musician's Gramophone\" (May 1960).  ''The Musical Times'', '''101''' (1407): 303.</ref><ref>Other reports have stated 1964, rather than 1963.  However, the Concertgebouw Orchestra's own website gives 1963 as the year when Haitink, unfortunately, became sole chief conductor.</ref>  He conducted frequently in London, with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. In 1975, the LSO appointed him conductor laureate, a position he held until 1978. Jochum served as principal conductor of the [[Bamberg Symphony]] from 1969-1973. He later worked regularly with the [[Staatskapelle Dresden]], with which he recorded the complete symphonies of [[Bruckner]] and \"London\" symphonies of [[Joseph Haydn]] (which latter he also recorded with the London Philharmonic). He appeared regularly at the [[Salzburg Festival]]. He also, in 1953\u201354 and 1971, conducted at the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]]; he made his debut conducting ''[[Tristan und Isolde]].''\n\nHe led the world premieres of various works, including the Concerto for Strings by [[Boris Blacher]], the ''Concerte per il principe Eugenio'' by [[Alberto Bruno Tedeschi]], the ''Suite Fran\u00e7aise'' by [[Werner Egk]], the ''Tanz-Rondo'' by [[Gottfried von Einem]], and the Symphony No. 6 by [[Karl Amadeus Hartmann]].\n\nHe was a regular recording artist, from his first records in 1932. In the stereo LP era, he recorded mainly for [[Deutsche Grammophon]]. His DG cycle of the symphonies of [[Anton Bruckner]], split between the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]], has remained in the record catalogs ever since its first issue in the 1960s.<ref name=\"woods\"/> This cycle and a later Jochum Bruckner cycle, with the [[Staatskapelle Dresden]] for EMI, have been widely and frequently acclaimed and have caused his name to be especially associated with this composer. In addition, he was president of the International Bruckner Society from 1950, and wrote extensively about Bruckner interpretation. Still, according to his ''New York Times'' obituary, he said in a 1983 interview, \"Today, everyone thinks of me as a specialist in Bruckner's symphonies. But I began with the music of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. And it is to their music that I still feel closest.\" His recordings of Bach's [[Mass in B minor]] and [[St. John Passion]] are frequently counted among the finest of these works. His three complete recordings of the Beethoven symphonies have also been strongly praised: they were made with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]] in the 1950s for [[Deutsche Grammophon]], with the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in the late 1960s for Philips, and with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in the 1970s for [[EMI]].

Jochum studied the [[piano]] and [[organ (music)|organ]] in Augsburg, enrolling in its Academy of Music from 1914 to 1922.<ref>Obituary for Eugen Jochum (1987).  ''The Musical Times'', '''128''' (1732): 346.</ref> He then studied at the Munich Conservatory, with his composition teacher being Hermann von Waltershausen; it was there that he changed his focus to conducting, his teacher being [[Siegmund von Hausegger]], who conducted the first performance of the original version of the Ninth Symphony of [[Anton Bruckner]] and made the first recording of it.\n\nJochum's first post was as a rehearsal pianist at [[M\u00f6nchengladbach|M\u00f6nchen-Gladbach]], and then in [[Kiel]]. He made his conducting debut with the [[Munich Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1926 in a program which included [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Seventh Symphony]]. In the same year he was appointed conductor at the [[Opernhaus Kiel|Kiel Opera House]], where he conducted seventeen operas in his first season, including ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]], [[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and ''[[Turandot]].''<ref name=\"Blyth\">[[Alan Blyth|Blyth, Alan]], [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/August%201972/30/855178/Review%20%7C%20EUGEN%20JOCHUM%20%7C Interview and profile of Eugen Jochum] (August 1972).  ''The Gramophone'': p. 319.</ref>\n\nAfter Kiel he went to [[Mannheim]], where [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] praised his conducting. He turned down an offer to conduct twelve concerts with the [[New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra]], believing that his repertory and experience were not yet equal to it. (He did not appear in America until 1958.) His next appointment was as music director in [[Duisburg]], from 1930 to 1932.<ref>Potts, Joseph E., \"European Radio Orchestras: Western Germany\" (September 1955). ''The Musical Times'', '''96''' (1351): 473-475.</ref>  In 1932 he became chief of the Berlin Radio Orchestra, also conducting 16 concerts a season with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]], and at the [[Deutsche Oper]].<ref name=\"Blyth\"/>\n\nIn 1934 Jochum succeeded [[Karl B\u00f6hm]] as musical director of the [[Hamburg State Opera]] and the [[Philharmoniker Hamburg|Hamburg Philharmonic]]. Throughout the [[Nazism|Nazi]] era, Hamburg remained, as Jochum put it, \"reasonably liberal\", and Jochum was even able to keep his post despite not joining the party. He performed music by composers such as [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]] and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] elsewhere banned by the Nazis. In 1944, [[Joseph Goebbels]] included Jochum in the [[Gottbegnadeten list]].\n\nIn the postwar [[denazification]] initiatives, however, British and American authorities had a \"high-level disagreement\" over Jochum that was \"an exception\" to the usual pattern of British authorities following the American lead: after \"initially clearing\" Jochum and selecting him to conduct the [[Munich Philharmonic]] in May 1945, the American authorities temporarily blacklisted him on grounds that he \"had done exceptionally well\" during the war and that his brothers had been \"fanatical\" Nazis; but British authorities \"found no fault\" with Jochum, arguing that he had never been a member of the Nazi party, [[SS]] or [[Sturmabteilung]], had remained a \"convinced Roman Catholic,\" and had \"not compromised his artistic integrity.\" <ref name=\"Toby Thacker 2007 p. 57\">Toby Thacker, Music after Hitler, 1945-1955 (Ashgate, 2007), p. 57</ref> It took until 1948 before the American authorities determined that they could find no evidence of his joining any Nazi organizations.<ref name=\"Toby Thacker 2007 p. 57\"/>\n\nJochum continued to serve at Hamburg until 1949,<ref name=\"Blyth\"/> then left when the newly reconstituted [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] appointed him the founding music director of its new orchestra, the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]]. To build the orchestra, Jochum \"recruited highly qualified musicians,\" including the [[Koeckert Quartet]] as the \"nucleus of the strings\".<ref name=\"Karl Schumann 1989\">Karl Schumann, \"40 Years of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra,\" 1989, booklet notes for the compact disc released on Orfeo 206 891</ref> Jochum remained music director of the orchestra until 1961; with it, he made numerous recordings, mostly for [[Deutsche Grammophon]].<ref name=\"Karl Schumann 1989\"/>\n\nJochum was also a regular guest conductor of the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]], [[Amsterdam]], and served as the orchestra's 'first conductor' (''{{lang|nl|eerste dirigent}}'') from 1941\u20131943, during the chief conductorship of [[Willem Mengelberg]].  From 1961 to 1963, Jochum was joint chief conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra alongside [[Bernard Haitink]].<ref>[[Dyneley Hussey|Hussey, Dyneley]], \"The Musician's Gramophone\" (May 1960).  ''The Musical Times'', '''101''' (1407): 303.</ref><ref>Other reports have stated 1964, rather than 1963.  However, the Concertgebouw Orchestra's own website gives 1963 as the year when Haitink, unfortunately, became sole chief conductor.</ref>  He conducted frequently in London, with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. In 1975, the LSO appointed him conductor laureate, a position he held until 1978. Jochum served as principal conductor of the [[Bamberg Symphony]] from 1969-1973. He later worked regularly with the [[Staatskapelle Dresden]], with which he recorded the complete symphonies of [[Bruckner]] and \"London\" symphonies of [[Joseph Haydn]] (which latter he also recorded with the London Philharmonic). He appeared regularly at the [[Salzburg Festival]]. He also, in 1953\u201354 and 1971, conducted at the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]]; he made his debut conducting ''[[Tristan und Isolde]].''\n\nHe led the world premieres of various works, including the Concerto for Strings by [[Boris Blacher]], the ''Concerte per il principe Eugenio'' by [[Alberto Bruno Tedeschi]], the ''Suite Fran\u00e7aise'' by [[Werner Egk]], the ''Tanz-Rondo'' by [[Gottfried von Einem]], and the Symphony No. 6 by [[Karl Amadeus Hartmann]].\n\nHe was a regular recording artist, from his first records in 1932. In the stereo LP era, he recorded mainly for [[Deutsche Grammophon]]. His DG cycle of the symphonies of [[Anton Bruckner]], split between the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]], has remained in the record catalogs ever since its first issue in the 1960s.<ref name=\"woods\"/> This cycle and a later Jochum Bruckner cycle, with the [[Staatskapelle Dresden]] for EMI, have been widely and frequently acclaimed and have caused his name to be especially associated with this composer. In addition, he was president of the International Bruckner Society from 1950, and wrote extensively about Bruckner interpretation. Still, according to his ''New York Times'' obituary, he said in a 1983 interview, \"Today, everyone thinks of me as a specialist in Bruckner's symphonies. But I began with the music of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. And it is to their music that I still feel closest.\" His recordings of Bach's [[Mass in B minor]] and [[St. John Passion]] are frequently counted among the finest of these works. His three complete recordings of the Beethoven symphonies have also been strongly praised: they were made with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]] in the 1950s for [[Deutsche Grammophon]], with the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in the late 1960s for Philips, and with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in the 1970s for [[EMI]]. Jochum also made two complete recordings of the symphonies of [[Johannes Brahms]], one with the Berlin Philharmonic in the mid-1950s, the other with the [[London Philharmonic]] in 1977.

It was co-produced by Daniels's [[Deedle-Dee Productions]], and [[Reveille Productions]] (later [[Endemol Shine North America|Shine America]]), in association with [[Universal Television]]. The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J.

These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006. Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor; however, the final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response.

It was co-produced by Daniels's [[Deedle-Dee Productions]], and [[Reveille Productions]] (later [[Endemol Shine North America|Shine America]]), in association with [[Universal Television]]. The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J.

Notable stars outside the original main cast include [[Ed Helms]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[James Spader]], and [[Ellie Kemper]].\n\n''The Office'' was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, particularly those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006.

The [[Jungfrau]] is visible in the background. ]]\n'''Wengen''' is a mountain village in the [[Bernese Oberland]] of central [[Switzerland]]. Located in the [[canton of Bern]] at an [[elevation]] of {{convert|1274|m|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]], it is part of the [[Jungfrauregion]] and has approximately 1,300 year-round residents, which swells to 5,000 during summer and to 10,000 in the winter. Wengen hosts the classic [[Lauberhorn ski races]] of the [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup]] in January.\n\n==History==\nWengen was first mentioned in official documents {{Time ago|1268}} in 1268, and the origin of the name is unknown.\n\nPrimarily an alpine farming community, the village began to be visited by tourists in the early 19th century. [[Mary Shelley|Mary]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[History of a Six Weeks' Tour]]'' and [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'', in which the scenery of the area is described, were published in 1817. This literature became the advent of the modern tourism industry for the village.<ref name=\"BritishTourism\"/> [[Felix Mendelssohn]], to whom there is a memorial above the village, also visited in the early nineteenth century.\n\nGuesthouses and hotels began to be built in the mid-19th century, with the opening of the ''Launerhaus'' in 1859, with accommodation for 30 guests, and in 1880 the ''Pension Wengen'' was available to 100 guests.<ref name=\"BritishTourism\"/>  The building and opening of the [[Wengernalpbahn]] in the 1890s made the village more accessible to tourists who previously had to walk up the steep slopes to the alpine village, opening the area for an expansion of tourism and the beginning of the ski industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jungfrau.ch/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-270//301_read-1617/ |title=Wengernalpbahn:History |language=German |publisher=Jungfraubahnen |accessdate=2010-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501184319/http://www.jungfrau.ch/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-270/301_read-1617/ |archivedate=May 1, 2010 }}\n</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, British tourists started ski-clubs in the area, beginning in the nearby village of M\u00fcrren. By 1903 Wengen had an  [[Anglican Church]] and two years later, [[Henry Simpson Lunn|Sir Henry Lunn]] formed the [[Public Schools Alpine Sports Club]] with Wengen as a destination ski area for the members.<ref name=\"BritishTourism\"/> A British [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister, Lunn first visited the area to organize a meeting of [[Protestant]] churches in nearby [[Grindelwald]] where he learned about winter sports such as skiing. He returned to the area in 1896 with his son [[Arnold Lunn|Arnold]], who quickly learned to ski, and both father and son realized the potential in the future of winter sports.  The club was established a few years later. Members of the Public Schools Alpine Sports Club were required to have attended an English public school or one of the \"older universities\".<ref>Beattie, p. 198</ref> Wengen's Curling Club was established in 1911.<ref name=\"BritishTourism\">[http://pages.unibas.ch/shine/swisstour20.html British and American Visitors in Switzerland:History of Tourism in Switzerland]</ref>\n\nThe first [[Alpine skiing|ski races]] were held in the early 1920s with the British downhill championship held in 1921;  the following year a ski race was held between [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]].<ref>Beattie, p. 199</ref> These events were the first to have downhill races as opposed to Nordic races, which were held in other Swiss resorts. In Wengen, skiers requested use of the train system for access to the slopes; for some years trains were the earliest ski-lifts in the area.<ref>Hudson, p. 19</ref> Arnold Lunn used the natural terrain of the mountains for the courses; the downhill event followed the slopes above Wengen and was called the \"straight down\": skiers went straight down the mountain. Also during this period, Lunn invented, and introduced in Wengen, the first [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] race, in which skiers followed the terrain through the trees, replaced with ski gates in later years. These events are considered the birth of modern [[ski racing]] and Alpine [[skiing]].<ref>Allen, p. 99</ref>\n\nFrom August 1944 to the end of [[World War II]], Wengen served as a sort of open-air internment camp for allied prisoners, mostly US bomber crews. Since the only practical way in or out of Wengen was via the cog railway, it was difficult for internees to escape.<ref name=\"WWII\">[http://swissinternees.tripod.com/wengen.htm]</ref>\n\n==Churches==\n\nWengen has three churches; Protestant English and Swiss and Roman Catholic.\n\nThe Swiss church was rebuilt in the 1950s and overlooks the Lauterbrunnen Valley.\n\nEnglish churches were established during the nineteenth century in nearby Grindelwald, Meiringen, and Murren.  By 1912, Anglican services were taking place in Wengen's Swiss church twice on Sundays.<ref>Northern Whig, 29 August 1912, p.7</ref>  Desiring their own building, the Continental & Colonial Church Society erected a new English church, which was consecrated on 15 January 1928 by the [[Bishop of Fulham]].<ref>West Middlesex Gazette, 14 January 1928, p.9</ref>  The building is on the road formerly leading to the Mannlichen cable car lift.  The new cable car station is however nearer the centre of Wengen.  St Bernard's has been used for over 90 years for Sunday services and occasional offices, such as the memorial in 1949 for Anthony Carrick, a schoolboy who died in the mountains.<ref>Gloucestershire Echo, 14 September 1949, p.4</ref>  The congregation in 1954 was described as consisting 'of people from many parts of the British Commonwealth and America as well as English-speaking Continentals'.<ref>Belfast Telegraph, 1 August 1955, p.4</ref> The congregation continues to be diverse.\n\nThe Roman Catholic church stands adjacent to the Falken Hotel and has a distinctive onion dome.  Mass is celebrated on most Sundays in-season.\n\n==Politics==\nTogether with villages of [[M\u00fcrren]], [[Isenfluh]], [[Gimmelwald]], [[Stechelberg]] and [[Lauterbrunnen]], Wengen forms the political commune of [[Lauterbrunnen]].\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Wengen and Lauterbrunnen valley from Mannlichen.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View from [[Luftseilbahn Wengen-M\u00e4nnlichen|M\u00e4nnlichen]] of Wengen, the [[Lauterbrunnen]] Valley and the [[Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen\u2013M\u00fcrren|M\u00fcrren Cableway]] on the opposite side of the valley.]]\nThere are generally no roads to Wengen/M\u00fcrren.<ref name=access>{{cite web |title=Arrival by car |url=https://wengen.swiss/en/winter/plan-your-trip/arrival-by-car/ |website=Jungfrauregion |accessdate=1 April 2019 |language=en |date=28 April 2016 |quote=There is no road that goes to Wengen or M\u00fcrren}}</ref> It is one of very few [[Carfree city|car-free resort villages]] in Europe, although there are a few service vehicles, local farm vehicles, electric vehicles for taxiing to and from the railway station. This creates a tranquil atmosphere throughout the village and reduces traffic noise. For ecological reasons other resorts are considering following the car-free example.<ref>Hudson p. 107</ref> Across the Lauterbrunnen valley, M\u00fcrren, too, is largely car free.<ref name=access/>\n\nWengen is serviced by the [[Rack railway]] system [[Wengernalpbahn]] (WAB), and the village is accessible directly from [[Lauterbrunnen]], or by train from [[Grindelwald]] via [[Kleine Scheidegg]], as well as by a series of gondola lifts from Grindelwald via [[Mannlichen]]. In Kleine Scheidegg, the mountain pass at the foot of the [[Eiger]], M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau, passengers must disembark and change trains to travel down to Grindelwald and Grund.  The rail service from Lauterbrunnen to [[Wengen railway station]] runs daily from early in the morning until very late at night and is the most intensively operated section of the [[Wengernalpbahn]]. There are approximately 40 services between Lauterbrunnen to Wengen every day. Each service may consist of up to 4 separate trains, running closely behind each other because during busy periods, the scheduled train can be followed by additional trains as necessary, optimizing capacity<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jungfrau.ch/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-224//247_read-1026/ |title=Wengernalpbahn |language=German |publisher=Jungfraubahnen |accessdate=2010-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522200106/http://www.jungfrau.ch/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-224/247_read-1026/ |archivedate=May 22, 2010 }}</ref>\n[[File:WengenBahnhof.JPG|thumb|right|[[Wengen railway station]]]]\nThe uphill journey takes around 14 minutes, and the downhill journey takes 17 minutes. The downhill services take longer because they arrive at the midpoint passing place below [[Wengwald railway station|Wengwald]] slightly earlier than the uphill services, allowing the uphill services to pass them and proceed to Wengen without stopping. All trains now use the less steep but slightly longer route via Wengwald. The old route runs across the footpath to Wengen. It was used for freight transport after the new route was created, but has since been abandoned.  All freight is delivered by rail from Lauterbrunnen into a depot underneath the passenger railway station, and refuse is returned from the village also by rail. Every day one or two goods trains goes from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen and back carrying large items such as furniture.\n\nThe [[aerial tramway|cable car]] [[Luftseilbahn Wengen-M\u00e4nnlichen]] operates seasonally.  The view from the tram and from M\u00e4nnlichen above, affords clear vistas of Wengen and much of Lauterbrunnen Valley and small villages.\n\n== Recreation ==\n[[File:Karl Schranz, Lauberhorn 1966.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Karl Schranz]] winning in 1966]]\n[[File:Lauterbrunnental2.jpg|thumb|200px|View from Wengen<br>of [[Jungfrau]] and [[Lauterbrunnental]]]]\nWengen hosts the internationally well-known [[Lauberhorn ski races]], and it is on the route of the [[Jungfrau Marathon]].\n\nThe classic ski races have been held in Wengen since 1930, and traditionally consist of a [[Downhill (ski competition)|downhill]], a [[Slalom skiing|slalom]], and a [[Alpine skiing combined|combined]] event. In addition to being one of the technically most challenging downhill races, the Lauberhorn is the longest race in the [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|World Cup]] circuit and arguably the most scenic. The top racers complete the {{convert|4.455|km|2|abbr=on}} run in about 2\u00bd minutes and the top speeds reached at ''Haneggschuss'' are the highest on the circuit, approaching {{convert|160|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} a half-minute prior to the finish.\n\n[[File:Detail of the watercolour 'Wengen chalet', 1884 by Helga von Cramm (1840-circa 1901).jpg|thumbnail|200px|A [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] (dated 1894)<br>by Helga von Cramm (1840-c. 1920)]]\n\n== Culture ==\nA special cultural feature of Wengen is the so-called \"Pfeifende Lurch\" (German for \"whistling amphibian\").

This literature became the advent of the modern tourism industry for the village.<ref name=\"BritishTourism\"/> [[Felix Mendelssohn]], to whom there is a memorial above the village, also visited in the early nineteenth century.\n\nGuesthouses and hotels began to be built in the mid-19th century, with the opening of the ''Launerhaus'' in 1859, with accommodation for 30 guests, and in 1880 the ''Pension Wengen'' was available to 100 guests.<ref name=\"BritishTourism\"/>  The building and opening of the [[Wengernalpbahn]] in the 1890s made the village more accessible to tourists who previously had to walk up the steep slopes to the alpine village, opening the area for an expansion of tourism and the beginning of the ski industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jungfrau.ch/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-270//301_read-1617/ |title=Wengernalpbahn:History |language=German |publisher=Jungfraubahnen |accessdate=2010-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501184319/http://www.jungfrau.ch/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-270/301_read-1617/ |archivedate=May 1, 2010 }}\n</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, British tourists started ski-clubs in the area, beginning in the nearby village of M\u00fcrren. By 1903 Wengen had an  [[Anglican Church]] and two years later, [[Henry Simpson Lunn|Sir Henry Lunn]] formed the [[Public Schools Alpine Sports Club]] with Wengen as a destination ski area for the members.<ref name=\"BritishTourism\"/> A British [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister, Lunn first visited the area to organize a meeting of [[Protestant]] churches in nearby [[Grindelwald]] where he learned about winter sports such as skiing. He returned to the area in 1896 with his son [[Arnold Lunn|Arnold]], who quickly learned to ski, and both father and son realized the potential in the future of winter sports.  The club was established a few years later. Members of the Public Schools Alpine Sports Club were required to have attended an English public school or one of the \"older universities\".<ref>Beattie, p. 198</ref> Wengen's Curling Club was established in 1911.<ref name=\"BritishTourism\">[http://pages.unibas.ch/shine/swisstour20.html British and American Visitors in Switzerland:History of Tourism in Switzerland]</ref>\n\nThe first [[Alpine skiing|ski races]] were held in the early 1920s with the British downhill championship held in 1921;  the following year a ski race was held between [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]].<ref>Beattie, p. 199</ref> These events were the first to have downhill races as opposed to Nordic races, which were held in other Swiss resorts. In Wengen, skiers requested use of the train system for access to the slopes; for some years trains were the earliest ski-lifts in the area.<ref>Hudson, p. 19</ref> Arnold Lunn used the natural terrain of the mountains for the courses; the downhill event followed the slopes above Wengen and was called the \"straight down\": skiers went straight down the mountain. Also during this period, Lunn invented, and introduced in Wengen, the first [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] race, in which skiers followed the terrain through the trees, replaced with ski gates in later years. These events are considered the birth of modern [[ski racing]] and Alpine [[skiing]].<ref>Allen, p. 99</ref>\n\nFrom August 1944 to the end of [[World War II]], Wengen served as a sort of open-air internment camp for allied prisoners, mostly US bomber crews. Since the only practical way in or out of Wengen was via the cog railway, it was difficult for internees to escape.<ref name=\"WWII\">[http://swissinternees.tripod.com/wengen.htm]</ref>\n\n==Churches==\n\nWengen has three churches; Protestant English and Swiss and Roman Catholic.\n\nThe Swiss church was rebuilt in the 1950s and overlooks the Lauterbrunnen Valley.\n\nEnglish churches were established during the nineteenth century in nearby Grindelwald, Meiringen, and Murren.  By 1912, Anglican services were taking place in Wengen's Swiss church twice on Sundays.<ref>Northern Whig, 29 August 1912, p.7</ref>  Desiring their own building, the Continental & Colonial Church Society erected a new English church, which was consecrated on 15 January 1928 by the [[Bishop of Fulham]].<ref>West Middlesex Gazette, 14 January 1928, p.9</ref>  The building is on the road formerly leading to the Mannlichen cable car lift.  The new cable car station is however nearer the centre of Wengen.  St Bernard's has been used for over 90 years for Sunday services and occasional offices, such as the memorial in 1949 for Anthony Carrick, a schoolboy who died in the mountains.<ref>Gloucestershire Echo, 14 September 1949, p.4</ref>  The congregation in 1954 was described as consisting 'of people from many parts of the British Commonwealth and America as well as English-speaking Continentals'.<ref>Belfast Telegraph, 1 August 1955, p.4</ref> The congregation continues to be diverse.\n\nThe Roman Catholic church stands adjacent to the Falken Hotel and has a distinctive onion dome.  Mass is celebrated on most Sundays in-season.\n\n==Politics==\nTogether with villages of [[M\u00fcrren]], [[Isenfluh]], [[Gimmelwald]], [[Stechelberg]] and [[Lauterbrunnen]], Wengen forms the political commune of [[Lauterbrunnen]].\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Wengen and Lauterbrunnen valley from Mannlichen.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View from [[Luftseilbahn Wengen-M\u00e4nnlichen|M\u00e4nnlichen]] of Wengen, the [[Lauterbrunnen]] Valley and the [[Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen\u2013M\u00fcrren|M\u00fcrren Cableway]] on the opposite side of the valley.]]\nThere are generally no roads to Wengen/M\u00fcrren.<ref name=access>{{cite web |title=Arrival by car |url=https://wengen.swiss/en/winter/plan-your-trip/arrival-by-car/ |website=Jungfrauregion |accessdate=1 April 2019 |language=en |date=28 April 2016 |quote=There is no road that goes to Wengen or M\u00fcrren}}</ref> It is one of very few [[Carfree city|car-free resort villages]] in Europe, although there are a few service vehicles, local farm vehicles, electric vehicles for taxiing to and from the railway station. This creates a tranquil atmosphere throughout the village and reduces traffic noise. For ecological reasons other resorts are considering following the car-free example.<ref>Hudson p. 107</ref> Across the Lauterbrunnen valley, M\u00fcrren, too, is largely car free.<ref name=access/>\n\nWengen is serviced by the [[Rack railway]] system [[Wengernalpbahn]] (WAB), and the village is accessible directly from [[Lauterbrunnen]], or by train from [[Grindelwald]] via [[Kleine Scheidegg]], as well as by a series of gondola lifts from Grindelwald via [[Mannlichen]]. In Kleine Scheidegg, the mountain pass at the foot of the [[Eiger]], M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau, passengers must disembark and change trains to travel down to Grindelwald and Grund.  The rail service from Lauterbrunnen to [[Wengen railway station]] runs daily from early in the morning until very late at night and is the most intensively operated section of the [[Wengernalpbahn]]. There are approximately 40 services between Lauterbrunnen to Wengen every day. Each service may consist of up to 4 separate trains, running closely behind each other because during busy periods, the scheduled train can be followed by additional trains as necessary, optimizing capacity<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jungfrau.ch/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-224//247_read-1026/ |title=Wengernalpbahn |language=German |publisher=Jungfraubahnen |accessdate=2010-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522200106/http://www.jungfrau.ch/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-224/247_read-1026/ |archivedate=May 22, 2010 }}</ref>\n[[File:WengenBahnhof.JPG|thumb|right|[[Wengen railway station]]]]\nThe uphill journey takes around 14 minutes, and the downhill journey takes 17 minutes. The downhill services take longer because they arrive at the midpoint passing place below [[Wengwald railway station|Wengwald]] slightly earlier than the uphill services, allowing the uphill services to pass them and proceed to Wengen without stopping. All trains now use the less steep but slightly longer route via Wengwald. The old route runs across the footpath to Wengen. It was used for freight transport after the new route was created, but has since been abandoned.  All freight is delivered by rail from Lauterbrunnen into a depot underneath the passenger railway station, and refuse is returned from the village also by rail. Every day one or two goods trains goes from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen and back carrying large items such as furniture.\n\nThe [[aerial tramway|cable car]] [[Luftseilbahn Wengen-M\u00e4nnlichen]] operates seasonally.  The view from the tram and from M\u00e4nnlichen above, affords clear vistas of Wengen and much of Lauterbrunnen Valley and small villages.\n\n== Recreation ==\n[[File:Karl Schranz, Lauberhorn 1966.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Karl Schranz]] winning in 1966]]\n[[File:Lauterbrunnental2.jpg|thumb|200px|View from Wengen<br>of [[Jungfrau]] and [[Lauterbrunnental]]]]\nWengen hosts the internationally well-known [[Lauberhorn ski races]], and it is on the route of the [[Jungfrau Marathon]].\n\nThe classic ski races have been held in Wengen since 1930, and traditionally consist of a [[Downhill (ski competition)|downhill]], a [[Slalom skiing|slalom]], and a [[Alpine skiing combined|combined]] event. In addition to being one of the technically most challenging downhill races, the Lauberhorn is the longest race in the [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|World Cup]] circuit and arguably the most scenic. The top racers complete the {{convert|4.455|km|2|abbr=on}} run in about 2\u00bd minutes and the top speeds reached at ''Haneggschuss'' are the highest on the circuit, approaching {{convert|160|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} a half-minute prior to the finish.\n\n[[File:Detail of the watercolour 'Wengen chalet', 1884 by Helga von Cramm (1840-circa 1901).jpg|thumbnail|200px|A [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] (dated 1894)<br>by Helga von Cramm (1840-c. 1920)]]\n\n== Culture ==\nA special cultural feature of Wengen is the so-called \"Pfeifende Lurch\" (German for \"whistling amphibian\").

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a [[canting keel]] shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of [[leeway]] (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of [[jib]] and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and [[trysail]] (in place of the [[mainsail]]).

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a ''canting keel'' shifts angle to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of leeway (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of jib and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and trysail (in place of the mainsail).

His grandfather, Sebald Kepler, had been Lord Mayor of the city. By the time Johannes was born, he had two brothers and one sister and the Kepler family fortune was in decline. His father, Heinrich Kepler, earned a precarious living as a [[mercenary]], and he left the family when Johannes was five years old. He was believed to have died in the [[Eighty Years' War]] in the Netherlands. His mother, [[Katharina Kepler|Katharina Guldenmann]], an innkeeper's daughter, was a [[healer (alternative medicine)|healer]] and [[herbalist]]. Born prematurely, Johannes claimed to have been weak and sickly as a child. Nevertheless, he often impressed travelers at his grandfather's inn with his phenomenal mathematical faculty.<ref>Caspar.

''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&nbsp; 49\u201369.</ref>\n\n== Graz (1594\u20131600) ==\n=== ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' ===\n[[Image:Kepler-solar-system-1.png|thumb|Kepler's [[Platonic solid]] model of the [[Solar System]], from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' (1596)]]\nKepler's first major astronomical work, ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (''The Cosmographic Mystery'', 1596), was the first published defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] on 19 July 1595, while teaching in [[Graz]], demonstrating the periodic [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] of [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]] in the [[zodiac]]: he realized that [[regular polygon]]s bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional [[polyhedron|polyhedra]]. He found that each of the five [[Platonic solid]]s could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical [[orb (astronomy)|orbs]]; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets\u2014[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively\u2014[[octahedron]], [[icosahedron]], [[dodecahedron]], [[tetrahedron]], [[cube]]\u2014Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its [[orbital period]]: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.<ref>Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;60\u201365; see also: Barker and Goldstein, \"Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy.\"</ref>\n\nAs he indicated in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his [[theological]] convictions about the connection between the physical and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]]; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the [[Jesus|Son]], and the intervening space between to the [[Holy Spirit]]. His first manuscript of ''Mysterium'' contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.<ref>Barker and Goldstein. \"Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy,\" pp.&nbsp;99\u2013103, 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kepler-solar-system-2.png|thumb|left|Close-up of an inner section of Kepler's model]]\nWith the support of his mentor Michael Maestlin, Kepler received permission from the T\u00fcbingen university senate to publish his manuscript, pending removal of the Bible [[exegesis]] and the addition of a simpler, more understandable description of the Copernican system as well as Kepler's new ideas.  ''Mysterium'' was published late in 1596, and Kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597; it was not widely read, but it established Kepler's reputation as a highly-skilled astronomer. The effusive dedication, to powerful patrons as well as to the men who controlled his position in Graz, also provided a crucial doorway into the [[Patronage|patronage system]].<ref>Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;65\u201371.</ref>\n\nThough the details would be modified in light of his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]''. His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of ''Mysterium'', half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.<ref>Field. ''Kepler's Geometrical Cosmology'', Chapter IV, p 73ff.</ref>\n\nIn terms of the impact of ''Mysterium'', it can be seen as an important first step in modernizing the theory proposed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in his \"[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]\". Whilst Copernicus sought to advance a heliocentric system in this book, he resorted to Ptolemaic devices (viz., epicycles and eccentric circles) in order to explain the change in planets' orbital speed, and also continued to use as a point of reference the center of the Earth's orbit rather than that of the Sun \"as an aid to calculation and in order not to confuse the reader by diverging too much from Ptolemy.\" Modern astronomy owes much to ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'', despite flaws in its main thesis, \"since it represents the first step in cleansing the Copernican system of the remnants of the Ptolemaic theory still clinging to it.\"<ref>Dreyer, J.L.E.

M\u00fcller, an heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also the daughter of a successful mill owner. Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage. Even though Kepler had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on ''Mysterium'', but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication. However, Protestant officials\u2014who had helped set up the match\u2014pressured the M\u00fcllers to honor their agreement. Barbara and Johannes were married on 27 April 1597.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler''. pp.&nbsp;71\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn the first years of their marriage, the Keplers had two children (Heinrich and Susanna), both of whom died in infancy. In 1602, they had a daughter (Susanna); in 1604, a son (Friedrich); and in 1607, another son (Ludwig).<ref>Connor. ''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&nbsp;89\u2013100, 114\u2013116; Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;75\u201377</ref>\n\n=== Other research ===\nFollowing the publication of ''Mysterium'' and with the blessing of the Graz school inspectors, Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work. He planned four additional books: one on the stationary aspects of the universe (the Sun and the fixed stars); one on the planets and their motions; one on the physical nature of planets and the formation of geographical features (focused especially on Earth); and one on the effects of the heavens on the Earth, to include atmospheric optics, meteorology, and astrology.<ref>Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;85\u201386.</ref>\n\nHe also sought the opinions of many of the astronomers to whom he had sent ''Mysterium'', among them [[Reimarus Ursus]] (Nicolaus Reimers B\u00e4r)\u2014the imperial mathematician to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]] and a bitter rival of [[Tycho Brahe]]. Ursus did not reply directly, but republished Kepler's flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over (what is now called) the [[Tychonic system]] with Tycho. Despite this black mark, Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler, starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler's system; among a host of objections, Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus. Through their letters, Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems, dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory (particularly its theological viability). But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho's observatory, Kepler had no way to address many of these issues.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;86\u201389</ref>\n\nInstead, he turned his attention to [[chronology]] and \"harmony,\" the [[numerology|numerological]] relationships among music, [[mathematics]] and the physical world, and their [[astrology|astrological]] consequences. By assuming the Earth to possess a soul (a property he would later invoke to explain how the sun causes the motion of planets), he established a speculative system connecting [[astrological aspects]] and astronomical distances to [[meteorology|weather]] and other earthly phenomena. By 1599, however, he again felt his work limited by the inaccuracy of available data\u2014just as growing religious tension was also threatening his continued employment in Graz. In December of that year, Tycho invited Kepler to visit him in [[Prague]]; on 1 January 1600 (before he even received the invitation), Kepler set off in the hopes that Tycho's patronage could solve his philosophical problems as well as his social and financial ones.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;89\u2013100</ref>\n\n== Prague (1600\u20131612) ==\n\n=== Work for Tycho Brahe ===\n[[Image:Tycho Brahe.JPG|thumb|[[Tycho Brahe]]]]\n\nOn 4 February 1600, Kepler met [[Tycho Brahe]] and his assistants [[Franz Tengnagel]] and [[Longomontanus]] at [[Ben\u00e1tky nad Jizerou]] (35&nbsp;km from Prague), the site where Tycho's new observatory was being constructed. Over the next two months, he stayed as a guest, analyzing some of Tycho's observations of Mars; Tycho guarded his data closely, but was impressed by Kepler's theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access. Kepler planned to test his theory<ref>[http://knol.google.com/k/the-sky-before-the-telescope# Using Tycho's data, see 'Two views of a system' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014442/http://knol.google.com/k/the-sky-before-the-telescope |date=21 July 2011 }}</ref> from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' based on the Mars data, but he estimated that the work would take up to two years (since he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use). With the help of [[Johannes Jessenius]], Kepler attempted to negotiate a more formal employment arrangement with Tycho, but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and Kepler left for Prague on 6 April. Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements, and in June, Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;100\u201308.</ref>\n\nPolitical and religious difficulties in Graz dashed his hopes of returning immediately to Brahe; in hopes of continuing his astronomical studies, Kepler sought an appointment as a mathematician to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Ferdinand]]. To that end, Kepler composed an essay\u2014dedicated to Ferdinand\u2014in which he proposed a force-based theory of lunar motion: \"In Terra inest virtus, quae Lunam ciet\" (\"There is a force in the earth which causes the moon to move\").<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', p. 110.</ref>  Though the essay did not earn him a place in Ferdinand's court, it did detail a new method for measuring lunar eclipses, which he applied during 10 July eclipse in Graz. These observations formed the basis of his explorations of the laws of optics that would culminate in ''Astronomiae Pars Optica''.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;108\u201311.</ref>\n\nOn 2 August 1600, after refusing to convert to Catholicism, Kepler and his family were banished from Graz. Several months later, Kepler returned, now with the rest of his household, to Prague. Through most of 1601, he was supported directly by Tycho, who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against Tycho's (by then deceased) rival, Ursus. In September, Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor: the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' that should replace the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' of [[Erasmus Reinhold]]. Two days after Tycho's unexpected death on 24 October 1601, Kepler was appointed his successor as the imperial mathematician with the responsibility to complete his unfinished work. The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;111\u201322.</ref>\n\n=== Advisor to Emperor Rudolph II ===\nKepler's primary obligation as imperial mathematician was to provide astrological advice to the emperor. Though Kepler took a dim view of the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in T\u00fcbingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars (including numerous [[Alchemy|alchemists]]) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;149\u201353</ref>\n\nOfficially, the only acceptable religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and [[Utraquist]], but Kepler's position in the imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered. The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family, but the difficulties of the over-extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle. Partly because of financial troubles, his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant, marred with bickering and bouts of sickness. Court life, however, brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars ([[Johannes Matth\u00e4us Wackher von Wackhenfels]], [[Jost B\u00fcrgi]], [[David Fabricius]], Martin Bachazek, and Johannes Brengger, among others) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;146\u2013148, 159\u2013177</ref>\n\n=== ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' ===\n[[Image:Kepler Optica.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A plate from ''[[Astronomiae Pars Optica]]'', illustrating the structure of eyes of various species.]]\n<!--[[File:Kepler - Ad Vitellionem paralipomena quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur, 1604 - 158093 F.jpg|thumb|''Astronomiae pars optica'']]-->\n\nAs Kepler slowly continued analyzing Tycho's Mars observations\u2014now available to him in their entirety\u2014and began the slow process of tabulating the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'', Kepler also picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600. Both lunar and [[solar eclipse]]s presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of [[atmospheric refraction]] applied to ''all'' astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on 1 January 1604, was published as ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' (The Optical Part of Astronomy). In it, Kepler described the [[inverse-square law]] governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of [[pinhole camera]]s, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as [[parallax]] and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. He also extended his study of optics to the human eye, and is generally considered by neuroscientists to be the first to recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the [[Lens (anatomy)|eye's lens]] onto the [[retina]]. The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics, although he did suggest that the image was later corrected \"in the hollows of the brain\" due to the \"activity of the Soul.\"<ref>Finger, \"Origins of Neuroscience,\" p. 74. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001.</ref> Today, ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the [[law of refraction]] is conspicuously absent).<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp. 142\u2013146</ref> With respect to the beginnings of [[projective geometry]], Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work. He argued that if a [[Focus (geometry)|focus]] of a [[conic section]] were allowed to move along the line joining the foci, the geometric form would morph or degenerate, one into another. In this way, an [[ellipse]] becomes a [[parabola]] when a focus moves toward infinity, and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another, a circle is formed. As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another, the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines. He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single [[point at infinity]], thus having the properties of a large circle.<ref>[[Morris Kline]], ''[[Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times]]'', p. 299. [[Oxford University Press]], 1972.</ref>\n\n=== Supernova of 1604 ===\n{{see also|Kepler's Supernova}} [[Image:Keplers supernova.jpg|thumb|Remnant of Kepler's Supernova [[SN 1604]]]]\n\nIn October 1604, a bright new evening star ([[SN 1604]]) appeared, but Kepler did not believe the rumors until he saw it himself. Kepler began systematically observing the nova. Astrologically, the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a [[fiery trigon]], the start of the about 800-year cycle of [[great conjunction]]s; astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of [[Charlemagne]] (c. 800 years earlier) and the birth of Christ (c. 1600 years earlier), and thus expected events of great portent, especially regarding the emperor. It was in this context, as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor, that Kepler described the new star two years later in his ''[[De Stella Nova]]''. In it, Kepler addressed the star's astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating. He noted its fading luminosity, speculated about its origin, and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in the sphere of fixed stars, further undermining the doctrine of the immutability of the heavens (the idea accepted since Aristotle that the [[celestial spheres]] were perfect and unchanging). The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens. In an appendix, Kepler also discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]]; he calculated that, if Suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind, then the [[Star of Bethlehem]]\u2014analogous to the present new star\u2014would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800-year cycle.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;153\u2013157</ref>\n[[Image:Kepler Drawing of SN 1604.png|thumb|upright|left|The location of the ''stella nova'', in the foot of [[Ophiuchus]], is marked with an ''N'' (8 grid squares down, 4 over from the left).]]\n\n=== ''Astronomia nova'' ===\nThe extended line of research that culminated in ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' (''A New Astronomy'')\u2014including the first two [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]]\u2014began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of Mars' orbit. Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars' orbit using an [[equant]] (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two [[arcminute]]s (the average measurement error). But he was not satisfied with the complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about trying to fit an [[ovoid]] orbit to the data.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;123\u2013128</ref>\n\nIn Kepler's religious view of the cosmos, the Sun (a symbol of [[God the Father]]) was the source of motive force in the Solar System. As a physical basis, Kepler drew by analogy on [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert's]] theory of the magnetic soul of the Earth from ''[[De Magnete]]'' (1600) and on his own work on optics. Kepler supposed that the motive power (or motive ''species'')<ref>On motive species, see Lindberg, \"The Genesis of Kepler's Theory of Light,\" pp.&nbsp;38\u201340.</ref> radiated by the Sun weakens with distance, causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it.<ref>Koyr\u00e9, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;199\u2013202.</ref>{{efn|\"Kepler's decision to base his causal explanation of planetary motion on a distance-velocity law, rather than on uniform circular motions of compounded spheres, marks a major shift from ancient to modern conceptions of science&nbsp;... [Kepler] had begun with physical principles and had then derived a trajectory from it, rather than simply constructing new models.  In other words, even before discovering the area law, Kepler had abandoned uniform circular motion as a physical principle.\"<ref>Peter Barker and Bernard R. Goldstein, \"Distance and Velocity in Kepler's Astronomy\", ''Annals of Science,'' 51 (1994): 59\u201373, at p. 60.</ref>}} Perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order. Based on measurements of the [[aphelion]] and [[perihelion]] of the Earth and Mars, he created a formula in which a planet's rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun. Verifying this relationship throughout the orbital cycle, however, required very extensive calculation; to simplify this task, by late 1602 Kepler reformulated the proportion in terms of geometry: ''planets sweep out equal areas in equal times''\u2014Kepler's second law of planetary motion.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;129\u2013132</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kepler Mars retrograde.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the [[geocentric]] trajectory of Mars through several periods of [[apparent retrograde motion]] (''Astronomia nova,'' Chapter 1, 1609)]]\n\nHe then set about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the geometrical rate law and assuming an egg-shaped [[ovoid]] orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in early 1605 he at last hit upon the idea of an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', p.&nbsp;133</ref> Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data, he immediately concluded that ''all planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus''\u2014Kepler's first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, however, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for ''Astronomia nova'', though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;131\u2013140; Koyr\u00e9, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;277\u2013279</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Dioptrice}}''Dioptrice'', ''Somnium'' manuscript, and other work ===\nIn the years following the completion of ''Astronomia Nova'', most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the ''Rudolphine Tables'' and a comprehensive set of [[ephemerides]] (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based on the table (though neither would be completed for many years). He also attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Antonio Magini]]. Some of his other work dealt with chronology, especially the [[Chronology of Jesus|dating of events in the life of Jesus]], and with astrology, especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of [[Helisaeus Roeslin]].<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;178\u201381</ref>\n\nKepler and Roeslin engaged in a series of published attacks and counter-attacks, while physician Philip Feselius published a work dismissing astrology altogether (and Roeslin's work in particular). In response to what Kepler saw as the excesses of astrology on the one hand and overzealous rejection of it on the other, Kepler prepared ''Tertius Interveniens'' [Third-party Interventions]. Nominally this work\u2014presented to the common patron of Roeslin and Feselius\u2014was a neutral mediation between the feuding scholars, but it also set out Kepler's general views on the value of astrology, including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls. While Kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be the \"evil-smelling dung\" in which \"an industrious hen\" scrapes, there was an \"occasional grain-seed, indeed, even a pearl or a gold nugget\" to be found by the conscientious scientific astrologer.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;181\u201385. The full title is ''Tertius Interveniens, das ist Warnung an etliche Theologos, Medicos vnd Philosophos, sonderlich D.

Upon publishing his account as ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' [Starry Messenger], Galileo sought the opinion of Kepler, in part to bolster the credibility of his observations. Kepler responded enthusiastically with a short published reply, ''Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo'' [Conversation with the Starry Messenger]. He endorsed Galileo's observations and offered a range of speculations about the meaning and implications of Galileo's discoveries and telescopic methods, for astronomy and optics as well as cosmology and astrology. Later that year, Kepler published his own telescopic observations of the moons in ''Narratio de Jovis Satellitibus'', providing further support of Galileo. To Kepler's disappointment, however, Galileo never published his reactions (if any) to ''Astronomia Nova''.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp. 192\u2013197</ref>\n\nAfter hearing of Galileo's telescopic discoveries, Kepler also started a theoretical and experimental investigation of telescopic optics using a telescope borrowed from Duke Ernest of Cologne.<ref>Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers'' p. 384</ref> The resulting manuscript was completed in September 1610 and published as ''Dioptrice'' in 1611. In it, Kepler set out the theoretical basis of [[double-convex converging lens]]es and [[double-concave diverging lens]]es\u2014and how they are combined to produce a [[Galilean telescope]]\u2014as well as the concepts of [[real image|real]] vs. [[virtual image|virtual]] images, upright vs. inverted images, and the effects of focal length on magnification and reduction. He also described an improved telescope\u2014now known as the ''astronomical'' or ''[[Keplerian telescope]]''\u2014in which two convex lenses can produce higher magnification than Galileo's combination of convex and concave lenses.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;198\u2013202</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kepler conjecture 2.jpg|thumb|One of the diagrams from ''Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula'', illustrating the [[Kepler conjecture]]]]\n\nAround 1611, Kepler circulated a manuscript of what would eventually be published (posthumously) as ''[[Somnium (novel)|Somnium]]'' [The Dream]. Part of the purpose of ''Somnium'' was to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from the perspective of another planet, to show the feasibility of a non-geocentric system. The manuscript, which disappeared after changing hands several times, described a fantastic trip to the Moon; it was part allegory, part autobiography, and part treatise on interplanetary travel (and is sometimes described as the first work of science fiction). Years later, a distorted version of the story may have instigated the witchcraft trial against his mother, as the mother of the narrator consults a demon to learn the means of space travel. Following her eventual acquittal, Kepler composed 223 footnotes to the story\u2014several times longer than the actual text\u2014which explained the allegorical aspects as well as the considerable scientific content (particularly regarding lunar geography) hidden within the text.<ref>Lear, ''Kepler's Dream'', pp.&nbsp;1\u201378</ref>\n\n===Work in mathematics and physics===\nAs a New Year's gift that year (1611), he also composed for his friend and some-time patron, Baron Wackher von Wackhenfels, a short pamphlet entitled ''Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula'' (''A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow''). In this treatise, he published the first description of the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes and, extending the discussion into a hypothetical [[atomism|atomistic]] physical basis for the symmetry, posed what later became known as the [[Kepler conjecture]], a statement about the most efficient arrangement for packing spheres.<ref>Schneer, \"Kepler's New Year's Gift of a Snowflake,\" pp.&nbsp;531\u201345</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Kepler |first1=Johannes |editor1-last=Hardie |editor1-first=Colin |title=De nive sexangula |trans-title=The Six-sided Snowflake |url= |date=1966 |origyear=1611 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn= |oclc=974730 }}</ref>\n\n=== Personal and political troubles ===\nIn 1611, the growing political-religious tension in Prague came to a head. Emperor Rudolph\u2014whose health was failing\u2014was forced to abdicate as [[List of rulers of Bohemia|King of Bohemia]] by his brother [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]]. Both sides sought Kepler's astrological advice, an opportunity he used to deliver conciliatory political advice (with little reference to the stars, except in general statements to discourage drastic action). However, it was clear that Kepler's future prospects in the court of Matthias were dim.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;202\u2013204</ref>\n\nAlso in that year, Barbara Kepler contracted [[Hungarian spotted fever]], then began having [[seizure]]s. As Barbara was recovering, Kepler's three children all fell sick with smallpox; Friedrich, 6, died. Following his son's death, Kepler sent letters to potential patrons in W\u00fcrttemberg and [[Padua]]. At the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] in W\u00fcrttemberg, concerns over Kepler's perceived [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] heresies in violation of the [[Augsburg Confession]] and the [[Formula of Concord]] prevented his return. The [[University of Padua]]\u2014on the recommendation of the departing Galileo\u2014sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship, but Kepler, preferring to keep his family in German territory, instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in [[Linz]]. However, Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler's return.<ref>Connor, ''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&nbsp;222\u2013226; Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;204\u201307</ref>\n\nKepler postponed the move to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolph's death in early 1612, though between political upheaval, religious tension, and family tragedy (along with the legal dispute over his wife's estate), Kepler could do no research. Instead, he pieced together a chronology manuscript, ''Eclogae Chronicae'', from correspondence and earlier work. Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;208\u201311</ref>\n\n== Linz and elsewhere (1612\u20131630) ==\n[[Image:Kepler Statue Linz.jpg|thumb|A statue of Kepler in [[Linz]]]]\n\nIn Linz, Kepler's primary responsibilities (beyond completing the ''Rudolphine Tables'') were teaching at the district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague\u2014though he was excluded from [[Eucharist]] by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler had to deal with the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother [[Katharina Kepler|Katharina]] in the Protestant town of [[Leonberg]]. That blow, happening only a few years after Kepler's [[excommunication]], is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GhamrvcsVyIC&pg=PT125&lpg=PT125&dq=mazer+waged+an+assault+against+kepler#v=onepage&q=mazer%20waged%20an%20assault%20against%20kepler&f=false|title=Shifting the Earth: The Mathematica Quest to Understand the Motion of the Universe|last=Mazer|first=Arthur|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=978-1-118-02427--0|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHis first publication in Linz was ''De vero Anno'' (1613), an expanded treatise on the year of Christ's birth; he also participated in deliberations on whether to introduce [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope Gregory]]'s [[Gregorian calendar|reformed calendar]] to Protestant German lands; that year he also wrote the influential mathematical treatise ''Nova stereometria doliorum vinariorum'', on measuring the volume of containers such as wine barrels, published in 1615.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;209\u201320, 227\u2013240</ref>\n\n=== Second marriage ===\nOn 30 October 1613, Kepler married the 24-year-old Susanna Reuttinger.

Despite the title, which referred simply to heliocentrism, Kepler's textbook culminated in his own ellipse-based system. The ''Epitome'' became Kepler's most influential work. It contained all three laws of planetary motion and attempted to explain heavenly motions through physical causes.<ref name=\"Gingerich pp 302\">Gingerich, \"Kepler, Johannes\" from ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'', pp.&nbsp;302\u201304</ref> Though it explicitly extended the first two laws of planetary motion (applied to Mars in ''Astronomia nova'') to all the planets as well as the Moon and the [[Galilean moons|Medicean satellites of Jupiter]],{{efn|By 1621 or earlier, Kepler recognized that Jupiter's moons obey his third law. Kepler contended that rotating massive bodies communicate their rotation to their satellites, so that the satellites are swept around the central body; thus the rotation of the Sun drives the revolutions of the planets and the rotation of the Earth drives the revolution of the Moon.  In Kepler's era, no one had any evidence of Jupiter's rotation.  However, Kepler argued that the force by which a central body causes its satellites to revolve around it, weakens with distance; consequently, satellites that are farther from the central body revolve slower.  Kepler noted that Jupiter's moons obeyed this pattern and he inferred that a similar force was responsible.  He also noted that the orbital periods and semi-major axes of Jupiter's satellites were roughly related by a 3/2 power law, as are the orbits of the six (then known) planets.  However, this relation was approximate:  the periods of Jupiter's moons were known within a few percent of their modern values, but the moons' semi-major axes were determined less accurately.

The dispute escalated, and in 1617 Katharina was accused of [[European witchcraft|witchcraft]]; witchcraft trials were relatively common in central Europe at this time. Beginning in August 1620, she was imprisoned for fourteen months. She was released in October 1621, thanks in part to the extensive legal defense drawn up by Kepler. The accusers had no stronger evidence than rumors. Katharina was subjected to ''territio verbalis'', a graphic description of the torture awaiting her as a witch, in a final attempt to make her confess. Throughout the trial, Kepler postponed his other work to focus on his \"harmonic theory\". The result, published in 1619, was ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (\"Harmony of the World\").<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;240\u2013264; Connor, ''Kepler's Witch'', chapters I, XI-XIII; Lear, ''Kepler's Dream'', pp.&nbsp;21\u201339</ref>\n\n=== ''Harmonices Mundi'' ===\n{{main|Harmonices Mundi}}\n\nKepler was convinced \"that the geometrical things have provided the Creator with the model for decorating the whole world\".<ref>Quotation from Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;265\u2013266, translated from ''Harmonices Mundi''</ref> In ''Harmony'', he attempted to explain the proportions of the natural world\u2014particularly the astronomical and astrological aspects\u2014in terms of music.{{efn|The opening of the movie ''[[Mars et Avril]]'' by [[Martin Villeneuve]] is based on German astronomer Johannes Kepler's cosmological model from the 17th century, ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'', in which the harmony of the universe is determined by the motion of celestial bodies.

From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies\u2014and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] and orbital distance from the Sun.

In the meantime, religious tension \u2013 the root of the ongoing [[Thirty Years' War]] \u2013 once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy. In 1625, agents of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Counter-Reformation]] placed most of Kepler's library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged.

Though not the general's court astrologer per se, Kepler provided astronomical calculations for Wallenstein's astrologers and occasionally wrote horoscopes himself. In his final years, Kepler spent much of his time traveling, from the imperial court in Prague to Linz and [[Ulm]] to a temporary home in [[\u017baga\u0144|Sagan]], and finally to [[Regensburg]].

These and other histories written from an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] perspective treated Kepler's metaphysical and religious arguments with skepticism and disapproval, but later [[Romanticism in science|Romantic]]-era natural philosophers viewed these elements as central to his success.  \n[[William Whewell]], in his influential ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' of 1837, found Kepler to be the archetype of the inductive scientific genius; in his ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'' of 1840, Whewell held Kepler up as the embodiment of the most advanced forms of [[scientific method]]. Similarly, [[Ernst Friedrich Apelt]]\u2014the first to extensively study Kepler's manuscripts, after their purchase by [[Catherine the Great]]\u2014identified Kepler as a key to the \"[[Scientific revolution|Revolution of the sciences]]\". \nApelt, who saw Kepler's mathematics, aesthetic sensibility, physical ideas, and theology as part of a unified system of thought, produced the first extended analysis of Kepler's life and work.<ref>Jardine, \"Koyr\u00e9's Kepler/Kepler's Koyr\u00e9,\" pp.&nbsp;363\u2013367</ref>\n\n[[Alexandre Koyr\u00e9]]'s work on Kepler was, after Apelt, the first major milestone in historical interpretations of Kepler's cosmology and its influence. In the 1930s and 1940s, Koyr\u00e9, and a number of others in the first generation of professional historians of science, described the \"[[Scientific Revolution]]\" as the central event in the history of science, and Kepler as a (perhaps the) central figure in the revolution. Koyr\u00e9 placed Kepler's theorization, rather than his empirical work, at the center of the intellectual transformation from ancient to modern world-views. Since the 1960s, the volume of historical Kepler scholarship has expanded greatly, including studies of his astrology and meteorology, his geometrical methods, the role of his religious views in his work, his literary and rhetorical methods, his interaction with the broader cultural and philosophical currents of his time, and even his role as an historian of science.<ref>Jardine, \"Koyr\u00e9's Kepler/Kepler's Koyr\u00e9,\" pp.&nbsp;367\u2013372; Shapin, ''The Scientific Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;1\u20132</ref>\n\nPhilosophers of science\u2014such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Stephen Toulmin]], and [[Karl Popper]]\u2014have repeatedly turned to Kepler: examples of [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]], [[analogical reasoning]], falsification, and many other philosophical concepts have been found in Kepler's work. Physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]] even used Kepler's priority dispute with Robert Fludd to explore the implications of [[analytical psychology]] on scientific investigation.<ref>Pauli, \"The Influence of Archetypical Ideas\"</ref>\n\n===Editions and translations===\nModern translations of a number of Kepler's books appeared in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the systematic publication of his collected works began in 1937 (and is nearing completion in the early 21st century).\n\nAn edition in eight volumes, '' Kepleri Opera omnia,'' was prepared by Christian Frisch (1807\u20131881), during 1858 to 1871, on the occasion of Kepler's 300th birthday.\nFrisch's edition only included Kepler's Latin, with a Latin commentary.\n\nA new edition was planned beginning in 1914 by [[Walther von Dyck]] (1856\u20131934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts to convince the Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler that had not been available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.\n\nMax Caspar (1880\u20131956) published his German translation of Kepler's ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' in 1923.  \nBoth Dyck and Caspar were influenced in their interest in Kepler by mathematician [[Alexander von Brill]] (1842\u20131935). \nCaspar became Dyck's collaborator, succeeding him as project leader in 1934, establishing the ''Kepler-Kommission'' in the following year. Assisted by Martha List (1908\u20131992) and Franz Hammer (1898\u20131979), Caspar continued editorial work during World War II. \nMax Caspar also published a biography of Kepler in 1948.<ref>Gingerich, introduction to Caspar's ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;3\u20134</ref> The commission was later chaired by Volker Bialas (during 1976\u20132003) and Ulrich Grigull (during 1984\u20131999) and [[Roland Bulirsch]] (1998\u20132014).<ref>\nUlrich Grigull, \"Sechzig Jahre Kepler-Kommission\", in: Sitzungsberichte der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften [Sitzung vom 5.

Mathematik, Technik und Wissenschaftsorganisation an der TH M\u00fcnchen, Stuttgart, 2003.\n</ref>\n\n===Popular science and historical fiction===\nKepler has acquired a popular image as an icon of scientific modernity and a man before his time; science popularizer [[Carl Sagan]] described him as \"the first [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and the last scientific astrologer\".<ref>Quote from Carl Sagan, ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', episode III: \"The Harmony of the Worlds\". Kepler was hardly the first to combine physics and astronomy; however, according to the traditional (though disputed) interpretation of the [[Scientific Revolution]], he would be the first astrophysicist in the era of modern science.</ref>\n\nThe debate over Kepler's place in the Scientific Revolution has produced a wide variety of philosophical and popular treatments. One of the most influential is [[Arthur Koestler]]'s 1959 ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'', in which Kepler is unambiguously the hero (morally and theologically as well as intellectually) of the revolution.<ref>Stephen Toulmin, Review of ''The Sleepwalkers'' in ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 59, no. 18 (1962), pp.&nbsp;500\u2013503</ref>\n\nA well-received, if fanciful, historical novel by [[John Banville]], ''Kepler'' (1981), explored many of the themes developed in Koestler's non-fiction narrative and in the philosophy of science.<ref>William Donahue, \"A Novelist's Kepler,\" ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', Vol. 13 (1982), pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136; \"Dancing the grave dance: Science, art and religion in John Banville's ''Kepler'',\" ''English Studies'', Vol. 86, no. 5 (October 2005), pp.&nbsp;424\u2013438</ref>  \nSomewhat more fanciful is a recent work of nonfiction, ''Heavenly Intrigue'' (2004), suggesting that Kepler murdered Tycho Brahe to gain access to his data.<ref>[[Marcelo Gleiser]], \"Kepler in the Dock\", review of Gilder and Gilder's ''Heavenly Intrigue'', ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', Vol. 35, pt. 4 (2004), pp.&nbsp;487\u2013489</ref>\n\n=== Veneration and eponymy===\nIn Austria, Kepler left behind such a historical legacy that he was one of the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2002 coinage|10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin]], minted on 10 September 2002. The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with [[Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg|Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg]] personally, and he probably influenced the construction of [[Eggenberg Castle]] (the motif of the obverse of the coin). In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum''.<ref name=\"Eggenberg Palace coin\">{{cite web | url=http://austrian-mint.at/silbermuenzen?l=en&muenzeSubTypeId=108&muenzeId=336 | title=Eggenberg Palace coin | publisher=Austrian Mint | accessdate=9 September 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210659/http://www.austrian-mint.at/silbermuenzen?l=en | archivedate=31 May 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe German composer [[Paul Hindemith]] wrote an opera about Kepler entitled ''[[Die Harmonie der Welt]]'', and a symphony of the same name was derived from music for the opera.\n[[Philip Glass]] wrote an opera called ''[[Kepler (opera)|Kepler]]'' based on Kepler's life (2009).\n\nKepler is honored together with Nicolaus Copernicus with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on 23 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://satucket.com/lectionary/Calendar.htm|title=Calendar of the Church Year according to the Episcopal Church|publisher=Charles Wohlers|accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{main|List of things named after Johannes Kepler}}\nDirectly named for Kepler's contribution to science are [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]], [[Kepler's Supernova]] (Supernova 1604, which he observed and described) and the [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra|Kepler Solids]], a set of geometrical constructions, two of which were described by him, and the [[Kepler conjecture]] on [[sphere packing]].\n\n[[File:AS12-52-7745.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Kepler (lunar crater)|Kepler crater]] as photographed by [[Apollo 12]] in 1969]]\n*In astronomy: The lunar crater [[Kepler (lunar crater)|Kepler]] (''Keplerus'', named by [[Giovanni Riccioli]], 1651), the asteroid [[1134 Kepler]] (1929), [[Kepler (crater on Mars)]] (1973), [[Kepler Launch Site]] for model rockets (2001), the [[Kepler space telescope]], a space [[photometer]] launched by [[NASA]] in 2009,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytech.com/Kepler+Mission+Sets+Out+to+Find+Planets+Using+CCD+Cameras/article14421.htm |title=Kepler Mission Sets Out to Find Planets Using CCD Cameras |work=DailyTech |first=Jansen |last=Ng |date=3 July 2009 |accessdate=3 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310010146/http://www.dailytech.com/Kepler+Mission+Sets+Out+to+Find+Planets+Using+CCD+Cameras/article14421.htm |archivedate=10 March 2009  }}</ref> [[Johannes Kepler ATV|''Johannes Kepler'' ATV]] ([[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] launched to resupply the [[International Space Station|ISS]] in 2011).\n*Educational institutions: [[Johannes Kepler University Linz]] (1975), [[Kepler College]] (Seattle, Washington), besides several institutions of primary and secondary education, such as Johannes Kepler Grammar School,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gjk.cz|title=GJK.cz|publisher=GJK.cz|accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref> at the site where Kepler lived in Prague, and ''Kepler Gymnasium'', [[T\u00fcbingen]]\n*Streets or squares named after him:  Keplerplatz Vienna (station of [[Vienna U-Bahn]]), Keplerstra\u00dfe in Hanau near Frankfurt am Main, Keplerstra\u00dfe in Munich, Germany, Keplerstra\u00dfe and Keplerbr\u00fccke in Graz, Austria, Keplerova ulice in Prague, ulitsa Keplera in Verkhnetemernitsky near [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Russia]].\n* The [[Kepler Mountains]] and [[Kepler Track]] in Fiordland National Park, South Island, New Zealand;

His grandfather, Sebald Kepler, had been Lord Mayor of the city. By the time Johannes was born, he had two brothers and one sister and the Kepler family fortune was in decline. His father, Heinrich Kepler, earned a precarious living as a [[mercenary]], and he left the family when Johannes was five years old. He was believed to have died in the [[Eighty Years' War]] in the Netherlands. His mother, [[Katharina Kepler|Katharina Guldenmann]], an innkeeper's daughter, was a [[healer (alternative medicine)|healer]] and [[herbalist]]. Born prematurely, Johannes claimed to have been weak and sickly as a child. Nevertheless, he often impressed travelers at his grandfather's inn with his phenomenal mathematical faculty.<ref>Caspar.

Under the instruction of Michael Maestlin, T\u00fcbingen's professor of mathematics from 1583 to 1631,<ref name=\"Kepler's Astronomy Author 2001 p. 96\"/> he learned both the [[Ptolemaic system]] and the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] of planetary motion. He became a [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] at that time. In a student disputation, he defended [[heliocentrism]] from both a theoretical and theological perspective, maintaining that the [[Sun]] was the principal source of motive power in the universe.<ref>Westman, Robert S. \"Kepler's Early Physico-Astrological Problematic,\" ''[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]]'', '''32''' (2001): 227\u201336.</ref> Despite his desire to become a minister, near the end of his studies, Kepler was recommended for a position as teacher of mathematics and astronomy at the Protestant school in Graz.

''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&nbsp; 49\u201369.</ref>\n\n== Graz (1594\u20131600) ==\n=== ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' ===\n[[Image:Kepler-solar-system-1.png|thumb|Kepler's [[Platonic solid]] model of the [[Solar System]], from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' (1596)]]\nKepler's first major astronomical work, ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (''The Cosmographic Mystery'', 1596), was the first published defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] on 19 July 1595, while teaching in [[Graz]], demonstrating the periodic [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] of [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]] in the [[zodiac]]: he realized that [[regular polygon]]s bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional [[polyhedron|polyhedra]]. He found that each of the five [[Platonic solid]]s could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical [[orb (astronomy)|orbs]]; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets\u2014[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively\u2014[[octahedron]], [[icosahedron]], [[dodecahedron]], [[tetrahedron]], [[cube]]\u2014Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its [[orbital period]]: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.<ref>Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;60\u201365; see also: Barker and Goldstein, \"Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy.\"</ref>\n\nAs he indicated in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his [[theological]] convictions about the connection between the physical and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]]; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the [[Jesus|Son]], and the intervening space between to the [[Holy Spirit]]. His first manuscript of ''Mysterium'' contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.<ref>Barker and Goldstein. \"Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy,\" pp.&nbsp;99\u2013103, 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kepler-solar-system-2.png|thumb|left|Close-up of an inner section of Kepler's model]]\nWith the support of his mentor Michael Maestlin, Kepler received permission from the T\u00fcbingen university senate to publish his manuscript, pending removal of the Bible [[exegesis]] and the addition of a simpler, more understandable description of the Copernican system as well as Kepler's new ideas.  ''Mysterium'' was published late in 1596, and Kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597; it was not widely read, but it established Kepler's reputation as a highly-skilled astronomer. The effusive dedication, to powerful patrons as well as to the men who controlled his position in Graz, also provided a crucial doorway into the [[Patronage|patronage system]].<ref>Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;65\u201371.</ref>\n\nThough the details would be modified in light of his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]''. His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of ''Mysterium'', half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.<ref>Field. ''Kepler's Geometrical Cosmology'', Chapter IV, p 73ff.</ref>\n\nIn terms of the impact of ''Mysterium'', it can be seen as an important first step in modernizing the theory proposed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in his \"[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]\". Whilst Copernicus sought to advance a heliocentric system in this book, he resorted to Ptolemaic devices (viz., epicycles and eccentric circles) in order to explain the change in planets' orbital speed, and also continued to use as a point of reference the center of the Earth's orbit rather than that of the Sun \"as an aid to calculation and in order not to confuse the reader by diverging too much from Ptolemy.\" Modern astronomy owes much to ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'', despite flaws in its main thesis, \"since it represents the first step in cleansing the Copernican system of the remnants of the Ptolemaic theory still clinging to it.\"<ref>Dreyer, J.L.E.

M\u00fcller, an heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also the daughter of a successful mill owner. Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage. Even though Kepler had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on ''Mysterium'', but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication. However, Protestant officials\u2014who had helped set up the match\u2014pressured the M\u00fcllers to honor their agreement. Barbara and Johannes were married on 27 April 1597.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler''. pp.&nbsp;71\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn the first years of their marriage, the Keplers had two children (Heinrich and Susanna), both of whom died in infancy. In 1602, they had a daughter (Susanna); in 1604, a son (Friedrich); and in 1607, another son (Ludwig).<ref>Connor. ''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&nbsp;89\u2013100, 114\u2013116; Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;75\u201377</ref>\n\n=== Other research ===\nFollowing the publication of ''Mysterium'' and with the blessing of the Graz school inspectors, Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work. He planned four additional books: one on the stationary aspects of the universe (the Sun and the fixed stars); one on the planets and their motions; one on the physical nature of planets and the formation of geographical features (focused especially on Earth); and one on the effects of the heavens on the Earth, to include atmospheric optics, meteorology, and astrology.<ref>Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;85\u201386.</ref>\n\nHe also sought the opinions of many of the astronomers to whom he had sent ''Mysterium'', among them [[Reimarus Ursus]] (Nicolaus Reimers B\u00e4r)\u2014the imperial mathematician to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]] and a bitter rival of [[Tycho Brahe]]. Ursus did not reply directly, but republished Kepler's flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over (what is now called) the [[Tychonic system]] with Tycho. Despite this black mark, Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler, starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler's system; among a host of objections, Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus. Through their letters, Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems, dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory (particularly its theological viability). But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho's observatory, Kepler had no way to address many of these issues.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;86\u201389</ref>\n\nInstead, he turned his attention to [[chronology]] and \"harmony,\" the [[numerology|numerological]] relationships among music, [[mathematics]] and the physical world, and their [[astrology|astrological]] consequences. By assuming the Earth to possess a soul (a property he would later invoke to explain how the sun causes the motion of planets), he established a speculative system connecting [[astrological aspects]] and astronomical distances to [[meteorology|weather]] and other earthly phenomena. By 1599, however, he again felt his work limited by the inaccuracy of available data\u2014just as growing religious tension was also threatening his continued employment in Graz. In December of that year, Tycho invited Kepler to visit him in [[Prague]]; on 1 January 1600 (before he even received the invitation), Kepler set off in the hopes that Tycho's patronage could solve his philosophical problems as well as his social and financial ones.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;89\u2013100</ref>\n\n== Prague (1600\u20131612) ==\n\n=== Work for Tycho Brahe ===\n[[Image:Tycho Brahe.JPG|thumb|[[Tycho Brahe]]]]\n\nOn 4 February 1600, Kepler met [[Tycho Brahe]] and his assistants [[Franz Tengnagel]] and [[Longomontanus]] at [[Ben\u00e1tky nad Jizerou]] (35&nbsp;km from Prague), the site where Tycho's new observatory was being constructed. Over the next two months, he stayed as a guest, analyzing some of Tycho's observations of Mars; Tycho guarded his data closely, but was impressed by Kepler's theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access. Kepler planned to test his theory<ref>[http://knol.google.com/k/the-sky-before-the-telescope# Using Tycho's data, see 'Two views of a system' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014442/http://knol.google.com/k/the-sky-before-the-telescope |date=21 July 2011 }}</ref> from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' based on the Mars data, but he estimated that the work would take up to two years (since he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use). With the help of [[Johannes Jessenius]], Kepler attempted to negotiate a more formal employment arrangement with Tycho, but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and Kepler left for Prague on 6 April. Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements, and in June, Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;100\u201308.</ref>\n\nPolitical and religious difficulties in Graz dashed his hopes of returning immediately to Brahe; in hopes of continuing his astronomical studies, Kepler sought an appointment as a mathematician to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Ferdinand]]. To that end, Kepler composed an essay\u2014dedicated to Ferdinand\u2014in which he proposed a force-based theory of lunar motion: \"In Terra inest virtus, quae Lunam ciet\" (\"There is a force in the earth which causes the moon to move\").<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', p. 110.</ref>  Though the essay did not earn him a place in Ferdinand's court, it did detail a new method for measuring lunar eclipses, which he applied during 10 July eclipse in Graz. These observations formed the basis of his explorations of the laws of optics that would culminate in ''Astronomiae Pars Optica''.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;108\u201311.</ref>\n\nOn 2 August 1600, after refusing to convert to Catholicism, Kepler and his family were banished from Graz. Several months later, Kepler returned, now with the rest of his household, to Prague. Through most of 1601, he was supported directly by Tycho, who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against Tycho's (by then deceased) rival, Ursus. In September, Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor: the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' that should replace the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' of [[Erasmus Reinhold]]. Two days after Tycho's unexpected death on 24 October 1601, Kepler was appointed his successor as the imperial mathematician with the responsibility to complete his unfinished work. The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;111\u201322.</ref>\n\n=== Advisor to Emperor Rudolph II ===\nKepler's primary obligation as imperial mathematician was to provide astrological advice to the emperor. Though Kepler took a dim view of the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in T\u00fcbingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars (including numerous [[Alchemy|alchemists]]) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;149\u201353</ref>\n\nOfficially, the only acceptable religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and [[Utraquist]], but Kepler's position in the imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered. The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family, but the difficulties of the over-extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle. Partly because of financial troubles, his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant, marred with bickering and bouts of sickness. Court life, however, brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars ([[Johannes Matth\u00e4us Wackher von Wackhenfels]], [[Jost B\u00fcrgi]], [[David Fabricius]], Martin Bachazek, and Johannes Brengger, among others) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;146\u2013148, 159\u2013177</ref>\n\n=== ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' ===\n[[Image:Kepler Optica.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A plate from ''[[Astronomiae Pars Optica]]'', illustrating the structure of eyes of various species.]]\n<!--[[File:Kepler - Ad Vitellionem paralipomena quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur, 1604 - 158093 F.jpg|thumb|''Astronomiae pars optica'']]-->\n\nAs Kepler slowly continued analyzing Tycho's Mars observations\u2014now available to him in their entirety\u2014and began the slow process of tabulating the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'', Kepler also picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600. Both lunar and [[solar eclipse]]s presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of [[atmospheric refraction]] applied to ''all'' astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on 1 January 1604, was published as ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' (The Optical Part of Astronomy). In it, Kepler described the [[inverse-square law]] governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of [[pinhole camera]]s, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as [[parallax]] and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. He also extended his study of optics to the human eye, and is generally considered by neuroscientists to be the first to recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the [[Lens (anatomy)|eye's lens]] onto the [[retina]]. The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics, although he did suggest that the image was later corrected \"in the hollows of the brain\" due to the \"activity of the Soul.\"<ref>Finger, \"Origins of Neuroscience,\" p. 74. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001.</ref> Today, ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the [[law of refraction]] is conspicuously absent).<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp. 142\u2013146</ref> With respect to the beginnings of [[projective geometry]], Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work. He argued that if a [[Focus (geometry)|focus]] of a [[conic section]] were allowed to move along the line joining the foci, the geometric form would morph or degenerate, one into another. In this way, an [[ellipse]] becomes a [[parabola]] when a focus moves toward infinity, and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another, a circle is formed. As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another, the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines. He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single [[point at infinity]], thus having the properties of a large circle.<ref>[[Morris Kline]], ''[[Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times]]'', p. 299. [[Oxford University Press]], 1972.</ref>\n\n=== Supernova of 1604 ===\n{{see also|Kepler's Supernova}} [[Image:Keplers supernova.jpg|thumb|Remnant of Kepler's Supernova [[SN 1604]]]]\n\nIn October 1604, a bright new evening star ([[SN 1604]]) appeared, but Kepler did not believe the rumors until he saw it himself. Kepler began systematically observing the nova. Astrologically, the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a [[fiery trigon]], the start of the about 800-year cycle of [[great conjunction]]s; astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of [[Charlemagne]] (c. 800 years earlier) and the birth of Christ (c. 1600 years earlier), and thus expected events of great portent, especially regarding the emperor. It was in this context, as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor, that Kepler described the new star two years later in his ''[[De Stella Nova]]''. In it, Kepler addressed the star's astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating. He noted its fading luminosity, speculated about its origin, and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in the sphere of fixed stars, further undermining the doctrine of the immutability of the heavens (the idea accepted since Aristotle that the [[celestial spheres]] were perfect and unchanging). The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens. In an appendix, Kepler also discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]]; he calculated that, if Suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind, then the [[Star of Bethlehem]]\u2014analogous to the present new star\u2014would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800-year cycle.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;153\u2013157</ref>\n[[Image:Kepler Drawing of SN 1604.png|thumb|upright|left|The location of the ''stella nova'', in the foot of [[Ophiuchus]], is marked with an ''N'' (8 grid squares down, 4 over from the left).]]\n\n=== ''Astronomia nova'' ===\nThe extended line of research that culminated in ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' (''A New Astronomy'')\u2014including the first two [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]]\u2014began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of Mars' orbit. Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars' orbit using an [[equant]] (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two [[arcminute]]s (the average measurement error). But he was not satisfied with the complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about trying to fit an [[ovoid]] orbit to the data.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;123\u2013128</ref>\n\nIn Kepler's religious view of the cosmos, the Sun (a symbol of [[God the Father]]) was the source of motive force in the Solar System. As a physical basis, Kepler drew by analogy on [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert's]] theory of the magnetic soul of the Earth from ''[[De Magnete]]'' (1600) and on his own work on optics. Kepler supposed that the motive power (or motive ''species'')<ref>On motive species, see Lindberg, \"The Genesis of Kepler's Theory of Light,\" pp.&nbsp;38\u201340.</ref> radiated by the Sun weakens with distance, causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it.<ref>Koyr\u00e9, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;199\u2013202.</ref>{{efn|\"Kepler's decision to base his causal explanation of planetary motion on a distance-velocity law, rather than on uniform circular motions of compounded spheres, marks a major shift from ancient to modern conceptions of science&nbsp;... [Kepler] had begun with physical principles and had then derived a trajectory from it, rather than simply constructing new models.  In other words, even before discovering the area law, Kepler had abandoned uniform circular motion as a physical principle.\"<ref>Peter Barker and Bernard R. Goldstein, \"Distance and Velocity in Kepler's Astronomy\", ''Annals of Science,'' 51 (1994): 59\u201373, at p. 60.</ref>}} Perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order. Based on measurements of the [[aphelion]] and [[perihelion]] of the Earth and Mars, he created a formula in which a planet's rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun. Verifying this relationship throughout the orbital cycle, however, required very extensive calculation; to simplify this task, by late 1602 Kepler reformulated the proportion in terms of geometry: ''planets sweep out equal areas in equal times''\u2014Kepler's second law of planetary motion.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;129\u2013132</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kepler Mars retrograde.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the [[geocentric]] trajectory of Mars through several periods of [[apparent retrograde motion]] (''Astronomia nova,'' Chapter 1, 1609)]]\n\nHe then set about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the geometrical rate law and assuming an egg-shaped [[ovoid]] orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in early 1605 he at last hit upon the idea of an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', p.&nbsp;133</ref> Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data, he immediately concluded that ''all planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus''\u2014Kepler's first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, however, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for ''Astronomia nova'', though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;131\u2013140; Koyr\u00e9, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;277\u2013279</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Dioptrice}}''Dioptrice'', ''Somnium'' manuscript, and other work ===\nIn the years following the completion of ''Astronomia Nova'', most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the ''Rudolphine Tables'' and a comprehensive set of [[ephemerides]] (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based on the table (though neither would be completed for many years). He also attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Antonio Magini]]. Some of his other work dealt with chronology, especially the [[Chronology of Jesus|dating of events in the life of Jesus]], and with astrology, especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of [[Helisaeus Roeslin]].<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;178\u201381</ref>\n\nKepler and Roeslin engaged in a series of published attacks and counter-attacks, while physician Philip Feselius published a work dismissing astrology altogether (and Roeslin's work in particular). In response to what Kepler saw as the excesses of astrology on the one hand and overzealous rejection of it on the other, Kepler prepared ''Tertius Interveniens'' [Third-party Interventions]. Nominally this work\u2014presented to the common patron of Roeslin and Feselius\u2014was a neutral mediation between the feuding scholars, but it also set out Kepler's general views on the value of astrology, including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls. While Kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be the \"evil-smelling dung\" in which \"an industrious hen\" scrapes, there was an \"occasional grain-seed, indeed, even a pearl or a gold nugget\" to be found by the conscientious scientific astrologer.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;181\u201385. The full title is ''Tertius Interveniens, das ist Warnung an etliche Theologos, Medicos vnd Philosophos, sonderlich D. Philippum Feselium, dass sie bey billicher Verwerffung der Sternguckerischen Aberglauben nict das Kindt mit dem Badt ausssch\u00fctten vnd hiermit jhrer Profession vnwissendt zuwider handlen'', translated by [[C. Doris Hellman]] as \"''Tertius Interveniens'', that is warning to some theologians, medics and philosophers, especially D.

Now a museum [https://web.archive.org/web/20090910212442/http://www.keplervpraze.cz/en/] ]]\n\nIn the first months of 1610, [[Galileo Galilei]]\u2014using his powerful new [[telescope]]\u2014discovered four satellites orbiting Jupiter. Upon publishing his account as ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' [Starry Messenger], Galileo sought the opinion of Kepler, in part to bolster the credibility of his observations. Kepler responded enthusiastically with a short published reply, ''Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo'' [Conversation with the Starry Messenger]. He endorsed Galileo's observations and offered a range of speculations about the meaning and implications of Galileo's discoveries and telescopic methods, for astronomy and optics as well as cosmology and astrology. Later that year, Kepler published his own telescopic observations of the moons in ''Narratio de Jovis Satellitibus'', providing further support of Galileo. To Kepler's disappointment, however, Galileo never published his reactions (if any) to ''Astronomia Nova''.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp. 192\u2013197</ref>\n\nAfter hearing of Galileo's telescopic discoveries, Kepler also started a theoretical and experimental investigation of telescopic optics using a telescope borrowed from Duke Ernest of Cologne.<ref>Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers'' p. 384</ref> The resulting manuscript was completed in September 1610 and published as ''Dioptrice'' in 1611. In it, Kepler set out the theoretical basis of [[double-convex converging lens]]es and [[double-concave diverging lens]]es\u2014and how they are combined to produce a [[Galilean telescope]]\u2014as well as the concepts of [[real image|real]] vs. [[virtual image|virtual]] images, upright vs. inverted images, and the effects of focal length on magnification and reduction. He also described an improved telescope\u2014now known as the ''astronomical'' or ''[[Keplerian telescope]]''\u2014in which two convex lenses can produce higher magnification than Galileo's combination of convex and concave lenses.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;198\u2013202</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kepler conjecture 2.jpg|thumb|One of the diagrams from ''Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula'', illustrating the [[Kepler conjecture]]]]\n\nAround 1611, Kepler circulated a manuscript of what would eventually be published (posthumously) as ''[[Somnium (novel)|Somnium]]'' [The Dream]. Part of the purpose of ''Somnium'' was to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from the perspective of another planet, to show the feasibility of a non-geocentric system. The manuscript, which disappeared after changing hands several times, described a fantastic trip to the Moon; it was part allegory, part autobiography, and part treatise on interplanetary travel (and is sometimes described as the first work of science fiction). Years later, a distorted version of the story may have instigated the witchcraft trial against his mother, as the mother of the narrator consults a demon to learn the means of space travel. Following her eventual acquittal, Kepler composed 223 footnotes to the story\u2014several times longer than the actual text\u2014which explained the allegorical aspects as well as the considerable scientific content (particularly regarding lunar geography) hidden within the text.<ref>Lear, ''Kepler's Dream'', pp.&nbsp;1\u201378</ref>\n\n===Work in mathematics and physics===\nAs a New Year's gift that year (1611), he also composed for his friend and some-time patron, Baron Wackher von Wackhenfels, a short pamphlet entitled ''Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula'' (''A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow''). In this treatise, he published the first description of the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes and, extending the discussion into a hypothetical [[atomism|atomistic]] physical basis for the symmetry, posed what later became known as the [[Kepler conjecture]], a statement about the most efficient arrangement for packing spheres.<ref>Schneer, \"Kepler's New Year's Gift of a Snowflake,\" pp.&nbsp;531\u201345</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Kepler |first1=Johannes |editor1-last=Hardie |editor1-first=Colin |title=De nive sexangula |trans-title=The Six-sided Snowflake |url= |date=1966 |origyear=1611 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn= |oclc=974730 }}</ref>\n\n=== Personal and political troubles ===\nIn 1611, the growing political-religious tension in Prague came to a head. Emperor Rudolph\u2014whose health was failing\u2014was forced to abdicate as [[List of rulers of Bohemia|King of Bohemia]] by his brother [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]]. Both sides sought Kepler's astrological advice, an opportunity he used to deliver conciliatory political advice (with little reference to the stars, except in general statements to discourage drastic action). However, it was clear that Kepler's future prospects in the court of Matthias were dim.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;202\u2013204</ref>\n\nAlso in that year, Barbara Kepler contracted [[Hungarian spotted fever]], then began having [[seizure]]s. As Barbara was recovering, Kepler's three children all fell sick with smallpox; Friedrich, 6, died. Following his son's death, Kepler sent letters to potential patrons in W\u00fcrttemberg and [[Padua]]. At the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] in W\u00fcrttemberg, concerns over Kepler's perceived [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] heresies in violation of the [[Augsburg Confession]] and the [[Formula of Concord]] prevented his return. The [[University of Padua]]\u2014on the recommendation of the departing Galileo\u2014sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship, but Kepler, preferring to keep his family in German territory, instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in [[Linz]]. However, Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler's return.<ref>Connor, ''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&nbsp;222\u2013226; Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;204\u201307</ref>\n\nKepler postponed the move to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolph's death in early 1612, though between political upheaval, religious tension, and family tragedy (along with the legal dispute over his wife's estate), Kepler could do no research. Instead, he pieced together a chronology manuscript, ''Eclogae Chronicae'', from correspondence and earlier work. Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;208\u201311</ref>\n\n== Linz and elsewhere (1612\u20131630) ==\n[[Image:Kepler Statue Linz.jpg|thumb|A statue of Kepler in [[Linz]]]]\n\nIn Linz, Kepler's primary responsibilities (beyond completing the ''Rudolphine Tables'') were teaching at the district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague\u2014though he was excluded from [[Eucharist]] by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler had to deal with the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother [[Katharina Kepler|Katharina]] in the Protestant town of [[Leonberg]]. That blow, happening only a few years after Kepler's [[excommunication]], is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GhamrvcsVyIC&pg=PT125&lpg=PT125&dq=mazer+waged+an+assault+against+kepler#v=onepage&q=mazer%20waged%20an%20assault%20against%20kepler&f=false|title=Shifting the Earth: The Mathematica Quest to Understand the Motion of the Universe|last=Mazer|first=Arthur|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=978-1-118-02427--0|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHis first publication in Linz was ''De vero Anno'' (1613), an expanded treatise on the year of Christ's birth; he also participated in deliberations on whether to introduce [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope Gregory]]'s [[Gregorian calendar|reformed calendar]] to Protestant German lands; that year he also wrote the influential mathematical treatise ''Nova stereometria doliorum vinariorum'', on measuring the volume of containers such as wine barrels, published in 1615.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;209\u201320, 227\u2013240</ref>\n\n=== Second marriage ===\nOn 30 October 1613, Kepler married the 24-year-old Susanna Reuttinger.

Despite the title, which referred simply to heliocentrism, Kepler's textbook culminated in his own ellipse-based system. The ''Epitome'' became Kepler's most influential work. It contained all three laws of planetary motion and attempted to explain heavenly motions through physical causes.<ref name=\"Gingerich pp 302\">Gingerich, \"Kepler, Johannes\" from ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'', pp.&nbsp;302\u201304</ref> Though it explicitly extended the first two laws of planetary motion (applied to Mars in ''Astronomia nova'') to all the planets as well as the Moon and the [[Galilean moons|Medicean satellites of Jupiter]],{{efn|By 1621 or earlier, Kepler recognized that Jupiter's moons obey his third law. Kepler contended that rotating massive bodies communicate their rotation to their satellites, so that the satellites are swept around the central body; thus the rotation of the Sun drives the revolutions of the planets and the rotation of the Earth drives the revolution of the Moon.  In Kepler's era, no one had any evidence of Jupiter's rotation.  However, Kepler argued that the force by which a central body causes its satellites to revolve around it, weakens with distance; consequently, satellites that are farther from the central body revolve slower.  Kepler noted that Jupiter's moons obeyed this pattern and he inferred that a similar force was responsible.  He also noted that the orbital periods and semi-major axes of Jupiter's satellites were roughly related by a 3/2 power law, as are the orbits of the six (then known) planets.  However, this relation was approximate:  the periods of Jupiter's moons were known within a few percent of their modern values, but the moons' semi-major axes were determined less accurately. Kepler discussed Jupiter's moons in his ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae|Summary of Copernican Astronomy]]'':<ref>Linz (\"Lentiis ad Danubium\"), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 4, part 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg=PA554#v=onepage&q&f=false page 554]</ref><ref>Christian Frisch, ed., ''Joannis Kepleri Astronomi Opera Omnia'', vol. 6 (Frankfurt-am-Main, (Germany):  Heyder & Zimmer, 1866), [https://books.google.com/books?id=xjMAAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA361#v=onepage&q&f=false page 361].)</ref><!--Original :  ''4) Confirmatur vero fides hujus rei comparatione quatuor Jovialium et Jovis cum sex planetis et Sole.

Because, regarding the body of Jupiter, whether it turns around its axis, we don't have proofs for what suffices for us [regarding the rotation of ] the body of the Earth and especially of the Sun, certainly [as reason proves to us]:  but reason attests that, just as it is clearly [true] among the six planets around the Sun, so also it is among the four [moons] of Jupiter, because around the body of Jupiter any [satellite] that can go farther from it orbits slower, and even that [orbit's period] is not in the same proportion, but greater [than the distance from Jupiter]; that is, 3/2 (''sescupla'' ) of the proportion of each of the distances from Jupiter, which is clearly the very [proportion] as [is used for] the six planets above.  In his [book] ''The World of Jupiter'' [''Mundus Jovialis'', 1614], [[Simon Marius|[Simon] Mayr]] [1573\u20131624] presents these distances, from Jupiter, of the four [moons] of Jupiter:  3, 5, 8, 13 (or 14 [according to] Galileo)&nbsp;... Mayr presents their time periods:  1 day 18 1/2 hours, 3 days 13 1/3 hours, 7 days 3 hours, 16 days 18 hours:  for all [of these data] the proportion is greater than double, thus greater than [the proportion] of the distances 3, 5, 8, 13 or 14, although less than [the proportion] of the squares, which double the proportions of the distances, namely 9, 25, 64, 169 or 196, just as [a power of] 3/2 is also greater than 1 but less than 2.}}}} it did not explain how elliptical orbits could be derived from observational data.<ref>Wolf, ''A History of Science, Technology and Philosophy'', pp.&nbsp;140\u201341; Pannekoek, ''A History of Astronomy'', p 252</ref>\n\nAs a spin-off from the ''Rudolphine Tables'' and the related ''Ephemerides'', Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work\u2014especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars\u2014six between 1617 and 1624\u2014Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather as well as political events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;239, 300\u201301, 307\u201308</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kepler-1619-pl-3.jpg|thumb|Geometrical harmonies in the perfect solids from ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (1619)]]\n\nIn 1615, Ursula Reingold, a woman in a financial dispute with Kepler's brother Christoph, claimed Kepler's mother Katharina had made her sick with an evil brew. The dispute escalated, and in 1617 Katharina was accused of [[European witchcraft|witchcraft]]; witchcraft trials were relatively common in central Europe at this time. Beginning in August 1620, she was imprisoned for fourteen months. She was released in October 1621, thanks in part to the extensive legal defense drawn up by Kepler. The accusers had no stronger evidence than rumors. Katharina was subjected to ''territio verbalis'', a graphic description of the torture awaiting her as a witch, in a final attempt to make her confess. Throughout the trial, Kepler postponed his other work to focus on his \"harmonic theory\". The result, published in 1619, was ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (\"Harmony of the World\").<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;240\u2013264; Connor, ''Kepler's Witch'', chapters I, XI-XIII; Lear, ''Kepler's Dream'', pp.&nbsp;21\u201339</ref>\n\n=== ''Harmonices Mundi'' ===\n{{main|Harmonices Mundi}}\n\nKepler was convinced \"that the geometrical things have provided the Creator with the model for decorating the whole world\".<ref>Quotation from Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;265\u2013266, translated from ''Harmonices Mundi''</ref> In ''Harmony'', he attempted to explain the proportions of the natural world\u2014particularly the astronomical and astrological aspects\u2014in terms of music.{{efn|The opening of the movie ''[[Mars et Avril]]'' by [[Martin Villeneuve]] is based on German astronomer Johannes Kepler's cosmological model from the 17th century, ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'', in which the harmony of the universe is determined by the motion of celestial bodies.

From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies\u2014and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler\u2014with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories\u2014treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;266\u201390</ref>\n\nAmong many other harmonies, Kepler articulated what came to be known as the third law of planetary motion.

However, due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe's heir, it would not be printed until 1627. In the meantime, religious tension \u2013 the root of the ongoing [[Thirty Years' War]] \u2013 once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy. In 1625, agents of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Counter-Reformation]] placed most of Kepler's library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged. Kepler moved to [[Ulm]], where he arranged for the printing of the ''Tables'' at his own expense.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;308\u2013328</ref>\n\nIn 1628, following the military successes of the Emperor Ferdinand's armies under [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|General Wallenstein]], Kepler became an official advisor to Wallenstein. Though not the general's court astrologer per se, Kepler provided astronomical calculations for Wallenstein's astrologers and occasionally wrote horoscopes himself. In his final years, Kepler spent much of his time traveling, from the imperial court in Prague to Linz and [[Ulm]] to a temporary home in [[\u017baga\u0144|Sagan]], and finally to [[Regensburg]]. Soon after arriving in Regensburg, Kepler fell ill. He died on 15 November 1630, and was buried there; his burial site was lost after the Swedish army destroyed the churchyard.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;332\u2013351, 355\u201361</ref> Only Kepler's self-authored poetic epitaph survived the times:\n\n:''Mensus eram coelos, nunc terrae metior umbras''\n:''Mens coelestis erat, corporis umbra iacet.''\n\n:I measured the skies, now the shadows I measure\n:Skybound was the mind, earthbound the body rests.<ref>Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers, p. 427.</ref>\n\n== Christianity ==\n\nKepler's belief that God created the cosmos in an orderly fashion caused him to attempt to determine and comprehend the laws that govern the natural world, most profoundly in astronomy.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johannes-Kepler | title=Johannes Kepler &#124; Biography, Discoveries, & Facts}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/science/astronomy/The-techniques-of-astronomy#ref1211452 | title=Astronomy \u2013 the techniques of astronomy}}</ref> The phrase \"I am merely thinking God's thoughts after Him\" has been attributed to him, although this is probably a capsulized version of a writing from his hand:\n<blockquote>Those laws [of nature] are within the grasp of the human mind; God wanted us to recognize them by creating us after his own image so that we could share in his own thoughts.<ref>Letter (9/10 Apr 1599) to the Bavarian chancellor Herwart von Hohenburg.

Several major figures such as [[Galileo]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] completely ignored Kepler's ''Astronomia nova.''  Many astronomers, including Kepler's teacher, Michael Maestlin, objected to Kepler's introduction of physics into his astronomy. Some adopted compromise positions. [[Isma\u00ebl Bullialdus]] accepted elliptical orbits but replaced Kepler's area law with uniform motion in respect to the empty focus of the ellipse, while [[Seth Ward (bishop)|Seth Ward]] used an elliptical orbit with motions defined by an equant.<ref>For a detailed study of the reception of Kepler's astronomy see Wilbur Applebaum, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996HisSc..34..451A \"Keplerian Astronomy after Kepler: Researches and Problems,\"] ''History of Science'', 34(1996): 451\u2013504.</ref><ref>Koyr\u00e9, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;362\u2013364</ref><ref>North, ''History of Astronomy and Cosmology'', pp.&nbsp; 355\u201360</ref>\n\nSeveral astronomers tested Kepler's theory, and its various modifications, against astronomical observations. Two transits of Venus and Mercury across the face of the sun provided sensitive tests of the theory, under circumstances when these planets could not normally be observed. In the case of the transit of Mercury in 1631, Kepler had been extremely uncertain of the parameters for Mercury, and advised observers to look for the transit the day before and after the predicted date.  [[Pierre Gassendi]] observed the transit on the date predicted, a confirmation of Kepler's prediction.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Albert van |last=Helden |title=The Importance of the Transit of Mercury of 1631 |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=7 |year=1976 |pages=1\u201310|bibcode = 1976JHA.....7....1V |doi=10.1177/002182867600700101 }}</ref> This was the first observation of a transit of Mercury.

In the late 17th century, a number of physical astronomy theories drawing from Kepler's work\u2014notably those of [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]] and Robert Hooke\u2014began to incorporate attractive forces (though not the quasi-spiritual motive species postulated by Kepler) and the Cartesian concept of [[Principle of inertia (physics)|inertia]].<ref>Lawrence Nolan (ed.), ''The Cambridge Descartes Lexicon'', Cambridge University Press, 2016, \"Inertia.\"</ref> This culminated in Isaac Newton's ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687), in which Newton derived Kepler's laws of planetary motion from a force-based theory of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]].<ref>Kuhn, ''The Copernican Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;238, 246\u2013252</ref>\n\n== Historical and cultural legacy ==\n[[Image:Brahe kepler.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Tycho Brahe and Kepler in [[Prague]], Czech Republic]]\n[[Image:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1971, MiNr 1649.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[East Germany|GDR]] stamp featuring Kepler]]\n\n===History of science===\nBeyond his role in the historical development of astronomy and natural philosophy, Kepler has loomed large in the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] and [[historiography of science]]. Kepler and his laws of motion were central to early histories of astronomy such as [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla]]'s 1758 ''Histoire des math\u00e9matiques'' and [[Jean-Baptiste Delambre]]'s 1821 ''Histoire de l'astronomie moderne''. These and other histories written from an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] perspective treated Kepler's metaphysical and religious arguments with skepticism and disapproval, but later [[Romanticism in science|Romantic]]-era natural philosophers viewed these elements as central to his success.  \n[[William Whewell]], in his influential ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' of 1837, found Kepler to be the archetype of the inductive scientific genius; in his ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'' of 1840, Whewell held Kepler up as the embodiment of the most advanced forms of [[scientific method]]. Similarly, [[Ernst Friedrich Apelt]]\u2014the first to extensively study Kepler's manuscripts, after their purchase by [[Catherine the Great]]\u2014identified Kepler as a key to the \"[[Scientific revolution|Revolution of the sciences]]\". \nApelt, who saw Kepler's mathematics, aesthetic sensibility, physical ideas, and theology as part of a unified system of thought, produced the first extended analysis of Kepler's life and work.<ref>Jardine, \"Koyr\u00e9's Kepler/Kepler's Koyr\u00e9,\" pp.&nbsp;363\u2013367</ref>\n\n[[Alexandre Koyr\u00e9]]'s work on Kepler was, after Apelt, the first major milestone in historical interpretations of Kepler's cosmology and its influence. In the 1930s and 1940s, Koyr\u00e9, and a number of others in the first generation of professional historians of science, described the \"[[Scientific Revolution]]\" as the central event in the history of science, and Kepler as a (perhaps the) central figure in the revolution. Koyr\u00e9 placed Kepler's theorization, rather than his empirical work, at the center of the intellectual transformation from ancient to modern world-views. Since the 1960s, the volume of historical Kepler scholarship has expanded greatly, including studies of his astrology and meteorology, his geometrical methods, the role of his religious views in his work, his literary and rhetorical methods, his interaction with the broader cultural and philosophical currents of his time, and even his role as an historian of science.<ref>Jardine, \"Koyr\u00e9's Kepler/Kepler's Koyr\u00e9,\" pp.&nbsp;367\u2013372; Shapin, ''The Scientific Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;1\u20132</ref>\n\nPhilosophers of science\u2014such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Stephen Toulmin]], and [[Karl Popper]]\u2014have repeatedly turned to Kepler: examples of [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]], [[analogical reasoning]], falsification, and many other philosophical concepts have been found in Kepler's work. Physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]] even used Kepler's priority dispute with Robert Fludd to explore the implications of [[analytical psychology]] on scientific investigation.<ref>Pauli, \"The Influence of Archetypical Ideas\"</ref>\n\n===Editions and translations===\nModern translations of a number of Kepler's books appeared in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the systematic publication of his collected works began in 1937 (and is nearing completion in the early 21st century).\n\nAn edition in eight volumes, '' Kepleri Opera omnia,'' was prepared by Christian Frisch (1807\u20131881), during 1858 to 1871, on the occasion of Kepler's 300th birthday.\nFrisch's edition only included Kepler's Latin, with a Latin commentary.\n\nA new edition was planned beginning in 1914 by [[Walther von Dyck]] (1856\u20131934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts to convince the Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler that had not been available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.\n\nMax Caspar (1880\u20131956) published his German translation of Kepler's ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' in 1923.  \nBoth Dyck and Caspar were influenced in their interest in Kepler by mathematician [[Alexander von Brill]] (1842\u20131935). \nCaspar became Dyck's collaborator, succeeding him as project leader in 1934, establishing the ''Kepler-Kommission'' in the following year. Assisted by Martha List (1908\u20131992) and Franz Hammer (1898\u20131979), Caspar continued editorial work during World War II. \nMax Caspar also published a biography of Kepler in 1948.<ref>Gingerich, introduction to Caspar's ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;3\u20134</ref> The commission was later chaired by Volker Bialas (during 1976\u20132003) and Ulrich Grigull (during 1984\u20131999) and [[Roland Bulirsch]] (1998\u20132014).<ref>\nUlrich Grigull, \"Sechzig Jahre Kepler-Kommission\", in: Sitzungsberichte der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften [Sitzung vom 5.

Kepler was hardly the first to combine physics and astronomy; however, according to the traditional (though disputed) interpretation of the [[Scientific Revolution]], he would be the first astrophysicist in the era of modern science.</ref>\n\nThe debate over Kepler's place in the Scientific Revolution has produced a wide variety of philosophical and popular treatments. One of the most influential is [[Arthur Koestler]]'s 1959 ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'', in which Kepler is unambiguously the hero (morally and theologically as well as intellectually) of the revolution.<ref>Stephen Toulmin, Review of ''The Sleepwalkers'' in ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 59, no. 18 (1962), pp.&nbsp;500\u2013503</ref>\n\nA well-received, if fanciful, historical novel by [[John Banville]], ''Kepler'' (1981), explored many of the themes developed in Koestler's non-fiction narrative and in the philosophy of science.<ref>William Donahue, \"A Novelist's Kepler,\" ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', Vol. 13 (1982), pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136; \"Dancing the grave dance: Science, art and religion in John Banville's ''Kepler'',\" ''English Studies'', Vol. 86, no. 5 (October 2005), pp.&nbsp;424\u2013438</ref>  \nSomewhat more fanciful is a recent work of nonfiction, ''Heavenly Intrigue'' (2004), suggesting that Kepler murdered Tycho Brahe to gain access to his data.<ref>[[Marcelo Gleiser]], \"Kepler in the Dock\", review of Gilder and Gilder's ''Heavenly Intrigue'', ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', Vol. 35, pt. 4 (2004), pp.&nbsp;487\u2013489</ref>\n\n=== Veneration and eponymy===\nIn Austria, Kepler left behind such a historical legacy that he was one of the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2002 coinage|10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin]], minted on 10 September 2002.

It is the largest indoor Asian shopping mall in North America, and has been reported as the largest Asian shopping mall in the [[Western world]]. The mall is located on the northeast corner of [[Steeles Avenue]] and [[York Regional Road 3|Kennedy Road]], along the city limits with [[Toronto]]. Opened in the mid-1990s amid a period of significant  [[History of Chinese immigration to Canada|Chinese immigration to Canada]], the mall operates as a [[Condominium|condominium corporation]] with 450 individual units. The mall also includes Heritage Town, a Pacific-style market that functions as a notable [[tourism in Canada|tourist destination]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. \n\nAn [[Remington Centre|addition to Pacific Mall]] that would occupy the site formerly held by [[Market Village]], a now-defunct mall adjacent to Pacific Mall, was announced in 2005. The expansion would see the construction of a structure that would bring the combined retail space of the malls to {{conv|1000000|ft2|m2|sigfig=1}}, though the project has faced numerous delays.

[[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is the largest indoor Asian shopping mall in North America, and has been reported as the largest Asian shopping mall in the [[Western world]]. The mall is located on the northeast corner of [[Steeles Avenue]] and [[York Regional Road 3|Kennedy Road]], along the city limits with [[Toronto]]. Opened in the mid-1990s amid a period of [[History of Chinese immigration to Canada|significant Chinese immigration to Canada]], the mall operates as a [[Condominium|condominium corporation]] with 450 individual units. The mall also includes Heritage Town, a Pacific-style market that functions as a notable [[tourism in Canada|tourist destination]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. \n\nAn [[Remington Centre|addition to Pacific Mall]] that would occupy the site formerly held by [[Market Village]], a now-defunct mall adjacent to Pacific Mall, was announced in 2005. The expansion would see the construction of a structure that would bring the combined retail space of the malls to {{conv|1000000|ft2|m2|sigfig=1}}, though the project has faced numerous delays. Pacific Mall is noted as a location for the sale of [[counterfeit goods]]; stores in Pacific Mall have been raided multiple times by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], and in 2018 the mall was listed as a [[Notorious markets|notorious market]] by the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Pacific Mall===\nPacific Mall is built on the site formerly occupied by Cullen Country Barns, a farm-themed complex opened in 1983 that housed shops, a theatre, and restaurants.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=143}} The complex was established by Len Cullen, the founder of [[Cullen Gardens and Miniature Village]] in [[Whitby, Ontario]], and consisted of two barn wings with [[gambrel]] roofs and a concrete silo. None were historic structures dating back to the time when the site was a working farm, but they were acquired by Cullen and moved from [[Pickering, Ontario]] to Markham in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Len Cullen was visionary industry pioneer |url=https://horttrades.com/len-cullen |website=Landscape Ontario Horticultural Trades Association |accessdate=20 October 2019 |date=30 March 2016}}</ref> A fire damaged part of the complex in 1988,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Irish |first1=Paul |title=Frontal attack |url=https://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/fire-fighters-struggle-to-break-through-the-west-wall-of-news-photo/499290885?#/frontal-attack-fire-fighters-struggle-to-break-through-the-west-wall-picture-id499290885 |website=[[Getty Images]] |accessdate=20 October 2019 |date=18 October 1998}}</ref> and it was demolished in 1994; some portions of the former [[Market Village]], a shopping complex adjacent to Pacific Mall, mimicked the Cullen complex.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Low |first1=Jeff |title=Then and Now: Cullen Country Barns and Pacific Mall |url=https://urbantoronto.ca/news/2013/02/then-and-now-cullen-country-barns-and-pacific-mall |website=Urban Toronto |accessdate=21 October 2019 |date=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\n[[File:PacificHeritageTown.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to Heritage Town in Pacific Mall]]\n[[File:Egg waffle stand at Pacific Mall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[egg waffle]] stand at Pacific Mall]]\nPlanning for Pacific Mall began in the late 1980s amid the formation of Chinese immigrant communities in suburban [[Toronto]] and a flourishing of ethnic malls in Markham, [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]], and [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]].{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=14}}{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=112}} The mall was planned and constructed amid the so-called \"Hong Kong Tide\" of the 1980s and 1990s, which saw an increase in immigration to Canada by highly educated, skilled migrants from Hong Kong who were frequently wealthy entrepreneurs and investors.{{sfn|Chan|2013|p=113}} This immigration was influenced by a range of factors, notably the [[handover of Hong Kong]], and new Canadian [[Immigration to Canada|open-door immigration policies]] that recruited based on merit rather than national origin.<ref name=\"GM1\"/>{{sfn|Chan|2013|p=112}} The passage of the [[Investment Canada Act]], which sought to direct business migrants and foreign capital into Canada, is also noted as a factor.{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=113}} Of additional note is the implementation of the [[Canadian Immigrant Investor Program]] (CANIIP), which granted landed immigrant status to individuals with least [[CAD$]]500,000 in wealth who agreed to invest $250,000 in Canadian business ventures.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=137}} As a result of this immigration, Markham's ethnic Chinese population rose 15 percent in 1995, resulting in nearly 30 percent of Markham's population being of Chinese origin;{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=139}} by 1999, there would be a total of 58 Asian shopping malls in Markham, Richmond Hill, and Scarborough.<ref name=\"GM1\"/> \n\nA large-scale, indoor Asian mall to be built on the former site of Cullen Country Barns was formally proposed in 1993 by Torgan Group, an [[Israeli-Canadian]] development company,{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=143}}{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=118}} with the [[Fairchild Group]] as a partner.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ley |first1=David |title=Millionaire Migrants: Trans-Pacific Life Lines |date=2011 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=9781444399530}}</ref> The mall would operate as a [[Condominium|condominium corporation]], where shop units are owned by individuals who determine the store's inventory and business hours, and can sell the unit at will. The developers of Pacific Mall claimed they were the first mall in North America to use this business model,{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=115}} though Pacific Mall was preceded by the condominium mall Chinatown Centre in [[Chinatown, Toronto#West Chinatown|West Chinatown, Toronto]], which opened in 1989.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=138}}\n\nThe mall's construction was opposed by some long-term residents of Markham,{{sfn|Chan|2013|p=120}} and was delayed numerous times from 1993 to 1996.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=141}} Concerns were raised by [[Markham City Council]] over the impact the mall would have parking and traffic volume, the style of the building that would replace Cullen Country Barns, and challenges in dealing with multiple owners in a condo-style mall.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=143}}{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=118}} The Council commissioned an independent study on retail condominiums by John Winter and Associates, which concluded that retail condos are a positive means of diversifying developments.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=144}} Pacific Mall's application underwent a nine-month review,{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=145}} with a building permit granted in May 1995.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=144}}\n\nHistorian Erica Allen-Kim argues that Pacific Mall was \"a weathervane for Markham's ongoing transformation from a rural township to an [[ethnoburb]].\"{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=133}} Then-deputy mayor of Markham Carole Bell received criticism for her statement that \"everything's going Chinese\" in response to the proliferation of ethnic malls.<ref name=\"GM1\">{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=Jan |title=Not made in China |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/not-made-in-china/article746929/ |website=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=22 October 2019 |date=6 November 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Matt |title=Ethnic Relations I: The Evolution of Steeles and Kennedy |url=http://green.hyperdot.net/ethnic-relations-i-the-evolution-of-steeles-and-kennedy |website=Green Beam City |accessdate=22 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522023252/http://green.hyperdot.net/ethnic-relations-i-the-evolution-of-steeles-and-kennedy |archivedate=22 May 2010 |date=5 July 2010}}</ref> She attempted to implement by-laws that would have forbid the rezoning of industrial areas for retail condominiums and made English-language signs mandatory on all structures.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=133}} Then-mayor of Markham [[Don Cousens]] formed an advisory council of eleven Markham residents and three members of council to \"address associated multicultural issues affecting planning decisions.\"{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=144}}\n\n===Opening and continued operation===\n[[File:PacificHeritageTown2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Emperor's chair at Heritage Town in Pacific Mall]]\nSources report Pacific Mall as opening either in 1996<ref name=\"1996 Opening\"/> or 1997.<ref name=\"1997 Opening\"/> Its Cantonese name, \"\u592a\u53e4\u5ee3\u5834\" (Tai Gu Gwong Cheung), is derived from [[Pacific Place (Hong Kong)|Pacific Place]] in [[Hong Kong]].

For example, in the [[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]], the Buddha is depicted presenting a notion of the [http://www.buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=530 \"three knowledges\" (''tevijja'')]&nbsp;\u2013 a term also used in the Vedic tradition to describe knowledge of the [[Veda]]s&nbsp;\u2013 as being not texts, but things that he had experienced.<ref>{{Harv|Gombrich|1997|pp=29\u201330}}</ref> The true \"three knowledges\" are said to be constituted by the process of achieving enlightenment, which is what the Buddha is said to have achieved in the three watches of the night of his enlightenment.<ref>\"The brahmin by caste alone, the teacher of the ''Veda'', is (jokingly) etymologized as the 'non-meditator' (''ajh\u0101yaka'').

Gombrich in Paul Williams, ed., \"Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious studies.\" Taylor and Francis 2006, page 120.</ref>\n\n====Karma====\n[[Karma]] ([[Sanskrit]]: \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e from the root k\u1e5b, \"to do\") is a word meaning ''action'' or ''activity'' and often implies its subsequent '''results''' (also called karma-phala, \"the fruits of action\"). It is commonly understood as a term to denote the entire cycle of [[Causality|cause and effect]] as described in the philosophies of a number of cosmologies, including those of Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\nKarma is a central part of Buddhist teachings. In Buddha's teaching, karma is a direct intentional<ref>Kamma A Study Guide by Thanissaro Bhikkhu http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/kamma.html</ref> result of a person's word, thought and/or action in life. In Buddhism a person's words, thoughts and/or actions form the basis for good and bad karma: [[\u015a\u012bla|sila]] (moral conduct) goes hand in hand with the development of meditation and wisdom. Buddhist teachings carry a markedly different meaning from pre-Buddhist conceptions of karma.<ref>{{Harv|Gombrich|1997|p=37}}</ref>\n\n====Dharma====\n[[Dharma]] ([[Sanskrit]], [[Devanagari]]: \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e or [[P\u0101li]] '''Dhamma''', Devanagari: \u0927\u092e\u094d\u092e) means '''Natural Law''', '''Reality''' or '''Duty''', and with respect to its significance for [[spirituality]] and [[religion]] might be considered '''the Way of the Higher Truths'''. A Hindu appellation for [[Hinduism]] itself is ''[[San\u0101tana Dharma]]'', which translates as \"the eternal dharma.\" Similarly, [[Buddhadharma]] is an appellation for [[Buddhism]]. The general concept of dharma forms a basis for philosophies, beliefs and practices originating in [[India]]. The four main ones are [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] (Jaina Dharma), and [[Sikhism]] (Sikha Dharma), all of whom retain the centrality of dharma in their teachings. In these traditions, beings that live in harmony with dharma proceed more quickly toward, according to the tradition, [[Dharma Yukam]], [[Moksha]], or [[Nirvana]] (personal liberation). Dharma can refer generally to religious [[duty]], and also mean social order, right conduct, or simply virtue.\n\n====Buddha====\nThe term \"Buddha\" too has appeared in Hindu scriptures before the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]]. In the ''[[Vayu Purana]]'', [[Daksha|sage Daksha]] calls Lord Shiva as Buddha.<ref>\"''namah suddhaya buddhaya''\"; P. 67 ''Cultural History From The Vayu Purana'' By Devendrakumar Rajaram Patil, Rajaram D. K. Patil</ref>\n\n===Similar symbolism===\n* '''[[Mudra]]''': This is a symbolic hand-gesture expressing an emotion. Images of the Buddha almost always depict him performing some [[mudra]].\n* '''[[Dharma Chakra]]''': The [[Dharmacakra|Dharma Chakra]], which appears on the national flag of India and the flag of the Thai royal family, is a Buddhist symbol that is used by members of both religions.\n* '''[[Rudraksha]]''': These are [[prayer beads|beads]] that devotees, usually monks, use for praying.\n* '''[[Tilak]]''': Many Hindu devotees mark their heads with a [[tilak]], which is interpreted as a [[third eye]]. A similar mark is one of the characteristic [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].\n* '''[[Swastika]]''' and '''[[Sauwastika]]''': both are sacred symbols. It can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise and both are seen in Hinduism and Buddhism. The Buddha is sometimes depicted with a sauwastika on his chest or the palms of his hands.<ref>[http://img.search.com/0/0f/300px-Buddha_image_-_stone_-_with_disciple.jpg Buddha image] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321133243/http://img.search.com/0/0f/300px-Buddha_image_-_stone_-_with_disciple.jpg |date=March 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Similar practices===\n\n====Mantra====\n[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|250px|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of [[Buddhist devotion|devotion]].]]\nA '''[[mantra]]''' (\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930) is a [[religion|religious]] [[syllable]] or [[poem]], typically from the [[Sanskrit]] language. Their use varies according to the school and philosophy associated with the mantra. They are primarily used as [[spiritual conduit]]s, words or vibrations that instill one-pointed [[Attention|concentration]] in the devotee. Other purposes have included religious ceremonies to accumulate wealth, avoid danger, or eliminate enemies. Mantras existed in the [[historical Vedic religion]], [[Zoroastrianism]]<ref>http://tenets.parsizoroastrianism.com/IsthereanysenseinchantingAvestaprayers.pdf</ref> and the Shramanic traditions, and thus they remain important in Buddhism and [[Jainism]] as well as other faiths of Indian origin such as [[Sikhism]].\n\n====Yoga====\n{{further|Mindful yoga}}\n\nThe practice of [[Yoga]] is intimately connected to the religious beliefs and practices of both Hinduism and Buddhism.<ref>The Yoga Tradition: its literature, philosophy and practice By Georg Feuerstein. {{ISBN|81-208-1923-3}}. p. 111</ref> However, there are distinct variations in the usage of yoga terminology in the two religions.\n\nIn Hinduism, the term \"Yoga\" commonly refers to the eight limbs of yoga as defined in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], written some time after 100 BCE, and means \"yoke\", with the idea that one's individual [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|atman]], or soul, would yoke or bind with the monistic entity that underlies everything ([[brahman]]). Yoga in Hinduism also known as being 'complex', based on yoking (integrating). Yoga defines a specific process: it has an emphasis on knowledge and practice, as well as being known to be 'mature' and difficult.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stratton Hawley|first=John|title=Yoga and Viyoga: Simple Religion in Hinduism|journal=The Harvard Theological Review|date=January 1981|volume=74|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1017/s0017816000028492}}<!--|accessdate=September 22, 2012--></ref> The most basic meaning of this Sanskrit term is with technique.

In the early translation phase of the [[Sutrayana]] and [[Tantrayana]] from India, China and other regions to Tibet, along with the practice lineages of [[sadhana]], codified in the [[Nyingmapa]] canon, the most subtle 'conveyance' (Sanskrit: [[Yana (Buddhism)|yana]]) is [[Dzogchen|Adi Yoga]] (Sanskrit). A contemporary scholar with a focus on [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Robert Thurman]] writes that Patanjali was influenced by the success of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastic system to formulate his own matrix for the version of thought he considered orthodox.<ref>Robert Thurman, \"The Central Philosophy of Tibet.''

Many scholars have noted that the concepts of [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]] and [[sam\u0101dhi]] - technical terms describing stages of meditative absorption&nbsp;\u2013 are common to meditative practices in both Hinduism and Buddhism. Most notable in this context is the relationship between the system of four Buddhist ''dhyana'' states ([[Pali]]: [[Jhana in Theravada|''jhana'']]) and the ''samprajnata samadhi'' states of Classical Yoga.<ref>Samadhi: The Numinous and Cessative in Indo-Tibetan Yoga By Stuart Ray Sarbacker. {{ISBN|0-7914-6553-5}}. p. 77</ref> Also, many (Tibetan) Vajrayana practices of the [[generation stage]] and [[completion stage]] work with the [[chakras]], inner energy channels ([[nadi (yoga)|nadis]]) and [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]], called [[tummo]] in Tibetan.\n\n==Differences==\nDespite the similarities in terminology there exist differences between the two religions. There is no evidence to show that Buddhism ever subscribed to vedic sacrifices, vedic deities or caste.<ref>Y. Masih (2000) In : A Comparative Study of Religions, Motilal Banarsidass Publ : Delhi, {{ISBN|81-208-0815-0}} Page 18.</ref>\n\nThe major differences are mentioned below.\n\n===God===\n[[Gautama Buddha]] was very ambiguous about the existence of a Creator Deity ([[Brahman]]) and Eternal Self ([[\u0100tman (Buddhism)|Atman]]) and rejected them both. Various sources from the Pali Canon and others suggest that the Buddha taught that belief in a Creator deity was not essential to attaining liberation from suffering, and perhaps chose to ignore theological questions because they were \"fascinating to discuss,\" and frequently brought about more conflict and anger than peace.  The Buddha did not deny the existence of the  popular gods of the Vedic pantheon, but rather argued that these [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s, who may be in a more exalted state than humans, are still nevertheless trapped in the same samsaric cycle of suffering as other beings and are not necessarily worthy of veneration and worship. The focus of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], while inheriting many practices and ideologies from the previous Hindu yogic tradition, deviates from the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and earlier works of the [[Dharmic Religions]] in that liberation ([[Nirvana]] or [[Moksha]]) is not attained via unity with Brahman (the Godhead), Self-realization or worship. Rather, the Buddha's teaching centers around what [[Eknath Easwaran]] described as a \"psychology of desire,\" that is attaining liberation from suffering by extermination of self-will, selfish desire and passions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Easwaran |first=Eknath |authorlink=Eknath Easwaran |title=The Dhammapada: (Classics of Indian Spirituality) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8czJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA227 |year=2007 |publisher=Nilgiri Press |isbn=978-1-58638-020-5 |page=227}}</ref> This is not to say that such teachings are absent from the previous Hindu tradition, rather they are singled out and separated from Vedic Theology.\n\nAccording to [[Buddhology|Buddhologist]] [[Richard Hayes (professor)|Richard Hayes]], the early Buddhist [[Nikaya]] literature treats the question of the existence of a creator god \"primarily from either an epistemological point of view or a moral point of view\". In these texts the [[Buddha]] is portrayed not as a creator-denying atheist who claims to be able to prove such a God's nonexistence, but rather his focus is other teachers' claims that their teachings lead to the highest good.<ref>Hayes, Richard P., [http://www.unm.edu/~rhayes/atheism.pdf \"Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition\"], ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 5-6, 8</ref>\n\nCiting the ''Devadaha Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 101), Hayes states, \"while the reader is left to conclude that it is attachment rather than God, actions in past lives, fate, type of birth or efforts in this life that is responsible for our experiences of sorrow, no systematic argument is given in an attempt to disprove the existence of God.\"<ref>Hayes, Richard P., \"Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition\", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 9-10</ref>\n\nThe Buddha (as portrayed in the Pali scriptures, the [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|agamas]]) set an important trend in [[Nontheistic#Nontheism in Buddhism|nontheism in Buddhism]] by establishing a somewhat non-theistic view on the notion of an omnipotent God, generally ignoring the issue as being irrelevant to his teachings.<ref name=\"gunasekara\">{{cite web|title=The Buddhist Attitude to God |work=Statement made to a Multi-religious Seminar |author=Dr V.

Hinduism though proposes detachment from fruits of action<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/3/verse/19|title=Chapter 3, Verse 19 \u2013 Bhagavad Gita, The Song of God \u2013 Swami Mukundananda|last=Mukundananda|first=Swami|access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref> and stresses on performance of duty or ''dharma'', it is not solely focused on it. In Hinduism, Lord Shiva explains 'death' to be journey of the immortal soul in pursuit of 'Moksha' and therefore a fact of life.\n# While Buddhism says retirement into forest was open to everyone regardless of caste, and although according to the vinaya (the code of conduct for the Sangha) it is not possible to take ordination as a Buddhist mendicant (a Bhikkhu or Bhikkhuni) under the age of 20 or adulthood, this is still viewed as escapism by Hinduism. Pre-Buddhist, non-brahman forest mendicants are criticised in the earliest group of Upanishads. Hinduism allows for this to happen only after performing all ''dharmas'' or duties of one's life, starting from studying scriptures, working to support children and family and taking care of aged parents and lastly after all the dharma done retire to the forest and slowly meditate, fast and perform rituals and austerities (tapas), until physical disintegration & to reach the ultimate truth or ''Brahman''. Buddhism by contrast emphasises realisation by the middle way (avoiding extremes of luxury or austerities), seeing limited value in the rituals and tapas and the danger of their mis-application.\n# Buddhism explained that attachment is the cause of sorrow in society. Therefore, Buddhism's cure for sorrow was detachment and non-involvement (non-action or negative action). Hinduism on the other hand explained that both sorrow or happiness is due to 'Karma' or past actions and bad karma can be overcome and good karma can be obtained by following dharma or righteous duty (pro-action or positive action) which will ultimately provide 'Moksha' i.e. overcoming the cycle of life and joining ''Brahman''.\n\nBuddhist canonical views about God and the priests are:\n\n{{quote|13. Well then, Vasettha, those ancient sages versed in ancient scriptures, the authors of the verses, the utterers of the verses, whose, ancient form of words so chanted, uttered, or composed, the priests of today chant over again or repeat; intoning or reciting exactly as has been intoned or recited-to wit, Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu [11]&nbsp;\u2013 did even they speak thus, saying: \"We know it, we have seen it\", where the creator is whence the creator is?}}\n\nScholar-monk [[Walpola Rahula]] writes that man depends on God \"for his own protection, safety, and security, just as a child depends on his parent.\" He describes this as a product of \"ignorance, weakness, fear, and desire,\" and writes that this \"deeply and fanatically held belief\" for man's consolation is \"false and empty\" from the perspective of Buddhism. He writes that man does not wish to hear or understand teachings against this belief, and that the Buddha described his teachings as \"against the current\" for this reason.<ref>Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught,'' pp. 51\u201352.</ref> He also wrote that for self-protection man created God and for self-preservation man created \"soul\".<ref>''What the Buddha Taught,'' pp.&nbsp;51\u201352.</ref>\n\nIn later Mahayana literature, however, the idea of an eternal, all-pervading, all-knowing, immaculate, uncreated and deathless Ground of Being (the dharmadhatu, inherently linked to the sattvadhatu, the realm of beings), which is the Awakened Mind (bodhicitta) or Dharmakaya (\"body of Truth\") of the Buddha himself, is attributed to the Buddha in a number of Mahayana sutras, and is found in various tantras as well. In some Mahayana texts, such a principle is occasionally presented as manifesting in a more personalised form as a primordial buddha, such as Samantabhadra, Vajradhara, Vairochana, Amitabha and Adi-Buddha, among others.\n\n===Rites and rituals===\nIn later tradition such as [[Mahayana Buddhism]] in Japan, the [[Shingon]] Fire Ritual (Homa /Yagna) and Urabon (Sanskrit: Ullambana) derives from Hindu traditions.<ref>R.K. Payne: The Tantric Ritual of Japan. Feeding the Gods: the Shingon Fire Ritual., and Koenraad Elst: Who is a Hindu? 2001</ref> Similar rituals are common in Tibetan Buddhism. Both Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism share common rites, such as the purification rite of Homa (Havan, Yagna in Sanskrit), prayers for the ancestors and deceased (Ullambana in Sanskrit, Urabon in Japanese).\n\n===Caste===\nThe Buddha repudiated the caste distinctions of the Brahmanical religion,<ref name=\"ccbs.ntu.edu.tw\">K.N.

In ''Citta Sambhutta Jataka'', describes the ''chandalas'' to be the lowest race and the meanest of men, and their origins traced to karma. Buddha in Ambaitha Sutta of [[Dighanikaya|Dighanikdya]] III says, \"''khattiyo va setfha hino brahmano''\" (he ksatriya is superior, brahmana inferior ) by the purity of their blood. Buddhist scriptures recognised caste distinctions in the present life as the product of a man's past karmas and not an accident of birth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Cosmology and worldview===\n{{Main|Buddhist Cosmology}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist cosmology]], there are 31 planes of existence within samsara.<ref name=\"books.google.co.in\">Jacob N. Kinnard, ''The Emergence of Buddhism: Classical Traditions in Contemporary Perspective'',  Fortress [https://books.google.com/books?id=xIzyZ7Nvs7cC&pg=PA14&dq=buddhist+cosmology+31+realms&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gDMJUIvZCfGviQe84unrCQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=buddhist%20cosmology%2031%20realms&f=false], Page 14</ref> Beings in these realms are subject to rebirth after some period of time, except for realms of the Non-Returners. Therefore, most of these places are not the goal of the holy life in the Buddha's dispensation. Buddhas are beyond all these 31 planes of existence after parinibbana. Hindu texts mostly mentions the devas in Kamma Loka. Only the Hindu god Brahma can be found in the Rupa loka. There are many realms above Brahma realm that are accessible through meditation. Those in Brahma realm are also subject to rebirth according to the Buddha.\n\n===Practices===\n\nTo have an idea of the differences between Buddhism and pre-existing beliefs and practices during this time, we can look into the [[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]] in the [[Digha Nikaya]] of the [[Pali Canon]]. In this sutra, a king of Magadha listed the teachings from many prominent and famous spiritual teachers around during that time. He also asked the [[Buddha]] about his teaching when visiting him. The Buddha told the king about the practices of his spiritual path.  The list of various practices he taught disciples as well as practices he doesn't encourage are listed. The text, rather than stating what the new faith was, emphasized what the new faith was not.  Contemporaneous religious traditions were caricatured and then negated. Though critical of prevailing religious practices and social institutions on philosophical grounds, early Buddhist texts exhibit a reactionary anxiety at having to compete in religiously plural societies.

Could that be the path to Awakening?\" Then following on that memory came the realization: \"That is the path to Awakening.\"|<ref name=\"Nanamoli, Bhikkhu 1995\"/>}}\n\nAccording to the Upakkilesa Sutta, after figuring out the cause of the various obstacles and overcoming them, the Buddha was able to penetrate the sign and enters 1st- 4th Jhana.\n\n{{quote|I also saw both the light and the vision of forms. Shortly after the vision of light and shapes disappear. I thought, \"What is the cause and condition in which light and vision of the forms disappear?\u201d\n\nThen consider the following: \"The question arose in me and because of doubt my concentration fell, when my concentration fell, the light disappeared and the vision of forms. I act so that the question does not arise in me again.\u201d\n\nI remained diligent, ardent, perceived both the light and the vision of forms. Shortly after the vision of light and shapes disappear. I thought, \"What is the cause and condition in which light and vision of the forms disappear?\u201d\n\nThen consider the following: \u201cInattention arose in me because of inattention and my concentration has decreased, when my concentration fell, the light disappeared and the vision of forms. I must act in such a way that neither doubt nor disregard arise in me again.\u201d}}\n\nIn the same way as above, the Buddha encountered many more obstacles that caused the light to disappear  and found his way out of them. These include sloth and torpor, fear, elation, inertia, excessive energy, energy deficient, desire, perception of diversity, and excessive meditation on the ways. Finally, he was able to penetrate the light and entered jhana.\n\nThe following descriptions in the Upakkilesa Sutta further show how he find his way into the first four Jhanas, which he later considered [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|''samma samadhi'']].\n\n{{quote|When Anuruddha, I realized that doubt is an imperfection of the mind, I dropped out of doubt, an imperfection of the mind. When I realized that inattention ... sloth and torpor ... fear ... elation ... inertia ... excessive energy ... deficient energy ... desire ... perception of diversity ... excessive meditation on the ways, I abandoned excessive meditation on the ways, an imperfection of the mind.\n\nWhen Anuruddha, I realized that doubt is an imperfection of the mind, I dropped out of doubt, an imperfection of the mind.

The Buddha said in the Ariyapariyesana Sutta:\n\n{{quote|But the thought occurred to me, \"This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.\" So, dissatisfied with that Dhamma, I left.|<ref name=\"Nanamoli, Bhikkhu 1995\">Nanamoli, Bhikkhu (trans.)

This is sometimes called the \"ninth ''jh\u0101na''\" in commentarial and scholarly literature.<ref name=\"Steven Sutcliffe 2004, page 135\"/><ref>Chandima Wijebandara, ''Early Buddhism, Its Religious and Intellectual Milieu.'' Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies, University of Kelaniya, 1993, page 22.</ref>\nAlthough the \"Dimension of Nothingness\" and the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\" are included in the list of nine Jhanas taught by the Buddha, they are not included in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Noble Path number eight is \"Samma Samadhi\" (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered \"Right Concentration\". If he takes a disciple through all the Jhanas, the emphasis is on the \"Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions\" rather than stopping short at the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\".\n\nIn the Magga-vibhanga Sutta, the Buddha defines Right Concentration that belongs to the concentration (samadhi)  division of the path as the first four Jhanas:\n\n{{quote|And what is right concentration? There is the case where a monk&nbsp;\u2014 quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities&nbsp;\u2014 enters & remains in the first Jhana: rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the Second Jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation&nbsp;\u2014 internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the Third Jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure & pain&nbsp;\u2014 as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress&nbsp;\u2014 he enters & remains in the Fourth Jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called right concentration.|<ref name=\"Bodhi, Bhikkhu 2000\">Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya.

He then underwent harsh ascetic practices that he eventually also became disillusioned with. He subsequently remembered entering ''jh\u0101na'' as a child, and realized that, \"That indeed is the path to enlightenment.\"\n\nIn the ''suttas'', the immaterial attainments are never referred to as ''jh\u0101nas''. The immaterial attainments have more to do with expanding, while the Jhanas (1-4) focus on  concentration. A common translation for the term \"samadhi\" is concentration. Rhys Davids and Maurice Walshe agreed that the term \u201d samadhi\u201d is not found in any pre-buddhist text. Hindu texts later used that term to indicate the state of enlightenment. This is not  in conformity with Buddhist usage. In ''The Long Discourse of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha Nikaya'' (pg. 1700) Maurice Walshe wrote,\n\n{{quote|Rhys Davids also states that the term samadhi is not found in any pre-Buddhist text. To his remarks on the subject should be added that its subsequent use in Hindu texts to denote the state of enlightenment is not in conformity with Buddhist usage, where the basic meaning of concentration is expanded to cover \"meditation\" in general.|<ref name=\"Walshe, Maurice 1995\"/>}}\n\n[[Meditation]] was an aspect of the practice of the [[yogi]]s in the centuries preceding the Buddha.

According to the ''[[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]]'' this sort of vision arose for the Buddhist adept as a result of the perfection of 'meditation' (Sanskrit: [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]) coupled with the perfection of 'ethics' (Sanskrit: [[\u015b\u012bla]]). Some of the Buddha's meditative techniques were shared with other traditions of his day, but the idea that ethics are causally related to the attainment of \"religious insight\" (Sanskrit: [[Wisdom in Buddhism|praj\u00f1\u0101]]) was original.<ref name=\"westernbuddhistreview.com\">Dharmacarini Manishini, ''Western Buddhist Review.''

Buddhist identity has been broadly defined as one who \"[[Refuge (Buddhism)|takes Refuge]]\" in the [[Three Jewels]]: Buddha, Dharma, and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], echoing a formula seen in Buddhist texts. In some communities, formal conversion rituals are observed. No specific ethnicity has typically been associated with Buddhism, and as it spread beyond its origin in India immigrant monastics were replaced with newly ordained members of the local ethnic or tribal group.<ref>Hunter, W.

In the former paradigm, change and movement are an illusion; to realize the Self as the only reality is to realize something that has always been the case. In the Buddha's system by contrast, one has to make things happen.<ref>Richard Gombrich, ''How Buddhism began: the Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 58.</ref>\n\nThe fire metaphor used in the [[Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta]] (which is also used elsewhere) is a radical way of making the point that the liberated sage is beyond phenomenal experience. It also makes the additional point that this indefinable, transcendent state is the sage's state even during life. This idea goes against the early Brahminic notion of liberation at death.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 96.</ref>\n\nLiberation for the Brahminic yogin was thought to be the permanent realization at death of a [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|nondual meditative state]] anticipated in life. In fact, old Brahminic metaphors for the liberation at death of the yogic adept (\"becoming cool\", \"going out\") were given a new meaning by the Buddha; their point of reference became the sage who is liberated in life.<ref name=\"Alexander Wynne 2007, page 109\">Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, page 109.</ref> The Buddha taught that these meditative states alone do not offer a decisive and permanent end to suffering either during life or after death.<ref>Michael Carrithers, ''The Buddha,'' 1983, page 36. Found in ''Founders of Faith,'' Oxford University Press, 1986.</ref>\n\nHe stated that achieving a formless attainment with no further practice would only lead to temporary rebirth in a formless realm after death.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 21.</ref> Moreover, he gave a pragmatic refutation of early Brahminical theories according to which the meditator, the meditative state, and the proposed uncaused, unborn, unanalyzable Self, are identical.<ref name=\"Michael Carrithers 1983, pp. 41\u201342\">Michael Carrithers, ''The Buddha,'' 1983, pp. 41\u201342. Found in ''Founders of Faith,'' Oxford University Press, 1986.</ref> These theories are undergirded by the Upanishadic correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm, from which perspective it is not surprising that meditative states of consciousness were thought to be identical to the subtle strata of the cosmos.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 42.</ref> The Buddha, in contrast, argued that states of consciousness come about caused and conditioned by the yogi's training and techniques, and therefore no state of consciousness could be this eternal Self.<ref name=\"Michael Carrithers 1983, pp. 41\u201342\"/>\n\n====Nonduality====\nBoth the Buddha's conception of the liberated person and the goal of early Brahminic yoga can be characterized as nondual, but in different ways. The nondual goal in early [[Brahminism]] was conceived in [[ontology|ontological]] terms; the goal was that into which one merges after death. According to Wynne, liberation for the Buddha \"... is nondual in another, more radical, sense. This is made clear in the dialogue with Upasiva, where the liberated sage is defined as someone who has passed beyond conceptual dualities.

In that regard, the chapter on Brahmins in the Dhammapada may be regarded as being entirely in tune with the definition of a Brahmin in Chapter 18 of the Bhagavad Gita.

For example, in the [[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]], the Buddha is depicted presenting a notion of the [http://www.buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=530 \"three knowledges\" (''tevijja'')]&nbsp;\u2013 a term also used in the Vedic tradition to describe knowledge of the [[Veda]]s&nbsp;\u2013 as being not texts, but things that he had experienced.<ref>{{Harv|Gombrich|1997|pp=29\u201330}}</ref> The true \"three knowledges\" are said to be constituted by the process of achieving enlightenment, which is what the Buddha is said to have achieved in the three watches of the night of his enlightenment.<ref>\"The brahmin by caste alone, the teacher of the ''Veda'', is (jokingly) etymologized as the 'non-meditator' (''ajh\u0101yaka'').

Gombrich in Paul Williams, ed., \"Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious studies.\" Taylor and Francis 2006, page 120.</ref>\n\n====Karma====\n[[Karma]] ([[Sanskrit]]: \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e from the root k\u1e5b, \"to do\") is a word meaning ''action'' or ''activity'' and often implies its subsequent '''results''' (also called karma-phala, \"the fruits of action\"). It is commonly understood as a term to denote the entire cycle of [[Causality|cause and effect]] as described in the philosophies of a number of cosmologies, including those of Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\nKarma is a central part of Buddhist teachings. In Buddha's teaching, karma is a direct intentional<ref>Kamma A Study Guide by Thanissaro Bhikkhu http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/kamma.html</ref> result of a person's word, thought and/or action in life. In Buddhism a person's words, thoughts and/or actions form the basis for good and bad karma: [[\u015a\u012bla|sila]] (moral conduct) goes hand in hand with the development of meditation and wisdom. Buddhist teachings carry a markedly different meaning from pre-Buddhist conceptions of karma.<ref>{{Harv|Gombrich|1997|p=37}}</ref>\n\n====Dharma====\n[[Dharma]] ([[Sanskrit]], [[Devanagari]]: \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e or [[P\u0101li]] '''Dhamma''', Devanagari: \u0927\u092e\u094d\u092e) means '''Natural Law''', '''Reality''' or '''Duty''', and with respect to its significance for [[spirituality]] and [[religion]] might be considered '''the Way of the Higher Truths'''. A Hindu appellation for [[Hinduism]] itself is ''[[San\u0101tana Dharma]]'', which translates as \"the eternal dharma.\" Similarly, [[Buddhadharma]] is an appellation for [[Buddhism]]. The general concept of dharma forms a basis for philosophies, beliefs and practices originating in [[India]]. The four main ones are [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] (Jaina Dharma), and [[Sikhism]] (Sikha Dharma), all of whom retain the centrality of dharma in their teachings. In these traditions, beings that live in harmony with dharma proceed more quickly toward, according to the tradition, [[Dharma Yukam]], [[Moksha]], or [[Nirvana]] (personal liberation). Dharma can refer generally to religious [[duty]], and also mean social order, right conduct, or simply virtue.\n\n====Buddha====\nThe term \"Buddha\" too has appeared in Hindu scriptures before the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]]. In the ''[[Vayu Purana]]'', [[Daksha|sage Daksha]] calls Lord Shiva as Buddha.<ref>\"''namah suddhaya buddhaya''\"; P. 67 ''Cultural History From The Vayu Purana'' By Devendrakumar Rajaram Patil, Rajaram D. K. Patil</ref>\n\n===Similar symbolism===\n* '''[[Mudra]]''': This is a symbolic hand-gesture expressing an emotion. Images of the Buddha almost always depict him performing some [[mudra]].\n* '''[[Dharma Chakra]]''': The [[Dharmacakra|Dharma Chakra]], which appears on the national flag of India and the flag of the Thai royal family, is a Buddhist symbol that is used by members of both religions.\n* '''[[Rudraksha]]''': These are [[prayer beads|beads]] that devotees, usually monks, use for praying.\n* '''[[Tilak]]''': Many Hindu devotees mark their heads with a [[tilak]], which is interpreted as a [[third eye]]. A similar mark is one of the characteristic [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].\n* '''[[Swastika]]''' and '''[[Sauwastika]]''': both are sacred symbols. It can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise and both are seen in Hinduism and Buddhism. The Buddha is sometimes depicted with a sauwastika on his chest or the palms of his hands.<ref>[http://img.search.com/0/0f/300px-Buddha_image_-_stone_-_with_disciple.jpg Buddha image] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321133243/http://img.search.com/0/0f/300px-Buddha_image_-_stone_-_with_disciple.jpg |date=March 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Similar practices===\n\n====Mantra====\n[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|250px|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of [[Buddhist devotion|devotion]].]]\nA '''[[mantra]]''' (\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930) is a [[religion|religious]] [[syllable]] or [[poem]], typically from the [[Sanskrit]] language. Their use varies according to the school and philosophy associated with the mantra. They are primarily used as [[spiritual conduit]]s, words or vibrations that instill one-pointed [[Attention|concentration]] in the devotee. Other purposes have included religious ceremonies to accumulate wealth, avoid danger, or eliminate enemies. Mantras existed in the [[historical Vedic religion]], [[Zoroastrianism]]<ref>http://tenets.parsizoroastrianism.com/IsthereanysenseinchantingAvestaprayers.pdf</ref> and the Shramanic traditions, and thus they remain important in Buddhism and [[Jainism]] as well as other faiths of Indian origin such as [[Sikhism]].\n\n====Yoga====\n{{further|Mindful yoga}}\n\nThe practice of [[Yoga]] is intimately connected to the religious beliefs and practices of both Hinduism and Buddhism.<ref>The Yoga Tradition: its literature, philosophy and practice By Georg Feuerstein. {{ISBN|81-208-1923-3}}. p. 111</ref> However, there are distinct variations in the usage of yoga terminology in the two religions.\n\nIn Hinduism, the term \"Yoga\" commonly refers to the eight limbs of yoga as defined in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], written some time after 100 BCE, and means \"yoke\", with the idea that one's individual [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|atman]], or soul, would yoke or bind with the monistic entity that underlies everything ([[brahman]]). Yoga in Hinduism also known as being 'complex', based on yoking (integrating). Yoga defines a specific process: it has an emphasis on knowledge and practice, as well as being known to be 'mature' and difficult.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stratton Hawley|first=John|title=Yoga and Viyoga: Simple Religion in Hinduism|journal=The Harvard Theological Review|date=January 1981|volume=74|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1017/s0017816000028492}}<!--|accessdate=September 22, 2012--></ref> The most basic meaning of this Sanskrit term is with technique.

Many Hindus tend to pick and choose between the five forms of yoga because of the way they live their life and how they want to practice it in the form they are most connected to.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stratton Hawley|first=John|title=Yoga and Viyoga: Simple Religion in Hinduism|journal=The Harvard Theological Review|date=January 1981|volume=74|series=no. 1|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1017/s0017816000028492}}<!--|accessdate=September 22, 2012--></ref>\n\nIn the [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism of Tibet, however, the  term \"Yoga\" is simply used to refer to any type of spiritual practice; from the various types of tantra (like [[Kriyayoga]] or [[Charyayoga]]) to '[[Deity yoga]]' and '[[guru yoga]]'. In the early translation phase of the [[Sutrayana]] and [[Tantrayana]] from India, China and other regions to Tibet, along with the practice lineages of [[sadhana]], codified in the [[Nyingmapa]] canon, the most subtle 'conveyance' (Sanskrit: [[Yana (Buddhism)|yana]]) is [[Dzogchen|Adi Yoga]] (Sanskrit). A contemporary scholar with a focus on [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Robert Thurman]] writes that Patanjali was influenced by the success of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastic system to formulate his own matrix for the version of thought he considered orthodox.<ref>Robert Thurman, \"The Central Philosophy of Tibet.'' Princeton University Press, 1984, p. 34.</ref>\n\nThe yoga scholar [[Stephen Cope]] identifies the following similarities between [[Raja yoga]] and Buddhism.

Many scholars have noted that the concepts of [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]] and [[sam\u0101dhi]] - technical terms describing stages of meditative absorption&nbsp;\u2013 are common to meditative practices in both Hinduism and Buddhism. Most notable in this context is the relationship between the system of four Buddhist ''dhyana'' states ([[Pali]]: [[Jhana in Theravada|''jhana'']]) and the ''samprajnata samadhi'' states of Classical Yoga.<ref>Samadhi: The Numinous and Cessative in Indo-Tibetan Yoga By Stuart Ray Sarbacker. {{ISBN|0-7914-6553-5}}. p. 77</ref> Also, many (Tibetan) Vajrayana practices of the [[generation stage]] and [[completion stage]] work with the [[chakras]], inner energy channels ([[nadi (yoga)|nadis]]) and [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]], called [[tummo]] in Tibetan.\n\n==Differences==\nDespite the similarities in terminology there exist differences between the two religions. There is no evidence to show that Buddhism ever subscribed to vedic sacrifices, vedic deities or caste.<ref>Y. Masih (2000) In : A Comparative Study of Religions, Motilal Banarsidass Publ : Delhi, {{ISBN|81-208-0815-0}} Page 18.</ref>\n\nThe major differences are mentioned below.\n\n===God===\n[[Gautama Buddha]] was very ambiguous about the existence of a Creator Deity ([[Brahman]]) and Eternal Self ([[\u0100tman (Buddhism)|Atman]]) and rejected them both. Various sources from the Pali Canon and others suggest that the Buddha taught that belief in a Creator deity was not essential to attaining liberation from suffering, and perhaps chose to ignore theological questions because they were \"fascinating to discuss,\" and frequently brought about more conflict and anger than peace.  The Buddha did not deny the existence of the  popular gods of the Vedic pantheon, but rather argued that these [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s, who may be in a more exalted state than humans, are still nevertheless trapped in the same samsaric cycle of suffering as other beings and are not necessarily worthy of veneration and worship. The focus of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], while inheriting many practices and ideologies from the previous Hindu yogic tradition, deviates from the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and earlier works of the [[Dharmic Religions]] in that liberation ([[Nirvana]] or [[Moksha]]) is not attained via unity with Brahman (the Godhead), Self-realization or worship. Rather, the Buddha's teaching centers around what [[Eknath Easwaran]] described as a \"psychology of desire,\" that is attaining liberation from suffering by extermination of self-will, selfish desire and passions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Easwaran |first=Eknath |authorlink=Eknath Easwaran |title=The Dhammapada: (Classics of Indian Spirituality) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8czJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA227 |year=2007 |publisher=Nilgiri Press |isbn=978-1-58638-020-5 |page=227}}</ref> This is not to say that such teachings are absent from the previous Hindu tradition, rather they are singled out and separated from Vedic Theology.\n\nAccording to [[Buddhology|Buddhologist]] [[Richard Hayes (professor)|Richard Hayes]], the early Buddhist [[Nikaya]] literature treats the question of the existence of a creator god \"primarily from either an epistemological point of view or a moral point of view\". In these texts the [[Buddha]] is portrayed not as a creator-denying atheist who claims to be able to prove such a God's nonexistence, but rather his focus is other teachers' claims that their teachings lead to the highest good.<ref>Hayes, Richard P., [http://www.unm.edu/~rhayes/atheism.pdf \"Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition\"], ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 5-6, 8</ref>\n\nCiting the ''Devadaha Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 101), Hayes states, \"while the reader is left to conclude that it is attachment rather than God, actions in past lives, fate, type of birth or efforts in this life that is responsible for our experiences of sorrow, no systematic argument is given in an attempt to disprove the existence of God.\"<ref>Hayes, Richard P., \"Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition\", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 9-10</ref>\n\nThe Buddha (as portrayed in the Pali scriptures, the [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|agamas]]) set an important trend in [[Nontheistic#Nontheism in Buddhism|nontheism in Buddhism]] by establishing a somewhat non-theistic view on the notion of an omnipotent God, generally ignoring the issue as being irrelevant to his teachings.<ref name=\"gunasekara\">{{cite web|title=The Buddhist Attitude to God |work=Statement made to a Multi-religious Seminar |author=Dr V.

Hinduism though proposes detachment from fruits of action<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/3/verse/19|title=Chapter 3, Verse 19 \u2013 Bhagavad Gita, The Song of God \u2013 Swami Mukundananda|last=Mukundananda|first=Swami|access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref> and stresses on performance of duty or ''dharma'', it is not solely focused on it. In Hinduism, Lord Shiva explains 'death' to be journey of the immortal soul in pursuit of 'Moksha' and therefore a fact of life.\n# While Buddhism says retirement into forest was open to everyone regardless of caste, and although according to the vinaya (the code of conduct for the Sangha) it is not possible to take ordination as a Buddhist mendicant (a Bhikkhu or Bhikkhuni) under the age of 20 or adulthood, this is still viewed as escapism by Hinduism. Pre-Buddhist, non-brahman forest mendicants are criticised in the earliest group of Upanishads. Hinduism allows for this to happen only after performing all ''dharmas'' or duties of one's life, starting from studying scriptures, working to support children and family and taking care of aged parents and lastly after all the dharma done retire to the forest and slowly meditate, fast and perform rituals and austerities (tapas), until physical disintegration & to reach the ultimate truth or ''Brahman''. Buddhism by contrast emphasises realisation by the middle way (avoiding extremes of luxury or austerities), seeing limited value in the rituals and tapas and the danger of their mis-application.\n# Buddhism explained that attachment is the cause of sorrow in society. Therefore, Buddhism's cure for sorrow was detachment and non-involvement (non-action or negative action). Hinduism on the other hand explained that both sorrow or happiness is due to 'Karma' or past actions and bad karma can be overcome and good karma can be obtained by following dharma or righteous duty (pro-action or positive action) which will ultimately provide 'Moksha' i.e. overcoming the cycle of life and joining ''Brahman''.\n\nBuddhist canonical views about God and the priests are:\n\n{{quote|13. Well then, Vasettha, those ancient sages versed in ancient scriptures, the authors of the verses, the utterers of the verses, whose, ancient form of words so chanted, uttered, or composed, the priests of today chant over again or repeat; intoning or reciting exactly as has been intoned or recited-to wit, Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu [11]&nbsp;\u2013 did even they speak thus, saying: \"We know it, we have seen it\", where the creator is whence the creator is?}}\n\nScholar-monk [[Walpola Rahula]] writes that man depends on God \"for his own protection, safety, and security, just as a child depends on his parent.\" He describes this as a product of \"ignorance, weakness, fear, and desire,\" and writes that this \"deeply and fanatically held belief\" for man's consolation is \"false and empty\" from the perspective of Buddhism. He writes that man does not wish to hear or understand teachings against this belief, and that the Buddha described his teachings as \"against the current\" for this reason.<ref>Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught,'' pp. 51\u201352.</ref> He also wrote that for self-protection man created God and for self-preservation man created \"soul\".<ref>''What the Buddha Taught,'' pp.&nbsp;51\u201352.</ref>\n\nIn later Mahayana literature, however, the idea of an eternal, all-pervading, all-knowing, immaculate, uncreated and deathless Ground of Being (the dharmadhatu, inherently linked to the sattvadhatu, the realm of beings), which is the Awakened Mind (bodhicitta) or Dharmakaya (\"body of Truth\") of the Buddha himself, is attributed to the Buddha in a number of Mahayana sutras, and is found in various tantras as well. In some Mahayana texts, such a principle is occasionally presented as manifesting in a more personalised form as a primordial buddha, such as Samantabhadra, Vajradhara, Vairochana, Amitabha and Adi-Buddha, among others.\n\n===Rites and rituals===\nIn later tradition such as [[Mahayana Buddhism]] in Japan, the [[Shingon]] Fire Ritual (Homa /Yagna) and Urabon (Sanskrit: Ullambana) derives from Hindu traditions.<ref>R.K. Payne: The Tantric Ritual of Japan. Feeding the Gods: the Shingon Fire Ritual., and Koenraad Elst: Who is a Hindu? 2001</ref> Similar rituals are common in Tibetan Buddhism. Both Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism share common rites, such as the purification rite of Homa (Havan, Yagna in Sanskrit), prayers for the ancestors and deceased (Ullambana in Sanskrit, Urabon in Japanese).\n\n===Caste===\nThe Buddha repudiated the caste distinctions of the Brahmanical religion,<ref name=\"ccbs.ntu.edu.tw\">K.N.

They will even get into trouble from their own deeds, whatever their caste (Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa, and Sudda) might be.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Long Discourses of the Buddha|first = Maurice|last = Walshe|page = 216|publisher = Wisdom Publications Inc|year = 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe superiority of Brahmanas were pretty clearly laid out in Buddhist scripture. In Madhura Sutta of the [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhimanikdya]] (II 4.4) and in the Assalayana Sutta of [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima]] (II 5.3), the brahamanas claim to be of superior caste (\"''brdhmano seftho venno\"'') and the rest are of inferior caste (\"''hino anno vanno\"''), the brahmanas claim to have fair complexion (\"''sukko vanno\"''), while others are dark (\"''kanho''\"); the brahamanas are pure (\"''sujjhanti\"''), while non-brahamarws are not.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Krishan|first=Y.|date=1998|title=Buddhism and Caste System|journal=East and West|volume=48|issue=1/2|pages=41\u201355|issn=0012-8376|jstor=29757366}}</ref> Occupational mobility across caste divisions was frowned upon as indicated in Osukdri Sutta of the [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima]] (II 5.6).<ref name=\":0\" /> In [[Jataka tales|Jataka]] like ''Setdketu Jataka, Matanga Jataka, Citta Sambhutta Jataka,'' there is evidence that the touch or sight of the pancamas was believed to cause pollution.\n\nThe Buddha himself didn't repudiate or condemn the caste system. In ''Citta Sambhutta Jataka'', describes the ''chandalas'' to be the lowest race and the meanest of men, and their origins traced to karma. Buddha in Ambaitha Sutta of [[Dighanikaya|Dighanikdya]] III says, \"''khattiyo va setfha hino brahmano''\" (he ksatriya is superior, brahmana inferior ) by the purity of their blood. Buddhist scriptures recognised caste distinctions in the present life as the product of a man's past karmas and not an accident of birth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Cosmology and worldview===\n{{Main|Buddhist Cosmology}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist cosmology]], there are 31 planes of existence within samsara.<ref name=\"books.google.co.in\">Jacob N. Kinnard, ''The Emergence of Buddhism: Classical Traditions in Contemporary Perspective'',  Fortress [https://books.google.com/books?id=xIzyZ7Nvs7cC&pg=PA14&dq=buddhist+cosmology+31+realms&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gDMJUIvZCfGviQe84unrCQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=buddhist%20cosmology%2031%20realms&f=false], Page 14</ref> Beings in these realms are subject to rebirth after some period of time, except for realms of the Non-Returners. Therefore, most of these places are not the goal of the holy life in the Buddha's dispensation. Buddhas are beyond all these 31 planes of existence after parinibbana. Hindu texts mostly mentions the devas in Kamma Loka. Only the Hindu god Brahma can be found in the Rupa loka. There are many realms above Brahma realm that are accessible through meditation. Those in Brahma realm are also subject to rebirth according to the Buddha.\n\n===Practices===\n\nTo have an idea of the differences between Buddhism and pre-existing beliefs and practices during this time, we can look into the [[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]] in the [[Digha Nikaya]] of the [[Pali Canon]]. In this sutra, a king of Magadha listed the teachings from many prominent and famous spiritual teachers around during that time. He also asked the [[Buddha]] about his teaching when visiting him. The Buddha told the king about the practices of his spiritual path.  The list of various practices he taught disciples as well as practices he doesn't encourage are listed. The text, rather than stating what the new faith was, emphasized what the new faith was not.  Contemporaneous religious traditions were caricatured and then negated. Though critical of prevailing religious practices and social institutions on philosophical grounds, early Buddhist texts exhibit a reactionary anxiety at having to compete in religiously plural societies. Below are a few examples found in the sutra:\n\n{{quote|Whereas some priests and contemplatives... are addicted to high and luxurious furnishings such as these&nbsp;\u2014 over-sized couches, couches adorned with carved animals, long-haired coverlets, multi-colored patchwork coverlets, white woolen coverlets, woolen coverlets embroidered with flowers or animal figures, stuffed quilts, coverlets with fringe, silk coverlets embroidered with gems;

Could that be the path to Awakening?\" Then following on that memory came the realization: \"That is the path to Awakening.\"|<ref name=\"Nanamoli, Bhikkhu 1995\"/>}}\n\nAccording to the Upakkilesa Sutta, after figuring out the cause of the various obstacles and overcoming them, the Buddha was able to penetrate the sign and enters 1st- 4th Jhana.\n\n{{quote|I also saw both the light and the vision of forms. Shortly after the vision of light and shapes disappear. I thought, \"What is the cause and condition in which light and vision of the forms disappear?\u201d\n\nThen consider the following: \"The question arose in me and because of doubt my concentration fell, when my concentration fell, the light disappeared and the vision of forms. I act so that the question does not arise in me again.\u201d\n\nI remained diligent, ardent, perceived both the light and the vision of forms. Shortly after the vision of light and shapes disappear. I thought, \"What is the cause and condition in which light and vision of the forms disappear?\u201d\n\nThen consider the following: \u201cInattention arose in me because of inattention and my concentration has decreased, when my concentration fell, the light disappeared and the vision of forms. I must act in such a way that neither doubt nor disregard arise in me again.\u201d}}\n\nIn the same way as above, the Buddha encountered many more obstacles that caused the light to disappear  and found his way out of them. These include sloth and torpor, fear, elation, inertia, excessive energy, energy deficient, desire, perception of diversity, and excessive meditation on the ways. Finally, he was able to penetrate the light and entered jhana.\n\nThe following descriptions in the Upakkilesa Sutta further show how he find his way into the first four Jhanas, which he later considered [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|''samma samadhi'']].\n\n{{quote|When Anuruddha, I realized that doubt is an imperfection of the mind, I dropped out of doubt, an imperfection of the mind. When I realized that inattention ... sloth and torpor ... fear ... elation ... inertia ... excessive energy ... deficient energy ... desire ... perception of diversity ... excessive meditation on the ways, I abandoned excessive meditation on the ways, an imperfection of the mind.\n\nWhen Anuruddha, I realized that doubt is an imperfection of the mind, I dropped out of doubt, an imperfection of the mind.

The Buddha said in the Ariyapariyesana Sutta:\n\n{{quote|But the thought occurred to me, \"This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.\" So, dissatisfied with that Dhamma, I left.|<ref name=\"Nanamoli, Bhikkhu 1995\">Nanamoli, Bhikkhu (trans.)

This is sometimes called the \"ninth ''jh\u0101na''\" in commentarial and scholarly literature.<ref name=\"Steven Sutcliffe 2004, page 135\"/><ref>Chandima Wijebandara, ''Early Buddhism, Its Religious and Intellectual Milieu.'' Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies, University of Kelaniya, 1993, page 22.</ref>\nAlthough the \"Dimension of Nothingness\" and the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\" are included in the list of nine Jhanas taught by the Buddha, they are not included in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Noble Path number eight is \"Samma Samadhi\" (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered \"Right Concentration\". If he takes a disciple through all the Jhanas, the emphasis is on the \"Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions\" rather than stopping short at the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\".\n\nIn the Magga-vibhanga Sutta, the Buddha defines Right Concentration that belongs to the concentration (samadhi)  division of the path as the first four Jhanas:\n\n{{quote|And what is right concentration? There is the case where a monk&nbsp;\u2014 quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities&nbsp;\u2014 enters & remains in the first Jhana: rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the Second Jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation&nbsp;\u2014 internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the Third Jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure & pain&nbsp;\u2014 as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress&nbsp;\u2014 he enters & remains in the Fourth Jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called right concentration.|<ref name=\"Bodhi, Bhikkhu 2000\">Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya.

He then underwent harsh ascetic practices that he eventually also became disillusioned with. He subsequently remembered entering ''jh\u0101na'' as a child, and realized that, \"That indeed is the path to enlightenment.\"\n\nIn the ''suttas'', the immaterial attainments are never referred to as ''jh\u0101nas''. The immaterial attainments have more to do with expanding, while the Jhanas (1-4) focus on  concentration. A common translation for the term \"samadhi\" is concentration. Rhys Davids and Maurice Walshe agreed that the term \u201d samadhi\u201d is not found in any pre-buddhist text. Hindu texts later used that term to indicate the state of enlightenment. This is not  in conformity with Buddhist usage. In ''The Long Discourse of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha Nikaya'' (pg. 1700) Maurice Walshe wrote,\n\n{{quote|Rhys Davids also states that the term samadhi is not found in any pre-Buddhist text.

According to the ''[[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]]'' this sort of vision arose for the Buddhist adept as a result of the perfection of 'meditation' (Sanskrit: [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]) coupled with the perfection of 'ethics' (Sanskrit: [[\u015b\u012bla]]). Some of the Buddha's meditative techniques were shared with other traditions of his day, but the idea that ethics are causally related to the attainment of \"religious insight\" (Sanskrit: [[Wisdom in Buddhism|praj\u00f1\u0101]]) was original.<ref name=\"westernbuddhistreview.com\">Dharmacarini Manishini, ''Western Buddhist Review.''

Buddhist identity has been broadly defined as one who \"[[Refuge (Buddhism)|takes Refuge]]\" in the [[Three Jewels]]: Buddha, Dharma, and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], echoing a formula seen in Buddhist texts. In some communities, formal conversion rituals are observed. No specific ethnicity has typically been associated with Buddhism, and as it spread beyond its origin in India immigrant monastics were replaced with newly ordained members of the local ethnic or tribal group.<ref>Hunter, W.

P. 149. {{ISBN|0-415-24495-1}}.</ref>\n\n===Soteriology===\nUpanishadic soteriology is focused on the static Self, while the Buddha's is focused on dynamic agency. In the former paradigm, change and movement are an illusion; to realize the Self as the only reality is to realize something that has always been the case. In the Buddha's system by contrast, one has to make things happen.<ref>Richard Gombrich, ''How Buddhism began: the Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 58.</ref>\n\nThe fire metaphor used in the [[Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta]] (which is also used elsewhere) is a radical way of making the point that the liberated sage is beyond phenomenal experience. It also makes the additional point that this indefinable, transcendent state is the sage's state even during life. This idea goes against the early Brahminic notion of liberation at death.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 96.</ref>\n\nLiberation for the Brahminic yogin was thought to be the permanent realization at death of a [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|nondual meditative state]] anticipated in life. In fact, old Brahminic metaphors for the liberation at death of the yogic adept (\"becoming cool\", \"going out\") were given a new meaning by the Buddha; their point of reference became the sage who is liberated in life.<ref name=\"Alexander Wynne 2007, page 109\">Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.''

Found in ''Founders of Faith,'' Oxford University Press, 1986.</ref> These theories are undergirded by the Upanishadic correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm, from which perspective it is not surprising that meditative states of consciousness were thought to be identical to the subtle strata of the cosmos.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 42.</ref> The Buddha, in contrast, argued that states of consciousness come about caused and conditioned by the yogi's training and techniques, and therefore no state of consciousness could be this eternal Self.<ref name=\"Michael Carrithers 1983, pp. 41\u201342\"/>\n\n====Nonduality====\nBoth the Buddha's conception of the liberated person and the goal of early Brahminic yoga can be characterized as nondual, but in different ways. The nondual goal in early [[Brahminism]] was conceived in [[ontology|ontological]] terms; the goal was that into which one merges after death. According to Wynne, liberation for the Buddha \"... is nondual in another, more radical, sense. This is made clear in the dialogue with Upasiva, where the liberated sage is defined as someone who has passed beyond conceptual dualities. Concepts that might have some meaning in ordinary discourse, such as consciousness or the lack of it, existence and non-existence, etc., do not apply to the sage. For the Buddha, propositions are not applicable to the liberated person, because language and concepts ([[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 1076: ''vaadapathaa'', ''dhammaa''), as well as any sort of intellectual reckoning (''sankhaa'') do not apply to the liberated sage.<ref>Alexander Wynne 2007, page 109</ref>\n\n====Nirvana====\n''[[Nirvana]]'' (or Nibbana in Pali language) means literally 'blowing out' or 'quenching'. The term is  pre-Buddhist, but its etymology is not essentially conclusive for finding out its exact meaning as the highest goal of early Buddhism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HP9O6OM4iOgC&pg=PA9&dq=its+etymology+is+not+necessarily+conclusive+for+determining+its+exact+meaning&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwieiuO9yMrWAhWBLI8KHV4PAM8Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=its%20etymology%20is%20not%20necessarily%20conclusive%20for%20determining%20its%20exact%20meaning&f=false Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy], Edward Craig, 1.

He further argued that a cognizer beyond cognition could be easily demonstrated from the diversity in self existence of the witness and the notion.<ref>Darling, Gregory Joseph.

Possibly the most famous Upanishadic dictum is ''[[tat tvam asi]]'', \"thou art that.\" Transposed into first person, the [[Pali]] version is ''eso \u2018ham asmi'', \"I am this.\" This is said in several suttas to be false. The full statement declared to be incorrect is \"This is mine, I am this, this is my self/essence.\" This is often rejected as a wrong view.<ref>Richard Francis Gombrich, How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, page 38.</ref> The Alagaduppama Sutta rejects this and other obvious echoes of surviving Upanishadic statements as well (these are not mentioned as such in the commentaries, and seem not to have been noticed until modern times). Moreover, the passage denies that one\u2019s self is the same as the world and that one will become the world self at death.<ref name=\"Richard Francis Gombrich 1996, page 39\">Richard Francis Gombrich, How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 39.</ref> The Buddha tells the monks that people worry about something that is non-existent externally ([https://notesfrommylibrary.com/2011/04/15/denial-of-the-atman-%E2%80%93-the-alagaddupama-sutta/ ''bahiddhaa asati'')] and non-existent internally (''ajjhattam asati''); he is referring respectively to the soul/essence of the world and of the individual.<ref name=\"Richard Francis Gombrich 1996, page 39\"/> A similar rejection of \"internal\" Self and \"external\" Self occurs at AN II 212. Both are referring to the Upanishads.<ref name=\"Richard Francis Gombrich 1996, page 39\"/> The most basic presupposition of early Brahminic cosmology is the identification of man and the cosmos (instances of this occur at [[Taittiriya Upanishad|TU]] II.1 and [[Mahabharata|Mbh]] XII.195), and liberation for the yogin was thought to only occur at death, with the adept's union with brahman (as at Mbh XII.192.22).<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, pp. 50, 96.</ref> The Buddha's rejection of these theories is therefore one instance of the Buddha's attack on the whole enterprise of Upanishadic ontology.<ref>Richard Francis Gombrich, ''How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 40.</ref><ref>See also Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 116.</ref>\n\n===Brahmin===\nThe Buddha redefined the word \"brahmin\" so as to become a synonym for arahant, replacing a distinction based on birth with one based on spiritual attainment.<ref>Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Handful of Leaves'' Vol 1, 2nd edition, page 391.</ref><ref>See for example Dhp XXVI, ''Brahmanavagga'', or [[Majjhima Nikaya]] 3.24, or especially MN 98 for three of many examples.</ref> The early Buddhist scriptures furthermore defined purity as determined by one's state of mind, and refer to anyone who behaves unethically, of whatever caste, as \"rotting within\", or \"a rubbish heap of impurity\".<ref>Sue Hamilton, ''Early Buddhism: A New Approach: The I of the Beholder.'' Routledge 2000, pp. 47, 49.</ref>\n\nThe Buddha explains his use of the word ''brahmin'' in many places. At [[Sutta Nipata]] 1.7 ''Vasala Sutta'', verse 12, he states: \"Not by birth is one an outcast; not by birth is one a brahmin. By deed one becomes an outcast, by deed one becomes a brahmin.\"<ref>Translated by Piyadassi Thera: [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.1.07.piya.html].</ref> An entire chapter of the [[Dhammapada]] is devoted to showing how a true Brahmin in the Buddha's use of the word is one who is of totally pure mind, namely, an [[arahant]].<ref>Dhammapada XXVI, translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu: [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.26.than.html].</ref>  However, it is very noteworthy that the Bhagavad Gita also defines Brahmin, and other varnas, as qualities and resulting from actions, and does not mention birth as a factor in determining these. In that regard, the chapter on Brahmins in the Dhammapada may be regarded as being entirely in tune with the definition of a Brahmin in Chapter 18 of the Bhagavad Gita. Both say that a Brahmin is a person having certain qualities.\n\nA defining of feature of the Buddha's teachings is self-sufficiency, so much so as to render the Brahminical priesthood entirely redundant.<ref>Sue Hamilton, ''Early Buddhism: A New Approach: The I of the Beholder.'' Routledge 2000, p. 49.</ref>\n\n==Buddha in Hindu scriptures==\n{{Main|Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu}}\n[[File:Avatars.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Hinduism regards Buddha (bottom right) as one of the 10 avatars of Vishnu.]]\nIn one [[Puranas|Purana]], the Buddha is described as an [[incarnation]] of [[Vishnu]] who incarnated in order to delude [[demon]]s away from the [[Vedic Dharma|Vedic dharma]]. The [[Bhavishya Purana]] posits:\n\n{{quote|At this time, reminded of the Kali Age, the god Vishnu became born as Gautama, the [[Shakyamuni]], and taught the Buddhist dharma for ten years.

After attaining enlightenment on Earth, there is to be no more rebirth for the Buddha. Before leaving the Tushita realm to take birth on earth, he designated [[Maitreya]] to take his place there. Maitreya will come to earth as the next Buddha, instead of him coming back again.\n[[Krishna]] was a past life of [[Sariputra]], a chief disciple of the Buddha.<ref>[http://www.mahapurisa.org/ghata-jataka-no-454/ GHATA-J\u0100TAKA (NO. 454) ]</ref> He has not attained enlightenment during that life as Krishna. Therefore, he came back to be reborn during the life of the Buddha and reached the first stage of Enlightenment after encountering an enlightened disciple of the Buddha. He reached full Arahantship or full Awakening/Enlightenment after becoming ordained in the Buddha's sangha.\n\n==Notable views==\n\n===Neo-Vedanta===\n[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] has claimed that the Buddha did not look upon himself as an innovator, but only a restorer of the way of the [[Upanishads]],<ref>Radhakrishnan: Indian Philosophy, vol.2, p. 469.</ref> despite the fact that the Buddha did not accept the Upanishads, viewing them as comprising a pretentious tradition, foreign to his paradigm.<ref>Carrithers, p. 38.</ref>\n\n[[Vivekananda]] wrote in glowing terms about Buddha, and visited [[Bodh Gaya]] several times.<ref>Sister Nivedita: The Master as I Saw Him. Koenraad Elst 2001: Who is a Hindu</ref>\n\nSteven Collins sees such Hindu claims regarding Buddhism as part of an effort&nbsp;\u2013 itself a reaction to Christian proselytizing efforts in India&nbsp;\u2013 to show that \"all religions are one\", and that Hinduism is uniquely valuable because it alone recognizes this fact.<ref>Steven Collins, ''Selfless Persons.'' Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 9.</ref>\n\n===Reformation===\nSome scholars have written that Buddhism should be regarded as \"reformed Brahmanism\",<ref>Christian Lindtner: \"From Brahmanism to Buddhism\", Asian Philosophy, 1999, John Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon): Shakti and Shakta, Koenraad Elst: Who is a Hindu (2001).</ref> and many Hindus consider Buddhism a sect of Hinduism.{{Citation needed|reason=need to find sources yet|date=June 2009}}\n\n===Dalit-movement===\n[[B. R. Ambedkar]], the founder of the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]], declared that Buddhism offered an opportunity for low-caste and [[dalit|untouchable]] Hindus to achieve greater respect and dignity because of its non-caste doctrines.  Among the 22 vows he prescribed to his followers is an injunction against having faith in [[Brahma]], Vishnu and [[Shiva|Mahesh]].
