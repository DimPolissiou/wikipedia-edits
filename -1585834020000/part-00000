The three new sub-atlases being; the Brain Atlas, the Blood Atlas and the Metabolic Atlas. The Human Protein Atlas program has already contributed to several thousands of publications in the field of human biology and disease and was selected by the organization [[ELIXIR]] as a European core resource due to its fundamental importance for a wider life science community. The HPA consortium is funded by the [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]].\n\n==Six projects==\nThe Human Protein Atlas consists of six sub-atlases:\n\nThe Tissue Atlas: contains information regarding the expression profiles of human genes both on the mRNA and protein level. The protein expression data is derived from antibody-based protein profiling using [[immunohistochemistry]]. Altogether 76 different cell types, corresponding to 44 normal human tissue types, have been analyzed and the data is presented as pathology-based annotation of protein expression levels. All underlying images of [[immunohistochemistry]] stained normal tissues are available as high-resolution images in the normal tissue atlas.\n\nThe Cell Atlas provides high-resolution insights into the spatial distribution of proteins within cells. The protein expression data is derived from antibody-based profiling using [[immunofluorescence]] [[confocal microscopy]]. A panel of 64 cell lines, selected to represent various cell populations in different organs of the human body, forms the basis of the Cell Atlas. In this cell line panel the mRNA expression of all human genes have been characterized using deep RNA-sequencing. The subcellular distribution of proteins is investigated in a subset of the cell lines, and classified into 32 different organelles and fine cellular structures.\n\nThe Pathology Atlas is based on the analysis of 17 main cancer types using data from 8,000 patients. In addition, a new concept for showing patient survival data is introduced, called Interactive Survival Scatter plots, and the atlas includes more than 400,000 such plots. A national supercomputer center was used to analyze more than 2.5 petabytes of underlying publicly available data from the [[The Cancer Genome Atlas|Cancer Genome Atlas]] (TCGA) to generate more than 900,000 [[Kaplan\u2013Meier estimator|survival plots]] describing the consequence of RNA and protein levels on clinical survival. The Pathology Atlas also contains 5 million [[pathology]]-based images generated by the Human Protein Atlas consortium.\n\nThe Brain Atlas explores the protein expression in the mammalian brain by visualization and integration of data from three mammalian species (human, pig and mouse). [[Transcriptomics technologies|Transcriptomics]] data combined with affinity-based protein in situ localization down to single cell detail is here available in a brain-centric sub atlas of the Human Protein Atlas. The data focuses on human genes and one-to-one orthologues in pig and mouse. Each gene is provided with a summary page, showing available expression data (mRNA) for summarized regions of the brain as well as protein location for selected targets. High resolution staining images as well as expression data for the individual sub regions are all available for exploring the brain, the most complex organ.\n\nThe Blood Atlas contains single cell type information on genome-wide RNA expression profiles of human protein-coding genes covering various [[B_cell|B-]] and [[T_cell|T-cells]], monocytes, granulocytes and dendritic cells. The single cell transcriptomics analysis covers 18 cell types isolated with cell sorting followed by RNA-seq analysis. In addition, an analysis of the \u201chuman secretome\u201d is presented including annotation of the genes predicted to be actively secreted to human blood, as well as the annotation of proteins predicted to be secreted to other parts of the human body, such as the gastric tract and local compartments. An analysis of the proteins detected in human blood is also presented with an estimation of the respective protein concentrations determined either with mass spectrometry-based proteomics or antibody-based immune assays.\n\nThe Metabolic Atlas portion of the Tissue Atlas enables exploration of protein function and tissue-specific gene expression in the context of the human metabolic network. For proteins involved in metabolism, a metabolic summary is provided that describes the metabolic subsystems/pathways, cellular compartments, and number of reactions associated with the protein. Over 120 manually curated metabolic pathway maps facilitate the visualization of each protein's participation in different metabolic processes. Each pathway map is accompanied by a heatmap detailing the mRNA levels across 37 different tissue types for all proteins involved in the metabolic pathway.\n\n==History==\nThe Human Protein Atlas program was started in 2003 and funded by the non-profit organization [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]] (KAW). The main site of the project is the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] (KTH), School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health (Stockholm, Sweden). Professor [[Mathias Uhl\u00e9n]] is the director of the program.\n\nThe research underpinning the start of the exploration of the whole human proteome in the Human Protein Atlas program was carried out in the late 1990s and early 2000s. A pilot study employing an affinity proteomics strategy using affinity-purified antibodies raised against recombinant human protein fragments was carried out for a chromosome-wide protein profiling of chromosome 21.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Agaton C, Galli J, H\u00f6id\u00e9n Guthenberg I, Janzon L, Hansson M, Asplund A, Brundell E, Lindberg S, Ruthberg I, Wester K, Wurtz D, H\u00f6\u00f6g

The Human Protein Atlas program has already contributed to several thousands of publications in the field of human biology and disease and was selected by the organization [[ELIXIR]] as a European core resource due to its fundamental importance for a wider life science community. The HPA consortium is funded by the [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]].\n\n==Six projects==\nThe Human Protein Atlas consists of six sub-atlases:\n\nThe Tissue Atlas: contains information regarding the expression profiles of human genes both on the mRNA and protein level. The protein expression data is derived from antibody-based protein profiling using [[immunohistochemistry]]. Altogether 76 different cell types, corresponding to 44 normal human tissue types, have been analyzed and the data is presented as pathology-based annotation of protein expression levels. All underlying images of [[immunohistochemistry]] stained normal tissues are available as high-resolution images in the normal tissue atlas.\n\nThe Cell Atlas provides high-resolution insights into the spatial distribution of proteins within cells. The protein expression data is derived from antibody-based profiling using [[immunofluorescence]] [[confocal microscopy]]. A panel of 64 cell lines, selected to represent various cell populations in different organs of the human body, forms the basis of the Cell Atlas. In this cell line panel the mRNA expression of all human genes have been characterized using deep RNA-sequencing. The subcellular distribution of proteins is investigated in a subset of the cell lines, and classified into 32 different organelles and fine cellular structures.\n\nThe Pathology Atlas is based on the analysis of 17 main cancer types using data from 8,000 patients. In addition, a new concept for showing patient survival data is introduced, called Interactive Survival Scatter plots, and the atlas includes more than 400,000 such plots. A national supercomputer center was used to analyze more than 2.5 petabytes of underlying publicly available data from the [[The Cancer Genome Atlas|Cancer Genome Atlas]] (TCGA) to generate more than 900,000 [[Kaplan\u2013Meier estimator|survival plots]] describing the consequence of RNA and protein levels on clinical survival. The Pathology Atlas also contains 5 million [[pathology]]-based images generated by the Human Protein Atlas consortium.\n\nThe Brain Atlas explores the protein expression in the mammalian brain by visualization and integration of data from three mammalian species (human, pig and mouse). [[Transcriptomics technologies|Transcriptomics]] data combined with affinity-based protein in situ localization down to single cell detail is here available in a brain-centric sub atlas of the Human Protein Atlas. The data focuses on human genes and one-to-one orthologues in pig and mouse. Each gene is provided with a summary page, showing available expression data (mRNA) for summarized regions of the brain as well as protein location for selected targets. High resolution staining images as well as expression data for the individual sub regions are all available for exploring the brain, the most complex organ.\n\nThe Blood Atlas contains single cell type information on genome-wide RNA expression profiles of human protein-coding genes covering various [[B_cell|B-]] and [[T_cell|T-cells]], monocytes, granulocytes and dendritic cells. The single cell transcriptomics analysis covers 18 cell types isolated with cell sorting followed by RNA-seq analysis. In addition, an analysis of the \u201chuman secretome\u201d is presented including annotation of the genes predicted to be actively secreted to human blood, as well as the annotation of proteins predicted to be secreted to other parts of the human body, such as the gastric tract and local compartments. An analysis of the proteins detected in human blood is also presented with an estimation of the respective protein concentrations determined either with mass spectrometry-based proteomics or antibody-based immune assays.\n\nThe Metabolic Atlas portion of the Tissue Atlas enables exploration of protein function and tissue-specific gene expression in the context of the human metabolic network. For proteins involved in metabolism, a metabolic summary is provided that describes the metabolic subsystems/pathways, cellular compartments, and number of reactions associated with the protein. Over 120 manually curated metabolic pathway maps facilitate the visualization of each protein's participation in different metabolic processes. Each pathway map is accompanied by a heatmap detailing the mRNA levels across 37 different tissue types for all proteins involved in the metabolic pathway.\n\n==History==\nThe Human Protein Atlas program was started in 2003 and funded by the non-profit organization [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]] (KAW). The main site of the project is the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] (KTH), School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health (Stockholm, Sweden). Professor [[Mathias Uhl\u00e9n]] is the director of the program.\n\nThe research underpinning the start of the exploration of the whole human proteome in the Human Protein Atlas program was carried out in the late 1990s and early 2000s. A pilot study employing an affinity proteomics strategy using affinity-purified antibodies raised against recombinant human protein fragments was carried out for a chromosome-wide protein profiling of chromosome 21.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Agaton C, Galli J, H\u00f6id\u00e9n Guthenberg I, Janzon L, Hansson M, Asplund A, Brundell E, Lindberg S, Ruthberg I, Wester K, Wurtz D, H\u00f6\u00f6g

''[[The Verge]]'' felt that the G4 could appeal to power users alienated by the removal of expandable storage and replaceable batteries on the then-recently released [[Samsung Galaxy S6]]. The display was praised for its improved color accuracy and energy efficiency over the G3, remarking that it was \"as good, if not better\", than the S6. The G4's rear camera was praised for its quality and color reproduction, along with its \"comprehensive\" manual mode and its \"uncommon\" ability to save [[Raw image format|raw images]], but it was noted that its autofocus sometimes missed focus or took long to achieve focus, and that the manual mode did not offer saturation or sharpness controls. LG's software was criticized for being relatively unchanged from the G3, and for suffering from [[feature creep]] and \"ugly\" aesthetics. The G4 given a 7.9 out of 10, concluding that it \"actually functions just fine \u2014 but you're not going to see it in the hands of every person at the state fair this summer.\"<ref name=verge-g4review>{{cite web|last1=Seifert|first1=Dan|title=LG G4 review: One for the diehards|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8559275/lg-g4-review|website=The Verge|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe performance of the LG G4 was contrasted to devices that utilize Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 (such as the [[LG G Flex 2]]), which was known to have overheating problems. ''[[Ars Technica]]'' felt that the need to throttle CPU-intensive tasks to prevent overheating had a negative effect on the 810's performance, arguing that as a result, the G4's Snapdragon 808 performed better in some cases than the 810 (represented in comparison testing by the [[HTC One M9]]), but that the [[Exynos]] processor of the Galaxy S6 had better overall performance than the two Snapdragon chips on benchmarks.

The G4 is primarily an evolution of the G3, with revisions to its overall design, display and camera.\n\nThe G4 received mixed to positive reviews; while praising the G4's display quality, camera, and overall performance, critics characterized the G4 as being a robust device that did not contain enough substantial changes or innovation over its predecessor to make the device stand out against its major competitors, but could appeal to power users needing a smartphone with expandable storage and a removable battery due to the exclusion of these features from its main competitor on launch, the [[Samsung Galaxy S6]].<ref name=verge-g4review/><ref name=ars-g4review/>\n\nThe device also became the subject of criticism due to instances of hardware failure caused by manufacturing defects, deemed \"[[LG smartphone bootloop issues|bootloops]]\", which culminated in a class-action lawsuit filed in March 2017.<ref name=\"ars-g4lawsuit\"/>\n\n==Specifications==\n===Hardware===\n[[File:LG G4 Display.jpg|thumb|200px|The LG G4 Display]]\nThe design of the G4 is an evolution of the G3, maintaining elements such as its rear-located volume and camera buttons.

''[[The Verge]]'' felt that the G4 could appeal to power users alienated by the removal of expandable storage and replaceable batteries on the then-recently released [[Samsung Galaxy S6]]. The display was praised for its improved color accuracy and energy efficiency over the G3, remarking that it was \"as good, if not better\", than the S6. The G4's rear camera was praised for its quality and color reproduction, along with its \"comprehensive\" manual mode and its \"uncommon\" ability to save [[Raw image format|raw images]], but it was noted that its autofocus sometimes missed focus or took long to achieve focus, and that the manual mode did not offer saturation or sharpness controls. LG's software was criticized for being relatively unchanged from the G3, and for suffering from [[feature creep]] and \"ugly\" aesthetics. The G4 given a 7.9 out of 10, concluding that it \"actually functions just fine \u2014 but you're not going to see it in the hands of every person at the state fair this summer.\"<ref name=verge-g4review>{{cite web|last1=Seifert|first1=Dan|title=LG G4 review: One for the diehards|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8559275/lg-g4-review|website=The Verge|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe performance of the LG G4 was contrasted to devices that utilize Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 (such as the [[LG G Flex 2]]), which was known to have overheating problems. ''[[Ars Technica]]'' felt that the need to throttle CPU-intensive tasks to prevent overheating had a negative effect on the 810's performance, arguing that as a result, the G4's Snapdragon 808 performed better in some cases than the 810 (represented in comparison testing by the [[HTC One M9]]), but that the [[Exynos]] processor of the Galaxy S6 had better overall performance than the two Snapdragon chips on benchmarks.

He considered most Jews to be racially \"Asiatic\" and argued for restricting Jewish immigration because he considered them a threat to Nordic racial purity in the US.

The transcript records Stoddard saying:<blockquote>\"'The more enlightened men of southern white America . . . are doing their best to see that separation shall not mean discrimination; that if the Negroes have separate schools, they shall be good schools; that if they have separate train accommodations, they shall have good accommodations.'

Du Bois, in responding to Stoddard, said the reason for the audience laughter was that he had never journeyed under [[Jim Crow]] restrictions. \"We have\", Du Bois told him and the mixed audience.<ref name=\"Frazier\" />\n\nThis moment was captured in ''[[The Chicago Defender]]''{{'}}s headline: \"DuBois Shatters Stoddard\u2019s Cultural Theories in Debate; Thousands Jam Hall . . .

He got preferential treatment by Nazi officials compared to other journalists.

After having observed several dysgenics trials at the court, Stoddard stated that the eugenics legislation was \"being administered with strict regard for its provisions and that, if anything, judgments were almost too conservative\" and that the law was \"weeding out the worst strains in the Germanic stock in a scientific and truly humanitarian way.\"<ref name=\"stefan_kuhl2001\"/><ref name=\"Spiro 2009 374\">{{Cite book |title=Defending the Master Race: Conservation, Eugenics, and the Legacy of Madison Grant |last=Spiro |first=Jonathan P. |publisher=Univ. of Vermont Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-58465-715-6 |lay-url=http://www.upne.com/1-58465-715-4.html |laydate=29 September 2010 |ref=harv |pages=373\u2013374}}</ref> However, Stoddard was taken aback by the forthrightness of the Nazis' anti-Jewish views, foreseeing that the \"Jewish problem\" would soon be settled \"by the physical elimination of the Jews themselves from the Third Reich.\"<ref name=\"Spiro 2009 374\"/>\n\nStoddard wrote a memoir, ''Into the Darkness: Nazi Germany Today'' (1940), about his experiences in Germany.

He wrote primarily on the alleged dangers posed by \"[[colored]]\" peoples to white civilization. Many of his books and articles were [[racialist]] and described what he saw as the peril of [[immigration]].

Like Madison Grant in ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', Stoddard divided the white race into three main divisions: Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean. He considered all three to be of good stock and far above the quality of the colored races but argued that the Nordic was the greatest of the three and needed to be preserved by way of eugenics. He considered most Jews to be racially \"Asiatic\" and argued for restricting Jewish immigration because he considered them a threat to Nordic racial purity in the US. He warned that US was being \"invaded by hordes of immigrant Alpines and Mediterraneans, not to mention Asiatic elements like Levantines and Jews.\"<ref>[[Leonard Dinnerstein]]. 1995.

Harding]] praised the book.<ref name=\"Frazier\" />\n\nIn ''The Revolt Against Civilization'' (1922), Stoddard put forward the theory that civilization places a growing burden on individuals, which leads to a growing underclass of individuals who cannot keep up and a \"ground-swell of revolt\".<ref>Stoddard, Lothrop (1922).

The transcript records Stoddard saying:<blockquote>\"'The more enlightened men of southern white America . . . are doing their best to see that separation shall not mean discrimination; that if the Negroes have separate schools, they shall be good schools; that if they have separate train accommodations, they shall have good accommodations.' [laughter].\"</blockquote>Travelling in segregated trains was an appalling experience for African Americans. Du Bois, in responding to Stoddard, said the reason for the audience laughter was that he had never journeyed under [[Jim Crow]] restrictions. \"We have\", Du Bois told him and the mixed audience.<ref name=\"Frazier\" />\n\nThis moment was captured in ''[[The Chicago Defender]]''{{'}}s headline: \"DuBois Shatters Stoddard\u2019s Cultural Theories in Debate; Thousands Jam Hall . . .

After having observed several dysgenics trials at the court, Stoddard stated that the eugenics legislation was \"being administered with strict regard for its provisions and that, if anything, judgments were almost too conservative\" and that the law was \"weeding out the worst strains in the Germanic stock in a scientific and truly humanitarian way.\"<ref name=\"stefan_kuhl2001\"/><ref name=\"Spiro 2009 374\">{{Cite book |title=Defending the Master Race: Conservation, Eugenics, and the Legacy of Madison Grant |last=Spiro |first=Jonathan P. |publisher=Univ. of Vermont Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-58465-715-6 |lay-url=http://www.upne.com/1-58465-715-4.html |laydate=29 September 2010 |ref=harv |pages=373\u2013374}}</ref> However, Stoddard was taken aback by the forthrightness of the Nazis' anti-Jewish views, foreseeing that the \"Jewish problem\" would soon be settled \"by the physical elimination of the Jews themselves from the Third Reich.\"<ref name=\"Spiro 2009 374\"/>\n\nStoddard wrote a memoir, ''Into the Darkness: Nazi Germany Today'' (1940), about his experiences in Germany.
