''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase.

Together they make up the subgenus called \u201cCitharoedus\u201d, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus'').

Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C.

The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities\u2019 limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />\n\n== Diet and Feeding ==\n''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2).

Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.    \n\n== Economic Importance ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are one of the most popular tropical fishes with divers and aquarists <ref name=\":7\" />.

The band was launched in its current form in the winter of 2004 and has since played more than 200 shows.\n\n==History==\nThe name Bad Flirt was inspired mostly from the revelation that the band would be pretty bad in a general sense. Starting in the spring of 2002, Bad Flirt performed extensively as a solo artist in [[Eastern Canada]] and the [[United States]] using the name Bad Flirt. Bad Flirt shared the stage with [[One Candle Power]] and [[Jade Tree (record label)|Jade Tree]] recording artist [[Onelinedrawing]] during an early performance in Montreal. Bad Flirt performed again with Onelinedrawing in 2003 and in the same year shared the stage with [[Victory Records]]' [[The Sleeping]], [[Bayside (band)|Bayside]] and [[Glasseater]] as well as the now defunct group [[The Unicorns]].\n\nBad Flirt released an [[Extended Play|EP]] in the summer of 2003 entitled The August Issues; a tour followed the release of this album. Bad Flirt played shows with [[Relapse Records]] band [[Buried Inside]], [[Astralwerks]] dance punk group [[VHS or BETA]],<ref name=\"chartattack\">{{cite news |url=http://www.chartattack.com/reviews/48383/live-vhs-or-beta-in-montreal | work=Chartattack | publisher=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]] | title= LIVE: VHS Or Beta in Montreal |last=Carpenter | first=Lorraine | date=21 October 2003 | accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref> and played at the 2003 edition of [[POP Montreal]].\n\nIn 2004, Bad Flirt took a break from touring and began working on their second EP. It was during this time the project expanded to a band. Bad Flirt enlisted ex-[[A Vertical Mosaic]] members Heidi Donnely and Edmund Lam, as well as guitarist Mark Grinberg. The first release by the newly formed band was 6 Ways To Break Your Heart, completed in 2005. This incarnation of Bad Flirt toured extensively throughout 2005.

In the late 1970s, Agrama, while in a trade fair in [[Cannes]], [[France]], met [[Hong Kong]] [[entrepreneur]]s Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun. The three agreed to form a collaboration to trade movie rights internationally. Chan set up Hong Kong-based company Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, while Agrama set up Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>  \nIn 1983, Agrama founded Harmony Gold USA.

Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a \"calculated gamble.\" ''Shaka Zulu'' had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-south-africa-alternative-visions-and-practices-joshua-brown|title=History from South Africa: Alternative Visions and Practices, page 301|publisher=Joshua Brown|date=1991}}</ref> The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by [[apartheid]]. The opening credits featured Harmony Gold, with Frank Agrama listed as associate producer.\n\n''Shaka Zulu'' went on to become a massive success worldwide, and has developed a [[cult following]] since its premiere in 1986. It has been the most repeatedly screened miniseries ever shown on syndicated television in the [[United States]]. By 1992, it had been seen by over 350 million viewers. The series dislodged John Marshall's ''[[The Hunters (1958 film)|The Hunters]]'' and the later ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' film series as the prime shaper of American perceptions of 'tribal' history in Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0703/ktfr15.html|title=Shaka Zulu and visual constructions of history|publisher=Screening the Past|date=30 June 2003}}</ref> Despite its success, the SABC failed to recoup the cost of their production due to unfair terms negotiated by Harmony Gold during production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://camerainthesun.com/?p=25727|title=Joshua Sinclair on Shaka Zulu and apartheid|publisher=Camera in the Sun|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====''Robotech'' (1985)====\nIn the mid 1980s, Harmony Gold hired [[Carl Macek]] to adapt [[Japan]]ese animated programming for American broadcast release. Macek originally wanted to adapt ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' only, but was instead forced to combine it with two other [[anime]] series together, even though they had no relation to Macross. These three series became ''[[Robotech]]''. The other two series used are:\n\n#''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]''\n#''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''<ref>(NOTE: ''[[Super Dimension Century Orguss]]'' was originally planned to be used as the third \"season\" after ''Macross'' & ''Southern Cross''. However, that plan was scrapped due to right issues, which resulted in its replacement by ''MOSPEADA''. Additionally, both Mospeada, and Orguss predate Southern Cross)</ref>\n\nHarmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit an American produced movie and a spin-off, ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.\n\n===Late 1980s to early 2000s===\nIn 1988, after the cancellation of ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', a number of the staff were recruited to work at [[Saban Entertainment]]. Carl Macek, along with his friend [[Jerry Beck]] went on to found [[Streamline Pictures]]. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.\n\nIn 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to [[Mediaset]].\n\nFrom 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with [[Netter Digital]] and hired [[Carl Macek]] to write ''[[Robotech 3000]]'', which would have been an American produced spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 [[FanimeCon]] anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. [[Tatsunoko Production]]s attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.\n\n===2000s and beyond===\nHarmony Gold began heavily pushing ''Robotech'', first by releasing the series via a partnership with [[A.D. Vision|ADV Films]] in the US, and [[Manga Entertainment]] in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with [[Funimation|FUNimation Entertainment]] to release the American produced ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' on home video.\n\nIn August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, ''The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines''. Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.\n\n==Legal problems==\n\nHarmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama.

They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.\n\nMost notably, many early designs used in ''[[BattleTech]]'', such as the ''Warhammer'', ''Valkyrie'', and ''Marauder'', were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of ''Macross'', with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued [[FASA]], and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of BattleTech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.\n\nHarmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a ''Warhammer''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5352295/mechwarrior-5-runs-into-legal-trouble | title=Mechwarrior 5 Runs Into Legal Trouble | author=Luke Plunkett | work=Kotaku | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>  The company claims that the images portray \u2019mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | title=Harmony Gold USA vs FASA | author=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION | work=Legal Filing | year=1996 | accessdate=2009-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903213803/http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | archive-date=2012-09-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that [[Hasbro]]'s [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC 2013]] exclusive set \"G.I.

Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, ''The Little Train'' was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned.

Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a \"calculated gamble.\" ''Shaka Zulu'' had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-south-africa-alternative-visions-and-practices-joshua-brown|title=History from South Africa: Alternative Visions and Practices, page 301|publisher=Joshua Brown|date=1991}}</ref> The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by [[apartheid]].

However, that plan was scrapped due to right issues, which resulted in its replacement by ''MOSPEADA''. Additionally, both Mospeada, and Orguss predate Southern Cross)</ref>\n\nHarmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit an American produced movie and a spin-off, ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.\n\n===Late 1980s to early 2000s===\nIn 1988, after the cancellation of ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', a number of the staff were recruited to work at [[Saban Entertainment]]. Carl Macek, along with his friend [[Jerry Beck]] went on to found [[Streamline Pictures]]. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.\n\nIn 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to [[Mediaset]].\n\nFrom 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with [[Netter Digital]] and hired [[Carl Macek]] to write ''[[Robotech 3000]]'', which would have been an American produced spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 [[FanimeCon]] anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. [[Tatsunoko Production]]s attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.\n\n===2000s and beyond===\nHarmony Gold began heavily pushing ''Robotech'', first by releasing the series via a partnership with [[A.D. Vision|ADV Films]] in the US, and [[Manga Entertainment]] in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with [[Funimation|FUNimation Entertainment]] to release the American produced ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' on home video.\n\nIn August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, ''The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines''. Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.\n\n==Legal problems==\n\nHarmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama. According to another Italian daily, the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the five accounts are said to contain SFr140 million ($109.5 million). This early investigation led to two high-profile trials.\n\n===Mediaset conviction===\nOn November 29, 2006, federal agents raided Agrama's home and offices in connection with Italy's ongoing tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting investigation of its former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Court documents revealed the recent search by FBI agents centered on Italian allegations that Agrama, Berlusconi and others fraudulently inflated the price of television rights originally purchased by Agrama so that millions of dollars in kickbacks could be paid to executives of Berlusconi's [[Mediaset]] media empire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/29/local/me-agrama29|title=Federal agents search producer's home, office|language=English|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 November 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 2012, Agrama was convicted after a lengthy [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi#Mediaset television and cinema rights .28false accounting.2C embezzlement and tax fraud.29|trial]] involving the buying and selling of US film rights to the Mediaset media company at inflated prices.<ref name=\"bbcfraud\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|title=Silvio Berlusconi sentenced for tax fraud | work=BBC News | date=26 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207101452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|archivedate=7 February 2014}}</ref> As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment and served no actual jail time. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', on November 21, 2006 prosecutors in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] charged Agrama, along with Berlusconi and ten others, in a trial over tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting at Mediaset.\n\n===Mediatrade acquittal===\n\nIn October 2011, Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun, along with nine others (including Frank Agrama and [[Pier Silvio Berlusconi]], son of Silvio Berlusconi), were indicted by a Milan court and charged with buying rights for US television series and movies, then reselling them to broadcasting rights firm Mediatrade (a subsidiary of Mediaset) at inflated prices and laundering the money in a complex scheme. The four companies allegedly involved in this scheme were Wiltshire Trading, Harmony Gold, CS Secretaries and Loong Po Management.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mediaset-mediatrade-idUSKBN0E21FH20140522#DvRYAqYgWZjC0iay.97|title=Hong Kong set to hand over Berlusconi-related evidence|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Chan met Agrama in [[Cannes]], [[France]] in the late 1970s at a trade fair and they decided to form a partnership to trade movie rights internationally. Chan organized a Hong Kong-based Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, records from the city's Companies Registry show. In the same year, Agrama organized Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Four years later, he set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles representative of another Hong Kong company established by Chan, Wiltshire Trading.\n\nProsecutors estimated the illicit profits between 1988 and 1999 amounted to US$170 million. Earlier in 2005, Swiss investigators froze 150 million francs (HK$1.29 billion) at a UBS branch in Lugano belonging to Harmony Gold, Wiltshire Trading and other companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 24, 2014, [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] reported that some of the charges have been dropped due to expiring [[statute of limitations]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957401.html?categoryid=22&cs=1 | title=Judge throws out some Berlusconi charges | author=Nick Vivarelli | work=Variety | accessdate=2015-12-11 | date=2014}}</ref> An appeals hearing was set to take place January 20, 2016.<ref name=\"afr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-duesse.it/News/Televisione/Mediatrade-il-20-gennaio-inizia-l-appello-195937|work=e-duesse|date=November 9, 2015|title=Mediatrade, il 20 gennaio inizia l\u2019appello|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref> On January 18, 2016, all charges against Frank Agrama and five other people were dropped.

They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.\n\nMost notably, many early designs used in ''[[Battletech]]'', such as the ''Warhammer'', ''Valkyrie'', and ''Marauder'', were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of ''Macross'', with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued [[FASA]], and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of Battletech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.\n\nHarmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a ''Warhammer''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5352295/mechwarrior-5-runs-into-legal-trouble | title=Mechwarrior 5 Runs Into Legal Trouble | author=Luke Plunkett | work=Kotaku | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>  The company claims that the images portray \u2019mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | title=Harmony Gold USA vs FASA | author=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION | work=Legal Filing | year=1996 | accessdate=2009-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903213803/http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | archive-date=2012-09-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that [[Hasbro]]'s [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC 2013]] exclusive set \"G.I.

Harmony Gold's license for ''Macross'' came from [[Tatsunoko Production]], but Japanese courts ruled that it was [[Studio Nue]] (creators of the series) that controls the ''Macross'' intellectual property. The license Tatsunoko was given was for international distribution outside Japan only, and does not allow them to control the intellectual property.\n\nIn November 2016, Harmony Gold initiated arbitration against Tatsunoko, to which Tatsunoko responded with counterclaims.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knaub|first1=Kelly|title=Judge OKs Production Co.'s $850K Award In License Dispute - Law360|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/957616/judge-oks-production-co-s-850k-award-in-license-dispute|website=Law360|accessdate=19 September 2017|location=New York|date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> With the exception of the original visual depictions of 41 characters, which are owned by [[Big West Advertising]] not Tatsunoko, the arbitrator found that Harmony Gold had the rights to ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'', ''Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross'', and ''Genesis Climber MOSPEADA'' until their expiry on March 14, 2021, as per the licensing agreement. Harmony Gold also holds several trademarks related to ''Macross'' and its trademark for the ''Macross'' series was renewed on December 26, 2012. The expiration date for these was set to take place ten years from that date, on December 26, 2022.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmony Gold's Macross, Mospeada, Southern Cross Licenses Still Expire in 2021|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-09-14/harmony-gold-macross-mospeada-southern-cross-licenses-still-expire-in-2021/.121372|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=19 September 2017|date=14 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn July 5, 2019, Harmony Gold confirmed that their license with Tatsunoko had been renewed again, extending their ownership of the ''Macross'' franchise's co-copyright past the original 2021 expiration date.

They released the same films on another UK label Kids Cartoon Collection for the home market during the 1985. Finding a MasterVision or Kids Cartoon Collection (a.k.a. Harmony Gold in the UK) is like striking a pot of Harmony Gold, as they were a rare brand of VHS in the UK. Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, ''The Little Train'' was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned. These VHS companies by them also released the standard fare from their USA branch, for example ''The Brave Frog'' and ''Robotech'' in the UK.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Empty section|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official|http://www.harmonygold.com/}}\n* {{IMDb company|id=0027738}}\n\n{{Robotech}}\n{{Animated television series created for syndication}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harmony Gold Usa}}\n[[Category:Anime companies]]\n[[Category:Dubbing (filmmaking)]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Macross]]\n[[Category:Robotech]]\n[[Category:Television production companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Video game development companies]]\n[[Category:Video game publishers]]\n", "name_user": "Bumm13", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLegal issues regarding Macross copyright:capitalization/spelling fixes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_Gold_USA"}

The gastraphetes ('belly-bow') was a handheld crossbow. It had a composite prod and was spanned by bracing the front end of the weapon against the ground while placing the end of a slider mechanism against the stomach. The operator would then walk forward to arm the weapon while a ratchet prevented it from shooting during loading. This produced a weapon which, it was claimed, could be operated by a person of average strength but which had a power that allowed it to be successfully used against armoured troops. The oxybeles was a bigger and heavier construction employing a winch, and was mounted on a tripod. It had a lower rate of fire and was used as a siege engine.\n\nWith the invention of [[torsion spring]] bundle technology, the first ballistae were built. The advantage of this new technology was the fast relaxation time of this system. Thus it was possible to shoot lighter projectiles with higher velocities over a longer distance. By contrast, the comparatively slow relaxation time of a [[crossbow|tension machine]] such as the oxybeles meant that much less energy could be transferred to light projectiles, limiting the effective range of the weapon.\n\nThe earliest form of the ballista is thought to have been developed for [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius of Syracuse]], {{circa}} 400 BC.\n\nThe Greek ballista was a [[siege weapon]]. All components that were not made of wood were transported in the baggage train. It would be assembled with local wood, if necessary. Some were positioned inside large, armoured, mobile [[siege tower]]s or even on the edge of a battlefield. For all of the tactical advantages offered, it was only under [[Philip II of Macedon]], and even more so under his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], that the ballista began to develop and gain recognition as both a siege engine and field artillery. Historical accounts, for instance, cited that Philip II employed a group of engineers within his army to design and build catapults for his military campaigns.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Soldiers' Lives through History: The Ancient World|last=Gabriel|first=Richard|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2007|isbn=0313333483|location=Westport, CT|pages=127}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Alexander the Great: Conqueror of the Ancient World|last=McGowen|first=Tom|publisher=Enslow Publishers|year=2006|isbn=9780766025608|location=Berkeley Heights, NJ|pages=[https://archive.org/details/alexandergreatco0000mcgo/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/alexandergreatco0000mcgo/page/24}}</ref> There is even a claim that it was Philip II - with his team of engineers - who invented the ballista after improving Dionysius's device, which was merely an oversized slingshot.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Art of the Catapult: Build Greek Ballistae, Roman Onagers, English Trebuchets, and More Ancient Artillery|last=Gurstelle|first=William|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2004|isbn=1556525265|location=Chicago|pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofcatapult00will/page/51 51]|url=https://archive.org/details/artofcatapult00will/page/51}}</ref> It was further perfected by Alexander, whose own team of engineers introduced innovations such as the idea of using springs made from tightly strung coils of rope instead of a bow to achieve more energy and power when throwing projectiles.<ref name=\":1\" />  [[Polybius]] reported about the usage of smaller, more portable ballistae, called [[scorpio (weapon)|scorpions]], during the [[Second Punic War]].\n\nBallistae could be easily modified to shoot both spherical and shaft projectiles, allowing their crews to adapt easily to prevailing battlefield situations in real time.\n\nAs the role of battlefield artillery became more sophisticated, a [[universal joint]] (which was invented just for this function) was integrated into the ballista's stand, allowing the operators to alter the trajectory and firing direction of the ballista as required without a lengthy disassembly of the machine.\n\n== Roman weaponry ==\n[[File:Hecht 090710 Ballista.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed small Roman ballista]]\n[[File:Bal BBC1.jpg|thumb|One [[Talent (measurement)|talent]] ballista ({{cvt|26|kg|lb|disp=sqbr}} weight projectile) was typical for Roman era ballista.

This included the great military machine advances the Greeks had made (most notably by Dionysus of Syracuse), as well as all the scientific, mathematical, political and artistic developments.\n\nThe Romans 'inherited' the torsion-powered ballista, which had by now spread to several cities around the Mediterranean, all of which became Roman spoils of war, including one from [[Pergamum]], which was depicted among a pile of trophy weapons in relief on a balustrade.\n\nThe torsion ballista, developed by Alexander, was a far more complicated weapon than its predecessor and the Romans developed it even further, especially into much smaller versions, that could be easily carried.\n\n=== Early Roman ballistae ===\nThe early Roman ballistae were made of wood, and held together with iron plates around the frames and iron nails in the stand. The main stand had a slider on the top, into which were loaded the [[Crossbow bolt|bolts]] or stone ''shot''. Attached to this, at the back, was a pair of '[[winch]]es' and a 'claw', used to [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] the bowstring back to the armed firing position.\n\nThe slider passed through the ''field frames'' of the weapon, in which were located the ''torsion springs'' (rope made of animal [[Tendon|sinew]]), which were twisted around the bow arms, which in turn, were attached to the bowstring.\n\nDrawing the bowstring back with the winches twisted the already taut springs, storing the energy to fire the projectiles. The bronze or iron caps, which secured the torsion-bundles were adjustable by means of pins and peripheral holes, which allowed the weapon to be tuned for symmetrical power and for changing weather conditions.\n\nThe ballista was a highly accurate weapon (there are many accounts of single soldiers being picked off by ballista operators), but some design aspects meant it could compromise its accuracy for range. The maximum range was over {{convert|500|yd}}, but effective combat range for many targets was far shorter.\n\nThe Romans continued the development of the ballista, and it became a highly prized and valued weapon in the army of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nIt was used, just before the start of the Empire, by [[Julius Caesar]] during his conquest of [[Gaul]] and on both of his campaigns in subduing Britain.\n\n==== First invasion of Britain ====\nThe first of [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] took place in 55 BC, after a rapid and successful initial conquest of Gaul, in part as an expedition, and more practically to try to put an end to the reinforcements sent by the native Britons to fight the Romans in Gaul.\n\nA total of eighty transports, carrying two legions, attempted to land on the British shore, only to be driven back by the many British warriors assembled along the shoreline. The ships had to unload their troops on the beach, as it was the only one suitable for many miles, yet the massed ranks of British [[chariot]]eers and javeliners were making it difficult.\n\n<blockquote>Seeing this, Caesar ordered the warships \u2013 which were swifter and easier to handle than the transports, and likely to impress the natives more by their unfamiliar appearance \u2013 to be removed a short distance from the others, and then be rowed hard and run ashore on the enemy\u2019s right flank, from which position the slings, bows and artillery could be used by men on deck to drive them back. This manoeuvre was highly successful.<br> Scared by the strange shape of the warships, the motion of the oars, and the unfamiliar machines, the natives halted and retreated. ''(Caesar, The Conquest of Gaul, p.99)</blockquote>\n\n==== Siege of Alesia ====\n[[File:Ballista-quadrirotis.jpeg|thumb|A four-wheeled [[carroballista]] drawn by armored horses, from an engraving illustrating a 1552 edition of the war-machine catalog ''[[De Rebus Bellicis]]'' ({{circa|400}})]]\nIn Gaul, the stronghold of [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]] was [[Battle of Alesia|under a Roman siege]] in 52 BC, and was completely surrounded by a Roman fortification including a wooden [[palisade]] and towers. As was standard siege technique at the time, small ballistae were placed in the towers with other troops armed with [[bow (weapon)|bows]] or [[Sling (weapon)|slings]]. The use of the ballista in the Roman siege strategy was also demonstrated in the case of the [[Siege of Masada]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Ballistae in the Roman Empire ===\nDuring the conquest of the Empire, the ballista proved its worth many times in sieges and battles, both at sea and on land. It was even used to quell riots.  It is from the time of the Roman Empire that many of the archaeological finds of ballistae date. Accounts by the finders, including technical manuals and journals, are used today by archaeologists to reconstruct these weapons.\n\nAfter Julius Caesar, the ballista was a permanent fixture in the Roman army and, over time, modifications and improvements were made by successive engineers. This included replacing the remaining wooden parts of the machine with metal, creating a much smaller, lighter and more powerful machine than the wooden version, which required less maintenance (though the vital torsion springs were still vulnerable to the strain). The largest ballistae of the 4th century could throw a dart further than 1200 yards (1,100 m). The weapon was named ''ballista fulminalis'' in [[De Rebus Bellicis]]: \"From this ballista, darts were projected not only in great number but also at a large size over a considerable distance, such as across the width of the Danube River.\"<ref>De Rebus Bellicis, Chapter XVIII: ballista fulminalis. Note: The modern width of the Danube is 1.5 km. During the Roman Empire, it was unlikely to have been less than 1.1 km, bearing in mind that [[Trajan's Bridge]] is known to have been longer than 1.1 km.</ref> Ballistae were not only used in laying siege: after {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;350, at least 22 [[bastion|semi-circular towers]] were erected around [[London Wall|the walls]] of [[Londinium]] ([[City of London|London]]) to provide platforms for permanently mounted defensive devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/Londinium/Today/vizrom/01+wall.htm |title=Visible Roman London: City wall and gates |publisher=Museum of London Group |accessdate=19 February 2015 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219043325/http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/Londinium/Today/vizrom/01%2Bwall.htm |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n=== Eastern Roman Empire ===\n[[File:Israel Batch 2 (50).JPG|thumb|Ballista stones found at excavation site in Jerusalem]]\nDuring the 6th century, [[Procopius]] described the effects of this weapon:\n\n<blockquote>But Belisarius placed upon the towers engines which they call \"ballistae\". Now these engines have the form of a bow, but on the under side of them a grooved wooden shaft projects; this shaft is so fitted to the bow that it is free to move, and rests upon a straight iron bed. So when men wish to shoot at the enemy with this, they make the parts of the bow which form the ends bend toward one another by means of a short rope fastened to them, and they place in the grooved shaft the arrow, which is about one half the length of the ordinary missiles which they shoot from bows, but about four times as wide...but the missile is discharged from the shaft, and with such force that it attains the distance of not less than two bow-shots, and that, when it hits a tree or a rock, it pierces it easily. Such is the engine which bears this name, being so called because it shoots with very great force''<ref>Procopius, Gothic war, chapter XXI</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe missiles were able to penetrate body-armour:\n\n<blockquote>And at the Salarian Gate a Goth of goodly stature and a capable warrior, wearing a corselet and having a helmet on his head, a man who was of no mean station in the Gothic nation, refused to remain in the ranks with his comrades, but stood by a tree and kept shooting many missiles at the parapet. But this man by some chance was hit by a missile from an engine which was on a tower at his left. And passing through the corselet and the body of the man, the missile sank more than half its length into the tree, and pinning him to the spot where it entered the tree, it suspended him there a corpse.<ref>Procopius, Gothic war, chapter XXIII</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Cheiroballistra and manuballista ====\n{{Main|Cheiroballistra}}\n\nThe cheiroballistra and the manuballista are held by many archaeologists to be the same weapon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The difference in name may be attributable to the different languages spoken in the Empire. Latin remained the official language in the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], but the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]] predominantly used Greek, which added an extra 'r' to the word ballista.\n\nThe manuballista was a handheld version of the traditional ballista. This new version was made entirely of iron, which conferred greater power to the weapon, since it was smaller, and less iron (an expensive material before the 19th century), was used in its production. It was not the ancient [[gastraphetes]], but the Roman weapon. However, the same physical limitations applied as with the gastraphetes.\n\n==== Carroballista ====\n[[File:031 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianss\u00e4ule, Tafel XXXI (Ausschnitt 01).jpg|thumb|right|Roman cart-mounted carroballista]]\n{{Main|Carroballista}}\n\nThe carroballista was a cart-mounted version of the weapon. There were probably different models of ballista under the ''cheiroballistra'' class, at least two different two-wheeled models and one model with four wheels. Their probable size was roughly 1.47 m width, i.e., 5 Roman feet. The cart system and structure gave it a great deal of flexibility and capability as a battlefield weapon, since the increased maneuverability allowed it to be moved with the flow of the battle. This weapon features several times on [[Trajan's Column]].\n\n==== Polybolos ====\n{{Main|Polybolos}}\n[[File:Ancient Mechanical Artillery. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|Reproductions of [[Greek and Roman artillery|ancient Greek artillery]], including [[catapult]]s such as the ''[[polybolos]]'' (to the left in the foreground) and a large, early [[crossbow]] known as the ''[[gastraphetes]]'' (mounted on the wall in the background)]]\nIt has been speculated that the Roman military may have also fielded a 'repeating' ballista, also known as a ''polybolos''. Reconstruction and trials of such a weapon carried out in a BBC documentary, ''What the Romans Did For Us'', showed that they \"were able to shoot eleven bolts a minute, which is almost four times the rate at which an ordinary ballista can be operated\".<ref>Hart-Davis, Adam [https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/tech_01.shtml Discovering Roman Technology] [[BBC]] History 17 February 2011. Accessed 21 November 2013</ref> However, no example of such a weapon has been found by archaeologists.\n\n=== Archaeology and the Roman ballista ===\n[[File:Ballista Ampurias Schramm.jpg|thumb|Metal components of the Ampurias Catapult, found in 1912 in the ''Neapolis'' of [[Emp\u00faries|Ampurias]]]]\n[[File:Balista Cluj Museaum.JPG|thumb|left|Metal components of a 4th-century ballista]]\n\n[[Archaeology]], and in particular [[experimental archaeology]] has been influential on this subject. Although several ancient authors (such as [[Vegetius]]) wrote very detailed technical treatises, providing us with all the information necessary to reconstruct the weapons, all their measurements were in their native language and therefore highly difficult to translate.\n\nAttempts to reconstruct these ancient weapons began at the end of the 19th century, based on rough translations of ancient authors. It was only during the 20th century, however, that many of the reconstructions began to make any sense as a weapon. By bringing in modern engineers, progress was made with the ancient systems of measurement. By redesigning the reconstructions using the new information, archaeologists in that specialty were able to recognize certain finds from Roman military sites, and identify them as ballistae. The information gained from the excavations was fed into the next generation of reconstructions and so on.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nSites across the empire have yielded information on ballistae, from Spain (the Ampurias Catapult), to Italy (the Cremona Battleshield, which proved that the weapons had decorative metal plates to shield the operators), to Iraq (the Hatra Machine) and even Scotland (Burnswark siege tactics training camp), and many other sites between.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe most influential archaeologists in this area have been [[Peter Connolly]] and Eric Marsden,<ref>Marsden, E.W. (1971). ''Greek and Roman Artillery''. Technical Treatises (Oxford). Reprinted 1999 by Sandpiper</ref> who have not only written extensively on the subject but have also made many reconstructions themselves and have refined the designs over many years of work.\n\n== Middle Ages ==\nWith the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], resources to build and maintain these complex machines became very scarce, so the ballista was supplanted initially by the simpler and cheaper [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]] and the more efficient [[springald]].\n\nThough the weapon continued to be used in the [[Middle Ages]], it faded from popular use with the advent of the [[trebuchet]] and [[mangonel]] in siege warfare.\n\nWhile not a direct descendant mechanically, the concept and naming continues on as [[arbalest]] crossbows (''arcus'' 'bow' + ballista).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Harpax]]\n* {{Interlanguage link|\u5e8a\u5f29|zh|vertical-align=sup}} - in Chinese case\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{ external media\n| image1 = [http://www.roman-empire.net/diverse/pics/birdoswald-2005/Dsc_0040-manuballista.jpg Reenactor with manuballista], Retrieved 6 February 2008\n| image2 = [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/war/Catapults-Dateien/dion2.jpg Trigger of the polybolos], retrieved 6 February 2008\n| image3 = [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/war/Catapults-Dateien/dion3.jpg Side elevation of the polybolos], retrieved 6 February 2008\n| image4 = [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/war/Catapults-Dateien/dion1.jpg From above with magazin removed], retrieved 6 February 2008\n| image5 = [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/war/Catapults-Dateien/image009.jpg Another view of the trigger], retrieved 6 February 2008\n}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* Caesar (tr Handforth), 1982, ''The Conquest of Gaul'', London: Penguin Books\n* Campbell, D;

This included the great military machine advances the Greeks had made (most notably by Dionysus of Syracuse), as well as all the scientific, mathematical, political and artistic developments.\n\nThe Romans 'inherited' the torsion-powered ballista, which had by now spread to several cities around the Mediterranean, all of which became Roman spoils of war, including one from [[Pergamum]], which was depicted among a pile of trophy weapons in relief on a balustrade.\n\nThe torsion ballista, developed by Alexander, was a far more complicated weapon than its predecessor and the Romans developed it even further, especially into much smaller versions, that could be easily carried.\n\n=== Early Roman ballistae ===\nThe early Roman ballistae were made of wood, and held together with iron plates around the frames and iron nails in the stand. The main stand had a slider on the top, into which were loaded the [[Crossbow bolt|bolts]] or stone ''shot''. Attached to this, at the back, was a pair of '[[winch]]es' and a 'claw', used to [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] the bowstring back to the armed firing position.\n\nThe slider passed through the ''field frames'' of the weapon, in which were located the ''torsion springs'' (rope made of animal [[Tendon|sinew]]), which were twisted around the bow arms, which in turn, were attached to the bowstring.\n\nDrawing the bowstring back with the winches twisted the already taut springs, storing the energy to fire the projectiles. The bronze or iron caps, which secured the torsion-bundles were adjustable by means of pins and peripheral holes, which allowed the weapon to be tuned for symmetrical power and for changing weather conditions.\n\nThe ballista was a highly accurate weapon (there are many accounts of single soldiers being picked off by ballista operators), but some design aspects meant it could compromise its accuracy for range. The maximum range was over {{convert|500|yd}}, but effective combat range for many targets was far shorter.\n\nThe Romans continued the development of the ballista, and it became a highly prized and valued weapon in the army of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nIt was used, just before the start of the Empire, by [[Julius Caesar]] during his conquest of [[Gaul]] and on both of his campaigns in subduing Britain.\n\n==== First invasion of Britain ====\nThe first of [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] took place in 55 BC, after a rapid and successful initial conquest of Gaul, in part as an expedition, and more practically to try to put an end to the reinforcements sent by the native Britons to fight the Romans in Gaul.\n\nA total of eighty transports, carrying two legions, attempted to land on the British shore, only to be driven back by the many British warriors assembled along the shoreline. The ships had to unload their troops on the beach, as it was the only one suitable for many miles, yet the massed ranks of British [[chariot]]eers and javeliners were making it difficult.\n\n<blockquote>Seeing this, Caesar ordered the warships \u2013 which were swifter and easier to handle than the transports, and likely to impress the natives more by their unfamiliar appearance \u2013 to be removed a short distance from the others, and then be rowed hard and run ashore on the enemy\u2019s right flank, from which position the slings, bows and artillery could be used by men on deck to drive them back. This manoeuvre was highly successful.<br> Scared by the strange shape of the warships, the motion of the oars, and the unfamiliar machines, the natives halted and retreated. ''(Caesar, The Conquest of Gaul, p.99)</blockquote>\n\n==== Siege of Alesia ====\n[[File:Ballista-quadrirotis.jpeg|thumb|A four-wheeled [[carroballista]] drawn by armored horses, from an engraving illustrating a 1552 edition of the war-machine catalog ''[[De Rebus Bellicis]]'' ({{circa|400}})]]\nIn Gaul, the stronghold of [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]] was [[Battle of Alesia|under a Roman siege]] in 52 BC, and was completely surrounded by a Roman fortification including a wooden [[palisade]] and towers. As was standard siege technique at the time, small ballistae were placed in the towers with other troops armed with [[bow (weapon)|bows]] or [[Sling (weapon)|slings]]. The use of the ballista in the Roman siege strategy was also demonstrated in the case of the [[Siege of Masada]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Ballistae in the Roman Empire ===\nDuring the conquest of the Empire, the ballista proved its worth many times in sieges and battles, both at sea and on land. It was even used to quell riots.  It is from the time of the Roman Empire that many of the archaeological finds of ballistae date. Accounts by the finders, including technical manuals and journals, are used today by archaeologists to reconstruct these weapons.\n\nAfter Julius Caesar, the ballista was a permanent fixture in the Roman army and, over time, modifications and improvements were made by successive engineers. This included replacing the remaining wooden parts of the machine with metal, creating a much smaller, lighter and more powerful machine than the wooden version, which required less maintenance (though the vital torsion springs were still vulnerable to the strain). The largest ballistae of the 4th century could throw a dart further than 1200 yards (1,100 m). The weapon was named ''ballista fulminalis'' in [[De Rebus Bellicis]]: \"From this ballista, darts were projected not only in great number but also at a large size over a considerable distance, such as across the width of the Danube River.\"<ref>De Rebus Bellicis, Chapter XVIII: ballista fulminalis. Note: The modern width of the Danube is 1.5 km. During the Roman Empire, it was unlikely to have been less than 1.1 km, bearing in mind that [[Trajan's Bridge]] is known to have been longer than 1.1 km.</ref> Ballistae were not only used in laying siege: after {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;350, at least 22 [[bastion|semi-circular towers]] were erected around [[London Wall|the walls]] of [[Londinium]] ([[City of London|London]]) to provide platforms for permanently mounted defensive devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/Londinium/Today/vizrom/01+wall.htm |title=Visible Roman London: City wall and gates |publisher=Museum of London Group |accessdate=19 February 2015 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219043325/http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/Londinium/Today/vizrom/01%2Bwall.htm |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n=== Eastern Roman Empire ===\n[[File:Israel Batch 2 (50).JPG|thumb|Ballista stones found at excavation site in Jerusalem]]\nDuring the 6th century, [[Procopius]] described the effects of this weapon:\n\n<blockquote>But Belisarius placed upon the towers engines which they call \"ballistae\". Now these engines have the form of a bow, but on the under side of them a grooved wooden shaft projects; this shaft is so fitted to the bow that it is free to move, and rests upon a straight iron bed. So when men wish to shoot at the enemy with this, they make the parts of the bow which form the ends bend toward one another by means of a short rope fastened to them, and they place in the grooved shaft the arrow, which is about one half the length of the ordinary missiles which they shoot from bows, but about four times as wide...but the missile is discharged from the shaft, and with such force that it attains the distance of not less than two bow-shots, and that, when it hits a tree or a rock, it pierces it easily. Such is the engine which bears this name, being so called because it shoots with very great force''<ref>Procopius, Gothic war, chapter XXI</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe missiles were able to penetrate body-armour:\n\n<blockquote>And at the Salarian Gate a Goth of goodly stature and a capable warrior, wearing a corselet and having a helmet on his head, a man who was of no mean station in the Gothic nation, refused to remain in the ranks with his comrades, but stood by a tree and kept shooting many missiles at the parapet. But this man by some chance was hit by a missile from an engine which was on a tower at his left. And passing through the corselet and the body of the man, the missile sank more than half its length into the tree, and pinning him to the spot where it entered the tree, it suspended him there a corpse.<ref>Procopius, Gothic war, chapter XXIII</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Cheiroballistra and manuballista ====\n{{Main|Cheiroballistra}}\n\nThe cheiroballistra and the manuballista are held by many archaeologists to be the same weapon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The difference in name may be attributable to the different languages spoken in the Empire. Latin remained the official language in the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], but the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]] predominantly used Greek, which added an extra 'r' to the word ballista.\n\nThe manuballista was a handheld version of the traditional ballista. This new version was made entirely of iron, which conferred greater power to the weapon, since it was smaller, and less iron (an expensive material before the 19th century), was used in its production. It was not the ancient [[gastraphetes]], but the Roman weapon. However, the same physical limitations applied as with the gastraphetes.\n\n==== Carroballista ====\n[[File:031 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianss\u00e4ule, Tafel XXXI (Ausschnitt 01).jpg|thumb|right|Roman cart-mounted carroballista]]\n{{Main|Carroballista}}\n\nThe carroballista was a cart-mounted version of the weapon. There were probably different models of ballista under the ''cheiroballistra'' class, at least two different two-wheeled models and one model with four wheels. Their probable size was roughly 1.47 m width, i.e., 5 Roman feet. The cart system and structure gave it a great deal of flexibility and capability as a battlefield weapon, since the increased maneuverability allowed it to be moved with the flow of the battle. This weapon features several times on [[Trajan's Column]].\n\n==== Polybolos ====\n{{Main|Polybolos}}\n[[File:Ancient Mechanical Artillery. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|Reproductions of [[Greek and Roman artillery|ancient Greek artillery]], including [[catapult]]s such as the ''[[polybolos]]'' (to the left in the foreground) and a large, early [[crossbow]] known as the ''[[gastraphetes]]'' (mounted on the wall in the background)]]\nIt has been speculated that the Roman military may have also fielded a 'repeating' ballista, also known as a ''polybolos''. Reconstruction and trials of such a weapon carried out in a BBC documentary, ''What the Romans Did For Us'', showed that they \"were able to shoot eleven bolts a minute, which is almost four times the rate at which an ordinary ballista can be operated\".<ref>Hart-Davis, Adam [https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/tech_01.shtml Discovering Roman Technology] [[BBC]] History 17 February 2011. Accessed 21 November 2013</ref> However, no example of such a weapon has been found by archaeologists.\n\n=== Archaeology and the Roman ballista ===\n[[File:Ballista Ampurias Schramm.jpg|thumb|Metal components of the Ampurias Catapult, found in 1912 in the ''Neapolis'' of [[Emp\u00faries|Ampurias]]]]\n[[File:Balista Cluj Museaum.JPG|thumb|left|Metal components of a 4th-century ballista]]\n\n[[Archaeology]], and in particular [[experimental archaeology]] has been influential on this subject. Although several ancient authors (such as [[Vegetius]]) wrote very detailed technical treatises, providing us with all the information necessary to reconstruct the weapons, all their measurements were in their native language and therefore highly difficult to translate.\n\nAttempts to reconstruct these ancient weapons began at the end of the 19th century, based on rough translations of ancient authors. It was only during the 20th century, however, that many of the reconstructions began to make any sense as a weapon. By bringing in modern engineers, progress was made with the ancient systems of measurement. By redesigning the reconstructions using the new information, archaeologists in that specialty were able to recognize certain finds from Roman military sites, and identify them as ballistae. The information gained from the excavations was fed into the next generation of reconstructions and so on.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nSites across the empire have yielded information on ballistae, from Spain (the Ampurias Catapult), to Italy (the Cremona Battleshield, which proved that the weapons had decorative metal plates to shield the operators), to Iraq (the Hatra Machine) and even Scotland (Burnswark siege tactics training camp), and many other sites between.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe most influential archaeologists in this area have been [[Peter Connolly]] and Eric Marsden,<ref>Marsden, E.W. (1971). ''Greek and Roman Artillery''. Technical Treatises (Oxford). Reprinted 1999 by Sandpiper</ref> who have not only written extensively on the subject but have also made many reconstructions themselves and have refined the designs over many years of work.\n\n== Middle Ages ==\nWith the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], resources to build and maintain these complex machines became very scarce, so the ballista was supplanted initially by the simpler and cheaper [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]] and the more efficient [[springald]].\n\nThough the weapon continued to be used in the [[Middle Ages]], it faded from popular use with the advent of the [[trebuchet]] and [[mangonel]] in siege warfare.\n\nWhile not a direct descendant mechanically, the concept and naming continues on as [[arbalest]] crossbows (''arcus'' 'bow' + ballista).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Harpax]]\n* {{Interlanguage link|\u5e8a\u5f29|zh|vertical-align=sup}} - in Chinese case\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{ external media\n| image1 = [http://www.roman-empire.net/diverse/pics/birdoswald-2005/Dsc_0040-manuballista.jpg Reenactor with manuballista], Retrieved 6 February 2008\n| image2 = [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/war/Catapults-Dateien/dion2.jpg Trigger of the polybolos], retrieved 6 February 2008\n| image3 = [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/war/Catapults-Dateien/dion3.jpg Side elevation of the polybolos], retrieved 6 February 2008\n| image4 = [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/war/Catapults-Dateien/dion1.jpg From above with magazin removed], retrieved 6 February 2008\n| image5 = [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/war/Catapults-Dateien/image009.jpg Another view of the trigger], retrieved 6 February 2008\n}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* Caesar (tr Handforth), 1982, ''The Conquest of Gaul'', London: Penguin Books\n* Campbell, D; 2003, ''Greek and Roman Artillery 399 BC \u2013 AD 363'', Osprey\n* Connolly, P; 1975, ''The Roman Army'', Macdonald Educational\n* Connolly, P; 1998, ''Greece and Rome at War'', Greenhill Books\n* Feug\u00e8re, M; 2002, ''Weapons of the Romans'', Arcadia\n* Goldsworthy, A; 2003, ''The Complete Roman Army'', Thames and Hudson\n* Marsden, E.W; 1971, ''Greek and Roman Technical Treatises'', Clarendon\n* Warry, J. ;1995, ''Warfare in the Classical World'', Salamander Books Ltd., London: United Kingdom. {{ISBN|0-8061-2794-5}}\n* Wilkins, A; 2003, ''Roman Artillery'', Shire Archaeology\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Ballista}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101123220013/http://www.howtobuildcatapults.com/ballista.html Roman Stone Throwing Ballista]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160112160714/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/war/CatapultTypes.htm Ancient Greek Artillery Technology]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130604140104/http://www.frapanthers.com/teachers/white/siege_gallery.htm Reconstructions and Plans of Greek and Roman Artillery]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110119043116/http://www.howtobuildcatapults.com/roman_ballista_plans.html Plans For a Working Model Ballista]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011530/http://www.carpenteroakandwoodland.com/timber-engineering/the-downright-unusual/building-a-ballista-roman-war-machine The reconstruction of a full-size working ballista by BBC TV and the Discovery Channel]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jolYDinb_50 The Ballista Project 2005 - 2007]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeoielGT2zk YouTube]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090326124757/http://www.frapanthers.com/teachers/white/galleries/roman_artillary/RomanPalintonePlan.jpg Wayback Machine]\n* [http://www.romanarmy.net/artillery.htm Roman Artillery]\n\n{{Ancient mechanical artillery and hand-held missile weapons}}\n\n[[Category:Projectile weapons]]\n[[Category:Roman siege engines]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek artillery]]\n[[Category:Roman artillery]]\n[[Category:Greek inventions]]\n", "name_user": "MydogisarodentxD", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballista"}
