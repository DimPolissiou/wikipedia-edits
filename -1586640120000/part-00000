The single was released on January 24, 2019, by [[El Cartel Records]] alongside a music video directed by Marlon Pe\u00f1a and filmed in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Toronto]], which features a Memoji ([[Animoji]]) of Daddy Yankee dancing with a crew. The track is a reimagination of Snow's 1992 single \"[[Informer (song)|Informer]]\". The song was written by Daddy Yankee, Snow, Michael Grier, Edmond Leary, MC Shan, Terri Moltke, and Play-N-Skillz, and was produced by American production duo [[Play-N-Skillz]] and co-produced by David \"Scott Summers\" Macias. A remix version featuring American singer [[Katy Perry]] was released on April 19, 2019.\n\nIt has been described as an [[uptempo]] [[reggaeton]] and [[dancehall]] song with lyrics about \"a woman who works her feminine charms and dances very well\". Commercially, the song topped the charts of 20 countries and reached the top 10 of 10 others. In the United States, it has topped the [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart for 14 weeks. Across Europe, the single peaked at number one in Czech Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Spain, and reached the top five in Belgium, Poland, and Switzerland.

His major compositions for choir and vocal soloists are mainly based on texts from the Bible or sacred themes. Old church music, especially [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] and [[Gregorian chant]]s, have had a major influence on his compositions.\n\n==Career==\nNystedt studied with [[Aaron Copland]] among others. He was the organist in the Torshov Church in Oslo from 1946 to 1982 and taught choir conducting at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1964 to 1985.\n\nNystedt founded and conducted the [[Det Norske Solistkor|Norwegian Soloists' Choir]] from 1950 to 1990. He also founded and conducted the [[Schola Cantorum (Norwegian choir)|Schola Cantorum]] from 1964 to 1985. The choir [[Ensemble 96]]  published \"Immortal Nystedt\" in 2005. This CD was nominated in two categories in the 2007 Grammy Awards and was the first Norwegian CD so nominated. It was also the first CD with a Norwegian composer nominated for a Grammy. On the occasion of his 90th birthday in 2005, there were several concerts around the world held in his honour.\n\nKey Nystedt works include the symphony ''Apocalypsis Joannis'' for soloists, choir and orchestra, op. 155 (1998), commissioned by the [[Oslo Philharmonic]]; ''Ode til mennesket'', op. 159 (2000), featuring texts by Sophocles, Hippocrates and Plato; ''The Word Became Flesh'', op. 162 (2001), commissioned by the Augsburg College Choir; and ''Reach Out For Peace'' for soprano, choir and orchestra, op. 164 A (2001), commissioned by the Ceciliaforeningen.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://musicnorway.no/artist/knut-nystedt/ |title= Bio from Music Norway |website= musicnorway.no |date= |accessdate=2016-12-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the King of Norway made Nystedt a Knight of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St Olav|Order of St. Olav]] in recognition of his contributions to Norwegian music,<ref name=ListenToNorwayBio/> and in 2002 the King made him a Commander of St. Olav. He received the [[Spellemannsprisen|Spellemann Award]] in 1978 for his album ''Contemporary Music From Norway'' and received the music prize of the [[Arts Council Norway]] in 1980.  In 1965, ''De Profundis'' was bestowed with the ''Work of the Year'' award of the [[Norwegian Society of Composers]]. Nystedt was awarded an honorary professorship ('Professor Honorario') by Mendoza University Argentina in 1991. In 2002 he received the ''Choir Prize of the Year'' from the Norwegian Choir Association and in 2005 the Artists' Prize by the City of [[Oslo]].\n\nMost of his compositions were published by Norsk Musikkforlag. His compositions also appear on several CDs in Norway and several other countries.\n<!--[[:Image:Nystedt-opusliste.pdf]]-->\n\n==Death==\nNystedt died in his sleep in Oslo on 8 December 2014 at the age of 99.<ref name=gnistrende/><ref name=minnesota/>\n\n== Works ==\n\n===Choral works===\n*''Landstad-kantate'', op. 27, cantata for mezzo-soprano, baritone, SATB choir and organ\n*''A hymn of human rights'', op. 95, for mixed choir, organ and percussion\n*[[Missa brevis (Nystedt)|Missa brevis]], op. 102 for mixed choir a cappella\n*''Adoro te'', op. 107, for mixed choir (SSAATTBB) a cappella\n*''[[Immortal Bach]]'', 1988\n*''A song as in the night'', op. 149, for soloists, choir, flute, strings and percussion\n*''Apocalypsis Joannis'', op. 155, symphony for soloists, choir and orchestra\n*''All the Ways of a Man'' for mixed choir (SATB) a cappella\n*''Astri, mi Astri'', Norwegian folk songs for mixed choir\n*''Christmas Carols'', for mixed choir and watches\n*''Cry Out and Shout'', for mixed choir SSATTB (Festival) a cappella\n*''But the Path of the Just'' for mixed choir\n*\"O Crux\" for choir a cappella (SSSAATTBB)\n\n===Concertante===\n*''Concerto Arctandriae'', op. 128 for strings\n*''Concerto for Horn and Orchestra'', op. 114\n*''Concerto Grosso'', op. 17b for three trumpets and organ/piano\n*''Concerto Sacro'', op. 137 for violin and organ\n\n===Orchestra works===\n*''Festival Overture'', op. 25\n\n===Organ solo===\n*''Exultate'', op. 74\n*''Le verbe eternel'', op. 133\n*''Pr\u00e9lude H\u00e9ro\u00efque'', op. 123\n*''Resurrexit'', op.68\n*''Suite d'orgue'', op. 84\n*''Toccata'', op. 9\n*''Tu es Petrus''\n*''Two Organ Pieces'' (from ''Apocalypsis Joannis'', op. 155)\n*''Amazing Grace''\n*''Beati''\n*''Variasjoner over folketonen \"Med Jesus vil eg fara\"'', op. 4\n*''Veni Creator Spiritus Partita'', op. 75\n\n== Discography ==\n* ''Contemporary Music From Norway'' (1967)\n* ''Contemporary Music From Norway'' (1968)\n* ''The Hindar String Quartet* - String Quartet No. 1 Op. 5 / String Quartet No. 4 Op. 56'' (1968)\n* ''Contemporary Music From Norway'' (1971)\n* ''Contemporary Music From Norway'' (1978)\n* The Norwegian Soloists' Choir, ''Knut Nystedt - Toner Julenatt'' (1980)\n* [[Oslo Philharmonic]], ''Knut Nystedt'' (1980)\n* Harald Herresthal, ''Knut Nystedt Suite D'Orgue Op. 84'' (1984)\n* Gunnar S\u00f8nstevold, Katja Medb\u00f8e, The Norwegian Soloist's Choir, S\u00e6tre Girl's Choir, The Norwegian Wind Quintet, Sandvika Big Band, B\u00e6rum Symphony Orchestra, ''Knut Nystedt \u2013 Litani I Atlanta'' (1985)\n* The Norwegian Soloists' Choir, ''A Hymn Of Human Rights'' (1986)\n* [[Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra]], ''Knut Nystedt \u2013 The Burnt Sacrifice Op. 36 - O.

One of them tells a story of how he exhumed a grave that is barely a month old on a stormy night. Ibarra then enters and asks for the grave of his father. One of the diggers replied that he dug the grave to put it to the Chinese Cemetery (a cemetery for heretics) by orders of a priest. This enraged Ibarra and the digger eventually told him that he had thrown the body to a river instead to the Chinese Cemetery. Ibarra leaves enraged as Pilosopo Tasyo enters, happily waiting for the upcoming storm. As the rain started to fall Pilosopo Tasyo noticed Basilio and Crispin. He said to them that they should go to their mother's house as she has prepared a wonderful dinner. However, shortly after this Crispin gets accused of theft by one of the priests and both of them are punished. Basilio escaped but is injured by a gunshot wound.

The news of Ibarra getting excommunicated and banished from San Diego greatly saddened her. Tiya Isabel, Sinang and Andeng consoles her. Kapitan Tiyago enters and announced in a woeful tone about Padre Damaso's order to break the engagement between Ibarra and Maria Clara, and instead making her marry with a young Spaniard named Alfonso Linares. Ibarra meanwhile talked to the governor-general to clear his name. He went to Maria Clara's place and proposed marriage.

Padre Damaso tries to console her. Maria Clara said if she was not able to marry Ibarra, she would either choose death or become a nun. Padre Damaso discourages her from becoming a nun, but as the firm determination of Maria Clara became apparent to him, Padre Damaso leaves her, feeling abjectly defeated and wounded to the core as he resigns his will to the inescapable ways of God.\n\nElias and Ibarra has just escaped from prison, and they visited Maria Clara through a window.

Basilio attempts to chase her mother until he became very tired. Sisa found the exhausted Basilio, and she immediately recognized him. The shock and overflowing joy is too much for her heart and she finally expires. Elias, mortally wounded, enters. He instructs Basilio to build a pyre to burn his (Elias) body and her mother to ashes. He also instructed him to dig the riches and jewelry buried nearby to use it for his studies. Elias lamented that he wouldn't see the light of tomorrow.
