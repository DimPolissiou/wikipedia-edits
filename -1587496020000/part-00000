After that incident in 2006, Kelly says that Ailes did not sexually harass her again. Then, in 2016, when [[Gretchen Carlson]] first made her sexual abuse allegations, Fox pressured Kelly to defend Ailes, which she refused to do.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/books/megyn-kelly-memoir-9-things-we-learned-about-roger-ailes-alleged-sexual-harassment|title=Megyn Kelly's Shocking Memoir: 9 Things We Learned About Roger Ailes' Alleged Sexual Harassment|date=November 16, 2016|work=People Magazine|author=Brittany King}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, after he left Fox News, he became an adviser to the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump campaign]], where he assisted with debate preparation.<ref>{{ cite web |first1=Maggie|last1=Haberman|first2=Ashley|last2=Parker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/us/politics/donald-trump-roger-ailes.html?_r=0 |title=Roger Ailes is advising Donald Trump ahead of Presidential election |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 16, 2016 |access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nAiles was married three times; his first two marriages ended in divorce.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Gabriel|title=The Revenge of Roger's Angels|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/how-fox-news-women-took-down-roger-ailes.html|access-date=December 20, 2016|agency=NY Mag|date=September 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe married his third wife Elizabeth Tilson (born 1960) on February 14, 1998.

As part of the [[British Invasion]], his [[hit record|hit]] song \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached number 8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1965.\n\nHe wrote several books on [[popular music]], beginning with ''[[After the Ball: Pop Music from Rag to Rock|After the Ball]]'', published by [[Penguin Books]] (Britain) and [[Simon & Schuster]] (United States) in 1972. He accompanied his singing by playing the [[ukulele]] and, through his [[gramophone record|records]], concerts, and film work, helped to stimulate the revival of interest in the instrument. His re-creation of the music played aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}} in [[Titanic (1997 film)|the film of that name]] won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1998 for package design and a nomination for Whitcomb's liner notes (''Titanic: Music as Heard on the Fateful Voyage'').\n\n==Early life==\nWhitcomb was born in [[Woking]], Surrey, England, and spent his childhood years in [[Scarborough]], [[Thorpeness]] and [[Putney]].<ref name=auto>[https://www.picklehead.com/ian/bio.htm  Ian Whitcomb Biography, ''Picklehead.com'']. Retrieved 20 April 2020</ref>  His father, Pat, worked for his father's film company British Screen Classics in the 1920s, eventually co-starring in ''Mr. Nobody'' (released by Fox in 1929). His father was a trained pianist and encouraged Whitcomb to also play piano. Growing up, Whitcomb's chief musical inspirations were [[Phil Harris]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]]. He was sent away to boarding school in 1949 (Newlands, Seaford, [[Sussex]]) at age 8 and there he soon formed a [[tissue paper-and-comb]] band to entertain staff and boys with current hits such as \"[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|Riders in the Sky]]\".\n\n==Music and writing career==\nAt [[Bryanston School|Bryanston]], a [[independent school (UK)|public school]] in Dorset, England, Whitcomb began writing comic and other songs.  He started a [[skiffle]] group in 1957 and then a [[rock and roll]] band in 1959. After leaving school, he worked at [[Harrods]], and then as an assistant at film studios.<ref name=auto/>  With his younger brother Robin on drums, he formed a band, The Ragtime Suwanee Six, that played at parties in the Surrey area and was managed by [[Denny Cordell]], later to produce records by [[Procol Harum]] and [[Joe Cocker]]. Robin went on to play [[tambourine]] on [[Sonny & Cher]]'s hit \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" (1965).\n\nAround 1963, while studying history at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Ian Whitcomb became a founding member and lead vocalist of Dublin's early [[rhythm and blues]] band, Bluesville.  After some unreleased early recordings, Whitcomb travelled to [[Seattle]], where he performed and was signed to record for [[Jerden Records]].  On returning to Dublin, he recorded \"This Sporting Life\", written by [[Brownie McGhee]] and previously recorded as a skiffle number by [[Chas McDevitt]].  Whitcomb's recording was then licensed to the [[Tower Records (record label)|Tower]] label, a subsidiary of [[Capitol Records]], for release in the US.  It reached number 100 for one week on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]].<ref name=irishrock>[https://www.irishrock.org/irodb/bands/bluesville.html  Ian Whitcomb & Bluesville, ''IrishRock.org''].

He returned to Dublin for his history finals and received a BA [[academic degree|degree]]. In 1966 he turned to early popular song: his version of a 1916 [[Al Jolson]] comedy number, \"Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday on Saturday Night?\" was a West Coast hit, reviving the ukulele before the emergence of [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].<ref name=Tranquada>{{cite book|last=Tranquada|first=Jim|title=The Ukulele \u2013 A History|year=2012|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-3634-4|pages=154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAfter making four albums for the Tower label, Whitcomb retired as a pop performer, later writing that he \"wanted no part of the growing pretentiousness of rock with its mandatory drugs and wishy-washy spiritualism and its increasing loud and metallic guitar sounds.\"<ref name=auto/>  However, in 1969 he produced [[Mae West]] on her album called ''[[Great Balls Of Fire (Mae West album)|Great Balls of Fire]]'' for [[MGM Records]].  Whitcomb then returned to the UK, and was commissioned by [[Penguin Books]] to write a history of pop music.  This was ''[[After the Ball: Pop Music from Rag to Rock|After the Ball]]'', published  in 1972. He later wrote ''Tin Pan Alley, A Pictorial History'' (1919\u20131939) and a novel, ''Lotusland: A Story of Southern California''.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Whitcomb starred in and wrote ''L.A.\u2013My Home Town'' (BBC TV; 1976) and ''Tin Pan Alley'' (PBS; 1974). He also provided the music for a documentary film, ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' (UA), which was narrated by [[Orson Welles]]. For Play-Rite Music he cut 18 piano rolls that were included in an album, ''Pianomelt''. His other albums reflected his research into the genres of [[ragtime]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]. These, beginning with ''Under the Ragtime Moon''  (1972), were released on several [[record label]]s including [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[United Artists]], and [[Decca Records]]. During that time he also wrote and produced singles for Warner Bros.' country division, most notably \"Hands\", a [[massage parlour]] story, and \"A Friend of a Friend of Mine\".\n\nIn the 1980s Whitcomb published ''Rock Odyssey: A Chronicle of the Sixties: Ian Whitcomb'', a memoir of the 1960s and described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the best personal account of this period.

19 April 2020) was an English entertainer, singer-songwriter, record producer, writer and actor. As part of the [[British Invasion]], his [[hit record|hit]] song \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached number 8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1965.\n\nHe wrote several books on [[popular music]], beginning with ''[[After the Ball: Pop Music from Rag to Rock|After the Ball]]'', published by [[Penguin Books]] (Britain) and [[Simon & Schuster]] (United States) in 1972. He accompanied his singing by playing the [[ukulele]] and, through his [[gramophone record|records]], concerts, and film work, helped to stimulate the revival of interest in the instrument. His re-creation of the music played aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}} in [[Titanic (1997 film)|the film of that name]] won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1998 for package design and a nomination for Whitcomb's liner notes (''Titanic: Music as Heard on the Fateful Voyage'').\n\n==Early life==\nWhitcomb was born in [[Woking]], Surrey, England, and spent his childhood years in [[Scarborough]], [[Thorpeness]] and [[Putney]].<ref name=auto>[https://www.picklehead.com/ian/bio.htm  Ian Whitcomb Biography, ''Picklehead.com'']. Retrieved 20 April 2020</ref>  His father, Pat, worked for his father's film company British Screen Classics in the 1920s, eventually co-starring in ''Mr. Nobody'' (released by Fox in 1929). His father was a trained pianist and encouraged Whitcomb to also play piano. Growing up, Whitcomb's chief musical inspirations were [[Phil Harris]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]]. He was sent away to boarding school in 1949 (Newlands, Seaford, [[Sussex]]) at age 8 and there he soon formed a [[tissue paper-and-comb]] band to entertain staff and boys with current hits such as \"[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|Riders in the Sky]]\".\n\n==Music and writing career==\nAt [[Bryanston School|Bryanston]], a [[independent school (UK)|public school]] in Dorset, England, Whitcomb began writing comic and other songs.  He started a [[skiffle]] group in 1957 and then a [[rock and roll]] band in 1959. After leaving school, he worked at [[Harrods]], and then as an assistant at film studios.<ref name=auto/>  With his younger brother Robin on drums, he formed a band, The Ragtime Suwanee Six, that played at parties in the Surrey area and was managed by [[Denny Cordell]], later to produce records by [[Procol Harum]] and [[Joe Cocker]]. Robin went on to play [[tambourine]] on [[Sonny & Cher]]'s hit \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" (1965).\n\nAround 1963, while studying history at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Ian Whitcomb became a founding member and lead vocalist of Dublin's early [[rhythm and blues]] band, Bluesville.  After some unreleased early recordings, Whitcomb travelled to [[Seattle]], where he performed and was signed to record for [[Jerden Records]].  After returning to Dublin, he recorded \"This Sporting Life\", written by [[Brownie McGhee]] and previously recorded as a skiffle number by [[Chas McDevitt]].  Whitcomb's recording was then licensed to the [[Tower Records (record label)|Tower]] label, a subsidiary of [[Capitol Records]], for release in the US.  It reached number 100 for one week on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]].<ref name=irishrock>[https://www.irishrock.org/irodb/bands/bluesville.html  Ian Whitcomb & Bluesville, ''IrishRock.org''].

Whitcomb played the [[Hollywood Bowl]] with [[The Beach Boys]] in 1965 and then toured with [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]], and [[Sam the Sham]] and the Pharaohs.<ref name=auto/>\n\n\"N-E-R-V-O-U-S!\", Whitcomb's next release, was recorded in Hollywood and reached No. 59 in ''Billboard'' and No. 47 in ''[[Cash Box]]''. He returned to Dublin for his history finals and received a BA [[academic degree|degree]]. In 1966 he turned to early popular song: his version of a 1916 [[Al Jolson]] comedy number, \"Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday on Saturday Night?\" was a West Coast hit, reviving the ukulele before the emergence of [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].<ref name=Tranquada>{{cite book|last=Tranquada|first=Jim|title=The Ukulele \u2013 A History|year=2012|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-3634-4|pages=154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAfter making four albums for the Tower label, Whitcomb retired as a pop performer, later writing that he \"wanted no part of the growing pretentiousness of rock with its mandatory drugs and wishy-washy spiritualism and its increasing loud and metallic guitar sounds.\"<ref name=auto/>  However, in 1969 he produced [[Mae West]] on her album called ''[[Great Balls Of Fire (Mae West album)|Great Balls of Fire]]'' for [[MGM Records]].  Whitcomb then returned to the UK, and was commissioned by [[Penguin Books]] to write a history of pop music.  This was ''[[After the Ball: Pop Music from Rag to Rock|After the Ball]]'', published  in 1972. He later wrote ''Tin Pan Alley, A Pictorial History'' (1919\u20131939) and a novel, ''Lotusland: A Story of Southern California''.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Whitcomb starred in and wrote ''L.A.\u2013My Home Town'' (BBC TV; 1976) and ''Tin Pan Alley'' (PBS; 1974). He also provided the music for a documentary film, ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' (UA), which was narrated by [[Orson Welles]]. For Play-Rite Music he cut 18 piano rolls that were included in an album, ''Pianomelt''. His other albums reflected his research into the genres of [[ragtime]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]].

{"title_page": "Hall's marriage theorem", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], '''Hall's marriage theorem''', proved by {{harvs|txt|first=Philip|last=Hall|authorlink=Philip Hall|year=1935}}, is a theorem with two equivalent formulations:\n* The [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] formulation deals with a collection of [[Finite set|finite]] [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. It gives a necessary and sufficient condition for being able to select a distinct element from each set.\n* The [[Graph theory|graph theoretic]] formulation deals with a [[bipartite graph]]. It gives a necessary and sufficient condition for finding a [[matching (graph theory)|matching]] that covers at least one side of the graph.\n\n== Combinatorial formulation ==\n\nLet <math>S</math> be a (possibly infinite) [[Family of sets|family]] of finite [[subset]]s of <math>X</math>, where the members of <math>S</math> are [[multiplicity (mathematics)|counted with multiplicity]]. (That is, <math>S</math> may contain the same set several times.)<ref>{{harvnb|Hall, Jr.|1986|loc=pg. 51}}. It is also possible to have infinite sets in the family, but the number of sets in the family must then be finite, counted with multiplicity. Only the situation of having an infinite number of sets while allowing infinite sets is not allowed.</ref>\n\nA '''[[Transversal (combinatorics)|transversal]]''' for <math>S</math> is the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of an [[injective function]] <math>f</math> from <math>S</math> to <math>X</math> such that <math>f(s)</math> is an element of the set <math>s</math> for every <math>s</math> in the family <math>S</math>. In other words, <math>f</math> selects one representative from each set in <math>S</math> in such a way that no two sets from <math>S</math> get the same representative.

For each woman, there is a subset of the men, any one of which she would happily marry; and any man would be happy to marry a woman who wants to marry him.  Consider whether it is possible to pair up (in [[marriage]]) the men and women so that every person is happy.\n\nIf we let ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> be the set of men that the ''i''-th woman would be happy to marry, then the marriage theorem states that each woman can happily marry a man if and only if the collection of sets {''A''<sub>''i''</sub>} meets the marriage condition.\n\nNote that the marriage condition is that, for any subset <math>I</math> of the women, the number of men whom at least one of the women would be happy to marry, <math>|\\bigcup_{i \\in I} A_i|</math>, be at least as big as the number of women in that subset, <math>|I|</math>.  It is obvious that this condition is ''necessary'', as if it does not hold, there are not enough men to share among the <math>I</math> women.  What is interesting is that it is also a ''sufficient'' condition.\n\n== Graph theoretic formulation ==\n[[File:Halls theorem matching graph theory2.svg|thumb|blue edges represent a matching]]\nLet ''G'' be a finite [[bipartite graph]] with bipartite sets ''X'' and ''Y'' (i.e. ''G'' := (''X''&thinsp;+{{space|hair}}''Y'', ''E'')).  An ''X''-saturating matching is a [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]] which covers every vertex in ''X''.\n\nFor a subset ''W'' of ''X'', let ''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''W'') denote the [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighborhood]] of ''W'' in ''G'', i.e. the set of all vertices in ''Y'' [[Adjacent (graph theory)|adjacent]] to some element of ''W''.  The marriage theorem in this formulation states that there is an ''X''-saturating matching [[if and only if]] for every subset ''W'' of ''X'':\n\n:<math>|W| \\leq |N_G(W)|.</math>\nIn other words: every subset ''W'' of ''X'' has sufficiently many adjacent vertices in ''Y''.\n\n=== Proof of the graph theoretic version ===\n\n'''Easy direction''': we assume that some matching ''M'' saturates every vertex of ''X'', and prove that Hall's condition is satisfied for all ''W'' \u2286 ''X''. Let ''M''(''W'') denote the set of all vertices in ''Y'' matched by ''M'' to a given ''W''.  By definition of a matching, |''M''(''W'')| = |''W''|. But ''M''(''W'') \u2286 ''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''W''), since all elements of ''M''(''W'') are neighbours of ''W''. So, |N<sub>''G''</sub>(''W'')| \u2265 |''M''(''W'')| and hence, |N<sub>''G''</sub>(''W'')| \u2265 |''W''|.\n\n'''Hard direction''': we assume that there is no ''X''-saturating matching and prove that Hall's condition is violated for at least one ''W'' \u2286 ''X''.  Let ''M'' be a maximum matching, and ''u'' a vertex not saturated by ''M''. Consider all ''alternating paths'' (i.e., paths in ''G'' alternately using edges outside and inside ''M'') starting from ''u''. Let the set of all points in ''Y'' connected to ''u'' by these alternating paths be ''Z'', and the set of all points in ''X'' connected to ''u'' by these alternating paths (including ''u'' itself) be ''W''. No maximal alternating path can end in a vertex in ''Y'', lest it would be an ''augmenting path'', so that we could augment ''M'' to a strictly larger matching by toggling the status (belongs to ''M'' or not) of all the edges of the path. Thus every vertex in ''Z'' is matched by M to a vertex in ''W'' \\{{Hair space}}{''u''}. Conversely, every vertex ''v'' in ''W'' \\{{Hair space}}{''u''} is matched by ''M'' to a vertex in ''Z'' (namely, the vertex preceding ''v'' on an alternating path ending at ''v''). Thus, ''M'' provides a bijection of ''W'' \\{{Hair space}}{''u''} and ''Z'', which implies |''W''| = |''Z''|&thinsp;+&thinsp;1. On the other hand, ''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''W'') \u2286 ''Z'': let ''v'' in ''Y'' be connected to a vertex ''w'' in ''W''. If the edge (''w'',''v'') is in ''M'', then ''v'' is in ''Z'' by the previous part of the proof, otherwise we can take an alternating path ending in ''w'' and extend it with ''v'', getting an augmenting path and showing that ''v'' is in ''Z''. Hence,  |N<sub>''G''</sub>(''W'')| \u2264 |''Z''| = |''W''|&thinsp;\u2212&thinsp;1 < |''W''|.\n\n=== Constructive proof of the hard direction ===\nDefine a [[Hall violator]] as a subset ''W'' of X for which |N<sub>''G''</sub>(''W'')| < |''W''|. If ''W'' is a Hall violator, then there is no matching that saturates all vertices of ''W''. Therefore, there is also no matching that saturates ''X''. Hall's marriage theorem says that a graph contains an ''X''-saturating matching if and only if it contains no Hall violators.  The following algorithm proves the hard direction of the theorem: it finds either an ''X''-saturating matching or a Hall violator.  It uses, as a subroutine, an algorithm that, given a matching ''M'' and an unmatched vertex ''x''<sub>0</sub>, either finds an ''M''-augmenting path or a Hall violator containing ''x''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nIt uses \n\n# Initialize ''M'' := {}. // Empty matching.\n#Assert: ''M'' is a matching in ''G''.\n# If ''M'' saturates all vertices of ''X,'' then '''return the ''X''-saturating matching ''M'''''.\n# Let ''x''<sub>0</sub> be an unmatched vertex (a vertex in ''X'' \\ V(''M'')).\n# Using the [[Hall violator]] algorithm, find either a Hall violator or an ''M''-augmenting path.\n#In the first case, '''return the Hall violator'''.\n#In the second case, use the ''M''-augmenting path to increase the size of ''M'' (by one edge), and '''go back to step 2'''.\n\nAt each iteration, ''M'' grows by one edge. Hence, this algorithm must end after at most |''E''| iterations. Each iteration takes at most |''X''| time. The total runtime complexity is similar to the Ford-Fulkerson method for finding a [[maximum cardinality matching]].\n\n=== Equivalence of the combinatorial formulation and the graph-theoretic formulation ===\n\nLet ''S'' = (''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>) where the ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> are finite sets which need not be distinct. Let the set ''X'' = {''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>} (that is, the set of names of the elements of ''S'') and the set ''Y'' be the union of all the elements in all the ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>.\n\nWe form a finite [[bipartite graph]] ''G'' := (''X''&thinsp;+{{space|hair}}''Y'', ''E''),  with bipartite sets ''X'' and ''Y'' by joining any element in ''Y'' to each ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> which it is a member of. A transversal of ''S'' is an ''X''-saturating [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]] (a matching which covers every vertex in ''X'') of the bipartite graph ''G''. Thus a problem in the combinatorial formulation can be easily translated to a problem in the graph-theoretic formulation.\n\n==Applications==\nThe theorem has many other interesting \"non-marital\" applications. For example, take a [[Playing card|standard deck of cards]], and deal them out into 13 piles of 4 cards each.  Then, using the marriage theorem, we can show that it is always possible to select exactly 1 card from each pile, such that the 13 selected cards contain exactly one card of each rank (Ace, 2, 3, ..., Queen, King).\n\nMore abstractly, let ''G'' be a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], and ''H'' be a finite [[subgroup]] of ''G''. Then the marriage theorem can be used to show that there is a set ''T'' such that ''T'' is a transversal for both the set of left [[coset]]s and right cosets of ''H'' in ''G''.\n\nThe marriage theorem is used in the usual proofs of the fact that an (''r'' &times; ''n'') [[Latin rectangle]] can always be extended to an ((''r''&thinsp;+1) &times; ''n'') Latin rectangle when ''r'' < ''n'', and so, ultimately to a [[Latin square]].\n\n== Logical equivalences ==\n\nThis theorem is part of a collection of remarkably powerful theorems in combinatorics, all of which are related to each other in an informal sense in that it is more straightforward to prove one of these theorems from another of them than from first principles.

This variant is:<ref>{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=pg.90}}</ref>\n\nSuppose that (''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>), where the ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> are finite sets that need not be distinct, is a family of sets satisfying the marriage condition, and suppose that |''A''<sub>i</sub>| \u2265 ''r'' for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''. Then the number of different transversals for the family is at least ''r''! if ''r'' \u2264 ''n'' and ''r''(''r'' \u2212 1) ... (''r'' \u2212 ''n'' + 1) if ''r'' > ''n''.\n\nRecall that a transversal for a family ''S'' is an ordered sequence, so two different transversals could have exactly the same elements. For instance, the family ''A''<sub>1</sub> = {1, 2, 3}, ''A''<sub>2</sub> = {1, 2, 5} has both (1, 2) and (2, 1) as distinct transversals.\n\n===Marriage condition does not extend===\nThe following example, due to Marshall Hall, Jr., shows that the marriage condition will not guarantee the existence of a transversal in an infinite family in which infinite sets are allowed.\n\nLet ''S'' be the family,  ''A''<sub>0</sub> = {1, 2, 3, ...}, ''A''<sub>1</sub> = {1}, ''A''<sub>2</sub> = {2}, ..., ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> = {''i''{{space|hair}}}, ...\n\nThe marriage condition holds for this infinite family, but no transversal can be constructed.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall, Jr.|1986|loc=pg. 51}}</ref>\n\nThe more general problem of selecting a (not necessarily distinct) element from each of a collection of [[Empty set|non-empty]] sets (without restriction as to the number of sets or the size of the sets) is permitted in general only if the [[axiom of choice]] is accepted.\n\nThe marriage theorem does extend to the infinite case if stated properly. Given a bipartite graph with sides ''A'' and ''B'', we say that a subset ''C'' of ''B'' is smaller than or equal in size to a subset ''D'' of ''A'' ''in the graph'' if there exists an injection in the graph (namely, using only edges of the graph) from ''C'' to ''D'', and that it is strictly smaller in the graph if in addition there is no injection in the graph in the other direction. Note that omitting ''in the graph'' yields the ordinary notion of comparing cardinalities. The infinite marriage theorem states that there exists an injection from ''A'' to ''B'' in the graph, if and only if there is no subset ''C'' of ''A'' such that ''N''(''C'') is strictly smaller than ''C'' in the graph.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aharoni|first=Ron|date=February 1984|title=K\u00f6nig's Duality Theorem for Infinite Bipartite Graphs|journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society|volume=s2-29|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1112/jlms/s2-29.1.1|issn=0024-6107}}</ref>\n\n== General graphs ==\nA generalization of Hall's theorem to general graphs (that are not necessarily bipartite) is provided by the [[Tutte theorem]].\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation|first=Richard A.|last=Brualdi|title=Introductory Combinatorics|publisher=Prentice-Hall/Pearson|place=Upper Saddle River, NJ|year=2010|isbn=978-0-13-602040-0}}\n*{{Citation|first=Peter J.|last=Cameron|title=Combinatorics: Topics, Techniques, Algorithms|publisher= Cambridge University Press|place=Cambridge|year=1994|isbn=978-0-521-45761-3}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Dongchen | first1=Jiang | last2=Nipkow | first2=Tobias | author2-link=Tobias Nipkow|title=Hall's Marriage Theorem | journal=The Archive of Formal Proofs | year=2010 | url=http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Marriage.shtml | issn=2150-914X | postscript=.

Let ''M'' be a maximum matching, and ''u'' a vertex not saturated by M. Consider all ''alternating paths'' (i.e., paths in ''G'' alternately using edges outside and inside M) starting from ''u''. Let the set of all points in ''Y'' connected to ''u'' by these alternating paths be ''Z'', and the set of all points in ''X'' connected to ''u'' by these alternating paths (including ''u'' itself) be ''W''. No maximal alternating path can end in a vertex in ''Y'', lest it would be an ''augmenting path'', so that we could augment M to a strictly larger matching by toggling the status (belongs to ''M'' or not) of all the edges of the path. Thus every vertex in ''Z'' is matched by M to a vertex in ''W'' \\{{Hair space}}{''u''}. Conversely, every vertex ''v'' in ''W'' \\{{Hair space}}{''u''} is matched by M to a vertex in ''Z'' (namely, the vertex preceding ''v'' on an alternating path ending at ''v''). Thus, M provides a bijection of ''W'' \\{{Hair space}}{''u''} and ''Z'', which implies |''W''| = |''Z''| + 1. On the other hand, N<sub>''G''</sub>(''W'') \u2286 ''Z'': let ''v'' in ''Y'' be connected to a vertex ''w'' in ''W''. If the edge (''w'',''v'') is in M, then ''v'' is in ''Z'' by the previous part of the proof, otherwise we can take an alternating path ending in ''w'' and extend it with ''v'', getting an augmenting path and showing that ''v'' is in ''Z''. Hence,  |N<sub>''G''</sub>(''W'')| \u2264 |''Z''| = |''W''| \u2212 1 < |''W''|.\n\n=== Constructive proof of the hard direction ===\nDefine a [[Hall violator]] as a subset ''W'' of X for which |N<sub>''G''</sub>(''W'')| < |''W''|. If W is a Hall violator, then there is no matching that saturates all vertices of W. Therefore, there is also no matching that saturates X. Hall's marriage theorem says that a graph contains an X-saturating matching if-and-only-if it contains no Hall violators.  The following algorithm proves the hard direction of the theorem: it finds either an X-saturating matching or a Hall violator.  It uses, as a subroutine, an algorithm that, given a matching ''M'' and an unmatched vertex ''x''<sub>0</sub>, either finds an ''M''-augmenting path or a Hall violator containing ''x''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nIt uses \n\n# Initialize ''M'' := {}. // Empty matching.\n#Assert: ''M'' is a matching in ''G''.\n# If ''M'' saturates all vertices of ''X,'' then '''return the ''X''-saturating matching ''M'''''.\n# Let ''x''<sub>0</sub> be an unmatched vertex (a vertex in ''X'' \\ V(M)).\n# Using the [[Hall violator]] algorithm, find either a Hall violator or an ''M''-augmenting path.\n#In the first case, '''return the Hall violator'''.\n#In the second case, use the ''M''-augmenting path to increase the size of ''M'' (by one edge), and '''go back to step 2'''.\n\nAt each iteration, ''M'' grows by one edge. Hence, this algorithm must end after at most |''E''| iterations. Each iteration takes at most |''X''| time. The total runtime complexity is similar to the Ford-Fulkerson method for finding a [[maximum cardinality matching]].\n\n=== Equivalence of the combinatorial formulation and the graph-theoretic formulation ===\n\nLet ''S'' = (''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>n</sub>) where the ''A''<sub>i</sub> are finite sets which need not be distinct. Let the set ''X'' = {''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>n</sub>} (that is, the set of names of the elements of ''S'') and the set ''Y'' be the union of all the elements in all the ''A''<sub>i</sub>.\n\nWe form a finite [[bipartite graph]] ''G'' := (''X'' + ''Y'', ''E''),  with bipartite sets ''X'' and ''Y'' by joining any element in ''Y'' to each ''A''<sub>i</sub> which it is a member of. A transversal of ''S'' is an [[matching (graph theory)|''X''-saturating matching]] (a matching which covers every vertex in ''X'') of the bipartite graph ''G''. Thus a problem in the combinatorial formulation can be easily translated to a problem in the graph-theoretic formulation.\n\n==Applications==\nThe theorem has many other interesting \"non-marital\" applications. For example, take a [[Playing card|standard deck of cards]], and deal them out into 13 piles of 4 cards each.  Then, using the marriage theorem, we can show that it is always possible to select exactly 1 card from each pile, such that the 13 selected cards contain exactly one card of each rank (Ace, 2, 3, ..., Queen, King).\n\nMore abstractly, let ''G'' be a [[group (mathematics)|group]], and ''H'' be a finite [[subgroup]] of ''G''. Then the marriage theorem can be used to show that there is a set ''T'' such that ''T'' is a transversal for both the set of left [[coset]]s and right cosets of ''H'' in ''G''.\n\nThe marriage theorem is used in the usual proofs of the fact that an (r &times; n) [[Latin rectangle]] can always be extended to an ((r+1) &times; n) Latin rectangle when r < n, and so, ultimately to a [[Latin square]].\n\n== Logical equivalences ==\n\nThis theorem is part of a collection of remarkably powerful theorems in combinatorics, all of which are related to each other in an informal sense in that it is more straightforward to prove one of these theorems from another of them than from first principles. These include:\n\n* The [[K\u00f6nig\u2013Egerv\u00e1ry theorem]] (1931) ([[D\u00e9nes K\u0151nig]], [[Jen\u0151 Egerv\u00e1ry]])\n* K\u00f6nig's theorem<ref>The naming of this theorem is inconsistent in the literature. There is the result concerning matchings in bipartite graphs and its interpretation as a covering of (0,1)-matrices. {{harvtxt|Hall, Jr.|1986}} and {{harvtxt|van Lint|Wilson|1992}} refer to the matrix form as K\u00f6nig's theorem, while {{harvtxt|Roberts|Tesman|2009}} refer to this version as the K\u0151nig-Egerv\u00e1ry theorem. The bipartite graph version is called K\u0151nig's theorem by {{harvtxt|Cameron|1994}} and {{harvtxt|Roberts|Tesman|2009}}.</ref>\n* [[Menger's theorem]] (1927)\n* The [[max-flow min-cut theorem]] (Ford\u2013Fulkerson algorithm)\n* The [[Birkhoff\u2013Von Neumann theorem]] (1946)\n* [[Dilworth's theorem]].\n\nIn particular,<ref>[http://robertborgersen.info/Presentations/GS-05R-1.pdf Equivalence of seven major theorems in combinatorics]</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Reichmeider|1984}}</ref> there are simple proofs of the implications Dilworth's theorem \u21d4 Hall's theorem \u21d4 K\u00f6nig\u2013Egerv\u00e1ry theorem \u21d4 K\u00f6nig's theorem.\n\n== Infinite families ==\n\n=== Marshall Hall Jr. variant ===\nBy examining [[Philip Hall]]'s original proof carefully, [[Marshall Hall (mathematician)|Marshall Hall, Jr.]] (no relation to Philip Hall) was able to tweak the result in a way that permitted the proof to work for infinite ''S''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall, Jr.|1986|loc=pg. 51}}</ref> This variant refines the marriage theorem and provides a lower bound on the number of transversals that a given ''S'' may have. This variant is:<ref>{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=pg.90}}</ref>\n\nSuppose that (''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>n</sub>), where the ''A''<sub>i</sub> are finite sets that need not be distinct, is a family of sets satisfying the marriage condition, and suppose that |''A''<sub>i</sub>| \u2265 ''r'' for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''. Then the number of different transversals for the family is at least ''r''! if ''r'' \u2264 ''n'' and ''r''(''r'' - 1) ... (''r'' - ''n'' +1) if ''r'' > ''n''.\n\nRecall that a transversal for a family ''S'' is an ordered sequence, so two different transversals could have exactly the same elements. For instance, the family ''A''<sub>1</sub> = {1,2,3}, ''A''<sub>2</sub> = {1, 2, 5} has both (1, 2) and (2, 1) as distinct transversals.\n\n===Marriage condition does not extend===\nThe following example, due to Marshall Hall, Jr., shows that the marriage condition will not guarantee the existence of a transversal in an infinite family in which infinite sets are allowed.\n\nLet ''S'' be the family,  ''A''<sub>0</sub> = {1, 2, 3, ...}, ''A''<sub>1</sub> = {1}, ''A''<sub>2</sub> = {2}, ..., ''A''<sub>i</sub> = {i}, ...\n\nThe marriage condition holds for this infinite family, but no transversal can be constructed.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall, Jr.|1986|loc=pg. 51}}</ref>\n\nThe more general problem of selecting a (not necessarily distinct) element from each of a collection of non-empty sets (without restriction as to the number of sets or the size of the sets) is permitted in general only if the [[axiom of choice]] is accepted.\n\nThe marriage theorem does extend to the infinite case if stated properly. Given a bipartite graph with sides ''A'' and ''B'', we say that a subset ''C'' of ''B'' is smaller than or equal in size to a subset ''D'' of ''A'' ''in the graph'' if there exists an injection in the graph (namely, using only edges of the graph) from ''C'' to ''D'', and that it is strictly smaller in the graph if in addition there is no injection in the graph in the other direction. Note that omitting ''in the graph'' yields the ordinary notion of comparing cardinalities. The infinite marriage theorem states that there exists an injection from ''A'' to ''B'' in the graph, if and only if there is no subset ''C'' of ''A'' such that ''N(C)'' is strictly smaller than ''C'' in the graph.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aharoni|first=Ron|date=February 1984|title=K\u00f6nig's Duality Theorem for Infinite Bipartite Graphs|journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society|volume=s2-29|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1112/jlms/s2-29.1.1|issn=0024-6107}}</ref>\n\n== General graphs ==\nA generalization of Hall's theorem to general graphs (that are not necessarily bipartite) is provided by the [[Tutte theorem]].\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation|first=Richard A.|last=Brualdi|title=Introductory Combinatorics|publisher=Prentice-Hall/Pearson|place=Upper Saddle River, NJ|year=2010|isbn=978-0-13-602040-0}}\n*{{Citation|first=Peter J.|last=Cameron|title=Combinatorics: Topics, Techniques, Algorithms|publisher= Cambridge University Press|place=Cambridge|year=1994|isbn=978-0-521-45761-3}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Dongchen | first1=Jiang | last2=Nipkow | first2=Tobias | author2-link=Tobias Nipkow|title=Hall's Marriage Theorem | journal=The Archive of Formal Proofs | year=2010 | url=http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Marriage.shtml | issn=2150-914X | postscript=.
