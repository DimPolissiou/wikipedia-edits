It hosted the 1992 World Wrestling Championships, the [[World Games 2013|ninth edition]] of the [[World Games]] in 2013, the [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships]] in 2014 and the [[IAAF World Youth Championships in Athletics|World Youth Championships in Athletics]] in 2015. The city is to host the first ever [[2021 Junior Pan American Games|Junior Pan American Games]] in 2021.\n\n==Etymology==\nCali is the shortened form of the official name of the city: Santiago de Cali. \"Santiago\" honours [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] whose [[feast day]] is celebrated on 25 July. The origin of the word \"Cali\" comes from the local Amerindians the \"[[Calima culture|Calima]]\".\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Cali}}\n\n===Pre-Columbian<!--This is NOT a typo. Before Christopher Columbus, not before Colombia --> era and settlers===\n\n[[File:Calima - Ceremonial Tweezers - Walters 57262.jpg|thumb|Calima culture gold ceremonial tweezers from [[Walters Art Museum]].]]\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spaniards, the region was inhabited by indigenous tribes, mostly speakers of [[Cariban languages]]. In the region between the [[Cauca River]] and the Western Cordillera, the Gorrones established themselves between the present day [[Roldanillo]] and Santiago de Cali. The biggest town of the Morrones was sited on the River Pescador near the present-day towns of [[Zarzal]] and [[Bugalagrande]]. The Morrones traded with the [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbayas]] who inhabited the north of the [[Valle del Cauca]].\n\nOn his way to Cali, [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]] first met the Timbas who ran away before the arrival of the men, leaving behind gold. After the Timbas, towards the north, the Spaniards entered the territory of the chief Jamund\u00ed and his tribe, the Jamund\u00edes, between the rivers Pance and [[Jamund\u00ed]]. This tribe offered a strong resistance to the invaders, fighting with poisonous darts and arrows against the [[arquebus]]es and swords of the Spaniards. Eventually, the Spanish prevailed in the struggle over the central valley.\n\nBefore taking control over the region, the Spaniards had to defeat the chief Petecuy, whose tribe inhabited the area between the river Lil\u00ed and the Western Cordillera. Petecuy formed a big army with many tribes and fought the Spaniards on [[Holy Tuesday]] of 1536. The natives lost to the Spaniards and the region was divided in ''[[encomienda]]s''.\n\nSantiago de Cali was important for Belalc\u00e1zar because it was outside the [[Inca empire]]. After the capture and execution of the Inca [[Atahualpa]] at [[Cajamarca]], [[Francisco Pizarro]] had sent Belalc\u00e1zar to take possession of [[Guayaquil]] and Quito on his behalf, but Cali, being outside the Quechua empire, was claimed by Belalcazar as his own territory. After his death, his descendants maintained possession of much of the land until the [[Patria Boba|war of independence against Spain]].\n\n===Founding and colonial period===\n[[File:Sebastian de belalcazar fundador.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]].]]\n[[File:La Merced.JPG|170px|right|200px|thumb|La Merced.]]\nThe founder of Cali, [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]], came to the American continent in the third voyage made by Columbus in 1498. In 1532, after serving in [[Dari\u00e9n Province|Dari\u00e9n]] and [[Nicaragua]], he joined [[Francisco Pizarro]] in the conquest of [[Per\u00fa]]. In 1534, Belalc\u00e1zar separated from Pizarro's expedition to find the city of [[Quito]], and later in his search of [[El Dorado]] he entered the territory of what is now Colombia, founding the cities of [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]] and [[Popay\u00e1n]].\n\nBelalc\u00e1zar founded Santiago de Cali on 25 July 1536, a few kilometres north of its present location, near what are now the towns of [[Vijes]] and [[Riofr\u00edo, Valle del Cauca|Riofr\u00edo]]. Under the orders of Belalc\u00e1zar, captain Miguel Mu\u00f1oz moved the city to its present location in 1537, where the chaplain Brother Santos de A\u00f1asco celebrated a mass in the place occupied by the Church La Merced today, and Belalc\u00e1zar designated Pedro de Ayala as the first municipal authority.\n\nDuring the ''Colonia'' (colonial period), Santiago de Cali was part of the ''gobernaci\u00f3n'' of Popay\u00e1n, which was part of [[Quito]]'s Audiencia. Although initially Cali was the capital of Popay\u00e1n's ''gobernaci\u00f3n'', Belalc\u00e1zar moved this function to Popay\u00e1n in 1540, owing to \"better\" weather there.\n\nUntil the 18th century most of the territory of what is now Santiago de Cali was occupied by haciendas (cattle farms and plantations of food, with some sugar cane), and the city was only a small town near the [[Cali River]]. In 1793, Santiago de Cali had 6,548 inhabitants, 1,106 of whom were (African) slaves. The haciendas were the property of the dominant noble class with many slaves dedicated mostly to stockbreeding and raising sugar cane crops. Many of these haciendas became zone of the present city like Ca\u00f1averalejo, Chipichape, Pasoancho, Arroyohondo, Ca\u00f1asgordas, Limonar and Mel\u00e9ndez. Santiago de Cali was strategically positioned for trade, centrally located in relation to the mining regions of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Department of Choc\u00f3|Choc\u00f3]], and Popay\u00e1n. In the colonial period, the first trail for mules and horses between Santiago de Cali and the port of [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]] was completed.\n\n===Independence===\nOn 3 July 1810, Santiago de Cali refused to recognize the [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Council of Regency]] of Spain, and established its own junta. This local uprising predates the national one in [[Bogot\u00e1]] by 17 days.<ref>Mendoza Neira, Plinio, ed. ''Cali: La sultana del Valle'' (Librer\u00eda Colombiana Camacho Rold\u00e1n, 1962).</ref> The Governor of [[Popay\u00e1n]], [[Miguel Tac\u00f3n y Rosique|Miguel Tac\u00f3n]] organized an army to control the uprising. The people from Cali called for help to the \"Junta Suprema\" in Bogot\u00e1, which sent a contingent under colonel Antonio Baraya to support the independence cause. For mutual defense, Cali also formed, with Anserma, [[Cartago, Colombia|Cartago]], Toro, [[Buga, Valle del Cauca|Buga]] and Caloto, the Confederated cities of the Cauca Valley, which [[Patria Boba|declared independence]] from the [[Governorate]] of Popay\u00e1n on 1 February 1811, although they continued to recognize the absent [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] as their [[head of state]]. On 28 March 1811 in the battle of Bajo Palac\u00e9, the first in Colombia's Independence, the royalist Spanish army was defeated by the revolutionary army commanded by colonel Antonio Baraya with a detachment of 120 soldiers from his native Cundinamarca and a huge garrison of 1.080 men from Valle del Cauca led by brothers [[Miguel and Francisco Cabal Barona]].<ref>Zawadzky C., Alfonso, ''Comentario al libro'' Las Ciudades Confederadas del Valle del Cauca en 1811. Bogot\u00e1, Editorial Librer\u00eda Voluntad, S.A., 1943.</ref>\n\nIn the following years there were many battles between royalists and local militia. After having been released from captivity by Napoleon, Ferdinand VII sent a large army under the command of the \"''Pacificador''\" (Pacifier) [[Pablo Morillo]] who restored royalist rule in the area by 1816.\n\nIn 1819 after [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] defeated the bulk of the royalist army in the [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1]], there were new uprisings in the Valle del Cauca and the [[Criollo people|Criollos]] took control permanently. In 1822 Bol\u00edvar arrived in Santiago de Cali. The city was an important military outpost and the region contributed many men to the war of independence that liberated the nations in the south.\n\n===Modernism===\n[[File:Cali theatre.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Municipal Theater]]\n[[File:Mapa-cali-1880s-WEB.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Map of Cali in about 1882\u20131884, Spanish edition.]]\nIn the 19th century Cali, capital of the Valley of the Cauca department, was a quiet community with no more than 20,000 inhabitants. The urban center of the city was around the neighborhoods of Altozano and San Antonio.\n\nOutside the city there were [[mango]] plantations, pastures and communal land that were transferred from the Spanish Crown to the working classes. From the market gardens on this land the city was supplied with food. The economy centered around livestock, sugar cane, [[panela]] (jaggery; a sugar derivative), cheese and gold mined in the Pacific. There was also a growing industrial and financial sector.\n\nJewish entrepreneurs came during the 18th and 19th centuries and achieved prominent positions in the city. Some married local women and felt they had to diminish or abandon their identity. These included the De Lima, Salazar, Espinoza, Arias, Ramirez, Perez and Lobo families from the Caribbean, as well as the author [[Jorge Isaacs]] of English Jewish ancestry, and the industrialist [[James Martin Eder]] (who adopted the more Christian name of Santiago Eder when he translated his name to Spanish) born into the [[Latvian Jew]]ish community. Over the generations most of their descendants were raised as secular Christians.\n\n{{Multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 180\n | image1 = . V. de Valenzuela, R.

This spurred commercial development and it transformed into the Plaza Mayor or Plaza de Caycedo. In 1921, the market was sold to the Cali municipality. Very close to the 9th street was the principal station of the ''[[Tram|tranvia]]'' of Cali, a system of public transportation that linked the city with suburban areas.\n\n===Recent history===\nOn 7 August 1956 at around 1&nbsp;a.m., seven [[Colombian army]] trucks filled with 42 [[ton]]s of [[dynamite]] exploded near the train station, destroying eight city blocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museonacional.gov.co/cali.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610223111/http://www.museonacional.gov.co/cali.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 June 2007 |publisher=Museo Nacional de Colombia |title=Cali, la explosi\u00f3n de 1956: cat\u00e1strofe hist\u00f3rica}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Agosto072006/cali3.html |newspaper=El Pa\u00eds |title=Cali recuerda la explosi\u00f3n del 7 de agosto |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015128/http://www.elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Agosto072006/cali3.html |archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref> The nearby army barracks was instantly destroyed.

In 1982, the government of Cali inaugurated what is now the city's largest building and the third-largest in the Republic of [[Colombia]]\u2014\"La Torre de Cali\", or The Cali Tower. It stands 42 stories tall and houses a hotel, offices and apartment complexes.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Location===\nCali is located on the Cauca Valley to the west of the [[Cauca River]] and to the east of the Western Mountain Range near the hills known as [[Farallones de Cali]]. The city rests approximately {{convert|1000|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Approximately {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} west of Cali and over the Western Cordillera, lies the port city of [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]] on the Colombian Pacific coast. To the northeast are the manufacturing center of Yumbo and Cali's international airport, the [[Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n International Airport|Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n]] (CLO). It is Colombia's third largest airport in terms of passengers, transporting 2,667,526 in 2009.\n\n===Geography===\n[[File:Los Farallones.jpg|thumb|center|700px|Panoramic [[Farallones de Cali]]]]\nSantiago de Cali is located in a valley. The city is completely bordered by mountains to the West; the [[Farallones de Cali]] mountains are the closest to the city. The Eastern part of the city is bordered by the Cauca River. To the north and south are extended plains. In the first one you can find the industrial city of [[Yumbo]] which is part of Cali's metropolitan area, to the south you can find [[Jamund\u00ed]], also part of the metropolitan area. The city is mainly flat, but there are areas mostly to the west that are mountainous, like San Antonio and La loma de la Cruz, which are both tourist sites. There are several rivers that descend from the Western Mountain Range and empty into the Cauca River, passing through the metropolitan area of Cali. In the western part of the city the Aguacatal River flows into the [[Cali River]], which continues on to the [[Cauca River]]. In the south the rivers Ca\u00f1averalejo, Lil\u00ed, and Mel\u00e9ndez flow into the [https://www.cvc.gov.co/ CVC] south channel which also empties into the Cauca River. Farther south, the banks of the [[Pance River]] are a popular place for recreation and leisure.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Guaiacum officinale- Cali, Colombia.jpg|thumb|[[Guaiacum officinale]] tree flowered in Cali.]]\nUnder [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen's climate classification]], Cali features a dry-summer [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''As'''). The Western Mountain Range rises from an average of {{convert|2000|m|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] in the northern part of the city to approximately {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=on}} to the south. Because of this variation in altitude, the weather in the northwest portion of the city is drier than in the southwest. The average annual precipitation varies between {{convert|900|to|1800|mm|0|abbr=on}} depending on the metropolitan zone for a citywide average of approximately {{convert|1000|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Cali's average temperature is {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} with an average low temperature of {{convert|18.5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and a high of {{convert|31|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nOwing to its proximity to the [[equator]], there are no major seasonal variations in Cali like winter, spring, summer and fall. However, locals refer to the dry season as the city's \"summer\", in which temperatures can rise to {{convert|34|to|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|}} and go down to {{convert|18|to|19|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} at night. During the rainy season (or \"winter\") temperatures can rise to {{convert|28|to|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and go down to {{convert|16|to|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} at night. There are typically two rainy seasons: from March to May and from October to November. However, rain can be expected to fall at any point during the year, nourishing the city's permanent green and lush vegetation. The highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|36.6|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in July 1997, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|13.4|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in August 1978.<ref

Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n is located in a long, narrow valley that runs from north to south, and is surrounded by mountains up to {{convert|14000|ft|m}} high. The airport is connected to the city by a highway known as the \"recta a Palmira\", that in the last few years has been upgraded to make the airport more accessible to Cali and the surrounding city centers in the region. The airport has also been remodeled recently; some of the last significant events in those terms were the inauguration of the VIP room in the National terminal and the installation of a main electronic screen in the center of the check-in area.\n\nThe [[Marco Fidel Su\u00e1rez Air Base]] is a military airport close to the city's downtown.

It is planned to be the primary system that connects the city. Taxis and old buses are the secondary way to get around. Taxis are one of the best systems that tourists can use, as they are relatively inexpensive and are more secure. Non-MIO buses round out the system and are used primarily by the working class to get around and are less expensive to use. Buses are secure but not at the same level as taxis. This part of the transport in the city is awaiting a needed reorganization of routes.\n\n'''[[Masivo Integrado de Occidente]] (MIO):''' Is a [[bus rapid transit]] system of articulated buses that run on dedicated bus lanes in the middle of major thoroughfares, with stations connected to sidewalks by dedicated pedestrian crossings or bridges.

The system also integrated the renovation and recuperation of the public space. The MIO system was not only designed for the public transport, but built for public use with extensive new sidewalks, parks, gardens and public squares for the public to enjoy.\n\nThe system also consists of a [[Aerial lift|cable car]], the so-called M\u00cdO Cable, which is fully integrated with the city's public transportation network and directly serves the residents of the district Silo\u00e9.\n\n'''List of the Trunk or principal corridors:'''\n\n*Calle 5\n*Carrera 15\n* Calles 13 y 15\n* Avenida de las Am\u00e9ricas\n* Avenida 3N\n* Carrera 1\n* Transversal 25\n* Carrera 29 y Autopista Oriental\n* Calle 70\n*Avenida Simon Bolivar\n\nMore information about El MIO is in the official web site of Metrocali.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrocali.gov.co/wp/|title=METROCALI \u2013 Sistemas Integral de Transporte Masivo|accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Bus Central Station===\nCali is served by over 20 coach companies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terminalcali.com/publicaciones.php?id=20563 |title=Bus Station website.

The City is an important stop on way to [[Ecuador]], and is connected with the world through the seaport of Buenaventura.\n[[File:Jose Serrano modificado Cali edificio Banco de Occidente.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Building of Banco de Occidente.]]\nThe economic transformation of Cali and the Valle del Cauca during the twentieth century and its crisis of the century, and the outlook to the new century have been the subject of deep analysis of financial and academic institutions. This section is based on the analysis and recommendations of the report'' Cali Colombia \u2013 Toward a City Development and Strategy'' published by the [[World Bank]] in 2002, and the Regional Economic Situation Reports (ICER) published quarterly by the [[Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad\u00edstica|DANE]].\n\nTraditionally, Cali and the department have been space [[farm]], the same as during the colonial times out with the mines, production shaft. In the early twentieth century the city's economy was concentrated in the production of [[sugar]], based on an agricultural model in which large tracts of land were cultivated with minimum use of labor. As a result, a few families owned vast areas of land in one of the most fertile regions of the country. This was an important factor in determining the power relations and the organization of the city through the twentieth century.\n\nIn the period 1910\u20131930, the city's economy shifted its focus from an agricultural model to become a commercial node at the national level through the development of basic infrastructure such as construction of the railway to Buenaventura and the creation of the department of [[Valle del Cauca]] with Cali designated as its capital.\n\nAlthough the industrial vallecaucana revolution of Cali did not begin until the third decade of the twentieth century, some companies had already begun to build the industrial development of the region, as the printing company Carvajal y Cia (which began operations in 1904). In 1929 there is the creation of'' Soap'' Varela Hermanos, in the 1930s other industries begin to grow as large scale factories of [[gas]] and [[beer]], [[printing]] and [[cigarette]]s. Smaller companies also appeared focusing on [[Textiles|textile clothing]], [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], [[chocolate]]s, [[building materials]], [[leather]] articles and [[furniture]].\n\nIn 1940, Cali had already ceased to be a single point of trade and its economy was focused on industry. A few years before the decade began a major investment of foreign capital led to the establishment of many factories and local business grew to multinational corporations; as Croydon in 1937, Cementos del Valle in 1939, and Carton Colombia in 1941; [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] and [[Colgate-Palmolive]] came from the US in 1941. Later came other corporations like General CEAT (Centelsa) in 1955, and pharmaceutical laboratories were based in the Cauca Valley between 1940 and 1960, as Tecnoqu\u00edmicas and Baxter.\n\nThe flourishing industrial city attracted waves of immigration in the 1950s and 1960s. In these decades there were important partnerships between the public and private sectors, as productive sector support to programs of business administration at the [[University of Valle]]. The growth of the University training professionals and technologists, as well as infrastructure development, were crucial for the further development of industry and trade in the Valle del Cauca. This trend continued in the 1970s and early years of the next decade. Public investment in infrastructure reached significant levels benefiting not only the production sector but also the growing population, this made Cali and Valle del Cauca models further development across the country.\n\nIn 1998, when the economic crisis became apparent, the national government could not respond to the call of the local politicians and mayors had to introduce austerity measures under pressure from [[creditor]]s, which caused the vallecaucano development model to collapse. Additionally, the tightening of the country's internal conflict required a tax increase aimed at national war spending, leaving less room for local governments to collect, through taxes, the money required for their development plans.\n\nIn the 21st [[century]], economic conditions in the country and the city have changed. The economic model that handled the Valle del Cauca until the 1980s, has been moved to the [[globalization]] of the economy{{clarify|date=January 2015}}, as evidenced in areas such as: capital inflows of the most important economic groups in Colombia, creating strategic alliances between entrepreneurs and multinational vallecaucanos, the concern of the companies in the region to optimize their resources and services, investment and diversification of economic groups. Faced with the loss of influence of traditional\n\nAccording to statistics by [[Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad\u00edstica|DANE]], in 1995 the annual growth of [[GDP]] of the Valle del Cauca region was almost twice the national rate. For 1997, GDP increased marginally vallecaucano even 1%. In 1999 the country's economic recession was felt with a depression that made the economy were reduced showing GDP growth of 4%. Since then GDP has grown Valley ups and downs, but its percentage share nationwide has been falling since 1995 as shown in the graph.\n\nThe department contributes significantly to the national economy. According to statistics for the year 2005 as [[agriculture|agricultural]] Valley contributes 5.37% of the national production, which is relatively low compared with [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] (15.48%) or [[Cundinamarca department|Cundinamarca]] (12.81%). In fisheries products, the region ranks first with vallecaucana contributing 36% of the country's total production. As for [[mining]], the Valley is not a metal region; however, in terms of non-metallic minerals the department contributes 8.15% of the [[value added]] across Colombia.\n\nThe [[industry]] vallecaucana contributes 13.81% of the national value added, second only to Bogot\u00e1 with a 25.39% and 18.20% with Antioquia. Particularly, the industries of food, beverages and snuff are important items of the Valley's economy contributing 16% of national value added, equaled or surpassed only by Antioquia and Bogot\u00e1. On trade, nationally Bogot\u00e1 has a 32.22%, 13.25% Antioquia and Valle 11.34%.

It hosted the 1992 World Wrestling Championships, the [[World Games 2013|ninth edition]] of the [[World Games]] in 2013, the [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships]] in 2014 and the [[IAAF World Youth Championships in Athletics|World Youth Championships in Athletics]] in 2015. The city is to host the first ever [[2021 Junior Pan American Games|Junior Pan American Games]] in 2021.\n\n==Etymology==\nCali is the shortened form of the official name of the city: Santiago de Cali. \"Santiago\" honours [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] whose [[feast day]] is celebrated on 25 July. The origin of the word \"Cali\" comes from the local Amerindians the \"[[Calima culture|Calima]]\".\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Cali}}\n\n===Pre-Columbian<!--This is NOT a typo. Before Christopher Columbus, not before Colombia --> era and settlers===\n\n[[File:Calima - Ceremonial Tweezers - Walters 57262.jpg|thumb|Calima culture gold ceremonial tweezers from [[Walters Art Museum]].]]\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spaniards, the region was inhabited by indigenous tribes, mostly speakers of [[Cariban languages]]. In the region between the [[Cauca River]] and the Western Cordillera, the Gorrones established themselves between the present day [[Roldanillo]] and Santiago de Cali. The biggest town of the Morrones was sited on the River Pescador near the present-day towns of [[Zarzal]] and [[Bugalagrande]]. The Morrones traded with the [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbayas]] who inhabited the north of the [[Valle del Cauca]].\n\nOn his way to Cali, [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]] first met the Timbas who ran away before the arrival of the men, leaving behind gold. After the Timbas, towards the north, the Spaniards entered the territory of the chief Jamund\u00ed and his tribe, the Jamund\u00edes, between the rivers Pance and [[Jamund\u00ed]]. This tribe offered a strong resistance to the invaders, fighting with poisonous darts and arrows against the [[arquebus]]es and swords of the Spaniards. Eventually, the Spanish prevailed in the struggle over the central valley.\n\nBefore taking control over the region, the Spaniards had to defeat the chief Petecuy, whose tribe inhabited the area between the river Lil\u00ed and the Western Cordillera. Petecuy formed a big army with many tribes and fought the Spaniards on [[Holy Tuesday]] of 1536. The natives lost to the Spaniards and the region was divided in ''[[encomienda]]s''.\n\nSantiago de Cali was important for Belalc\u00e1zar because it was outside the [[Inca empire]]. After the capture and execution of the Inca [[Atahualpa]] at [[Cajamarca]], [[Francisco Pizarro]] had sent Belalc\u00e1zar to take possession of [[Guayaquil]] and Quito on his behalf, but Cali, being outside the Quechua empire, was claimed by Belalcazar as his own territory. After his death, his descendants maintained possession of much of the land until the [[Patria Boba|war of independence against Spain]].\n\n===Founding and colonial period===\n[[File:Sebastian de belalcazar fundador.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]].]]\n[[File:La Merced.JPG|170px|right|200px|thumb|La Merced.]]\nThe founder of Cali, [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]], came to the American continent in the third voyage made by Columbus in 1498. In 1532, after serving in [[Dari\u00e9n Province|Dari\u00e9n]] and [[Nicaragua]], he joined [[Francisco Pizarro]] in the conquest of [[Per\u00fa]]. In 1534, Belalc\u00e1zar separated from Pizarro's expedition to find the city of [[Quito]], and later in his search of [[El Dorado]] he entered the territory of what is now Colombia, founding the cities of [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]] and [[Popay\u00e1n]].\n\nBelalc\u00e1zar founded Santiago de Cali on 25 July 1536, a few kilometres north of its present location, near what are now the towns of [[Vijes]] and [[Riofr\u00edo, Valle del Cauca|Riofr\u00edo]]. Under the orders of Belalc\u00e1zar, captain Miguel Mu\u00f1oz moved the city to its present location in 1537, where the chaplain Brother Santos de A\u00f1asco celebrated a mass in the place occupied by the Church La Merced today, and Belalc\u00e1zar designated Pedro de Ayala as the first municipal authority.\n\nDuring the ''Colonia'' (colonial period), Santiago de Cali was part of the ''gobernaci\u00f3n'' of Popay\u00e1n, which was part of [[Quito]]'s Audiencia. Although initially Cali was the capital of Popay\u00e1n's ''gobernaci\u00f3n'', Belalc\u00e1zar moved this function to Popay\u00e1n in 1540, owing to \"better\" weather there.\n\nUntil the 18th century most of the territory of what is now Santiago de Cali was occupied by haciendas (cattle farms and plantations of food, with some sugar cane), and the city was only a small town near the [[Cali River]]. In 1793, Santiago de Cali had 6,548 inhabitants, 1,106 of whom were (African) slaves. The haciendas were the property of the dominant noble class with many slaves dedicated mostly to stockbreeding and raising sugar cane crops. Many of these haciendas became zone of the present city like Ca\u00f1averalejo, Chipichape, Pasoancho, Arroyohondo, Ca\u00f1asgordas, Limonar and Mel\u00e9ndez. Santiago de Cali was strategically positioned for trade, centrally located in relation to the mining regions of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Department of Choc\u00f3|Choc\u00f3]], and Popay\u00e1n. In the colonial period, the first trail for mules and horses between Santiago de Cali and the port of [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]] was completed.\n\n===Independence===\nOn 3 July 1810, Santiago de Cali refused to recognize the [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Council of Regency]] of Spain, and established its own junta. This local uprising predates the national one in [[Bogot\u00e1]] by 17 days.<ref>Mendoza Neira, Plinio, ed. ''Cali: La sultana del Valle'' (Librer\u00eda Colombiana Camacho Rold\u00e1n, 1962).</ref> The Governor of [[Popay\u00e1n]], [[Miguel Tac\u00f3n y Rosique|Miguel Tac\u00f3n]] organized an army to control the uprising. The people from Cali called for help to the \"Junta Suprema\" in Bogot\u00e1, which sent a contingent under colonel Antonio Baraya to support the independence cause. For mutual defense, Cali also formed, with Anserma, [[Cartago, Colombia|Cartago]], Toro, [[Buga, Valle del Cauca|Buga]] and Caloto, the Confederated cities of the Cauca Valley, which [[Patria Boba|declared independence]] from the [[Governorate]] of Popay\u00e1n on 1 February 1811, although they continued to recognize the absent [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] as their [[head of state]]. On 28 March 1811 in the battle of Bajo Palac\u00e9, the first in Colombia's Independence, the royalist Spanish army was defeated by the revolutionary army commanded by colonel Antonio Baraya with a detachment of 120 soldiers from his native Cundinamarca and a huge garrison of 1.080 men from Valle del Cauca led by brothers [[Miguel and Francisco Cabal Barona]].<ref>Zawadzky C., Alfonso, ''Comentario al libro'' Las Ciudades Confederadas del Valle del Cauca en 1811. Bogot\u00e1, Editorial Librer\u00eda Voluntad, S.A., 1943.</ref>\n\nIn the following years there were many battles between royalists and local militia. After having been released from captivity by Napoleon, Ferdinand VII sent a large army under the command of the \"''Pacificador''\" (Pacifier) [[Pablo Morillo]] who restored royalist rule in the area by 1816.\n\nIn 1819 after [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] defeated the bulk of the royalist army in the [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1]], there were new uprisings in the Valle del Cauca and the [[Criollo people|Criollos]] took control permanently. In 1822 Bol\u00edvar arrived in Santiago de Cali. The city was an important military outpost and the region contributed many men to the war of independence that liberated the nations in the south.\n\n===Modernism===\n[[File:Cali theatre.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Municipal Theater]]\n[[File:Mapa-cali-1880s-WEB.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Map of Cali in about 1882\u20131884, Spanish edition.]]\nIn the 19th century Cali, capital of the Valley of the Cauca department, was a quiet community with no more than 20,000 inhabitants. The urban center of the city was around the neighborhoods of Altozano and San Antonio.\n\nOutside the city there were [[mango]] plantations, pastures and communal land that were transferred from the Spanish Crown to the working classes. From the market gardens on this land the city was supplied with food. The economy centered around livestock, sugar cane, [[panela]] (jaggery; a sugar derivative), cheese and gold mined in the Pacific. There was also a growing industrial and financial sector.\n\nJewish entrepreneurs came during the 18th and 19th centuries and achieved prominent positions in the city. Some married local women and felt they had to diminish or abandon their identity. These included the De Lima, Salazar, Espinoza, Arias, Ramirez, Perez and Lobo families from the Caribbean, as well as the author [[Jorge Isaacs]] of English Jewish ancestry, and the industrialist [[James Martin Eder]] (who adopted the more Christian name of Santiago Eder when he translated his name to Spanish) born into the [[Latvian Jew]]ish community. Over the generations most of their descendants were raised as secular Christians.\n\n{{Multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 180\n | image1 = . V. de Valenzuela, R.

This spurred commercial development and it transformed into the Plaza Mayor or Plaza de Caycedo. In 1921, the market was sold to the Cali municipality. Very close to the 9th street was the principal station of the ''[[Tram|tranvia]]'' of Cali, a system of public transportation that linked the city with suburban areas.\n\n===Recent history===\nOn 7 August 1956 at around 1&nbsp;a.m., seven [[Colombian army]] trucks filled with 42 [[ton]]s of [[dynamite]] exploded near the train station, destroying eight city blocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museonacional.gov.co/cali.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610223111/http://www.museonacional.gov.co/cali.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 June 2007 |publisher=Museo Nacional de Colombia |title=Cali, la explosi\u00f3n de 1956: cat\u00e1strofe hist\u00f3rica}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Agosto072006/cali3.html |newspaper=El Pa\u00eds |title=Cali recuerda la explosi\u00f3n del 7 de agosto |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015128/http://www.elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Agosto072006/cali3.html |archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref> The nearby army barracks was instantly destroyed.

In 1982, the government of Cali inaugurated what is now the city's largest building and the third-largest in the Republic of [[Colombia]]\u2014\"La Torre de Cali\", or The Cali Tower. It stands 42 stories tall and houses a hotel, offices and apartment complexes.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Location===\nCali is located on the Cauca Valley to the west of the [[Cauca River]] and to the east of the Western Mountain Range near the hills known as [[Farallones de Cali]]. The city rests approximately {{convert|1000|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Approximately {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} west of Cali and over the Western Cordillera, lies the port city of [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]] on the Colombian Pacific coast. To the northeast are the manufacturing center of Yumbo and Cali's international airport, the [[Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n International Airport|Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n]] (CLO). It is Colombia's third largest airport in terms of passengers, transporting 2,667,526 in 2009.\n\n===Geography===\n[[File:Los Farallones.jpg|thumb|center|700px|Panoramic [[Farallones de Cali]]]]\nSantiago de Cali is located in a valley. The city is completely bordered by mountains to the West; the [[Farallones de Cali]] mountains are the closest to the city. The Eastern part of the city is bordered by the Cauca River. To the north and south are extended plains. In the first one you can find the industrial city of [[Yumbo]] which is part of Cali's metropolitan area, to the south you can find [[Jamund\u00ed]], also part of the metropolitan area. The city is mainly flat, but there are areas mostly to the west that are mountainous, like San Antonio and La loma de la Cruz, which are both tourist sites. There are several rivers that descend from the Western Mountain Range and empty into the Cauca River, passing through the metropolitan area of Cali. In the western part of the city the Aguacatal River flows into the [[Cali River]], which continues on to the [[Cauca River]]. In the south the rivers Ca\u00f1averalejo, Lil\u00ed, and Mel\u00e9ndez flow into the [https://www.cvc.gov.co/ CVC] south channel which also empties into the Cauca River. Farther south, the banks of the [[Pance River]] are a popular place for recreation and leisure.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Guaiacum officinale- Cali, Colombia.jpg|thumb|[[Guaiacum officinale]] tree flowered in Cali.]]\nUnder [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen's climate classification]], Cali features a dry-summer [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''As'''). The Western Mountain Range rises from an average of {{convert|2000|m|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] in the northern part of the city to approximately {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=on}} to the south. Because of this variation in altitude, the weather in the northwest portion of the city is drier than in the southwest. The average annual precipitation varies between {{convert|900|to|1800|mm|0|abbr=on}} depending on the metropolitan zone for a citywide average of approximately {{convert|1000|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Cali's average temperature is {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} with an average low temperature of {{convert|18.5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and a high of {{convert|31|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nOwing to its proximity to the [[equator]], there are no major seasonal variations in Cali like winter, spring, summer and fall. However, locals refer to the dry season as the city's \"summer\", in which temperatures can rise to {{convert|34|to|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|}} and go down to {{convert|18|to|19|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} at night. During the rainy season (or \"winter\") temperatures can rise to {{convert|28|to|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and go down to {{convert|16|to|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} at night. There are typically two rainy seasons: from March to May and from October to November. However, rain can be expected to fall at any point during the year, nourishing the city's permanent green and lush vegetation. The highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|36.6|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in July 1997, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|13.4|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in August 1978.<ref

This plaza is close to other tourist places, like The Saint Francis church (in Spanish, ''Iglesia de San Francisco''), the municipal theater and La Merced church. The city is also rich in monuments, parks, squares and museums. The most emblematic sculptures are [[Cristo Rey (Colombian statue)|Cristo Rey]], located upon a mountain range; Sebastian de Belalcazar, founder of the city; and Las tres Cruces, a place of pilgrimage during the days of the Holy Week.\n\n===Other tourist attractions===\n[[File:Ermita cali.jpg|thumb|Ermita Church.]]\n[[File:Dan Brooke Cali La Merced.jpg|thumb|Church La Merced, Sede Banco de Occidente al fondo.]]\n[[File:San Antonio Church.jpg|thumb|San Antonio church.]]\n[[File:Victor H Hernandez Cali Plaza de Caycedol.jpg|thumb|Plaza de Cayzedo (Cayzedo Square).]]\n\n[[File:Salsa en Cali.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Salsa music|Salsa]] show at the XIII International Art Festival Cali.]]\n'''Main touristic centers:'''\n* '''Plaza de Caicedo:''' The main square of the city, located in downtown Cali.

It is Colombia's third largest airport in terms of passengers (transporting 3,422,919 in 2010) and fourth in cargo. Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n is located in a long, narrow valley that runs from north to south, and is surrounded by mountains up to {{convert|14000|ft|m}} high. The airport is connected to the city by a highway known as the \"recta a Palmira\", that in the last few years has been upgraded to make the airport more accessible to Cali and the surrounding city centers in the region. The airport has also been remodeled recently; some of the last significant events in those terms were the inauguration of the VIP room in the National terminal and the installation of a main electronic screen in the center of the check-in area.\n\nThe [[Marco Fidel Su\u00e1rez Air Base]] is a military airport close to the city's downtown. It is located in the east side of the city and belongs to the [[Colombian Air Force]]. It is used as one of the main training centers for the country's [[fighter pilot]]s.\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:MIO CALI COLOMBIA.JPG|225px|right|thumb|Masivo Integrado de Occidente (MIO)]]\n\nThe city of Cali offers a variety of ways to move through the city; in March 2009, The Masivo Integrado de Occidente (MIO) began operations. It is planned to be the primary system that connects the city. Taxis and old buses are the secondary way to get around. Taxis are one of the best systems that tourists can use, as they are relatively inexpensive and are more secure. Non-MIO buses round out the system and are used primarily by the working class to get around and are less expensive to use. Buses are secure but not at the same level as taxis. This part of the transport in the city is awaiting a needed reorganization of routes.\n\n'''[[Masivo Integrado de Occidente]] (MIO):''' Is a [[bus rapid transit]] system of articulated buses that run on dedicated bus lanes in the middle of major thoroughfares, with stations connected to sidewalks by dedicated pedestrian crossings or bridges. The system layout is {{convert|243|km|0|abbr=off}} and is distributed in a main trunk, pre-trunk and complementary corridors. The system also integrated the renovation and recuperation of the public space. The MIO system was not only designed for the public transport, but built for public use with extensive new sidewalks, parks, gardens and public squares for the public to enjoy.\n\nThe system also consists of a [[Aerial lift|cable car]], the so-called M\u00cdO Cable, which is fully integrated with the city's public transportation network and directly serves the residents of the district Silo\u00e9.\n\n'''List of the Trunk or principal corridors:'''\n\n*Calle 5\n*Carrera 15\n* Calles 13 y 15\n* Avenida de las Am\u00e9ricas\n* Avenida 3N\n* Carrera 1\n* Transversal 25\n* Carrera 29 y Autopista Oriental\n* Calle 70\n*Avenida Simon Bolivar\n\nMore information about El MIO is in the official web site of Metrocali.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrocali.gov.co/wp/|title=METROCALI \u2013 Sistemas Integral de Transporte Masivo|accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Bus Central Station===\nCali is served by over 20 coach companies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terminalcali.com/publicaciones.php?id=20563 |title=Bus Station website.

Informal stops exist for the short destination rides all along the way from Central Station to the town of destination.

The City is an important stop on way to [[Ecuador]], and is connected with the world through the seaport of Buenaventura.\n[[File:Jose Serrano modificado Cali edificio Banco de Occidente.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Building of Banco de Occidente.]]\nThe economic transformation of Cali and the Valle del Cauca during the twentieth century and its crisis of the century, and the outlook to the new century have been the subject of deep analysis of financial and academic institutions. This section is based on the analysis and recommendations of the report'' Cali Colombia \u2013 Toward a City Development and Strategy'' published by the [[World Bank]] in 2002, and the Regional Economic Situation Reports (ICER) published quarterly by the [[Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad\u00edstica|DANE]].\n\nTraditionally, Cali and the department have been space [[farm]], the same as during the colonial times out with the mines, production shaft. In the early twentieth century the city's economy was concentrated in the production of [[sugar]], based on an agricultural model in which large tracts of land were cultivated with minimum use of labor. As a result, a few families owned vast areas of land in one of the most fertile regions of the country. This was an important factor in determining the power relations and the organization of the city through the twentieth century.\n\nIn the period 1910\u20131930 the city's economy shifted its focus from an agricultural model to become a commercial node at the national level through the development of basic infrastructure such as construction of the railway to Buenaventura and the creation of the department of [[Valle del Cauca]] with Cali designated as its capital.\n\nAlthough the industrial vallecaucana revolution of Cali did not begin until the third decade of the twentieth century, some companies had already begun to build the industrial development of the region, as the printing company Carvajal y Cia (which began operations in 1904). In 1929 there is the creation of'' Soap'' Varela Hermanos, in the 1930s other industries begin to grow as large scale factories of [[gas]] and [[beer]], [[printing]] and [[cigarette]]s. Smaller companies also appeared focusing on [[Textiles|textile clothing]], [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], [[chocolate]]s, [[building materials]], [[leather]] articles and [[furniture]].\n\nIn 1940 Cali had already ceased to be a single point of trade and its economy was focused on industry. A few years before the decade began a major investment of foreign capital led to the establishment of many factories and local business grew to multinational corporations; as Croydon in 1937, Cementos del Valle in 1939, and Carton Colombia in 1941; [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] and [[Colgate-Palmolive]] came from the US in 1941. Later came other corporations like General CEAT (Centelsa) in 1955, and pharmaceutical laboratories were based in the Cauca Valley between 1940 and 1960, as Tecnoqu\u00edmicas and Baxter.\n\nThe flourishing industrial city attracted waves of immigration in the 1950s and 1960s. In these decades there were important partnerships between the public and private sectors, as productive sector support to programs of business administration at the [[University of Valle]]. The growth of the University training professionals and technologists, as well as infrastructure development, were crucial for the further development of industry and trade in the Valle del Cauca. This trend continued in the 1970s and early years of the next decade. Public investment in infrastructure reached significant levels benefiting not only the production sector but also the growing population, this made Cali and Valle del Cauca models further development across the country.\n\nIn 1998, when the economic crisis became apparent, the national government could not respond to the call of the local politicians and mayors had to introduce austerity measures under pressure from [[creditor]]s, which caused the vallecaucano development model to collapse. Additionally, the tightening of the country's internal conflict required a tax increase aimed at national war spending, leaving less room for local governments to collect, through taxes, the money required for their development plans.\n\nIn the 21st [[century]], economic conditions in the country and the city have changed. The economic model that handled the Valle del Cauca until the 1980s, has been moved to the [[globalization]] of the economy{{clarify|date=January 2015}}, as evidenced in areas such as: capital inflows of the most important economic groups in Colombia, creating strategic alliances between entrepreneurs and multinational vallecaucanos, the concern of the companies in the region to optimize their resources and services, investment and diversification of economic groups. Faced with the loss of influence of traditional\n\nAccording to statistics by [[Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad\u00edstica|DANE]], in 1995 the annual growth of [[GDP]] of the Valle del Cauca region was almost twice the national rate. For 1997, GDP increased marginally vallecaucano even 1%. In 1999 the country's economic recession was felt with a depression that made the economy were reduced showing GDP growth of 4%. Since then GDP has grown Valley ups and downs, but its percentage share nationwide has been falling since 1995 as shown in the graph.\n\nThe department contributes significantly to the national economy. According to statistics for the year 2005 as [[agriculture|agricultural]] Valley contributes 5.37% of the national production, which is relatively low compared with [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] (15.48%) or [[Cundinamarca department|Cundinamarca]] (12.81%). In fisheries products, the region ranks first with vallecaucana contributing 36% of the country's total production. As for [[mining]], the Valley is not a metal region; however, in terms of non-metallic minerals the department contributes 8.15% of the [[value added]] across Colombia.\n\nThe [[industry]] vallecaucana contributes 13.81% of the national value added, second only to Bogot\u00e1 with a 25.39% and 18.20% with Antioquia. Particularly, the industries of food, beverages and snuff are important items of the Valley's economy contributing 16% of national value added, equaled or surpassed only by Antioquia and Bogot\u00e1. On trade, nationally Bogot\u00e1 has a 32.22%, 13.25% Antioquia and Valle 11.34%. In the Valley transportation services has 12.52% of value added.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index ([[Consumer price index|IPC]]) of Cali has been since the last decade one of the lowest among Colombian cities. About 78% of Cali's people are of working age (over 18 years). In 2005 for the first time in six years the city presented an occupancy rate above 60%, which confirms the good state of the economy, led primarily by growth in manufacturing, agriculture and trade among others.\n\nDrogas La Rebaja, one of Colombia's largest pharmacy store chains, is based in Cali.\nBanco de Occidente,A Grupo Aval company, has head office in cali.\n\n==Public order==\nCali had a murder rate of 66.4 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2014; this fell to 51.5 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ideaspaz.org/publications/posts/1504 |title=As\u00ed se concentra el homicidio en las ciudades |publisher=ideaspaz.org |accessdate=14 February 2018 |language=Spanish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214202724/http://www.ideaspaz.org/publications/posts/1504 |archive-date=14 February 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.co/judicial/balance-de-violencia-en-el-2017-valle-el-departamento-con-mas-homicidios.html |title=Balance de violencia en el 2017: Valle, el departamento con m\u00e1s homicidios |work=El Pais |accessdate=14 February 2018 |language=Spanish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214205811/http://www.elpais.com.co/judicial/balance-de-violencia-en-el-2017-valle-el-departamento-con-mas-homicidios.html |archive-date=14 February 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2006 the budget for security in [[Medell\u00edn]] was more than four times higher than in Cali, and in Bogota (which is 3.5 times more populous) the budget was more than seven times higher.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nBetween 1 January and 1 December 2011 there were 1870<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/cali/noticias/cali-ciudad-armada-hasta-dientes |title=Conozca el panorama de los homicidios en Cali con armas de fuego \u2013 diario El Pais |publisher=Elpais.com.co |accessdate=17 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207044043/http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/cali/noticias/cali-ciudad-armada-hasta-dientes |archive-date=7 February 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> intentional homicides in the municipality of Cali, which is considered a 5% increase compared to 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/judicial/lideres-empresariales-y-gremiales-reclaman-politica-seguridad |title=\u00bfQu\u00ea hacer para frenar a los delincuentes y devolverle la seguridad a Cali? : Noticias de Judicial |publisher=elpais.com.co |accessdate=17 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308142945/http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/judicial/lideres-empresariales-y-gremiales-reclaman-politica-seguridad |archive-date=8 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The surge in violence in Cali in 2011 has partly been attributed to what has been described as an ongoing 'mafia war' between the 'neo-paramilitary' groups [[Los Rastrojos]] and [[Los Urabe\u00f1os]], both involved in drug trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/719-mafia-war-feared-in-cali-if-rastrojos-face-new-competition |title=Mafia War Feared in Cali, as Rastrojos Face New Competition |publisher=Insightcrime.org |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316105232/http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/719-mafia-war-feared-in-cali-if-rastrojos-face-new-competition |archivedate=16 March 2012}}</ref> Los Rastrojos are considered the 'heirs' of the [[Cali Cartel]] and Los Urabe\u00f1os have their roots in Colombia's coast.

Under the mayor, there are several administrative departments and secretaries. [[Elecciones regionales en Colombia|Mayor's elections]] started in 1986, followed by Governors' in 1992. Before these dates, all Colombian regional executive-branch leaders were appointed by the President himself. The first elected mayor was [[Carlos Holmes Trujillo]] of the Liberal Party. Unlike other Colombian cities, Cali has not properly adapted to the quite new Mayor's election system. The city has had some unsuccessful stories with some of its elected mayors, two of them being removed from office. Some argue this is caused by Aguablanca's huge mass population often driven to vote based in small short-termed gifts from populist candidates fully aware of this District needs, but this is not more than a [[popular misconceptions]].<ref name=\"JPM\">{{cite journal |last=Milanese |first=Juan Pablo |last2=Abad\u00eda |first2=Adolfo A. |last3=Rodr\u00edguez |first3=Alejandro |last4=Cuervo |first4=Beatriz |title=Configuraci\u00f3n de los apoyos electorales a nivel municipal.
