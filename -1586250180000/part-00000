While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes.

These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.

The Clark is known as the \"Baby Nobel\" in economics because around a third of the medalists have gone on to win the Nobel, the average age of whose laureates approaches 70 when they were awarded the prize. Similar prizes for young talent economists in the world include the ''[[Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Foundation#Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award|Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award]]'' (1993), the European equivalent awarded to European economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Nakahara Prize]]'' (1995) awarded to Japanese economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Gossen Prize]]'' (1997) awarded to German-speaking economists under '''45''' years of age;  the ''[[Prix du meilleur jeune \u00e9conomiste de France|Prix du Meilleur Jeune \u00c9conomiste de France]]'' (2000) awarded to French economists under '''40''' years of age; and the ''[[Assar Lindbeck Medal]]'' (2007) awarded to Swedish economists under '''45''' years of age. \n* 2: The John von Neumann Award, which honors professors with top contributions to economics and social sciences, is distinguished from other scientific awards on the basis that it is given by students. The students at the [[Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies]] ([[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]), which is a self governing community of about 100 selected students living together, elect the nominees and vote for the prize-winner in the Assembly of the College after a review and debate regarding the candidates every year. Recipients are invited to the college to receive the award, give an open lecture and hold a master class. ''It also needs to be noted that there are three other prizes named after Hungarian-American polymath [[John von Neumann]] in this prize list, the [[#Applied mathematics|SIAM John von Neumann Lecture]] (1960) for distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences, the [[#Computer science|IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992) for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology, and the [[#Operations research|INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize]] (1975) for fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.''\n}}</small>\n\n====Electrical engineering====\n* '''[[IEEE Medal of Honor]]''' (1917)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IET Faraday Medal|Faraday Medal]] (1922)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal|Edison Medal]] (1909)<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8290600|title=Origins of the IEEE Edison Medal| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 106| issue = 2| pages = 319\u2013328| issn =0018-9219|doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790278|author=David P.

Aga Khan called on the [[British Raj]] to consider Muslims to be a separate nation within India, the so-called 'Two Nation Theory'. Even after he resigned as president of the AIML in 1912, he still exerted major influence on its policies and agendas. He was nominated to represent India to the League of Nations in 1932 and served as President of the [[League of Nations]] from 1937\u201338.<ref name=findpk/>\n\n==Early life==\nSir Sultan Mahomed Shah was born in [[Karachi]], the capital of [[Sindh]] province in British [[India]], (now [[Pakistan]]) to [[Aga Khan II]] and his third wife,<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\">{{cite book | title=The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs: Their History and Doctrines| last=Daftary| first=Farhad| year=1990| page=518| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-42974-9}}</ref> Nawab A'lia Shamsul-Muluk, who was a granddaughter of [[Fath Ali Shah]] of [[Persia]] ([[Qajar dynasty]]).\n\nUnder the care of his mother, he was given not only that religious and Oriental education which his position as the religious leader of the [[Ismailis]] made indispensable, but also sound European training, an opportunity denied to his father and paternal grandfather.{{sfn|Bhownagree|1911}} He also attended [[Eton College|Eton]] and the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>\"Aga Khan, Fashionable Londoner, Holds Enormous Power in Islam\", The New York Times,8 July 1923, p.

The distinction of a [[Order of the Indian Empire|Knight Commander of the Indian Empire]] (KCIE) was conferred upon him by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1897; and he was promoted to a Knight Grand Commander (GCIE) in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}</ref><ref name=\"LG27448\" /> and invested as such by King [[Edward VII]] at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=25 October 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36908| }}</ref> He was made a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) by George V (1912), and appointed a GCMG in 1923. He received like recognition for his public services from the German Emperor, the Sultan of Turkey, the Shah of Persia and other potentates.{{sfn|Bhownagree|1911}}\n\nIn 1906, the Aga Khan was a founding member and first president of the [[All India Muslim League]], a political party which pushed for the creation of an independent Muslim nation in the north west regions of India, then under British colonial rule, and later established the country of Pakistan in 1947.\n\nDuring the three [[Round Table Conferences (India)]] in London from 1930\u201332, he played an important role to bring about Indian constitutional reforms.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\nIn 1934, he was made a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and served as a member of the [[League of Nations]] (1934\u201337), becoming the President of the League of Nations in 1937.<ref name=findpk/>\n\n==Imamate==\n{{Ismailism|collapsed=1}}\nUnder the  leadership of Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah, Aga Khan III, the first half of the 20th century was a period of significant development for the Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b community. Numerous institutions for social and economic development were established in the Indian Subcontinent and in East Africa.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\">{{cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=A Short History of the Ismailis |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh, UK |isbn=0-7486-0687-4 |pages=199\u2013206}}</ref> Ismailis have marked the Jubilees of their Im\u0101ms with public celebrations, which are symbolic affirmations of the ties that link the [[Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b]] Im\u0101m and his followers. Although the Jubilees have no religious significance, they serve to reaffirm the Imamat's worldwide commitment to the improvement of the quality of human life, especially in the developing countries.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/>\n\nThe Jubilees of Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah, Aga Khan III, are well remembered. During his 72 years of Imamat (1885\u20131957), the community celebrated his Golden (1937), Diamond (1946) and Platinum (1954) Jubilees. To show their appreciation and affection, the Ism\u0101'\u012bliyya weighed their Imam in gold, diamonds and, symbolically, in platinum, respectively, the proceeds of which were used to further develop major social welfare and development institutions in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn [[British Raj|India]] and later in [[Pakistan]], social development institutions were established, in the words of Aga Khan III, \"for the relief of humanity\". They included institutions such as the Diamond Jubilee Trust and the Platinum Jubilee Investments Limited which in turn assisted the growth of various types of cooperative societies. ''Diamond Jubilee High School for Girls'' were established throughout the remote Northern Areas of what is now Pakistan. In addition, scholarship programs, established at the time of the Golden Jubilee to give assistance to needy students, were progressively expanded. In East Africa, major social welfare and economic development institutions were established. Those involved in social welfare included the accelerated development of schools and community centres, and a modern, fully equipped [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|hospital]] in [[Nairobi]]. Among the economic development institutions established in East Africa were companies such as the Diamond Jubilee Investment Trust (now Diamond Trust of Kenya) and the Jubilee Insurance Company, which are quoted on the Nairobi Stock Exchange and have become major players in national development.\n\nSir Sultan Mahomed Shah also introduced organizational forms that gave Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b communities the means to structure and regulate their own affairs.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/> These were built on the Muslim tradition of a communitarian ethic on the one hand, and responsible individual conscience with freedom to negotiate one's own moral commitment and destiny on the other. In 1905 he ordained the first Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b Constitution for the social governance of the community in East Africa. The new administration for the Community's affairs was organised into a hierarchy of councils at the local, national, and regional levels. The constitution also set out rules in such matters as marriage, divorce and inheritance, guidelines for mutual cooperation and support among Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs, and their interface with other communities. Similar constitutions were promulgated in India, and all were periodically revised to address emerging needs and circumstances in diverse settings.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[Second World War]], far-reaching social, economic and political changes profoundly affected a number of areas where Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs resided. In 1947, British rule in the Indian Subcontinent was replaced by the sovereign, independent nations of [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and later [[Bangladesh]], resulting in the migration of millions people and significant loss of life and property. In the Middle East, the [[Suez crisis]] of 1956 as well as the preceding crisis in Iran, demonstrated the sharp upsurge of nationalism, which was as assertive of the region's social and economic aspirations as of its political independence. Africa was also set on its course to [[decolonisation]], swept by what [[Harold Macmillan]], the then British prime minister, termed the \"wind of change\". By the early 1960s, most of East and Central Africa, where the majority of the [[Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b]] population on the continent resided, including [[Tanganyika]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Madagascar]], Rwanda, Burundi and [[Zaire]], had attained their political independence.\n\n==Religious and Social Views==\nThe Aga Khan was influenced by the views of [[Syed Ahmad Khan|Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Aga Khan Case: Religion and Identity in Colonial India|last=Purohit|first=Teena|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-674-06639-7|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=111}}</ref>, a supporter of Muslim adoption of Western ideas.

[[Ismaili]] religion. He was one of the founders and the first president of the [[All-India Muslim League]] (AIML). His goal was the advancement of Muslim agendas and protection of Muslim rights in [[India]]. The League, until the late 1930s, was not a large organisation but represented the landed and commercial Muslim interests of the British-ruled 'United Provinces' (as of today [[Uttar Pradesh]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=John Keay|title=India: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aeQqmcXBhoC&pg=PA468|year=2001|publisher=Grove Press|page=468|isbn=9780802137975}}</ref> He shared Sir [[Syed Ahmad Khan]]'s  belief that Muslims should first build up their [[social capital]] through advanced education before engaging in politics. Aga Khan called on the [[British Raj]] to consider Muslims to be a separate nation within India, the so-called 'Two Nation Theory'. Even after he resigned as president of the AIML in 1912, he still exerted major influence on its policies and agendas. He was nominated to represent India to the League of Nations in 1932 and served as President of the [[League of Nations]] from 1937\u201338.<ref name=findpk/>\n\n==Early life==\nSir Sultan Mahomed Shah was born in [[Karachi]], the capital of [[Sindh]] province in British [[India]], (now [[Pakistan]]) to [[Aga Khan II]] and his third wife,<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\">{{cite book | title=The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs: Their History and Doctrines| last=Daftary| first=Farhad| year=1990| page=518| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-42974-9}}</ref> Nawab A'lia Shamsul-Muluk, who was a granddaughter of [[Fath Ali Shah]] of [[Persia]] ([[Qajar dynasty]]).\n\nUnder the care of his mother, he was given not only that religious and Oriental education which his position as the religious leader of the [[Ismailis]] made indispensable, but also sound European training, an opportunity denied to his father and paternal grandfather.{{sfn|Bhownagree|1911}} He also attended [[Eton College|Eton]] and the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>\"Aga Khan, Fashionable Londoner, Holds Enormous Power in Islam\", The New York Times,8 July 1923, p.

The distinction of a [[Order of the Indian Empire|Knight Commander of the Indian Empire]] (KCIE) was conferred upon him by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1897; and he was promoted to a Knight Grand Commander (GCIE) in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}</ref><ref name=\"LG27448\" /> and invested as such by King [[Edward VII]] at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=25 October 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36908| }}</ref> He was made a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) by George V (1912), and appointed a GCMG in 1923. He received like recognition for his public services from the German Emperor, the Sultan of Turkey, the Shah of Persia and other potentates.{{sfn|Bhownagree|1911}}\n\nIn 1906, the Aga Khan was a founding member and first president of the [[All India Muslim League]], a political party which pushed for the creation of an independent Muslim nation in the north west regions of India, then under British colonial rule, and later established the country of Pakistan in 1947.\n\nDuring the three [[Round Table Conferences (India)]] in London from 1930\u201332, he played an important role to bring about Indian constitutional reforms.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\nIn 1934, he was made a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and served as a member of the [[League of Nations]] (1934\u201337), becoming the President of the League of Nations in 1937.<ref name=findpk/>\n\n==Imamate==\n{{Ismailism|collapsed=1}}\nUnder the  leadership of Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah, Aga Khan III, the first half of the 20th century was a period of significant development for the Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b community. Numerous institutions for social and economic development were established in the Indian Subcontinent and in East Africa.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\">{{cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=A Short History of the Ismailis |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh, UK |isbn=0-7486-0687-4 |pages=199\u2013206}}</ref> Ismailis have marked the Jubilees of their Im\u0101ms with public celebrations, which are symbolic affirmations of the ties that link the [[Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b]] Im\u0101m and his followers. Although the Jubilees have no religious significance, they serve to reaffirm the Imamat's worldwide commitment to the improvement of the quality of human life, especially in the developing countries.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/>\n\nThe Jubilees of Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah, Aga Khan III, are well remembered. During his 72 years of Imamat (1885\u20131957), the community celebrated his Golden (1937), Diamond (1946) and Platinum (1954) Jubilees. To show their appreciation and affection, the Ism\u0101'\u012bliyya weighed their Imam in gold, diamonds and, symbolically, in platinum, respectively, the proceeds of which were used to further develop major social welfare and development institutions in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn [[British Raj|India]] and later in [[Pakistan]], social development institutions were established, in the words of Aga Khan III, \"for the relief of humanity\". They included institutions such as the Diamond Jubilee Trust and the Platinum Jubilee Investments Limited which in turn assisted the growth of various types of cooperative societies. ''Diamond Jubilee High School for Girls'' were established throughout the remote Northern Areas of what is now Pakistan. In addition, scholarship programs, established at the time of the Golden Jubilee to give assistance to needy students, were progressively expanded. In East Africa, major social welfare and economic development institutions were established. Those involved in social welfare included the accelerated development of schools and community centres, and a modern, fully equipped [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|hospital]] in [[Nairobi]]. Among the economic development institutions established in East Africa were companies such as the Diamond Jubilee Investment Trust (now Diamond Trust of Kenya) and the Jubilee Insurance Company, which are quoted on the Nairobi Stock Exchange and have become major players in national development.\n\nSir Sultan Mahomed Shah also introduced organizational forms that gave Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b communities the means to structure and regulate their own affairs.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/> These were built on the Muslim tradition of a communitarian ethic on the one hand, and responsible individual conscience with freedom to negotiate one's own moral commitment and destiny on the other. In 1905 he ordained the first Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b Constitution for the social governance of the community in East Africa. The new administration for the Community's affairs was organised into a hierarchy of councils at the local, national, and regional levels. The constitution also set out rules in such matters as marriage, divorce and inheritance, guidelines for mutual cooperation and support among Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs, and their interface with other communities. Similar constitutions were promulgated in India, and all were periodically revised to address emerging needs and circumstances in diverse settings.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[Second World War]], far-reaching social, economic and political changes profoundly affected a number of areas where Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs resided. In 1947, British rule in the Indian Subcontinent was replaced by the sovereign, independent nations of [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and later [[Bangladesh]], resulting in the migration of millions people and significant loss of life and property. In the Middle East, the [[Suez crisis]] of 1956 as well as the preceding crisis in Iran, demonstrated the sharp upsurge of nationalism, which was as assertive of the region's social and economic aspirations as of its political independence. Africa was also set on its course to [[decolonisation]], swept by what [[Harold Macmillan]], the then British prime minister, termed the \"wind of change\". By the early 1960s, most of East and Central Africa, where the majority of the [[Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b]] population on the continent resided, including [[Tanganyika]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Madagascar]], Rwanda, Burundi and [[Zaire]], had attained their political independence.\n\n==Religious and Social Views==\nThe Aga Khan was deeply influenced by the views of [[Syed Ahmad Khan|Sir

The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself on a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.\n\n''Another World'' was developed by Chahi alone over a period of about two years, with only help with the soundtrack from Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Freitas. Chahi developed his own [[game engine]], completing all the game's art and animations in [[Vector graphics|vector]] form to reduce memory use, with some use of [[rotoscope|rotoscoping]] to help plan out character movements. Both narratively and gameplay-wise, he wanted the game to be told with little to no language or user-interface elements. The game was originally developed for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] but has since been widely ported to other contemporary systems, including home and portable consoles and mobile devices. Chahi has since overseen release of various anniversary releases of the game.\n\n''Another World'' was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and [[cutscene]]s, which earned the game praise among critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers, inspiring such titles as ''[[Ico]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'', ''[[Silent Hill (video game)|Silent Hill]]'', and Delphine's later ''[[Flashback (1992 video game)|Flashback]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Megadrive another world.png|thumb|left|The first level of the [[Sega Genesis]] version, with Lester climbing out of the pond into which he has been teleported.]]\n\n''Another World'' is a [[platform game]], featuring a control scheme where the player uses either the keyboard, [[joystick]] or [[gamepad]] to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation-specific actions, such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, the player's character Lester is unarmed. He is able to kick at small creatures, but is otherwise defenseless.\n\nLater in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web | url=http://uk.ign.com/videos/2012/03/26/86-laser-gun-another-world-igns-top-100-video-game-weapons | title=Tenchi Muyo GXP - Volume 1: Out of This World (Collector's Box) - #86: Laser Gun (Another World) - IGN's Top 100 Video Game Weapons | website=IGN | date=2012-03-26 | accessdate=2012-10-30}}</ref> Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.\n\nLester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard.<ref name=gr/> However, the game uses numerous [[saved game|checkpoints]] enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues as to what the player should do next, features no [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in an unintelligible alien language.<ref name=1up/><ref name=retro/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[protagonist]] of the game is Lester Knight Chaykin, a young genius [[physicist]]. In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his high-tech underground laboratory in his [[Ferrari 288 GTO]]<ref>{{cite book | title=Out of this World Manual | publisher=Interplay | author=Cousseau, Pierre | page=3}}</ref> during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a [[particle accelerator]], attempting to reconstruct what happened when the universe was born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and [[teleportation|teleporting]] Lester to a barren, alien planet.<ref name=1up/>\n\nAfter evading a number of dangerous indigenous animals, Lester is captured by a race of humanoid [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|aliens]] and taken to a subterranean prison camp. Lester escapes along with an alien captive known as \"Buddy\" and the two of them must evade capture while travelling through a series of dangerous environments, battling alien soldiers and wild creatures while solving numerous puzzles in order to survive. The duo traverse the prison complex, a cave system and a tower structure.<ref name=1up/><ref name=retro/> In the game's climax, Lester is severely wounded by one of the aliens, but with the help of his alien friend, manages to kill his attacker and escape. After reaching the top of the tower, Lester collapses, but is promptly joined by Buddy, who picks Lester up and the two escape on a dragon-like creature, flying off to the horizon and ending the game.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Eric Chahi 2010 GDC Conference.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c9ric Chahi]], the creator of ''Another World'', at the 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]]]]\n\nThe game's French designer \u00c9ric Chahi had previously worked as a [[game programmer]] and then as a [[graphic designer]] for video games since 1983. It was the success of his earlier work with [[Paul Cuisset]] as a graphic designer for the [[adventure game]] ''[[Future Wars]]'' for [[Delphine Software International|Delphine Software]] and its royalties that gave him the chance to develop ''Another World'' \"without any constraint of any sort or any editorial pressure.\" After ''Future Wars'' was released in 1989, Chahi had the choice either to work on Cuisset's next game, ''[[Operation Stealth]]'', or create his own game. As \"there had been many books and tools released to develop easily on the [[Amiga]] at that time,\" Chahi felt confident that he could go back to programming.<ref name=inter/>\n\nThe game was influenced by works that Chahi liked at the time. The art and atmosphere were influenced by [[science fiction]] books such as ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'', artists such as [[Michael Whelan]], and comic illustrators such as [[Richard Corben]].<ref name=inter/> [[Manga]] such as ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' influenced the way it suggests a lot with very little, character blurring effects, and charging power attacks.<ref name=\"Eric Chahi Interview\">{{YouTube|GTb6zX7Hd5I|Another World Rotoscoping & Interview Eric Chahi}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1989, Chahi was impressed by the flat-color animations that the Amiga version of ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'' had and thought that it would be possible to use [[Euclidean vector|vector]] outlines to create a similar effect using much less [[Computer data storage|computer storage]]. After first attempting to write the graphical routines in [[C (programming language)|C]], he turned to [[assembly language]]. He wrote a [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]] routine for the [[Motorola 68000]] on an [[Atari ST]] to test his theory, with much success. Later, he found that he could run the code on the Amiga platform and achieve a [[frame rate]] of about 20 frames per second, later recognizing this as \"a major turning point in the creation of the game\" and the point where he knew the polygon approach would work.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33356/GDC_2011_Eric_Chahi_Retro_Postmortem_Another_World_.php | title = GDC 2011: Eric Chahi Retro Postmortem: Another World | first = Christian | last = Nutt | date =2011-03-03 | accessdate = 2011-03-03 | website = [[Gamasutra]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110306162759/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33356/GDC_2011_Eric_Chahi_Retro_Postmortem_Another_World_.php| archivedate= 2011-03-06 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref> He was able to take advantage of the Amiga's [[genlock]] capabilities to create [[rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] animations with the polygons, using video recordings of himself performing various actions. Though he had tried to use smaller polygons (which Chahi called \"pixigons\") to construct the backgrounds for the scenes based on [[Deluxe Paint]] artwork, the process of creating them was excruciatingly slow, and he returned to using [[bitmap]]ped images.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/><ref name=\"chahi realisation\">{{cite web | url=http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_realisation.htm|title=Another World: Realisation | publisher = [[\u00c9ric Chahi]] | accessdate = 2008-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080802062429/http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_realisation.htm| archivedate= 2 August 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box | width=25% | align=left | quote=''Another World'' was influenced by everything I liked at that time of my life&nbsp;\u2014 mainly by pictorial art, movies and science fiction books, like ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' or ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]''.

Because he wanted to create a dramatic, cinematic experience, the game features no HUD or dialog, giving the player only a representation of the surrounding game world during both gameplay elements and the cutscenes progressing the story. However, with no idea of the technical limitations he would face while building out the story, he focused more on creating ambiance, rhythmic pacing, and narrative tension to the game.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/> Chahi resorted to developing his own tool with a new programming language through [[GFA BASIC]] coupled with the game's engine in Devpac assembler, to control and animate the game, interpreted in real-time by the game engine, effectively creating his own animation sequencer.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/><ref name=\"chahi realisation\"/>\n\nWith the creation of the tools needed for building out the rest of the game by December 1989, Chahi began working on the introductory sequence as a means to validate the full capacities of his engine. The introduction sequence also gave Chahi the chance to explore the types of cinematics he could create through the engine. Chahi later considered this the \"first step in the improvisation process\" that he used throughout the rest of development. He finished the game's introduction sequence in early 1990 and started working on the first [[Level (video gaming)|level]]. Chahi worked at the game at a linear pace, developing each section of the game in chronological order and influenced by his own personal feelings and attitude at the time. For example, as Chahi recognized he was trying to create a game on his own, the first portions of the game evoke loneliness and isolation, reflecting Chahi's mood at the time. He did not have the original intention of the character meeting an ally, but again described the improvisation approach led him to include the alien friend, and had included specific cinematics that showed a close up of the alien to help the player imagine this world.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/>\n\nLater in the game's development, Chahi added laser pistols, including the one that Lester carries for several effects. The idea was influenced by the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, but added depth to the gameplay by giving the player more options. He also found that repeated laser fire by the enemies helped to enunciate the rhythm of the game. Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/>\n\nAfter 17 months of development, Chahi was only about one-third finished with the game, and realized that this rate would have been impractical. He began to take steps to simplify the development, including reusing background graphics and creating building blocks that allowed him to focus more on the game's puzzles. At the same time, he began to seek a publisher for the game. He first spoke to his former employer, Delphine Software, but also sought other distributors. One, [[Virgin Interactive]], was favourable to Chahi's game but had suggested that he change it to a [[Point and click|point-and-click]] style adventure game. Chahi had considered changing the game in line with this request but realized \"the effort to do this would have been too huge, and some friends who played the game loved it.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/03/03/how-another-world-almost-became-a-point-and-click-adventure/ | title=How 'Another World' almost became a point-and-click adventure | publisher=joystiq.com | date=2001-03-03 | accessdate=2013-05-09 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010001821/http://www.joystiq.com/2011/03/03/how-another-world-almost-became-a-point-and-click-adventure/ | archive-date=2012-10-10 | url-status=dead}}</ref> Ultimately, he accepted Delphine's offer in June 1991, and set a tentative release date in November. To meet this deadline, Chahi used [[storyboard]]s to sketch out the rest of the game's plot, balancing the overall pacing of the game. One ending captured on these storyboards, but abandoned, was Lester becoming the leader of the alien world. Chahi also argued for his own cover art for the game even with the time crunch for release; he had been disappointed in cover art that was foisted on his games by previous publishers and insisted he be allowed to create it for this game.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-world-creator-on-improvisational-design/1100-6301814/ | title = Another World creator on improvisational design | first = Brendan | last = Sinclair | date = March 4, 2011 | accessdate = September 15, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180916060122/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-world-creator-on-improvisational-design/1100-6301814/ | archive-date = 2018-09-16 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> The game was finished in 1991, which inspired the game's tagline: \"It took six days to create the Earth. ''Another World'' took two years\"; Chahi noted his own exhaustion at completing this project is mirrored in the near-death of Lester at the end of the game.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/>\n\nUpon publishing, Delphine did not perform a playtest of the full game, only having previously tested the first portion of the game. Delphine's U.S. publisher [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] undertook a full playtest and Chahi fixed a number of bugs that arose from this. Interplay had also requested additional changes in the game, including making the game longer and changing the game's introduction music. Chahi was adamant about retaining the game's opening music, and had attempted to change Interplay's minds by sending them an \"infinite fax\", a looped piece of paper, with the message \"keep the original intro music\" on it. Only when Delphine's lawyer got involved and told Interplay they legally could not change the music did Interplay relax this requirement.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/><ref name=versions/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe game's music was composed by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Freitas. The music was influenced by film soundtracks such as ''[[Back to the Future]]''.<ref name=\"Eric Chahi Interview\"/> Black Screen Records released CD and vinyl versions of the 18-song soundtrack in August 2017.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blackscreenrecords.limitedrun.com/products/597546-jean-francois-freitas-another-world-official-soundtrack | title = Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Freitas - Another World: Official Soundtrack | access-date = 2018-05-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180503042130/http://blackscreenrecords.limitedrun.com/products/597546-jean-francois-freitas-another-world-official-soundtrack | archive-date = 2018-05-03 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[Image:Out Of This World - Amiga.png|thumb|Screenshot of the introduction [[cutscene]] to the final level from the original [[Amiga]] version. [[Nintendo]] requested that all scenes that feature blood, or any blood-like thing, such as the [[venus flytrap]] saliva, as well as this brief nudity scene, be redrawn, and so \"crack of the naked aliens' bottoms was reduced by 3 pixels.\"<ref name=versions/>]]\nThe game was originally released for the Amiga and Atari ST in November 1991, running at a [[display resolution]] of 320\u00d7200 pixels. These versions received less [[Playtest|play-testing]] than other versions, making for a less-fluid game, but the Amiga's sound capabilities afford it a high sound quality compared to contemporary ports. The game released on the Atari ST is identical, but with a less refined sound, and its colors are less sharp than on Amiga. These versions had [[code wheel]] protection that made it difficult to use unauthorized copies, forcing the player to enter a code (series of figures) looked up from a code wheel that came with the game. The player had to turn the wheel according to the number that was requested in the screen whenever the game is loaded in order to reload the game.<ref name=\"versions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_versions.htm|title=Versions|publisher=Another World|accessdate=2008-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080802071301/http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_versions.htm| archivedate= 2008-08-02<!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref> Another small change between the Amiga and ST versions and the others was that Lester would yell as he grabs the vine in the first area if he was not being chased by the beast in these versions; this feature was omitted from most other versions.\n\nThe game was published in North America under the title ''Out of This World'' in order to avoid confusion with the popular but unrelated [[soap opera]] television series ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]''. Coincidentally, the science fiction [[sitcom]] ''[[Out of This World (TV series)|Out of This World]]'' aired at the same time as the game's USA-Canada release.\n\n=== Ports ===\nReviews praised the game's graphics, sound, and gameplay, but criticized its short span. Chahi, working for 16 hours a day for two months, responded with creating a new level just before the amphitheatre scene, when the alien friend rescues Lester at the end of a long dead-end corridor. Chahi said: \"I like this extra level a lot because it reinforces the close relationship between the hero and the alien by developing their mutual aid.\"<ref name=inter/> Also added were more dangers and more save points. This ended up being the 1992 [[DOS]] version, which was coded by Daniel Morais, and had the exact code wheel protection of the Amiga and ST versions. The [[Macintosh]] features higher resolution than the DOS version, but is otherwise identical.<ref name=versions/>\n\nThrough [[Interplay Entertainment]], the game was ported to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES), the [[Sega Genesis]] (Mega Drive), and the [[Apple IIGS]] in 1992. The SNES, [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] (3DO) and Apple IIGS ports each contain a [[prologue]] before the introduction begins, which consists of an entry that comes from Lester's diary. The Mega Drive port's prologue is different from that of the SNES and 3DO ports. The [[Sega CD]] version of ''Another World'' combines the original game (with CD-quality new music by Freitas) with the sequel, ''[[Heart of the Alien]]'',<ref name=versions/> and was released exclusively in North America as '''''Heart of the Alien: Out of This World Parts I and II'''''.\n\nAll of the console versions include some form of dynamic musical score during gameplay, and in the case of the Mega Drive conversion, use arrangements of the music originating in the SNES and Apple IIGS versions. This differs from other versions which only have music for the opening and ending segments. Interplay wanted to add additional tunes by [[Charles Deenen]]. They also wanted to exchange Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Freitas's music for a different soundtrack, but Chahi did not agree to the change and Delphine's lawyer helped to keep the original intro music.<ref name=versions/> The Apple IIGS and Super NES versions were programmed by [[Rebecca Heineman]], who said: \"Since Interplay wouldn't pay for a [[Super FX]] chip, I found a way to do it with [[Static random-access memory|static RAM]] on the cart and [[Direct memory access|DMA]] which got me a great frame rate. Interplay wouldn't pay for the static RAM either, so I ended up using Fast [[Read-only memory|ROM]] instruction. Interplay wouldn't pay for a 3.6 MHz ROM either. So, frustrated, I shoved my block move code into the DMA registers and use it as RAM running at 3.6 MHz. It worked. I got fast block moves on slow [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]] and made a game using polygons working on a 65816 with pure software rendering.\"<ref name=\"Interview: Rebecca Heineman\">{{cite interview | url=http://grokcode.com/106/interview-rebecca-heineman/ | title=Interview: Rebecca Heineman | publisher=GrokCode | interviewer=Jess Johnson | first=Rebecca | last=Heineman | subjectlink=Rebecca Heineman | accessdate=June 24, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904120546/http://grokcode.com/106/interview-rebecca-heineman/ | archivedate=2014-09-04 | url-status=live}}</ref> ''Another World'' is the only game directly ported from the Super NES to the Apple IIGS, which has the same [[WDC 65816/65802|65C816]] microprocessor.\n\nThe 3DO port was developed by Interplay in 1993, and features very detailed [[raster graphics]] backgrounds. However, Chahi believes that this actually detracts from the game, because the polygons do not fit in with this, and thus make the backgrounds look flat. The game's soundtrack was changed again, albeit without any legal troubles, due to Chahi's focus on a new project. Some new tunes were also added, all played from the disc, such as when Lester escapes the big pool in the first level and when he is grabbed by the guard that appears at the end. At the ending, there is a fragment of the introduction of the sequel, ''Heart of the Alien''. Also included in some versions of this 3DO release is a separate [[minigame]] \"Stalactites\", in which the player pushes up [[stalactite]] shapes falling from the top of the screen.<ref>{{cite book | title=3DO Games Secrets: Book Two | publisher=Semantix Design Llc | author=Meston, Zach | year=1996 | page=135 | isbn=9781884364204 | author2 = Arnold, J.

It was released as a limited collector's item in cartridge form, complete with a box and manual published by the association Retro-Gaming Connexion (RGC) in 2013. The game engine was rewritten especially for the Atari Jaguar to make use of the console's several processors: the GPU and [[blitter]] perform polygon rendering; the GPU performs on-the-fly data decompression; the DSP plays stereo music and sound effects; and the 68000 CPU performs JIT compilation and execution of the scripts. The Jaguar version is playable in the original graphics 16-color mode and ''Deluxe 15th Anniversary'' graphics 256-color mode. It can be played in normal and speed-run modes. It supports five languages: English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mleguludec.free.fr/product/AnotherWorld_Jaguar/ |title=Pr\u00e9-commande Another World (Jaguar) - asso RGC |publisher=Mleguludec.free.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430124741/http://mleguludec.free.fr/product/AnotherWorld_Jaguar/ |archive-date=2013-04-30 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrocollect.com/News/pre-orders-open-for-the-atari-jaguar-port-of-eric-chahis-another-world-out-of-this-world.html |title=Pre-Orders Open For The Atari Jaguar Port Of Eric Chahi's Another World (Out Of This World) |publisher=RetroCollect |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127134259/http://www.retrocollect.com/News/pre-orders-open-for-the-atari-jaguar-port-of-eric-chahis-another-world-out-of-this-world.html |archive-date=2013-01-27 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===''15th Anniversary''===\nAfter the release of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version targeted at [[Windows XP]].

The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself on a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.\n\n''Another World'' was developed by Chahi alone over a period of about two years, with only help with the soundtrack from Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Freitas. Chahi developed his own [[game engine]], completing all the game's art and animations in [[Vector graphics|vector]] form to reduce memory use, with some use of [[rotoscope|rotoscoping]] to help plan out character movements. Both narratively and gameplay-wise, he wanted the game to be told with little to no language or user-interface elements. The game was originally developed for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] but has since been widely ported to other contemporary systems, including home and portable consoles and mobile devices. Chahi has since overseen release of various anniversary releases of the game.\n\n''Another World'' was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and [[cutscene]]s, which earned the game praise among critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers, inspiring such titles as ''[[Ico]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'', ''[[Silent Hill (video game)|Silent Hill]]'', and Delphine's later ''[[Flashback (1992 video game)|Flashback]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Megadrive another world.png|thumb|left|The first level of the [[Sega Genesis]] version, with Lester climbing out of the pond into which he has been teleported.]]\n\n''Another World'' is a [[platform game]], featuring a control scheme where the player uses either the keyboard, [[joystick]] or [[gamepad]] to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation-specific actions, such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, the player's character Lester is unarmed. He is able to kick at small creatures, but is otherwise defenseless.\n\nLater in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web | url=http://uk.ign.com/videos/2012/03/26/86-laser-gun-another-world-igns-top-100-video-game-weapons | title=Tenchi Muyo GXP - Volume 1: Out of This World (Collector's Box) - #86: Laser Gun (Another World) - IGN's Top 100 Video Game Weapons | website=IGN | date=2012-03-26 | accessdate=2012-10-30}}</ref> Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.\n\nLester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard.<ref name=gr/> However, the game uses numerous [[saved game|checkpoints]] enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues as to what the player should do next, features no [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in an unintelligible alien language.<ref name=1up/><ref name=retro/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[protagonist]] of the game is Lester Knight Chaykin, a young genius [[physicist]]. In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his high-tech underground laboratory in his [[Ferrari 288 GTO]]<ref>{{cite book | title=Out of this World Manual | publisher=Interplay | author=Cousseau, Pierre | page=3}}</ref> during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a [[particle accelerator]], attempting to reconstruct what happened when the universe was born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and [[teleportation|teleporting]] Lester to a barren, alien planet.<ref name=1up/>\n\nAfter evading a number of dangerous indigenous animals, Lester is captured by a race of humanoid [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|aliens]] and taken to a subterranean prison camp. Lester escapes along with an alien captive known as \"Buddy\" and the two of them must evade capture while travelling through a series of dangerous environments, battling alien soldiers and wild creatures while solving numerous puzzles in order to survive. The duo traverse the prison complex, a cave system and a tower structure.<ref name=1up/><ref name=retro/> In the game's climax, Lester is severely wounded by one of the aliens, but with the help of his alien friend, manages to kill his attacker and escape. After reaching the top of the tower, Lester collapses, but is promptly joined by Buddy, who picks Lester up and the two escape on a dragon-like creature, flying off to the horizon.\n{{Clear}}\n==Development==\n[[File:Eric Chahi 2010 GDC Conference.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c9ric Chahi]], the creator of ''Another World'', at the 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]]]]\n\nThe game's French designer \u00c9ric Chahi had previously worked as a [[game programmer]] and then as a [[graphic designer]] for video games since 1983. It was the success of his earlier work with [[Paul Cuisset]] as a graphic designer for the [[adventure game]] ''[[Future Wars]]'' for [[Delphine Software International|Delphine Software]] and its royalties that gave him the chance to develop ''Another World'' \"without any constraint of any sort or any editorial pressure.\" After ''Future Wars'' was released in 1989, Chahi had the choice either to work on Cuisset's next game, ''[[Operation Stealth]]'', or create his own game. As \"there had been many books and tools released to develop easily on the [[Amiga]] at that time,\" Chahi felt confident that he could go back to programming.<ref name=inter/>\n\nThe game was influenced by works that Chahi liked at the time. The art and atmosphere were influenced by [[science fiction]] books such as ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'', artists such as [[Michael Whelan]], and comic illustrators such as [[Richard Corben]].<ref name=inter/> [[Manga]] such as ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' influenced the way it suggests a lot with very little, character blurring effects, and charging power attacks.<ref name=\"Eric Chahi Interview\">{{YouTube|GTb6zX7Hd5I|Another World Rotoscoping & Interview Eric Chahi}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1989, Chahi was impressed by the flat-color animations that the Amiga version of ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'' had and thought that it would be possible to use [[Euclidean vector|vector]] outlines to create a similar effect using much less [[Computer data storage|computer storage]]. After first attempting to write the graphical routines in [[C (programming language)|C]], he turned to [[assembly language]]. He wrote a [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]] routine for the [[Motorola 68000]] on an [[Atari ST]] to test his theory, with much success. Later, he found that he could run the code on the Amiga platform and achieve a [[frame rate]] of about 20 frames per second, later recognizing this as \"a major turning point in the creation of the game\" and the point where he knew the polygon approach would work.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33356/GDC_2011_Eric_Chahi_Retro_Postmortem_Another_World_.php | title = GDC 2011: Eric Chahi Retro Postmortem: Another World | first = Christian | last = Nutt | date =2011-03-03 | accessdate = 2011-03-03 | website = [[Gamasutra]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110306162759/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33356/GDC_2011_Eric_Chahi_Retro_Postmortem_Another_World_.php| archivedate= 2011-03-06 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref> He was able to take advantage of the Amiga's [[genlock]] capabilities to create [[rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] animations with the polygons, using video recordings of himself performing various actions. Though he had tried to use smaller polygons (which Chahi called \"pixigons\") to construct the backgrounds for the scenes based on [[Deluxe Paint]] artwork, the process of creating them was excruciatingly slow, and he returned to using [[bitmap]]ped images.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/><ref name=\"chahi realisation\">{{cite web | url=http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_realisation.htm|title=Another World: Realisation | publisher = [[\u00c9ric Chahi]] | accessdate = 2008-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080802062429/http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_realisation.htm| archivedate= 2 August 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box | width=25% | align=left | quote=''Another World'' was influenced by everything I liked at that time of my life&nbsp;\u2014 mainly by pictorial art, movies and science fiction books, like ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' or ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]''.

Because he wanted to create a dramatic, cinematic experience, the game features no HUD or dialog, giving the player only a representation of the surrounding game world during both gameplay elements and the cutscenes progressing the story. However, with no idea of the technical limitations he would face while building out the story, he focused more on creating ambiance, rhythmic pacing, and narrative tension to the game.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/> Chahi resorted to developing his own tool with a new programming language through [[GFA BASIC]] coupled with the game's engine in Devpac assembler, to control and animate the game, interpreted in real-time by the game engine, effectively creating his own animation sequencer.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/><ref name=\"chahi realisation\"/>\n\nWith the creation of the tools needed for building out the rest of the game by December 1989, Chahi began working on the introductory sequence as a means to validate the full capacities of his engine. The introduction sequence also gave Chahi the chance to explore the types of cinematics he could create through the engine. Chahi later considered this the \"first step in the improvisation process\" that he used throughout the rest of development. He finished the game's introduction sequence in early 1990 and started working on the first [[Level (video gaming)|level]]. Chahi worked at the game at a linear pace, developing each section of the game in chronological order and influenced by his own personal feelings and attitude at the time. For example, as Chahi recognized he was trying to create a game on his own, the first portions of the game evoke loneliness and isolation, reflecting Chahi's mood at the time. He did not have the original intention of the character meeting an ally, but again described the improvisation approach led him to include the alien friend, and had included specific cinematics that showed a close up of the alien to help the player imagine this world.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/>\n\nLater in the game's development, Chahi added laser pistols, including the one that Lester carries for several effects. The idea was influenced by the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, but added depth to the gameplay by giving the player more options. He also found that repeated laser fire by the enemies helped to enunciate the rhythm of the game. Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/>\n\nAfter 17 months of development, Chahi was only about one-third finished with the game, and realized that this rate would have been impractical. He began to take steps to simplify the development, including reusing background graphics and creating building blocks that allowed him to focus more on the game's puzzles. At the same time, he began to seek a publisher for the game. He first spoke to his former employer, Delphine Software, but also sought other distributors. One, [[Virgin Interactive]], was favourable to Chahi's game but had suggested that he change it to a [[Point and click|point-and-click]] style adventure game. Chahi had considered changing the game in line with this request but realized \"the effort to do this would have been too huge, and some friends who played the game loved it.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/03/03/how-another-world-almost-became-a-point-and-click-adventure/ | title=How 'Another World' almost became a point-and-click adventure | publisher=joystiq.com | date=2001-03-03 | accessdate=2013-05-09 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010001821/http://www.joystiq.com/2011/03/03/how-another-world-almost-became-a-point-and-click-adventure/ | archive-date=2012-10-10 | url-status=dead}}</ref> Ultimately, he accepted Delphine's offer in June 1991, and set a tentative release date in November. To meet this deadline, Chahi used [[storyboard]]s to sketch out the rest of the game's plot, balancing the overall pacing of the game. One ending captured on these storyboards, but abandoned, was Lester becoming the leader of the alien world. Chahi also argued for his own cover art for the game even with the time crunch for release; he had been disappointed in cover art that was foisted on his games by previous publishers and insisted he be allowed to create it for this game.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-world-creator-on-improvisational-design/1100-6301814/ | title = Another World creator on improvisational design | first = Brendan | last = Sinclair | date = March 4, 2011 | accessdate = September 15, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180916060122/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-world-creator-on-improvisational-design/1100-6301814/ | archive-date = 2018-09-16 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> The game was finished in 1991, which inspired the game's tagline: \"It took six days to create the Earth. ''Another World'' took two years\"; Chahi noted his own exhaustion at completing this project is mirrored in the near-death of Lester at the end of the game.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/>\n\nUpon publishing, Delphine did not perform a playtest of the full game, only having previously tested the first portion of the game. Delphine's U.S. publisher [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] undertook a full playtest and Chahi fixed a number of bugs that arose from this. Interplay had also requested additional changes in the game, including making the game longer and changing the game's introduction music. Chahi was adamant about retaining the game's opening music, and had attempted to change Interplay's minds by sending them an \"infinite fax\", a looped piece of paper, with the message \"keep the original intro music\" on it. Only when Delphine's lawyer got involved and told Interplay they legally could not change the music did Interplay relax this requirement.<ref name=\"gdc postmortem\"/><ref name=versions/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe game's music was composed by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Freitas. The music was influenced by film soundtracks such as ''[[Back to the Future]]''.<ref name=\"Eric Chahi Interview\"/> Black Screen Records released CD and vinyl versions of the 18-song soundtrack in August 2017.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blackscreenrecords.limitedrun.com/products/597546-jean-francois-freitas-another-world-official-soundtrack | title = Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Freitas - Another World: Official Soundtrack | access-date = 2018-05-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180503042130/http://blackscreenrecords.limitedrun.com/products/597546-jean-francois-freitas-another-world-official-soundtrack | archive-date = 2018-05-03 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[Image:Out Of This World - Amiga.png|thumb|Screenshot of the introduction [[cutscene]] to the final level from the original [[Amiga]] version.

These versions received less [[Playtest|play-testing]] than other versions, making for a less-fluid game, but the Amiga's sound capabilities afford it a high sound quality compared to contemporary ports. The game released on the Atari ST is identical, but with a less refined sound, and its colors are less sharp than on Amiga. These versions had [[code wheel]] protection that made it difficult to use unauthorized copies, forcing the player to enter a code (series of figures) looked up from a code wheel that came with the game. The player had to turn the wheel according to the number that was requested in the screen whenever the game is loaded in order to reload the game.<ref name=\"versions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_versions.htm|title=Versions|publisher=Another World|accessdate=2008-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080802071301/http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_versions.htm| archivedate= 2008-08-02<!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref> Another small change between the Amiga and ST versions and the others was that Lester would yell as he grabs the vine in the first area if he was not being chased by the beast in these versions; this feature was omitted from most other versions.\n\nThe game was published in North America under the title ''Out of This World'' in order to avoid confusion with the popular but unrelated [[soap opera]] television series ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]''. Coincidentally, the science fiction [[sitcom]] ''[[Out of This World (TV series)|Out of This World]]'' aired at the same time as the game's USA-Canada release.\n\n=== Ports ===\nReviews praised the game's graphics, sound, and gameplay, but criticized its short span. Chahi, working for 16 hours a day for two months, responded with creating a new level just before the amphitheatre scene, when the alien friend rescues Lester at the end of a long dead-end corridor. Chahi said: \"I like this extra level a lot because it reinforces the close relationship between the hero and the alien by developing their mutual aid.\"<ref name=inter/> Also added were more dangers and more save points. This ended up being the 1992 [[DOS]] version, which was coded by Daniel Morais, and had the exact code wheel protection of the Amiga and ST versions. The [[Macintosh]] features higher resolution than the DOS version, but is otherwise identical.<ref name=versions/>\n\nThrough [[Interplay Entertainment]], the game was ported to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES), the [[Sega Genesis]] (Mega Drive), and the [[Apple IIGS]] in 1992. The SNES, [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] (3DO) and Apple IIGS ports each contain a [[prologue]] before the introduction begins, which consists of an entry that comes from Lester's diary. The Mega Drive port's prologue is different from that of the SNES and 3DO ports. The [[Sega CD]] version of ''Another World'' combines the original game (with CD-quality new music by Freitas) with the sequel, ''[[Heart of the Alien]]'',<ref name=versions/> and was released exclusively in North America as '''''Heart of the Alien: Out of This World Parts I and II'''''.\n\nAll of the console versions include some form of dynamic musical score during gameplay, and in the case of the Mega Drive conversion, use arrangements of the music originating in the SNES and Apple IIGS versions. This differs from other versions which only have music for the opening and ending segments. Interplay wanted to add additional tunes by [[Charles Deenen]]. They also wanted to exchange Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Freitas's music for a different soundtrack, but Chahi did not agree to the change and Delphine's lawyer helped to keep the original intro music.<ref name=versions/> The Apple IIGS and Super NES versions were programmed by [[Rebecca Heineman]], who said: \"Since Interplay wouldn't pay for a [[Super FX]] chip, I found a way to do it with [[Static random-access memory|static RAM]] on the cart and [[Direct memory access|DMA]] which got me a great frame rate. Interplay wouldn't pay for the static RAM either, so I ended up using Fast [[Read-only memory|ROM]] instruction. Interplay wouldn't pay for a 3.6 MHz ROM either. So, frustrated, I shoved my block move code into the DMA registers and use it as RAM running at 3.6 MHz. It worked. I got fast block moves on slow [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]] and made a game using polygons working on a 65816 with pure software rendering.\"<ref name=\"Interview: Rebecca Heineman\">{{cite interview | url=http://grokcode.com/106/interview-rebecca-heineman/ | title=Interview: Rebecca Heineman | publisher=GrokCode | interviewer=Jess Johnson | first=Rebecca | last=Heineman | subjectlink=Rebecca Heineman | accessdate=June 24, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904120546/http://grokcode.com/106/interview-rebecca-heineman/ | archivedate=2014-09-04 | url-status=live}}</ref> ''Another World'' is the only game directly ported from the Super NES to the Apple IIGS, which has the same [[WDC 65816/65802|65C816]] microprocessor.\n\nThe 3DO port was developed by Interplay in 1993, and features very detailed [[raster graphics]] backgrounds. However, Chahi believes that this actually detracts from the game, because the polygons do not fit in with this, and thus make the backgrounds look flat. The game's soundtrack was changed again, albeit without any legal troubles, due to Chahi's focus on a new project. Some new tunes were also added, all played from the disc, such as when Lester escapes the big pool in the first level and when he is grabbed by the guard that appears at the end. At the ending, there is a fragment of the introduction of the sequel, ''Heart of the Alien''. Also included in some versions of this 3DO release is a separate [[minigame]] \"Stalactites\", in which the player pushes up [[stalactite]] shapes falling from the top of the screen.<ref>{{cite book | title=3DO Games Secrets: Book Two | publisher=Semantix Design Llc | author=Meston, Zach | year=1996 | page=135 | isbn=9781884364204 | author2 = Arnold, J.

Magic Productions then offered to port the game to [[mobile phone]]s, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game's playability could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming certain parts of the script and made the graphics' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones' low resolutions.<ref name=versions/> In July 2005, almost a decade and a half after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the [[Symbian]] operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions.<ref name=magic/> In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered [[Pocket PC]] version for [[Windows Mobile 5.0]] OS or later in [[Graphics display resolution#QVGA|QVGA]] (320\u00d7240 resolution).<ref name=\"magic\">{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/15/out-of-this-world-remastered-with-high-res-graphics/ | title=Out of this World remastered with high-res graphics | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Joystiq | date=2006-04-15 | accessdate=2012-10-30 | author=Grant, Christopher | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106204127/http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/15/out-of-this-world-remastered-with-high-res-graphics/ | archive-date=2012-11-06 | url-status=dead}}</ref> Telcogames entered administration in 2008, closing the Magic Productions studio.

It was released as a limited collector's item in cartridge form, complete with a box and manual published by the association Retro-Gaming Connexion (RGC) in 2013. The game engine was rewritten especially for the Atari Jaguar to make use of the console's several processors: the GPU and [[blitter]] perform polygon rendering; the GPU performs on-the-fly data decompression; the DSP plays stereo music and sound effects; and the 68000 CPU performs JIT compilation and execution of the scripts. The Jaguar version is playable in the original graphics 16-color mode and ''Deluxe 15th Anniversary'' graphics 256-color mode. It can be played in normal and speed-run modes. It supports five languages: English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mleguludec.free.fr/product/AnotherWorld_Jaguar/ |title=Pr\u00e9-commande Another World (Jaguar) - asso RGC |publisher=Mleguludec.free.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430124741/http://mleguludec.free.fr/product/AnotherWorld_Jaguar/ |archive-date=2013-04-30 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrocollect.com/News/pre-orders-open-for-the-atari-jaguar-port-of-eric-chahis-another-world-out-of-this-world.html |title=Pre-Orders Open For The Atari Jaguar Port Of Eric Chahi's Another World (Out Of This World) |publisher=RetroCollect |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127134259/http://www.retrocollect.com/News/pre-orders-open-for-the-atari-jaguar-port-of-eric-chahis-another-world-out-of-this-world.html |archive-date=2013-01-27 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===''15th Anniversary''===\nAfter the release of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version targeted at [[Windows XP]].

Born in [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], he grew up in the United States from the age of 11 and became an activist while attending [[Howard University]].  He eventually developed the [[Black Power movement]], first while leading the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), later serving as the \"Honorary Prime Minister\" of the [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP), and lastly as a leader of the [[All-African People's Revolutionary Party]] (A-APRP).<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/people/stokely-carmichael \"Stokely Carmichael\" biography], ''Freedom Riders'', American Experience website (PBS).</ref>\n\nCarmichael was one of the original SNCC [[freedom riders]] of 1961 under [[Diane Nash]]'s leadership. He became a major voting rights activist in [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] after being mentored by [[Ella Baker]] and [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]]. Like most young people in SNCC, he became disillusioned with the [[two-party system]] after the 1964 Democratic National Convention failed to recognize the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] as official delegates from the state. Carmichael chose to develop independent black political organizations, such as the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] and, for a time, the national Black Panther Party. Inspired by [[Malcolm X]]'s example, he articulated a philosophy of \"[[black power]]\", and popularized it both by provocative speeches and more sober writings. Carmichael became one of the most popular and controversial Black leaders of the late 1960s. [[J. Edgar Hoover]], director of the FBI, secretly identified Carmichael as the man most likely to succeed Malcolm X as America's \"black messiah\". The FBI targeted him for personal destruction through its [[COINTELPRO]] program, and Carmichael fled to Africa in 1968. He re-established himself in [[Ghana]], and then [[Guinea]] by 1969. There he adopted the new name of Kwame Ture and began campaigning internationally for [[revolutionary socialist]] Pan-Africanism.\n\n==Early life==\nStokely Standiford Churchill Carmichael was born in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], Stokely Carmichael attended Tranquility School there before moving to [[Harlem]], [[New York City|New York]], in 1952 at the age of 11, to rejoin his parents.

At that time, most blacks in Mississippi had been disenfranchised since passage of a new constitution in 1890. The summer project was to prepare them to register to vote and to conduct a parallel registration movement to demonstrate how much people wanted to vote. Grassroots activists organized the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP), as the regular Democratic Party did not represent African Americans in the state. At the end of Freedom Summer, Carmichael went to the [[1964 Democratic Convention]] in support of the MFDP, which sought to have its delegation seated.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim64b.htm#1964fsfs \"Mississippi Summer Project\"], Civil Rights Movement Veterans website.</ref> But, the MFDP delegates were refused voting rights by the [[Democratic National Committee]], who chose to seat the regular white [[Jim Crow]] delegation. Carmichael, along with many SNCC staff members, left the convention with a profound sense of disillusionment in the American political system, and what he later called \"totalitarian liberal opinion\".<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim64b.htm#1964b-fsmfdpfallout \"MFDP Challenge to the Democratic Convention\"], Civil Rights Movement Veterans website.</ref>\n\n===Selma to Montgomery marches===\nHaving developed an aversion to working with the Democratic Party after the 1964 convention experience, Carmichael decided to leave the MFDP.  Instead he began exploring SNCC projects in Alabama in 1965. During the period of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma to Montgomery Marches]], he was recruited by [[James Forman]] to participate in a \"second front\" to stage protests at the Alabama State Capitol in March 1965. Carmichael became disillusioned with the growing struggles between SNCC and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), who opposed Forman's strategy. He thought SCLC was working with affiliated black churches to undercut it.<ref>Kwame Ture, ''Ready for Revolution: The Life and Struggles of Stokely Carmichael'' (Simon & Schuster, 2003), p. 441\u2013446</ref>  He was also frustrated to be drawn again into nonviolent confrontations with police, which he no longer found empowering.

He initiated a grassroots project in \"Bloody Lowndes\" County, along the march route.<ref>Taylor Branch, ''At Canaan's Edge: America in the King Years 1965\u20131968'' (Simon & Schuster, 2006), pp. 132, 192.</ref> This was a county known for white violence against blacks during this era, where SCLC and Dr. King had tried and failed to organize its black residents.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim65b.htm#1965lowndes \"1965-Cracking Lowndes\" Civil Rights Movement Veterans timeline]</ref> In the period from 1877 to 1950, Lowndes County had 14  documented [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings of African Americans]].<ref name=\"eji\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-second-edition-supplement-by-county.pdf ''Lynching in America'', 2nd edition], Supplement by County, p. 2</ref>\n\n===Lowndes County Freedom Organization===\nIn 1965, working as a SNCC activist in the black-majority [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County]], Carmichael helped to increase the number of registered black voters from 70 to 2,600\u2014300 more than the number of registered white voters.<ref name=\"NYTobit\"/> Black voters had essentially been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] by Alabama's constitution passed by white Democrats in 1901. After Congressional passage in August of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the federal government was authorized to oversee and enforce their rights. But there was still tremendous resistance by whites in the area, which endangered activists. Black residents and voters organized and widely supported the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] (LCFO), a party that had the [[black panther]] as its mascot, over the white-dominated local [[Southern Democrats#American Civil War and post-Reconstruction|Democratic Party]], whose mascot was a white rooster. Since federal protection from violent voter suppression by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other white opponents was sporadic, most Lowndes County activists openly carried arms.\n\nAlthough black residents and voters outnumbered whites in Lowndes, their candidate lost the county-wide election of 1965. In 1966, several LCFO candidates ran for office in the general election but failed to win.<ref>[http://www.blackpast.org/aah/lowndes-county-freedom-organization Lowndes County Freedom Organization] Black Past.org</ref> In 1970, the LCFO merged with the statewide Democratic Party, and former LCFO candidates won their first offices in the county.<ref>\"[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1781 Lowndes County Freedom Organization\"], ''Encyclopedia of Alabama''</ref><ref>[http://freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/DOC513_scans/Lowndes_Co/513.LowndesCO.bpp.6.1966.pdf \"The Black Panther Party\" (pamphlet)], Merrit Publishers, June 1966.</ref><!-- Anything more to say about this? Not enough people registered in 1966 who supported the candidates, or was there fraud? -->\n\n===Chair of SNCC and Black Power===\nCarmichael became chairman of SNCC in 1966, taking over from [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], an activist who later was elected to the US Congress, and has served since then. [[James Meredith]] had initiated a solitary [[March Against Fear]] in early June of that year from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi. He did not want the big civil rights organizations or leaders involved, but was willing to have individual black men join him. On his second day out, Meredith was shot and wounded by a white sniper, and had to be hospitalized. Civil rights leaders vowed to finish the march in his name.\n\nCarmichael joined [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Floyd McKissick]], [[Cleveland Sellers]] and others to continue Meredith's march. He was arrested in [[Greenwood, Mississippi|Greenwood]] during the march. After his release, he gave his first \"[[Black Power]]\" speech at a rally that night, using the phrase to urge [[black pride]] and socio-economic independence:\n\n{{quote|It is a call for black people in this country to unite, to recognize their heritage, to build a sense of community. It is a call for black people to define their own goals, to lead their own organizations.}}\n\nAccording to historian [[David J. Garrow]], a few days after Carmichael spoke about \"Black Power\" slogan at the rally during \"Meredith March Against Fear\", he told King: \"Martin, I deliberately decided to raise this issue on the march in order to give it a national forum and force you to take a stand for Black Power.\" King responded, \"I have been used before. One more time won't hurt.\"<ref>David J. Garrow, ''Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference'' (1986).</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nWhile Black Power was not a new concept, Carmichael's speech brought it into the spotlight. It became a rallying cry for young [[African Americans]] across the country who were frustrated about slow progress in civil rights, even after federal legislation had been passed to strengthen the effort. Everywhere that Black Power spread, if accepted, credit was given to the prominent Carmichael. If the concept was condemned, he was held responsible and blamed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bennet Jr.|first=Lerone|title=Stokely Carmichael Architect of Black Power|newspaper=Ebony Magazine|date=September 1966}}</ref> According to Carmichael: \"Black Power meant black people coming together to form a political force and either electing representatives or forcing their representatives to speak to their needs [rather than relying on established parties]\".<ref>\"Stokely Carmichael\", ''King Encyclopedia'', The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute, Stanford University. Accessed November 20, 2006.</ref> Strongly influenced by the work of [[Frantz Fanon]] and his landmark book ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'', along with others such as [[Malcolm X]], Carmichael led SNCC to become more radical. The group focused on Black Power as its core goal and ideology.\n\nDuring the controversial [[Atlanta Project]] in 1966, SNCC, under the local leadership of Bill Ware, engaged in a voter drive to promote the candidacy of [[Julian Bond]] from an Atlanta district for a seat in the [[Georgia State Legislature]]. Ware excluded Northern white SNCC members from working on this drive.

Accessed March 17, 2007.</ref>\n\nCarmichael considered [[nonviolence]] to be a tactic, as opposed to an underlying principle, which separated him from civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Carmichael criticized civil rights leaders who called for the [[Racial integration|integration]] of African Americans into existing institutions of the [[middle-class]] mainstream.\n\n<blockquote>Now, several people have been upset because we've said that integration was irrelevant when initiated by blacks, and that in fact it was a subterfuge, an insidious subterfuge, for the maintenance of [[white supremacy]]. Now we maintain that in the past six years or so, this country has been feeding us a \"[[thalidomide]] drug of integration\", and that some Negroes have been walking down a dream street talking about sitting next to white people; and that that does not begin to solve the problem; that when we went to Mississippi we did not go to sit next to [[Ross Barnett]]; we did not go to sit next to [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]]; we went to get them out of our way; and that people ought to understand that; that we were never fighting for the right to integrate, we were fighting against [[white supremacy]]. Now, then, in order to understand white supremacy we must dismiss the fallacious notion that white people can give anybody their freedom. No man can give anybody his freedom. A man is born free. You may enslave a man after he is born free, and that is in fact what this country does. It enslaves black people after they're born, so that the only acts that white people can do is to stop denying black people their freedom; that is, they must stop ''denying'' freedom. They never give it to anyone.<ref name=Speech>Stokely Carmichael, [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/stokelycarmichaelblackpower.html \"Black Power\" speech].

It encouraged the SDS to focus on militant [[Draft resistance|anti-draft]] resistance. At an SDS-organized conference at [[UC Berkeley]] in October 1966, Carmichael challenged the white left to escalate their resistance to the military draft in a manner similar to the black movement.<ref>Joshua Bloom and Waldo E.

Hamilton]]. It is a first-person reflection on his experiences in [[SNCC]] and his dissatisfaction with the direction of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the late 1960s.  Throughout the work he directly and indirectly criticizes the established leadership of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] and [[NAACP]] for their tactics and results, often claiming that they were accepting symbols instead of change.\n\nHe promoted what he calls \"political modernization\".  This idea included three major concepts: \"1) questioning old values and institutions of the society; 2) searching for new and different forms of political structure to solve political and economic problems; and, 3) broadening the base of political participation to include more people in the decision-making process\".<ref name=\"1941-1998. 1992\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/blackpowerpoliti00carm_0|title=Black power : the politics of liberation in America|author=Carmichael, Stokely|date=1992|publisher=Vintage Books|others=Hamilton, Charles V.|isbn=0679743138|edition=Vintage|location=New York|oclc=26096713}}</ref> By questioning \"old values and institutions\", Carmichael was referring not only to the established Black leadership of the time, but also to the values and institutions of the nation as a whole. He criticized the emphasis on the American \"middle-class\".  \"The values\", he said, \"of that class are based on material aggrandizement, not the expansion of humanity.\" (40)  Carmichael believed that blacks were being lured to enter the \"middle-class\" as a trap, in which they would be assimilated into the white world by turning their backs on others of their race who were still suffering.  This assimilation, he thought, was an inherent indictment of blackness and validation of whiteness as the preferred state. He said, \"Thus we reject the goal of assimilation into middle-class America because the values of that class are in themselves anti-humanist and because that class as a social force perpetuates racism.\"<ref name=\"1941-1998. 1992\"/>\n\nSecondly, Carmichael discussed searching for different forms of political structure to solve political and economic problems.  At the time, the established forms of political structure were the SCLC and the NAACP.  These groups were religiously and academically based and focused their attention on the concepts of non-violence and steady legal and legislative change, situated within the established systems and structures of the United States. Carmichael rejected these ideas, basing his assertions on his lived experience. He explores the development of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party|Mississippi Freedom Democrats]], the 1966 local election in [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County, AL]], and the political history of the town of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]].  He chose these examples as places where blacks changed the system by way of political and legal maneuvering within the system. But Carmichael said that they ultimately failed to achieve more than the bare minimum change. In the process, he believed they reinforced the political and legal structures that were perpetuating the racism they were fighting.\n\nIn response to these failures and to offer a way forward, Carmichael discussed the concept of coalition with regard to the Civil Rights Movement. The leadership of the movement had affirmed that anyone who truly believed in their cause was welcome to join and march. Carmichael offered a different vision. Influenced by the ideas of [[Frantz Fanon|Franz Fanon]] in ''[[The Wretched of the Earth|Wretched of the Earth]]'', wherein two groups were not \"complementary\" (could have no overlap) until they were mutually exclusive (were on an equal power footing economically, socially, politically, etc.), Carmichael said that blacks in the United States had to unite and build their power independent of the white structure. Otherwise they would never be able to build a coalition that would function for both parties, not just the dominant one. He said that \"we want to establish the grounds on which we feel political coalitions can be viable.\"<ref name=\"1941-1998. 1992\"/>  For this to happen, Carmichael argued that blacks had to address three myths regarding coalition. First, \"that the interests of black people are identical with the interests of certain liberal, labor, or other reform groups.\" Second, that a viable coalition can be created between \"the politically and economically secure and the politically and economically insecure\". And third, that a coalition can be \"sustained on a moral, friendly, sentimental basis; by appeals to conscience.\" He believed that each of these myths showed the need for two groups to be mutually exclusive, and on relatively equal footing, for them to be in a viable coalition.\n\nThis philosophy, grounded in the independence literature of Africa and Latin America (Fanon), became the basis for a great deal of Carmichael's work. He believed that the Black Power Movement had to be developed outside the white power structure.\n\nHe also continued as a strong critic of the [[Vietnam War]], and imperialism in general. During this period he traveled and lectured extensively throughout the world; visiting [[Guinea]], [[North Vietnam]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], and [[Cuba]]. Carmichael became more clearly identified with the [[Black Panther Party]] as its \"Honorary Prime Minister\".<ref name=\"WPOST\" /> During this period, he acted more as a speaker than an organizer, traveling throughout the country and internationally advocating for his vision of Black Power.<ref name=\"Cobb\">[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/473.html Charlie Cobb, \"From Stokely Carmichael to Kwame Ture\"], ''Hartford '',  Accessed March 17, 2007.</ref>\n\nCarmichael lamented the 1967 execution of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], saying:\n\n{{quote|The death of Che Guevara places a responsibility on all revolutionaries of the World to redouble their decision to fight on to the final defeat of [[Imperialism]].

He led a group through the streets, demanding that businesses close out of respect. Although he tried to prevent violence, the situation escalated beyond his control.

This book expounds an explicitly [[socialism|socialist]] [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] vision, which he retained for the rest of his life.

His mentor Kwame Nkrumah had many ideas for unifying the African continent, and Ture extended the scope of these ideas to the entire African diaspora. He was a Central Committee member during his association with the A-APRP and made many speeches in the Party's behalf.<ref>[http://socialjustice.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/index.php/All-African_People's_Revolutionary_Party \"Social Justice Movements: All-African People's Revolutionary Party\"], Columbia University website</ref>\n\nTure did not simply study with S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 and Kwame Nkrumah. The latter had been designated honorary co-president of Guinea after he was deposed by the US-backed coup in Ghana.<ref>[http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/kwame-nkrumah-fathered-pan-africanism \"Kwame Nkrumah\"] at African American Registry.</ref> Ture worked overtly and covertly to \"Take Nkrumah Back to Ghana\" (according to the movement's slogan). He became a member of the Democratic Party of Guinea (PDG), the revolutionary ruling party. He sought Nkrumah's permission to launch the All-African People's Revolutionary Party (A-APRP), which Nkrumah had called for in his book ''Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare''. After several discussions, Nkrumah gave his blessing.\n\nTure was convinced that the A-APRP was needed as a permanent mass-based organization in all countries where people of African descent lived. For the last decades of his life, a period often ignored by popular media, Ture worked for full-time as an organizer of the Party. He spoke on its behalf on several continents, at innumerable college campuses, in community centers, and other venues. He was instrumental in strengthening ties between the African/Black liberation movement and several revolutionary or progressive organizations, both African and non-African. Notable among them were the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) of the United States, [[New Jewel Movement]] ([[Grenada]]), [[National Joint Action Committee]] (NJAC) of Trinidad and Tobago, [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (South Africa) and the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]].\n\nRoutinely, Ture was regarded as the leader of the A-APRP, but his only titles were \"Organizer\" and Central Committee member. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the A-APRP began each May to sponsor African Liberation Day (ALD), a continuation of the African Freedom Day begun by Kwame Nkrumah in 1958 in Ghana.<ref>[http://www.africanliberationday.net/?q=history ALD History], African Liberation Day.</ref> Although the party was involved in or was primary or co-sponsor of other ALD annual observances, marches, and rallies around the world, the best-known and largest event was held annually in Washington, DC, usually at [[Meridian Hill Park]] (also known as Malcolm X Park) at 16th and W Streets, NW.\n\nWhile making his home in Guinea, Ture traveled frequently. Britain and his birth country, Trinidad and Tobago, barred him from speaking at one time or another for fear that he would arouse African-descended people in those countries. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Ture became the world's most active and prominent exponent of pan-Africanism, defined by Nkrumah and the A-APRP as \"The Liberation and Unification of Africa Under Scientific Socialism\".\n\nTure often returned to speak to audiences of thousands (including students and townspeople) at his alma mater, Howard University, and at other campuses. The Party worked to recruit students and other youth, and Ture hoped to attract them through his speeches. He also worked to raise the political consciousness of African/Black people in general. He formed the A-APRP with the initial goal of putting \"Africa\" on the lips of Black people throughout the [[African Diaspora|diaspora]], knowing that many did not consciously or positively relate to the homeland of their ancestors. Ture was convinced that the party significantly raised international black consciousness of Pan-Africanism.\n\nUnder his leadership, the A-APRP organized the All African Women's Revolutionary Union and the [[Sammy Younge Jr.]] Brigade (named after the first black college student to die during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement) as component organizations.\n\nTure and Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] admired each other, sharing a common opposition to imperialism. In Ture's final letter, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>It was Fidel Castro who before the OLAS (Organization of Latin American States) Conference said \"if imperialism touches one grain of hair on his head, we shall not let the fact pass without retaliation.\" It was he, who on his own behalf, asked them all to stay in contact with me when I returned to the United States to offer me protection.<ref>[http://www.kwameture.com/ \"Stokely Carmichael Interview Part 1\"], KwameTure.com.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTure was ill when he gave his final speech at Howard University.

He eventually developed the [[Black Power movement]], first while leading the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), later serving as the \"Honorary Prime Minister\" of the [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP), and lastly as a leader of the [[All-African People's Revolutionary Party]] (A-APRP).<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/people/stokely-carmichael \"Stokely Carmichael\" biography], ''Freedom Riders'', American Experience website (PBS).</ref>\n\nCarmichael was one of the original SNCC [[freedom riders]] of 1961 under [[Diane Nash]]'s leadership. He became a major voting rights activist in [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] after being mentored by [[Ella Baker]] and [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]]. Like most young people in SNCC, he became disillusioned with the [[two-party system]] after the 1964 Democratic National Convention failed to recognize the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] as official delegates from the state. Carmichael chose to develop independent black political organizations, such as the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] and, for a time, the national Black Panther Party. Inspired by [[Malcolm X]]'s example, he articulated a philosophy of \"[[black power]]\", and popularized it both by provocative speeches and more sober writings. Carmichael became one of the most popular and controversial Black leaders of the late 1960s. [[J. Edgar Hoover]], director of the FBI, secretly identified Carmichael as the man most likely to succeed Malcolm X as America's \"black messiah\". The FBI targeted him for personal destruction through its [[COINTELPRO]] program, and Carmichael fled to Africa in 1968. He re-established himself in [[Ghana]], and then [[Guinea]] by 1969. There he adopted the new name of Kwame Ture and began campaigning internationally for [[revolutionary socialist]] Pan-Africanism.\n\n==Early life==\nStokely Standiford Churchill Carmichael was born in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], Stokely Carmichael attended Tranquility School there before moving to [[Harlem]], [[New York City|New York]], in 1952 at the age of 11, to rejoin his parents.

He and his colleagues were only allowed to shower twice a week, were not allowed books or any other personal effects, and were at times placed in maximum security to isolate them from one another.<ref name=FreedomRides&WhiteBacklash>{{cite web|title=Freedom Rides and White Backlash|url=http://stokely-carmichael.com/stokely-carmichael-part-6-freedom-rides-and-white-backlash/|accessdate=April 8, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508085731/http://stokely-carmichael.com/stokely-carmichael-part-6-freedom-rides-and-white-backlash/#|archive-date=2011-05-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCarmichael said about the Parchman Farm sheriff:\n\n<blockquote>The sheriff acted like he was scared of black folks and he came up with some beautiful things.

He knew their situation was serious.\n\n<blockquote>What with the range of ideology, religious belief, political commitment and background, age, and experience, something interesting was always going on. Because no matter our differences, this group had one thing in common, moral stubbornness. Whatever we believed, we really believed and were not at all shy about advancing. We were where we were only because of our willingness to affirm our beliefs even at the risk of physical injury. So it was never dull on death row.<ref name=\"Arsenault 2006 362\u2013363\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn a 1964 interview with author [[Robert Penn Warren]], Carmichael reflected on his motives for going on the rides, saying,\n\n<blockquote>I thought I have to go because you've got to keep the issue alive, and you've got to show the Southerners that you're not gonna be scared off, as we've been scared off in the past.

At that time, most blacks in Mississippi had been disenfranchised since passage of a new constitution in 1890. The summer project was to prepare them to register to vote and to conduct a parallel registration movement to demonstrate how much people wanted to vote. Grassroots activists organized the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP), as the regular Democratic Party did not represent African Americans in the state. At the end of Freedom Summer, Carmichael went to the [[1964 Democratic Convention]] in support of the MFDP, which sought to have its delegation seated.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim64b.htm#1964fsfs \"Mississippi Summer Project\"], Civil Rights Movement Veterans website.</ref> But, the MFDP delegates were refused voting rights by the [[Democratic National Committee]], who chose to seat the regular white [[Jim Crow]] delegation. Carmichael, along with many SNCC staff members, left the convention with a profound sense of disillusionment in the American political system, and what he later called \"totalitarian liberal opinion\".<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim64b.htm#1964b-fsmfdpfallout \"MFDP Challenge to the Democratic Convention\"], Civil Rights Movement Veterans website.</ref>\n\n===Selma to Montgomery marches===\nHaving developed an aversion to working with the Democratic Party after the 1964 convention experience, Carmichael decided to leave the MFDP.  Instead he began exploring SNCC projects in Alabama in 1965. During the period of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma to Montgomery Marches]], he was recruited by [[James Forman]] to participate in a \"second front\" to stage protests at the Alabama State Capitol in March 1965. Carmichael became disillusioned with the growing struggles between SNCC and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), who opposed Forman's strategy. He thought SCLC was working with affiliated black churches to undercut it.<ref>Kwame Ture, ''Ready for Revolution: The Life and Struggles of Stokely Carmichael'' (Simon & Schuster, 2003), p. 441\u2013446</ref>  He was also frustrated to be drawn again into nonviolent confrontations with police, which he no longer found empowering.  After seeing protesters brutally beaten again, he collapsed from stress, and his colleagues urged him to leave the city.<ref>Taylor Branch, ''At Canaan's Edge: America in the King Years 1965\u20131968'' (Simon & Schuster, 2006), pp. 109\u2013110</ref>\n\nWithin a week, Carmichael returned to protesting, this time in Selma, to participate in the final march along Route 80 to the state capital.  He initiated a grassroots project in \"Bloody Lowndes\" County, along the march route.<ref>Taylor Branch, ''At Canaan's Edge: America in the King Years 1965\u20131968'' (Simon & Schuster, 2006), pp. 132, 192.</ref> This was a county known for white violence against blacks during this era, where SCLC and Dr. King had tried and failed to organize its black residents.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim65b.htm#1965lowndes \"1965-Cracking Lowndes\" Civil Rights Movement Veterans timeline]</ref> In the period from 1877 to 1950, Lowndes County had 14  documented [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings of African Americans]].<ref name=\"eji\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-second-edition-supplement-by-county.pdf ''Lynching in America'', 2nd edition], Supplement by County, p. 2</ref>\n\n===Lowndes County Freedom Organization===\nIn 1965, working as a SNCC activist in the black-majority [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County]], Carmichael helped to increase the number of registered black voters from 70 to 2,600\u2014300 more than the number of registered white voters.<ref name=\"NYTobit\"/> Black voters had essentially been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] by Alabama's constitution passed by white Democrats in 1901. After Congressional passage in August of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the federal government was authorized to oversee and enforce their rights. But there was still tremendous resistance by whites in the area, which endangered activists. Black residents and voters organized and widely supported the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] (LCFO), a party that had the [[black panther]] as its mascot, over the white-dominated local [[Southern Democrats#American Civil War and post-Reconstruction|Democratic Party]], whose mascot was a white rooster. Since federal protection from violent voter suppression by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other white opponents was sporadic, most Lowndes County activists openly carried arms.\n\nAlthough black residents and voters outnumbered whites in Lowndes, their candidate lost the county-wide election of 1965. In 1966, several LCFO candidates ran for office in the general election but failed to win.<ref>[http://www.blackpast.org/aah/lowndes-county-freedom-organization Lowndes County Freedom Organization] Black Past.org</ref> In 1970, the LCFO merged with the statewide Democratic Party, and former LCFO candidates won their first offices in the county.<ref>\"[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1781 Lowndes County Freedom Organization\"], ''Encyclopedia of Alabama''</ref><ref>[http://freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/DOC513_scans/Lowndes_Co/513.LowndesCO.bpp.6.1966.pdf \"The Black Panther Party\" (pamphlet)], Merrit Publishers, June 1966.</ref><!-- Anything more to say about this? Not enough people registered in 1966 who supported the candidates, or was there fraud? -->\n\n===Chair of SNCC and Black Power===\nCarmichael became chairman of SNCC in 1966, taking over from [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], an activist who later was elected to the US Congress, and has served since then. [[James Meredith]] had initiated a solitary [[March Against Fear]] in early June of that year from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi. He did not want the big civil rights organizations or leaders involved, but was willing to have individual black men join him. On his second day out, Meredith was shot and wounded by a white sniper, and had to be hospitalized. Civil rights leaders vowed to finish the march in his name.\n\nCarmichael joined [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Floyd McKissick]], [[Cleveland Sellers]] and others to continue Meredith's march. He was arrested in [[Greenwood, Mississippi|Greenwood]] during the march. After his release, he gave his first \"[[Black Power]]\" speech at a rally that night, using the phrase to urge [[black pride]] and socio-economic independence:\n\n{{quote|It is a call for black people in this country to unite, to recognize their heritage, to build a sense of community. It is a call for black people to define their own goals, to lead their own organizations.}}\n\nAccording to historian [[David J. Garrow]], a few days after Carmichael spoke about \"Black Power\" slogan at the rally during \"Meredith March Against Fear\", he told King: \"Martin, I deliberately decided to raise this issue on the march in order to give it a national forum and force you to take a stand for Black Power.\" King responded, \"I have been used before. One more time won't hurt.\"<ref>David J. Garrow, ''Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference'' (1986).</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nWhile Black Power was not a new concept, Carmichael's speech brought it into the spotlight. It became a rallying cry for young [[African Americans]] across the country who were frustrated about slow progress in civil rights, even after federal legislation had been passed to strengthen the effort. Everywhere that Black Power spread, if accepted, credit was given to the prominent Carmichael. If the concept was condemned, he was held responsible and blamed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bennet Jr.|first=Lerone|title=Stokely Carmichael Architect of Black Power|newspaper=Ebony Magazine|date=September 1966}}</ref> According to Carmichael: \"Black Power meant black people coming together to form a political force and either electing representatives or forcing their representatives to speak to their needs [rather than relying on established parties]\".<ref>\"Stokely Carmichael\", ''King Encyclopedia'', The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute, Stanford University. Accessed November 20, 2006.</ref> Strongly influenced by the work of [[Frantz Fanon]] and his landmark book ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'', along with others such as [[Malcolm X]], Carmichael led SNCC to become more radical. The group focused on Black Power as its core goal and ideology.\n\nDuring the controversial [[Atlanta Project]] in 1966, SNCC, under the local leadership of Bill Ware, engaged in a voter drive to promote the candidacy of [[Julian Bond]] from an Atlanta district for a seat in the [[Georgia State Legislature]]. Ware excluded Northern white SNCC members from working on this drive. Initially, Carmichael opposed him and voted against this decision, but eventually changed his mind.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantahighered.org/civilrights/essay_detail.asp?phase=4 |title=Quest for Black Power (1966-1970) |publisher=Atlanta in the Civil Rights Movement |accessdate=April 15, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616083304/http://www.atlantahighered.org/civilrights/essay_detail.asp?phase=4 |archivedate=June 16, 2014 }}</ref> At the urging of the Atlanta Project, the issue of whites being members in SNCC came up for a vote. Carmichael ultimately sided with those calling for the expulsion of whites. He said that whites should organize poor white southern communities, of which there were plenty, while SNCC focused on promoting African-American self-reliance through Black Power.<ref name=forman>James Forman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2RIhBEy7dEC&pg=PP16&lpg=PP16&dq=sncc+expulsion+of+whites&source=web&ots=kQWEr8lbss&sig=qal9cfxnU9U01uivL-mAJrraj2k&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result ''The Making of Black Revolutionaries''], pp. xvi-xv (2nd edn 1997). Accessed March 17, 2007.</ref>\n\nCarmichael considered [[nonviolence]] to be a tactic, as opposed to an underlying principle, which separated him from civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Carmichael criticized civil rights leaders who called for the [[Racial integration|integration]] of African Americans into existing institutions of the [[middle-class]] mainstream.\n\n<blockquote>Now, several people have been upset because we've said that integration was irrelevant when initiated by blacks, and that in fact it was a subterfuge, an insidious subterfuge, for the maintenance of [[white supremacy]]. Now we maintain that in the past six years or so, this country has been feeding us a \"[[thalidomide]] drug of integration\", and that some Negroes have been walking down a dream street talking about sitting next to white people; and that that does not begin to solve the problem; that when we went to Mississippi we did not go to sit next to [[Ross Barnett]]; we did not go to sit next to [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]]; we went to get them out of our way; and that people ought to understand that; that we were never fighting for the right to integrate, we were fighting against [[white supremacy]]. Now, then, in order to understand white supremacy we must dismiss the fallacious notion that white people can give anybody their freedom. No man can give anybody his freedom. A man is born free. You may enslave a man after he is born free, and that is in fact what this country does. It enslaves black people after they're born, so that the only acts that white people can do is to stop denying black people their freedom; that is, they must stop ''denying'' freedom. They never give it to anyone.<ref name=Speech>Stokely Carmichael, [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/stokelycarmichaelblackpower.html \"Black Power\" speech].

It encouraged the SDS to focus on militant [[Draft resistance|anti-draft]] resistance. At an SDS-organized conference at [[UC Berkeley]] in October 1966, Carmichael challenged the white left to escalate their resistance to the military draft in a manner similar to the black movement.<ref>Joshua Bloom and Waldo E.

Hamilton]]. It is a first-person reflection on his experiences in [[SNCC]] and his dissatisfaction with the direction of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the late 1960s.  Throughout the work he directly and indirectly criticizes the established leadership of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] and [[NAACP]] for their tactics and results, often claiming that they were accepting symbols instead of change.\n\nHe promoted what he calls \"political modernization\".  This idea included three major concepts: \"1) questioning old values and institutions of the society; 2) searching for new and different forms of political structure to solve political and economic problems; and, 3) broadening the base of political participation to include more people in the decision-making process\".<ref name=\"1941-1998. 1992\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/blackpowerpoliti00carm_0|title=Black power : the politics of liberation in America|author=Carmichael, Stokely|date=1992|publisher=Vintage Books|others=Hamilton, Charles V.|isbn=0679743138|edition=Vintage|location=New York|oclc=26096713}}</ref> By questioning \"old values and institutions\", Carmichael was referring not only to the established Black leadership of the time, but also to the values and institutions of the nation as a whole. He criticized the emphasis on the American \"middle-class\".  \"The values\", he said, \"of that class are based on material aggrandizement, not the expansion of humanity.\" (40)  Carmichael believed that blacks were being lured to enter the \"middle-class\" as a trap, in which they would be assimilated into the white world by turning their backs on others of their race who were still suffering.  This assimilation, he thought, was an inherent indictment of blackness and validation of whiteness as the preferred state. He said, \"Thus we reject the goal of assimilation into middle-class America because the values of that class are in themselves anti-humanist and because that class as a social force perpetuates racism.\"<ref name=\"1941-1998. 1992\"/>\n\nSecondly, Carmichael discussed searching for different forms of political structure to solve political and economic problems.  At the time, the established forms of political structure were the SCLC and the NAACP.  These groups were religiously and academically based and focused their attention on the concepts of non-violence and steady legal and legislative change, situated within the established systems and structures of the United States. Carmichael rejected these ideas, basing his assertions on his lived experience. He explores the development of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party|Mississippi Freedom Democrats]], the 1966 local election in [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County, AL]], and the political history of the town of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]].  He chose these examples as places where blacks changed the system by way of political and legal maneuvering within the system. But Carmichael said that they ultimately failed to achieve more than the bare minimum change. In the process, he believed they reinforced the political and legal structures that were perpetuating the racism they were fighting.\n\nIn response to these failures and to offer a way forward, Carmichael discussed the concept of coalition with regard to the Civil Rights Movement. The leadership of the movement had affirmed that anyone who truly believed in their cause was welcome to join and march. Carmichael offered a different vision. Influenced by the ideas of [[Frantz Fanon|Franz Fanon]] in ''[[The Wretched of the Earth|Wretched of the Earth]]'', wherein two groups were not \"complementary\" (could have no overlap) until they were mutually exclusive (were on an equal power footing economically, socially, politically, etc.), Carmichael said that blacks in the United States had to unite and build their power independent of the white structure. Otherwise they would never be able to build a coalition that would function for both parties, not just the dominant one. He said that \"we want to establish the grounds on which we feel political coalitions can be viable.\"<ref name=\"1941-1998. 1992\"/>  For this to happen, Carmichael argued that blacks had to address three myths regarding coalition. First, \"that the interests of black people are identical with the interests of certain liberal, labor, or other reform groups.\" Second, that a viable coalition can be created between \"the politically and economically secure and the politically and economically insecure\". And third, that a coalition can be \"sustained on a moral, friendly, sentimental basis; by appeals to conscience.\" He believed that each of these myths showed the need for two groups to be mutually exclusive, and on relatively equal footing, for them to be in a viable coalition.\n\nThis philosophy, grounded in the independence literature of Africa and Latin America (Fanon), became the basis for a great deal of Carmichael's work. He believed that the Black Power Movement had to be developed outside the white power structure.\n\nHe also continued as a strong critic of the [[Vietnam War]], and imperialism in general. During this period he traveled and lectured extensively throughout the world; visiting [[Guinea]], [[North Vietnam]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], and [[Cuba]]. Carmichael became more clearly identified with the [[Black Panther Party]] as its \"Honorary Prime Minister\".<ref name=\"WPOST\" /> During this period, he acted more as a speaker than an organizer, traveling throughout the country and internationally advocating for his vision of Black Power.<ref name=\"Cobb\">[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/473.html Charlie Cobb, \"From Stokely Carmichael to Kwame Ture\"], ''Hartford '',  Accessed March 17, 2007.</ref>\n\nCarmichael lamented the 1967 execution of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], saying:\n\n{{quote|The death of Che Guevara places a responsibility on all revolutionaries of the World to redouble their decision to fight on to the final defeat of [[Imperialism]].

He led a group through the streets, demanding that businesses close out of respect. Although he tried to prevent violence, the situation escalated beyond his control.

This book expounds an explicitly [[socialism|socialist]] [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] vision, which he retained for the rest of his life.

His mentor Kwame Nkrumah had many ideas for unifying the African continent, and Ture extended the scope of these ideas to the entire African diaspora. He was a Central Committee member during his association with the A-APRP and made many speeches in the Party's behalf.<ref>[http://socialjustice.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/index.php/All-African_People's_Revolutionary_Party \"Social Justice Movements: All-African People's Revolutionary Party\"], Columbia University website</ref>\n\nTure did not simply study with S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 and Kwame Nkrumah. The latter had been designated honorary co-president of Guinea after he was deposed by the US-backed coup in Ghana.<ref>[http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/kwame-nkrumah-fathered-pan-africanism \"Kwame Nkrumah\"] at African American Registry.</ref> Ture worked overtly and covertly to \"Take Nkrumah Back to Ghana\" (according to the movement's slogan). He became a member of the Democratic Party of Guinea (PDG), the revolutionary ruling party. He sought Nkrumah's permission to launch the All-African People's Revolutionary Party (A-APRP), which Nkrumah had called for in his book ''Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare''. After several discussions, Nkrumah gave his blessing.\n\nTure was convinced that the A-APRP was needed as a permanent mass-based organization in all countries where people of African descent lived. For the last decades of his life, a period often ignored by popular media, Ture worked for full-time as an organizer of the Party. He spoke on its behalf on several continents, at innumerable college campuses, in community centers, and other venues. He was instrumental in strengthening ties between the African/Black liberation movement and several revolutionary or progressive organizations, both African and non-African. Notable among them were the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) of the United States, [[New Jewel Movement]] ([[Grenada]]), [[National Joint Action Committee]] (NJAC) of Trinidad and Tobago, [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (South Africa) and the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]].\n\nRoutinely, Ture was regarded as the leader of the A-APRP, but his only titles were \"Organizer\" and Central Committee member. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the A-APRP began each May to sponsor African Liberation Day (ALD), a continuation of the African Freedom Day begun by Kwame Nkrumah in 1958 in Ghana.<ref>[http://www.africanliberationday.net/?q=history ALD History], African Liberation Day.</ref> Although the party was involved in or was primary or co-sponsor of other ALD annual observances, marches, and rallies around the world, the best-known and largest event was held annually in Washington, DC, usually at [[Meridian Hill Park]] (also known as Malcolm X Park) at 16th and W Streets, NW.\n\nWhile making his home in Guinea, Ture traveled frequently. Britain and his birth country, Trinidad and Tobago, barred him from speaking at one time or another for fear that he would arouse African-descended people in those countries. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Ture became the world's most active and prominent exponent of pan-Africanism, defined by Nkrumah and the A-APRP as \"The Liberation and Unification of Africa Under Scientific Socialism\".\n\nTure often returned to speak to audiences of thousands (including students and townspeople) at his alma mater, Howard University, and at other campuses. The Party worked to recruit students and other youth, and Ture hoped to attract them through his speeches. He also worked to raise the political consciousness of African/Black people in general. He formed the A-APRP with the initial goal of putting \"Africa\" on the lips of Black people throughout the [[African Diaspora|diaspora]], knowing that many did not consciously or positively relate to the homeland of their ancestors. Ture was convinced that the party significantly raised international black consciousness of Pan-Africanism.\n\nUnder his leadership, the A-APRP organized the All African Women's Revolutionary Union and the [[Sammy Younge Jr.]] Brigade (named after the first black college student to die during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement) as component organizations.\n\nTure and Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] admired each other, sharing a common opposition to imperialism. In Ture's final letter, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>It was Fidel Castro who before the OLAS (Organization of Latin American States) Conference said \"if imperialism touches one grain of hair on his head, we shall not let the fact pass without retaliation.\" It was he, who on his own behalf, asked them all to stay in contact with me when I returned to the United States to offer me protection.<ref>[http://www.kwameture.com/ \"Stokely Carmichael Interview Part 1\"], KwameTure.com.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTure was ill when he gave his final speech at Howard University.  A standing-room-only crowd in Rankin Chapel paid tribute to him, and he spoke boldly, as usual.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW45PbSXyMM \"Kwame Ture's last fire side chat from the Meeca-Howard Univ part 1\"].

The group included men and women born in Africa, South America, the Caribbean, as well as the USA.\n\n==Illness and death==\nAfter his diagnosis of [[prostate cancer]] in 1996, Ture was treated for a period in Cuba, while receiving some support from the [[Nation of Islam]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Schaefer|first=Richard T.|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks California|page=523}}</ref> [[Benefit concert]]s for Ture were held in Denver; New York; Atlanta; and Washington, D.C.,<ref name=\"WPOST\"/> to help defray his medical expenses.
