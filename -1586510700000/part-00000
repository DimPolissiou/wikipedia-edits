It was originally to be released in 2019 by [[RCA Records]], but now the release date is undetermined.<ref name=\"Surgery\"/> Cyrus completed the original version of the album between 2017 and May 2019, and stated that work began shortly before the release of her sixth studio album ''[[Younger Now]]'' in September 2017. However, recording sessions continued following several happenings in Cyrus' personal life, including the end of her relationship with husband [[Liam Hemsworth]] in August 2019. Cyrus' health issues and vocal cord surgery in November 2019 delayed progress on the project until early 2020.\n\n''She Is Miley Cyrus'' is described by Cyrus as \"genre-less\" and a \"mosaic of all the things that [she's] been before.\" She stated that it would feature elements of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[alternative music]] that are commonly associated with her fourth and fifth studio albums ''[[Bangerz]]'' (2013) and ''[[Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz]]'' (2015), and are in contrast to the [[country pop]] sound of ''Younger Now''. Cyrus collaborated with producers including [[Mike Will Made It]], [[Mark Ronson]], and [[Andrew Wyatt]] from [[Miike Snow]]. Featured artists will include [[Ghostface Killah]], [[RuPaul]], and [[Swae Lee]].\n\n''She Is Miley Cyrus'' will consist of three six-song EPs &ndash; ''[[She Is Coming]]'', ''She Is Here'', and ''She Is Everything'' &ndash; which will be released before the full-length album. The first EP was released on May 31, 2019; although the second EP was to be released mid-year and the third EP was to be released by the end of 2019, their release dates are unscheduled {{as of|2020|03|lc=y}}. The lead single, \"[[Mother's Daughter (song)|Mother's Daughter]]\", was released from ''She Is Coming'' on June 11, 2019, and peaked at number 54 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The second single, \"[[Slide Away (Miley Cyrus song)|Slide Away]]\", was released separately from the EPs on August 16, and peaked at number 47 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"capfm\"/>\n\n==Background and development==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"[''Younger Now''] was obviously a little bit more country influenced, but I still really love pop music and I love music that can be played at the club.\"\n| source = \u2014 Cyrus discussing her shift in musical direction since ''Younger Now'' (2017)<ref name=\"Teases\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3106509/miley-cyrus-teases-seventh-album-mike-will-made-it/|title=Miley Cyrus's Next Album Will Probably Sound More Like Bangerz Than Younger Now|last=Roth|first=Madeline|publisher=MTV|date=December 11, 2018|accessdate=December 17, 2018}}</ref>\n| width  = 25%\n| align  = left\n}}\n\nCyrus grew distant from the mainstream hip hop culture she was involved with while working on her albums ''[[Bangerz]]'' (2013) and ''[[Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz]]'' (2015), and leaned towards \"rootsy\" country music elements while making her sixth studio album ''[[Younger Now]]'' (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7783997/miley-cyrus-cover-story-new-music-malibu|title=Miley Cyrus Breaks Silence on Rootsy New Music, Fiance Liam Hemsworth & America: 'Unity Is What We Need'|last=Norris|first=John|work=Billboard|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=December 17, 2018}}</ref> The album was released on September 29, 2017 to lukewarm critical and commercial performance.

Cyrus collaborated with producers including [[Mike Will Made It]], [[Mark Ronson]], and [[Andrew Wyatt]] from [[Miike Snow]]. Featured artists will include [[Ghostface Killah]], [[RuPaul]], and [[Swae Lee]].\n\n''She Is Miley Cyrus'' will consist of three six-song EPs &ndash; ''[[She Is Coming]]'', ''She Is Here'', and ''She Is Everything'' &ndash; which will be released before the full-length album. The first EP was released on May 31, 2019; although the second EP was to be released mid-year and the third EP was to be released by the end of 2019, their release dates are unscheduled {{as of|2020|03|lc=y}}.

Basketball is one of 11 varsity women's sports at the University of Oregon. The team is a member of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] and a Division I team in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]. [[Matthew Knight Arena]] is the home venue for both women's and men's basketball and women's volleyball. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] provides the official team uniforms for University of Oregon sports teams.\n\n==History==\nWomen's basketball (as a zoned, single-dribble game) at the University of Oregon started as a club in 1899, brought to Oregon by physical education instructor Alice Chapman, wife of University President Charles Chapman. With a women's intercollegiate game emerging at [[Willamette University]], [[Oregon State University|Oregon Agricultural College]], [[Pacific University]], and elsewhere, an effort was made during the 1902-03 academic year to organize a women's university team.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34238402/university_of_oregon_women_look_to/ \"Society Notes,\"] ''Eugene Register,'' vol. 9, no. 65 (Oct. 21, 1902), p. 3.</ref> This effort was waylaid by the Oregon faculty athletic committee early in January 1903, however, with the committee deeming it \"not advisable\" for the \"young ladies' basketball team\" to enter into intercollegiate games.<ref name=Committee>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34238661/university_of_oregon_faculty_athletic/ \"Will Strive for Footlight Plaudits,\"] 'Eugene Register,'' vol. 9, no. 133 (Jan. 9, 1903), p. 6.</ref> Instead, it was hoped that two campus teams could be organized to keep competition on a local level.<ref name=Committee />\n\nThe sport became an \"interest group\" in 1965. Intercollegiate games also began in 1965, and in 1966, the women's team entered the Northwest College Women's Sports Association (which would eventually become the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women|AIAW]] Region 9 conference). The program became official in 1973, the year following the passage of Title IX, which required federally supported universities to offer equal opportunities in men's and women's athletics.<ref>\"Reaching a Bit Further,\" ''Emerald Sports Weekly'', March 11, 1981.</ref> They have an all-time record (as of the end of the 2015\u201316 season) of 706\u2013507.

With a women's intercollegiate game emerging at [[Willamette University]], [[Oregon State University|Oregon Agricultural College]], [[Pacific University]], and elsewhere, an effort was made during the 1902-03 academic year to organize a women's university team.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34238402/university_of_oregon_women_look_to/ \"Society Notes,\"] ''Eugene Register,'' vol. 9, no. 65 (Oct. 21, 1902), p. 3.</ref> This effort was waylaid by the Oregon faculty athletic committee early in January 1903, however, with the committee deeming it \"not advisable\" for the \"young ladies' basketball team\" to enter into intercollegiate games.<ref name=Committee>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34238661/university_of_oregon_faculty_athletic/ \"Will Strive for Footlight Plaudits,\"] 'Eugene Register,'' vol. 9, no. 133 (Jan. 9, 1903), p. 6.</ref> Instead, it was hoped that two campus teams could be organized to keep competition on a local level.<ref name=Committee />\n\nThe sport became an \"interest group\" in 1965. Intercollegiate games also began in 1965, and in 1966, the women's team entered the Northwest College Women's Sports Association (which would eventually become the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women|AIAW]] Region 9 conference). The program became official in 1973, the year following the passage of Title IX, which required federally supported universities to offer equal opportunities in men's and women's athletics.<ref>\"Reaching a Bit Further,\" ''Emerald Sports Weekly'', March 11, 1981.</ref> They have an all-time record (as of the end of the 2015\u201316 season) of 706\u2013507. They previously played in the Northwest Basketball League from 1977\u20131982 (47\u20135 all-time record) and the NorPac Conference from 1982\u20131986 (34\u201312 all-time record) before the Pacific-10 Conference, now known as the [[Pac-12 Conference]], began sponsoring women's sports in 1986. The Ducks' current all-time conference record is 260\u2013280. They won the [[Women's National Invitation Tournament]] in 2002 54\u201352 over Houston.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goducks.com/documents/2016/10/10/WBB_Record_Book_16_17.pdf|title=2016-17 Women's Basketball Media Guide V2 - GoDucks.com - The University of Oregon Official Athletics Web Site|website=www.goducks.com}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Oregon Ducks|Season|Coach|Record|Conference Record}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1973\u201374 ||Jane Spearing ||3\u20138 || n/a\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1974\u201375 ||Nancy Mikleton ||2\u201310 || n/a\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1975\u201376 ||Nancy Mikleton  ||5\u201315 || n/a\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1976\u201377 || Elwin Heiny || 11\u20136 || n/a\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1977\u201378 || Elwin Heiny || 19\u20135 || 8\u20134 (2nd)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1978\u201379 || Elwin Heiny || 23\u20132 ||11\u20130 (1st)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1979\u201380 || Elwin Heiny || 24\u20135 || 13\u20130 (1st)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1980\u201381 || Elwin Heiny || 25\u20137 || 11\u20131 (1st)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1981\u201382 || Elwin Heiny || 21\u20135 || 4\u20130 (1st)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1982\u201383 || Elwin Heiny || 15\u201314 || 8\u20134 (3rd)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1983\u201384 || Elwin Heiny || 23\u20137 || 10\u20131 (1st)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1984\u201385 || Elwin Heiny || 14\u201314 || 6\u20135 (3rd)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1985\u201386 || Elwin Heiny || 21\u20137 || 10\u20132 (T-1st)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1986\u201387 || Elwin Heiny || 23\u20137 || 14\u20134 (T-2nd)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1987\u201388 || Elwin Heiny || 16\u201312|| 9\u20139 (5th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1988\u201389 || Elwin Heiny || 22\u201310 || 11\u20137 (3rd)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1989\u201390 || Elwin Heiny || 17\u201312 || 9\u20139 (T-4th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1990\u201391 || Elwin Heiny || 13\u201315 || 6\u201312 (8th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1991\u201392 || Elwin Heiny || 14\u201314 || 6\u201312 (7th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1992\u201393 || Elwin Heiny || 9\u201318 || 3\u201315 (T-9th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1993\u201394 || Jody Runge || 20\u20139 || 13\u20135 (3rd)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1994\u201395 || Jody Runge || 18\u201310 || 11\u20137 (4th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1995\u201396 || Jody Runge || 18\u201311 || 10\u20138 (T-3rd)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1996\u201397 || Jody Runge || 22\u20137 || 14\u20134 (2nd)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1997\u201398 || Jody Runge || 17\u201310 || 13\u20135 (4th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1998\u201399 || Jody Runge || 25\u20136 || 15\u20133 (T-1st)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|1999-00 || Jody Runge || 23\u20138 || 14\u20134 (1st)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2000\u201301 || Jody Runge || 17\u201312 || 10\u20138 (4th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2001\u201302 || Bev Smith || 22\u201313 || 10\u20138 (T-6th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2002\u201303 || Bev Smith || 12\u201316 || 8\u201310 (T-5th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2003\u201304 || Bev Smith || 14\u201315 || 6\u201312 (8th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2004\u201305 || Bev Smith || 21\u201310 || 12\u20136 (T-2nd)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2005\u201306 || Bev Smith || 14\u201315 || 5\u201313 (8th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2006\u201307 || Bev Smith || 17\u201314 ||8\u201310 (6th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2007\u201308 || Bev Smith || 14\u201317 ||7\u201311 (7th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2008\u201309 || Bev Smith || 9\u201321 || 5\u201313 (7th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2009\u201310 || Paul Westhead || 18\u201316 || 7\u201311 (T-6th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2010\u201311 || Paul Westhead || 13\u201317 || 4\u201314 (9th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2011\u201312 || Paul Westhead || 15\u201316 || 7\u201311 (9th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2012\u201313 || Paul Westhead || 4\u201327 || 2\u201316 (12th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2013\u201314 || Paul Westhead || 16\u201316 || 6\u201312 (10th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2014\u201315 || Kelly Graves || 13\u201317 || 6\u201312 (T-9th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2015\u201316 || Kelly Graves ||24\u201311 || 9\u20139 (6th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2016-17|| Kelly Graves ||23-14 || 8-10 (6th)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2017-18|| Kelly Graves || 33\u20135 || 16\u20132 (1st)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2018-19|| Kelly Graves || 33\u20135 || 16\u20132 (1st)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|2019-20|| Kelly Graves || 31\u20132 || 17\u20131 (1st)\n|}\n\n==Postseason==\n===NCAA Tournament results===\nThe Ducks have appeared in 15 [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]]s.

She is a 82-foot house aft vessel that holds 120 pots and sleeps between nine and ten people. She was purchased by Rick and Donna Quashnick of [[Warrenton, Oregon]] in 1991. The F/V Maverick was selected for a camera crew for season one in the 2005 opilio crab season, as partner vessel of the [[FV Cornelia Marie|''F/V Cornelia Marie'']]. The ''Maverick'' took part in the rescue efforts for the [[FV Big Valley|''F/V Big Valley'']], which sunk on the first day of the opilio crab season off [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island]], losing all but one crew member.
