The song is an uplifting song that speaks of the value behind the idea the 'unity is strength'. The song contains a lyric in [[Lugandan]], the Bantu language of the Baganda people of Uganda, that says 'kwegata bwe bugumu' which literally translates to 'togetherness is strength'.

The line 'we are the music makers, we are the dreamer of dreams' was used in the chorus.\n\nSeo Linn's track \"[[The Irish Roar]]\" was chosen as the official [[Football Association of Ireland]] song for [[Euro 2016]]. Recorded in [[\u00c1ras Chr\u00f3n\u00e1in]] in [[Clondalkin]], the track tells the story of Irish successes in previous competitions and pays homage to travelling Irish fans.\n\nIn 'Sonas Studios' in [[Killarney]], [[Co.

After a successful career in German silent films, where he was one of the best-paid stars of [[UFA GmbH|UFA]], he and his new Jewish wife Ilona Prager were forced to leave Germany in 1933 after the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power. The couple settled in Britain, where he took British citizenship in 1939. He appeared in many British films, including ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), before emigrating to the United States around 1941, which led to him being cast as Major Strasser in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942).\n\n==Early life==\nVeidt was born in a [[bourgeois]] district of [[Berlin]], in what was then the German Empire, to Amalie Marie (n\u00e9e Gohtz) and Phillip Heinrich Veidt.<ref name=bptt>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Jarry|title=Conrad Veidt: from Caligari to Casablanca|page=5|publisher=boxwood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMJZAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Phillip+Heinrich+Veidt%22&dq=%22Phillip+Heinrich+Veidt%22&hl=en|isbn=978-0940168046}}</ref> (Some biographies wrongly state that he was born in [[Potsdam]], probably on the basis of an early claim on his part.)

Later in the year Veidt was [[conscription|conscripted]] into the [[German Army]] during [[World War I]].  In 1915, he was sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] as a non-commissioned officer and took part in the [[Great Retreat (Russian)|Battle of Warsaw]]. He contracted [[jaundice]] and [[pneumonia]], and had to be evacuated to a hospital on the [[Baltic Sea]]. While recuperating, he received a letter from Mannheim telling him that she had found work at a theatre in [[Liep\u0101ja|Libau]]. Intrigued, Veidt applied for the theatre as well. As his condition had not improved, the army allowed him to join the theatre so that he could entertain the troops. While performing at the theatre, he ended his relationship with Mannheim. In late 1916, he was re-examined by the Army and deemed unfit for service; he was given a full discharge in January 1917.

One of his earliest performances was as the murderous somnambulist Cesare in director [[Robert Wiene]]'s ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920), a classic of [[German Expressionism#Cinema and architecture|German Expressionist]] cinema, with [[Werner Krauss]] and [[Lil Dagover]]. His starring role in ''[[The Man Who Laughs (1928 film)|The Man Who Laughs]]'' (1928), as a disfigured circus performer whose face is cut into a permanent grin, provided the (visual) inspiration for the [[Batman]] villain [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]. Veidt starred in other silent horror films such as ''[[The Hands of Orlac (1924 film)|The Hands of Orlac]]'' (1924), also directed by Robert Wiene, ''[[The Student of Prague (1926 film)|The Student of Prague]]'' (1926) and ''[[Waxworks (film)|Waxworks]]'' (1924), in which he played [[Ivan the Terrible]].\n[[File:Konrad Fajt.png|thumb|left|Painting of Conrad Veidt by [[Milena Pavlovi\u0107-Barili]].|alt=Konrad Fajt.png]]\nVeidt also appeared in [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s film ''Anders als die Andern'' (''[[Different from the Others]]'', 1919), one of the earliest films to sympathetically portray homosexuality, although the characters in it do not end up happily.<ref name=\"badass\">{{cite web|url=http://badassdigest.com/2013/07/09/meet-conrad-veidt-badass/|title=Meet Conrad Veidt, Badass |publisher=Badass Digest|date=9 July 2013}}</ref> He had a leading role in Germany's first talking picture, ''Das Land ohne Frauen'' (''[[Land Without Women]]'', 1929).#calebcares\n\nHe moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s and made a few films there, but the advent of talking pictures and his difficulty with speaking English led him to return to Germany.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Turner Classic Movies]] ''Conrad Veidt''</ref> During this period, he lent his expertise to tutoring aspiring performers, one of whom was the later American character actress Lisa Golm.\n\n==Emigration==\nVeidt fervently opposed the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime and later donated a major portion of his personal fortune to Britain to assist in the war effort. Soon after the [[Nazi Party]] took power in Germany, by March 1933, [[Joseph Goebbels]] was purging the film industry of anti-Nazi sympathizers and Jews, and so in 1933, a week after Veidt's marriage to Ilona Prager, a Jewish woman, the couple emigrated to Britain before any action could be taken against either of them.\n\nGoebbels had imposed a \"racial questionnaire\" in which everyone employed in the German film industry had to declare their \"race\" to continue to work. When Veidt was filling in the questionnaire, he answered the question about what his ''Rasse'' (race) was by writing that he was a ''Jude'' (Jew).<ref name=\"Hull, David Stewart page 90\">Hull, David Stewart ''Film in the Third Reich'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1973 page 90.</ref> Veidt was not Jewish, but his wife was Jewish, and Veidt would not renounce the woman he loved.<ref name=\"Hull, David Stewart page 90\"/> Additionally, Veidt, who was opposed to [[antisemitism]], wanted to show solidarity with the German Jewish community, who were in the process of being stripped of their rights as German citizens in the spring of 1933. As one of Germany's most prominent actors, Veidt had been informed that if he was prepared to divorce his wife and declare his support for the new regime, he could continue to act in Germany. Several other leading actors who had been opposed to the Nazis before 1933 switched allegiances. In answering the questionnaire by stating he was a Jew, Veidt rendered himself unemployable in Germany, but stated this sacrifice was worth it as there was nothing in the world that would compel him to break with his wife.<ref name=\"Hull, David Stewart page 90\"/> Upon hearing about what Veidt had done, Goebbels remarked that he would never act in Germany again.\n\n[[File:SpyInBlack-Veidt.jpg|thumbnail|Conrad Veidt in ''[[The Spy in Black]]'' (1939)]]\nAfter arriving in Britain, Veidt perfected his English and starred in the title roles of the original anti-Nazi versions of ''[[The Wandering Jew (1933 film)|The Wandering Jew]]'' (1933) and ''[[Jew S\u00fcss (1934 film)|Jew S\u00fcss]]'' (1934), the latter film was directed by the exiled German-born director [[Lothar Mendes]] and produced by [[Michael Balcon]] for [[Gaumont-British]]. He naturalised as a [[British subject]] on 25 February 1939.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34605 |date=7 March 1939 |page=1546}}</ref> By this point multi-lingual, Veidt made films in both French with expatriate French directors and in English, including three of his best-known roles for British director [[Michael Powell]] in ''[[The Spy in Black]]'' (1939), ''[[Contraband (1940 film)|Contraband]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940).\n\n===Later career in the US===\nBy 1941, he and Ilona had settled in Hollywood to assist in the British effort in making American films that might persuade the then-neutral and still [[isolationist]] US to join the war against the Nazis, who had conquered all of continental Europe and were [[battle of Britain|bombing the United Kingdom]] at the time. Before leaving the United Kingdom, Veidt gave his life savings to the British government to help finance the war effort.<ref name=\"badass\"/> Realizing that Hollywood would most likely typecast him in Nazi roles, he had his contract mandate that they must always be villains.<ref name=\"badass\"/>\n\nHe starred in a few films, such as [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' (1941) where he received billing under [[Joan Crawford]]'s and ''[[Nazi Agent]]'' (1942), in which he had a dual role as both an aristocratic German Nazi spy and as the man's twin brother, an anti-Nazi American. His best-known Hollywood role was as the sinister Major Heinrich Strasser in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), a film which began pre-production before the United States entered [[World War II]].\n\n==Personal life==\nConrad Veidt married three times: he first married [[Gussy Holl]], a [[cabaret]] entertainer, on 18 June 1918.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=aMJZAAAAMAAJ&q=gussy+holl&dq=gussy+holl&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw3pDEwtfoAhVNQq0KHTzYCIoQ6AEISTAJ</ref> They divorced four years later. Gussy later married German actor [[Emil Jannings]]. Some sources say Veidt had a daughter named Ruth-Maria with Holl.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=QfUKAQAAMAAJ&q=ruth+maria+jannings&dq=ruth+maria+jannings&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWxfHzjuHoAhVMF6wKHZlvA7oQ6AEIKzAF</ref>\n\nVeidt's second wife Felicitas Radke was from an aristocratic German family; they married in 1923. Their daughter, Vera Viola Maria, called Viola, was born on 10 August 1925. He last married Ilona Prager, a Hungarian Jew called Lily, in 1933; they remained together until his death.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)-->\n\n==Death==\nConrad Veidt died on 3 April 1943 of a massive heart attack while playing golf at the [[Riviera Country Club]] in Los Angeles with singer [[Arthur Fields]] and his personal physician, Dr. Bergman, who pronounced him dead on the scene.<ref name=\"badass\"/><ref>\"Conrad Veidt Obituary,\" ''Los Angeles Times'', 1943</ref> Veidt was 50 years old.

After a successful career in German silent films, where he was one of the best-paid stars of [[UFA GmbH|UFA]], he and his new Jewish wife Ilona Prager were forced to leave Germany in 1933 after the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power. The couple settled in Britain, where he took British citizenship in 1939. He appeared in many British films, including ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), before emigrating to the United States around 1941, which led to him being cast as Major Strasser in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942).\n\n==Early life==\nVeidt was born in a [[bourgeois]] district of [[Berlin]], in what was then the German Empire, to Amalie Marie (n\u00e9e Gohtz) and Phillip Heinrich Veidt.<ref name=bptt>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Jarry|title=Conrad Veidt: from Caligari to Casablanca|page=5|publisher=boxwood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMJZAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Phillip+Heinrich+Veidt%22&dq=%22Phillip+Heinrich+Veidt%22&hl=en|isbn=978-0940168046}}</ref> (Some biographies wrongly state that he was born in [[Potsdam]], probably on the basis of an early claim on his part.) His family was [[Lutheran]].<ref name=bptt/>\n\nIn 1914, Veidt met actress [[Lucie Mannheim]], with whom he began a relationship. Later in the year Veidt was [[conscription|conscripted]] into the [[German Army]] during [[World War I]].  In 1915, he was sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] as a non-commissioned officer and took part in the [[Great Retreat (Russian)|Battle of Warsaw]]. He contracted [[jaundice]] and [[pneumonia]], and had to be evacuated to a hospital on the [[Baltic Sea]]. While recuperating, he received a letter from Mannheim telling him that she had found work at a theatre in [[Liep\u0101ja|Libau]]. Intrigued, Veidt applied for the theatre as well. As his condition had not improved, the army allowed him to join the theatre so that he could entertain the troops. While performing at the theatre, he ended his relationship with Mannheim. In late 1916, he was re-examined by the Army and deemed unfit for service; he was given a full discharge in January 1917. Veidt returned to Berlin to pursue his acting career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thethunderchild.com/ConradVeidt/page94.html|title=Conrad Veidt: The Cinema's Master|publisher=The Conrad Veidt Society}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eric.b.olsen.tripod.com/veidt.html|title=Conrad Veidt|publisher=A History of Horror|access-date=3 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309215410/http://eric.b.olsen.tripod.com/veidt.html|archive-date=9 March 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monsterzine.com/200010/conradveidt1.html|title=Conrad Veidt: Cinema\u2019s Dark Prince, 1893\u20131943|publisher=Monster Zine|date=October\u2013December 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207182606/http://monsterzine.com/200010/conradveidt1.html|archivedate=7 February 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Conrad Veidt by Becker & Maass.jpg|thumb|Veidt, c. 1920]]\nFrom 1916 until his death, Veidt appeared in more than 100 films. One of his earliest performances was as the murderous somnambulist Cesare in director [[Robert Wiene]]'s ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920), a classic of [[German Expressionism#Cinema and architecture|German Expressionist]] cinema, with [[Werner Krauss]] and [[Lil Dagover]]. His starring role in ''[[The Man Who Laughs (1928 film)|The Man Who Laughs]]'' (1928), as a disfigured circus performer whose face is cut into a permanent grin, provided the (visual) inspiration for the [[Batman]] villain [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]. Veidt starred in other silent horror films such as ''[[The Hands of Orlac (1924 film)|The Hands of Orlac]]'' (1924), also directed by Robert Wiene, ''[[The Student of Prague (1926 film)|The Student of Prague]]'' (1926) and ''[[Waxworks (film)|Waxworks]]'' (1924), in which he played [[Ivan the Terrible]].\n[[File:Konrad Fajt.png|thumb|left|Painting of Conrad Veidt by [[Milena Pavlovi\u0107-Barili]].|alt=Konrad Fajt.png]]\nVeidt also appeared in [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s film ''Anders als die Andern'' (''[[Different from the Others]]'', 1919), one of the earliest films to sympathetically portray homosexuality, although the characters in it do not end up happily.<ref name=\"badass\">{{cite web|url=http://badassdigest.com/2013/07/09/meet-conrad-veidt-badass/|title=Meet Conrad Veidt, Badass |publisher=Badass Digest|date=9 July 2013}}</ref> He had a leading role in Germany's first talking picture, ''Das Land ohne Frauen'' (''[[Land Without Women]]'', 1929).\n\nHe moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s and made a few films there, but the advent of talking pictures and his difficulty with speaking English led him to return to Germany.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Turner Classic Movies]] ''Conrad Veidt''</ref> During this period, he lent his expertise to tutoring aspiring performers, one of whom was the later American character actress Lisa Golm.\n\n==Emigration==\nVeidt fervently opposed the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime and later donated a major portion of his personal fortune to Britain to assist in the war effort. Soon after the [[Nazi Party]] took power in Germany, by March 1933, [[Joseph Goebbels]] was purging the film industry of anti-Nazi sympathizers and Jews, and so in 1933, a week after Veidt's marriage to Ilona Prager, a Jewish woman, the couple emigrated to Britain before any action could be taken against either of them.\n\nGoebbels had imposed a \"racial questionnaire\" in which everyone employed in the German film industry had to declare their \"race\" to continue to work. When Veidt was filling in the questionnaire, he answered the question about what his ''Rasse'' (race) was by writing that he was a ''Jude'' (Jew).<ref name=\"Hull, David Stewart page 90\">Hull, David Stewart ''Film in the Third Reich'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1973 page 90.</ref> Veidt was not Jewish, but his wife was Jewish, and Veidt would not renounce the woman he loved.<ref name=\"Hull, David Stewart page 90\"/> Additionally, Veidt, who was opposed to [[antisemitism]], wanted to show solidarity with the German Jewish community, who were in the process of being stripped of their rights as German citizens in the spring of 1933. As one of Germany's most prominent actors, Veidt had been informed that if he was prepared to divorce his wife and declare his support for the new regime, he could continue to act in Germany. Several other leading actors who had been opposed to the Nazis before 1933 switched allegiances. In answering the questionnaire by stating he was a Jew, Veidt rendered himself unemployable in Germany, but stated this sacrifice was worth it as there was nothing in the world that would compel him to break with his wife.<ref name=\"Hull, David Stewart page 90\"/> Upon hearing about what Veidt had done, Goebbels remarked that he would never act in Germany again.\n\n[[File:SpyInBlack-Veidt.jpg|thumbnail|Conrad Veidt in ''[[The Spy in Black]]'' (1939)]]\nAfter arriving in Britain, Veidt perfected his English and starred in the title roles of the original anti-Nazi versions of ''[[The Wandering Jew (1933 film)|The Wandering Jew]]'' (1933) and ''[[Jew S\u00fcss (1934 film)|Jew S\u00fcss]]'' (1934), the latter film was directed by the exiled German-born director [[Lothar Mendes]] and produced by [[Michael Balcon]] for [[Gaumont-British]]. He naturalised as a [[British subject]] on 25 February 1939.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34605 |date=7 March 1939 |page=1546}}</ref> By this point multi-lingual, Veidt made films in both French with expatriate French directors and in English, including three of his best-known roles for British director [[Michael Powell]] in ''[[The Spy in Black]]'' (1939), ''[[Contraband (1940 film)|Contraband]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940).\n\n===Later career in the US===\nBy 1941, he and Ilona had settled in Hollywood to assist in the British effort in making American films that might persuade the then-neutral and still [[isolationist]] US to join the war against the Nazis, who had conquered all of continental Europe and were [[battle of Britain|bombing the United Kingdom]] at the time. Before leaving the United Kingdom, Veidt gave his life savings to the British government to help finance the war effort.<ref name=\"badass\"/> Realizing that Hollywood would most likely typecast him in Nazi roles, he had his contract mandate that they must always be villains.<ref name=\"badass\"/>\n\nHe starred in a few films, such as [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' (1941) where he received billing under [[Joan Crawford]]'s and ''[[Nazi Agent]]'' (1942), in which he had a dual role as both an aristocratic German Nazi spy and as the man's twin brother, an anti-Nazi American. His best-known Hollywood role was as the sinister Major Heinrich Strasser in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), a film which began pre-production before the United States entered [[World War II]].\n\n==Personal life==\nConrad Veidt married three times: he first married [[Gussy Holl]], a [[cabaret]] entertainer, on 18 June 1918.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=aMJZAAAAMAAJ&q=gussy+holl&dq=gussy+holl&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw3pDEwtfoAhVNQq0KHTzYCIoQ6AEISTAJ</ref> They divorced four years later. Gussy later married German actor [[Emil Jannings]]. Some sources say Veidt had a daughter named Ruth-Maria with Holl.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=QfUKAQAAMAAJ&q=ruth+maria+jannings&dq=ruth+maria+jannings&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWxfHzjuHoAhVMF6wKHZlvA7oQ6AEIKzAF</ref>\n\nVeidt's second wife Felicitas Radke was from an aristocratic German family; they married in 1923. Their daughter, Vera Viola Maria, called Viola, was born on 10 August 1925. He last married Ilona Prager, a Hungarian Jew called Lily, in 1933; they remained together until his death.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)-->\n\n==Death==\nConrad Veidt died on 3 April 1943 of a massive heart attack while playing golf at the [[Riviera Country Club]] in Los Angeles with singer [[Arthur Fields]] and his personal physician, Dr. Bergman, who pronounced him dead on the scene.<ref name=\"badass\"/><ref>\"Conrad Veidt Obituary,\" ''Los Angeles Times'', 1943</ref> Veidt was 50 years old.

It is the headquarters of [[Kaimur district]]..<ref name=greencity>{{cite web|title=Bhabua in Bihar to become World's first Green City|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/01/bhabua-in-bihar-to-become-worlds-first-green-city/|work=Biharprabha News|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nBhabua is located at {{Coord|25.05|N|83.62|E}}. The Buxar district of [[Bihar]] State and the Ghazipur district of U.P. State bound it on the North. On the south is the Garhwa district of Jharkhand State and on the West is the Chandauli and Sonbhadra districts of the U.P. State. On the East is Rohtas district of Bihar State.\n\n== About District ==\nThe district has 14 police stations and covers an area of about {{cvt|340447|hectare}}, Geographically, the district can be divided into two parts viz. (i) [[Hilly area]] and (ii) [[Plain area]].\nThe district has close linkage with the history of [[Shahabad district|Shahabad]], which was its parent district also. The old district of Shahabad had four subdivisions of which Bhabua was one. The present district of Kaimur has been formed from the whole of this Bhabua subdivision.\nThe District of Bhabua is divided in wards e.g. Ward 6 for Gavai ward 12 near Patel chowk etc., all wards have a ward commissioner who looks after the welfare and civic affairs of the ward and the head of all the ward commissioner's is elected amongst themselves who is called the chairman. \nThe nearest big city is Varanasi which is 70&nbsp;km from here and we have buses every half an hour running to and fro.\n\n== History ==\nKaimur has an old and interesting history. In pre-historic days the plateau region of the district has been the abode of the aboriginals whose chief representatives now are the [[Bhars]], the [[Cheros]] and the [[Savers]]. According to some legends, the [[Kharwar]] were the original settlers in the hilly tracts of [[Rohtas district|Rohtas]]. The [[Ovaons]] also claim that they ruled over the stretch falling between Rohtas and [[Patna]]. One local legend also connects [[Sasaram]] the present headquarters of Rohtas with [[king Sahasrarjun]], who was killed by [[Saint Parshuram]] in a fight.\n\nThe district of Kaimur formed part of the mighty [[Magadh|Magadh Empire]] from the 6th century BC. to the 5th century AD., under the [[Mauryan Empire]] and [[Gupta rulers]] of [[Magadh]]. In the 7th century AD., this district came under the control of [[Harshwardhan]], the ruler of [[Kannauj]]. An inscription in the Mundeshwari temple near Bhabua refers to the King [[Udaysena]] as the ruling chief of the area. \n\nThe Seal of King [[Sasanka]] of [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]] in [[Bengal]] is inscribed at Rohtasgarh in the district of [[Rohtas District|Rohtas]]. The Chinese pilgrim [[Huen- tang]], who journeyed through the country in the 7th century AD., passed through [[Arrah]], the headquarters of the old [[Shahabad district]] through this region of newly formed [[Kaimur district]]. The area of the district successively came under the rulers of [[Shail dynasty]] of [[Central India]] and [[Pal dynasty]] of Bengal. \n\nAccording to C. Mark, a historian, the first ruler of [[Pal dynasty]] controlled this region. Later on [[Chandauli]] controlled [[Varanasi]]-[[Chandawali]] and also the [[Kaimur district]] in the 12th century, as confirmed by the [[Tarachandi]] inscription near [[Sasaram]]. \n\nAfter the fall of the Guptas the district in all probability relapsed into the hands of the aboriginal tribes and came under the control of petty chieftains.

Subsequently, [[Pahalwan Singh]] succumbed to comply and live on the latter's terms. \n\nIn 1764, the old Shahabad district witnessed conflict for supremacy and the English became absolute masters of the area after defeating [[Siraj-ud-daula]] in the battle of [[Buxar]]. Again the area was shaken by the rebellion of Raja [[Chait Singh]] of [[Banaras]] but eventually the English succeeded in suppressing the revolt.\n\nLastly the historic 1857 mutiny under command of [[Kunwar Singh]] had its impact in the district. As a result, during the independence movement the district had a substantial contribution to the freedom of India.

The Buxar district of [[Bihar]] State and the Ghazipur district of U.P. State bound it on the North. On the south is the Garhwa district of Jharkhand State and on the West is the Chandauli and Sonbhadra districts of the U.P. State. On the East is Rohtas district of Bihar State.\n\n== About District ==\nThe district has 14 police stations and covers an area of about {{cvt|340447|hectare}}, Geographically, the district can be divided into two parts viz. (i) [[Hilly area]] and (ii) [[Plain area]].\nThe district has close linkage with the history of [[Shahabad district|Shahabad]], which was its parent district also. The old district of Shahabad had four subdivisions of which Bhabua was one. The present district of Kaimur has been formed from the whole of this Bhabua subdivision.\nThe District of Bhabua is divided in wards e.g. Ward 6 for Gavai ward 12 near Patel chowk etc., all wards have a ward commissioner who looks after the welfare and civic affairs of the ward and the head of all the ward commissioner's is elected amongst themselves who is called the chairman. \nThe nearest big city is Varanasi which is 70&nbsp;km from here and we have buses every half an hour running to and fro.\n\n== History ==\nKaimur has an old and interesting history. In pre-historic days the plateau region of the district has been the abode of the aboriginals whose chief representatives now are the [[Bhars]], the [[Cheros]] and the [[Savers]]. According to some legends, the [[Kharwar]] were the original settlers in the hilly tracts of [[Rohtas district|Rohtas]]. The [[Ovaons]] also claim that they ruled over the stretch falling between Rohtas and [[Patna]]. One local legend also connects [[Sasaram]] the present headquarters of Rohtas with [[king Sahasrarjun]], who was killed by [[Saint Parshuram]] in a fight.\n\nThe district of Kaimur formed part of the mighty [[Magadh|Magadh Empire]] from the 6th century BC. to the 5th century AD., under the [[Mauryan Empire]] and [[Gupta rulers]] of [[Magadh]]. In the 7th century AD., this district came under the control of [[Harshwardhan]], the ruler of [[Kannauj]]. An inscription in the Mundeshwari temple near Bhabua refers to the King [[Udaysena]] as the ruling chief of the area. \n\nThe Seal of King [[Sasanka]] of [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]] in [[Bengal]] is inscribed at Rohtasgarh in the district of [[Rohtas District|Rohtas]]. The Chinese pilgrim [[Huen- tang]], who journeyed through the country in the 7th century AD., passed through [[Arrah]], the headquarters of the old [[Shahabad district]] through this region of newly formed [[Kaimur district]]. The area of the district successively came under the rulers of [[Shail dynasty]] of [[Central India]] and [[Pal dynasty]] of Bengal. \n\nAccording to C. Mark, a historian, the first ruler of [[Pal dynasty]] controlled this region. Later on [[Chandauli]] controlled [[Varanasi]]-[[Chandawali]] and also the [[Kaimur district]] in the 12th century, as confirmed by the [[Tarachandi]] inscription near [[Sasaram]]. \n\nAfter the fall of the Guptas the district in all probability relapsed into the hands of the aboriginal tribes and came under the control of petty chieftains. The [[Rajputs]] who came from [[Ujjain]] and the province of [[Malwa]] had a series of conflicts with the aboriginals and it took them many hundred years to subdue the aboriginal completely. \n\nThe Census report of 1961 describes that when [[Bakhtiar Khiliji]] attacked [[Bihar]] in 1193 A.D.

While Abby continued to study the paranormal at a technical college with eccentric engineer Jillian Holtzmann, Erin, now a professor at [[Columbia University]], disowned the work, fearing it might jeopardize her [[Academic tenure|tenure]]. When Abby republishes the book, Erin convinces her to agree to remove the book from publication in exchange for helping Abby and Jillian in a paranormal investigation. They witness a malevolent ghost, restoring Erin's belief in the paranormal, but video footage of the investigation is posted online, and Erin is fired by the university. She joins Abby and Jillian to set up new offices above a Chinese restaurant, calling themselves \"Conductors of the Metaphysical Examination\". They build equipment to study and capture ghosts, and hire the dimwitted but handsome Kevin Beckman as a [[receptionist]].\n\n[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] staffer Patty Tolan witnesses a ghost in a subway line and contacts the group. They document the ghost and successfully test Jillian's [[Proton pack|proton containment laser]], but their findings are again dismissed. They continue to develop their technology and advertise their services with the name pundits have labeled them, \"Ghostbusters\". Patty joins the team, providing historical knowledge of New York City and a repurposed [[hearse]], \"[[Ecto-1]]\".\n\nUnbeknownst to the Ghostbusters, the ghosts are being summoned by devices built by Rowan North, an [[occultist]] attempting to bring about the [[apocalypse]]. When Rowan plants another device at a live music venue, the Ghostbusters are called in and capture the ghost in front of the audience. When supernatural [[debunker]] Dr. Martin Heiss challenges the Ghostbusters, the incensed Erin releases the ghost as proof; it throws Heiss out a window and escapes. The Ghostbusters are brought to Mayor Bradley and his secretary Jennifer Lynch, who reveal that the city and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) are aware of New York's ghost problem. While privately supporting the team's work, the mayor's office and the DHS publicly denounce them as fraudsters.\n\nThe Ghostbusters realize that Rowan is planting his devices along [[ley line]]s, which intersect at the Mercado Hotel in [[Times Square]], a site with a history of paranormal activity, and discover Rowan building a portal to the ghost dimension in the hotel basement. To avoid capture, Rowan commits suicide by electrocuting himself, after which Jillian deactivates the portal.  Erin discovers an annotated copy of her and Abby's book among Rowan's possessions and realizes that he killed himself so he could become a ghost and command a spirit army.  Rowan returns as a powerful ghost, possessing Abby and then Kevin. As Kevin, he opens the portal and releases hundreds of ghosts. The police and DHS are subdued, but the Ghostbusters fight through the army of ghosts to reach the portal.\n\nRowan takes the form of the ghost in the Ghostbusters' logo, grows to enormous height, and attacks the city. The team devises a plan to use Ecto-1's nuclear reactor to close the portal and return the ghosts to their own dimension. The plan succeeds, but Rowan drags Abby into the portal with him; Erin leaps into the portal and rescues her as Rowan is obliterated. The mayor's office agrees to secretly fund the Ghostbusters' research while continuing to publicly denounce them as frauds. With new funding, the Ghostbusters move to a better facility, a disused fire house. New York lights up with thanks and tributes to the Ghostbusters.

While Abby continued to study the paranormal at a technical college with eccentric engineer Jillian Holtzmann, Erin, now a professor at [[Columbia University]], disowned the work, fearing it might jeopardize her [[Academic tenure|tenure]]. When Abby republishes the book, Erin convinces her to agree to remove the book from publication in exchange for helping Abby and Jillian in a paranormal investigation. They witness a malevolent ghost, restoring Erin's belief in the paranormal, but video footage of the investigation is posted online, and Erin is fired by the university. She joins Abby and Jillian to set up new offices above a Chinese restaurant, calling themselves \"Conductors of the Metaphysical Examination\". They build equipment to study and capture ghosts, and hire the dimwitted but handsome Kevin Beckman as a [[receptionist]].\n\n[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] staffer Patty Tolan witnesses a ghost in a subway line and contacts the group. They document the ghost and successfully test Jillian's [[Proton pack|proton containment laser]], but their findings are again dismissed. They continue to develop their technology and advertise their services with the name pundits have labeled them, \"Ghostbusters\". Patty joins the team, providing historical knowledge of New York City and a repurposed [[hearse]], \"[[Ecto-1]]\".\n\nUnbeknownst to the Ghostbusters, the ghosts are being summoned by devices built by Rowan North, an [[occultist]] attempting to bring about the [[apocalypse]]. When Rowan plants another device at a live music venue, the Ghostbusters are called in and capture the ghost in front of the audience. When supernatural [[debunker]] Dr. Martin Heiss challenges the Ghostbusters, the incensed Erin releases the ghost as proof; it throws Heiss out a window and escapes. The Ghostbusters are brought to Mayor Bradley and his secretary Jennifer Lynch, who reveal that the city and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) are aware of New York's ghost problem. While privately supporting the team's work, the mayor's office and the DHS publicly denounce them as fraudsters.\n\nThe Ghostbusters realize that Rowan is planting his devices along [[ley line]]s, which intersect at the Mercado Hotel in [[Times Square]], a site with a history of paranormal activity, and discover Rowan building a portal to the ghost dimension in the hotel basement. To avoid capture, Rowan commits suicide by electrocuting himself, after which Jillian deactivates the portal.  Erin discovers an annotated copy of her and Abby's book among Rowan's possessions and realizes that he killed himself so he could become a ghost and command a spirit army.  Rowan returns as a powerful ghost, possessing Abby and then Kevin. As Kevin, he opens the portal and releases hundreds of ghosts. The police and DHS are subdued, but the Ghostbusters fight through the army of ghosts to reach the portal.\n\nRowan takes the form of the ghost in the Ghostbusters' logo, grows to enormous height, and attacks the city. The team devises a plan to use Ecto-1's nuclear reactor to close the portal and return the ghosts to their own dimension. The plan succeeds, but Rowan drags Abby into the portal with him; Erin leaps into the portal and rescues her as Rowan is obliterated. The mayor's office agrees to secretly fund the Ghostbusters' research while continuing to publicly denounce them as frauds.

A professional competitor since 2001, Kyle has competed for the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], the [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]], [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], the [[World Series of Fighting]], [[Absolute Championship Berkut]], [[Pancrase]], [[King of the Cage]], and is the former [[List of KOTC champions#Light Heavyweight Championship|King of the Cage Light Heavyweight Champion]].\n\n==Background==\nKyle was raised in Hemet, CA for most of his life. He moved to Nampa, ID in his late childhood.  Kyle is the youngest of 4 siblings. He has 1 older sister from his Dad's 1st marriage and 2 older siblings from his Dad's 2nd marriage.  He attended [[Nampa High School]] and was friends with the late [[Justin Eilers]], who Kyle would actually end up fighting in his second fight for the UFC. Eilers and a friend who were both two grades ahead of Kyle, taught him [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] techniques when he was a sophomore in high school. Kyle was also a talented football player, playing fullback for [[Butte College]] in [[Oroville, California]] and [[Eastern Oregon University]]. During his early mixed martial arts career he split time between fighting and playing football. <ref name=\"411mania.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/MMA/columns/180490/411-Fighter-Profile-04.04.11:-Mike-Kyle.htm |title=411MANIA  |work=411 Fighter Profile 04.04.11: Mike Kyle |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019162412/http://www.411mania.com/MMA/columns/180490/411-Fighter-Profile-04.04.11%3A-Mike-Kyle.htm |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n===Early career===\nKyle held an undefeated amateur record of 3\u20130 before turning professional. Kyle made his professional debut on March 10, 2001, when he was 18 years old and won by [[Knockout|TKO]] only 90 seconds into the fight. He then won his next two fights, also by punches before debuting in the [[King of the Cage]] promotion. Kyle made his King of the Cage debut in a fight for the [[List of KOTC champions|King of the Cage Super Heavyweight Championship]] against then [[List of KOTC champions|King of the Cage Super Heavyweight Champion]] [[Dan Bobish]]. Kyle, who then weighed 275 lbs. was outweighed by Bobish, who was 55 lbs. bigger than Kyle. Despite rocking Bobish early in the fight and almost pulling off the upset, Kyle was handed his first career loss after he submitted due to punches. In his next [[King of the Cage|KOTC]] bout, Kyle made his [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] debut against future [[List of KOTC champions|King of the Cage Heavyweight Champion]] [[Paul Buentello]]. Kyle lost after he was knocked out from punches. After losing to Buentello, the San Jose-based [[American Kickboxing Academy]] invited Kyle to train. He accepted and has been training with AKA ever since.<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\nIn his next fight, Kyle made his debut in the [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]], and snapped his two-fight losing streak with a knockout win. The 4\u20132 Kyle then fought in the IFC and again won by strikes as his opponent tapped out due to punches. Kyle then also won his next two fights, which included another win under the WEC banner.<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\n===Ultimate Fighting Championship===\nKyle made his [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] debut against [[Wes Sims (fighter)|Wes Sims]] winning via KO at 4:59 of round one. Sims took the fight a days notice notice after Kyle's original opponent filled into the main event after [[Tim Sylvia]] failed a drug test. Kyle dominated the entire first round and knocked Sims out at 4:59. Sims protested after the fight that Kyle had bitten him on the chest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onzuka.com/news_2004April3.html |title=Hawaii Martial Arts News & Rumors \u2013 Dedicated to Hawaii-Specific Martial Arts News & Rumors |publisher=Onzuka.com |accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> During the post-fight interview, a bite mark could clearly be seen on Sims' left [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral muscle]]. This marks the first time a bite has ever happened in a UFC fight since its inception at [[UFC 1]] in 1993, when [[Gerard Gordeau]] bit [[Royce Gracie]] in the championship match. Kyle still denies any wrongdoing.\n\nKyle then fought the late [[Justin Eilers]] in a [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] bout. This was a significant match up as Eilers was a friend of Kyle's who had actually introduced Kyle to the sport of mixed martial arts. Kyle lost the fight when he was knocked out from a punch 74 seconds into the first round.<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\nHe then fought former [[List of WEC champions#Heavyweight Championship|WEC Heavyweight Champion]] [[James Irvin (fighter)|James Irvin]] at [[UFC 51]] winning via knockout in the first round. Despite this relatively notable win in the UFC, Kyle requested his release in from the UFC to compete in [[Japan]].\n\n===Post-UFC===\nKyle then left the UFC and had planned to fight in the [[PRIDE Fighting Championships]] in Japan. However, the plan fell through and in his next bout he fought in Japan's [[Pancrase]] where he defeated Japanese legend [[Tsuyoshi Kohsaka]]. Kyle won the fight via (technical) decision in round three after ringside doctors ruled Kohsaka unable to continue. Kyle had cut down from 245 lbs. to 230 lbs. for the fight. He then fought against [[Devin Cole]] at [[WEC 18|WEC 18: Unfinished Business]], and lost by TKO. This was Kyle's first defeat in the [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]].<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\n===Strikeforce===\nHe then signed with [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], making his debut against [[Krzysztof Soszynski]] in a [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] bout at [[List of Strikeforce events|Strikeforce: Shamrock vs. Gracie]]. The fight was declared a technical draw after Soszynski was accidentally poked in the eye by Kyle. Kyle then fought [[Brian Olsen]] for the [[List of WEC champions#Heavyweight Championship|WEC Heavyweight Championship]] and was disqualified after he hit Olsen with illegal strikes, for which he was placed on the national suspension list, and given an 18-month ban. After throwing Olsen over his shoulder, Kyle hit Olsen, who was on his knees and therefore a grounded opponent, with a soccer kick and then repeatedly hit him with strikes, continuing to hit Olsen even after fight referee Josh Rosenthal had physically tried to separate them, and did not stop until referee Herb Dean ran into the cage to assist Rosenthal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmafanatics.blogspot.com/2006/05/mike-kyle-on-national-suspension-list.html|title=Mike Kyle on national suspension list for kicking a downed fighter|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe 10\u20135\u20131 Kyle then fought at [[List of Strikeforce events|Strikeforce: Shamrock vs. Le]] against former All-American [[wrestling|wrestler]] Wayne Cole in a [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] bout and lost after he was submitted from an [[armbar]]. Kyle then returned to the IFC and won his bout via knockout, and followed this up with another win, this time via unanimous decision, his first career decision win. Kyle then returned to Strikeforce to fight [[Rafael Cavalcante]] in a [[Light Heavyweight (MMA)|Light Heavyweight]] bout at [[List of Strikeforce events|Strikeforce: Lawler vs. Shields]]. Kyle picked up one of the biggest victories of his career, winning by knockout against the future [[List of Strikeforce champions|Strikeforce Light Heavyweight Champion]]. This was also significant because it was Calvacante's first decisive loss, as his only other defeat was by disqualification against [[Marcio Cruz]].<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\nAfter his huge win over Calvacante, Kyle fought against [[Fabr\u00edcio Werdum]] in a [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] bout at [[List of Strikeforce events|Strikeforce: Carano vs. Cyborg]] in [[San Jose, California]]. He lost the bout via [[guillotine choke]] submission.<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\nHe then fought Jeremy Freitag at Xtreme MMA Australia 1 winning via TKO due to knees in the third round.\n\n===King of the Cage===\nKyle next signed with [[King of the Cage]] and fought against [[Travis Wiuff]] in a [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] bout, initially winning by TKO (doctor stoppage) in the second round. However, it was changed to a no contest decision after it was determined Kyle hit Wiuff after the bell.\n\nIn his second fight with [[King of the Cage]] Kyle fought [[Jon Murphy (fighter)|Jon Murphy]] and won via TKO at 4:53 of round two. He then fought Tony Lopez for the [[King of the Cage#Current champions|King of the Cage Light Heavyweight Championship]] and won via split decision after a five-round battle, becoming the [[List of KOTC champions|King of the Cage Light Heavyweight Champion]].\n\n===Return to Strikeforce===\nKyle fought against Abongo Humphrey at [[List of Strikeforce events|Strikeforce Challengers: del Rosario vs. Mahe]]. Kyle won via submission in the second round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lowkick.com/UFC/ShoMMA-9-Rosario-vs-Mahe-Quick-Results-LowPick-winneers-announced-9203|title=ShoMMA 9: Rosario vs Mahe Results|accessdate=August 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728013059/http://www.lowkick.com/UFC/ShoMMA-9-Rosario-vs-Mahe-Quick-Results-LowPick-winneers-announced-9203|archive-date=July 28, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nKyle fought against Steve Oliver at Xtreme MMA Australia 3 Kyle won via TKO due to punches in round one, winning the XMMA Light Heavyweight Championship.\n\nKyle stepped in on late notice to fight [[Ant\u00f4nio Silva (fighter)|Ant\u00f4nio \"Bigfoot\" Silva]] at [[Strikeforce: Henderson vs. Babalu II]] on December 4 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in a Heavyweight bout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/mike-kyle-tapped-to-face-antonio-silva-for-strikeforce|title=Mike Kyle Tapped to Face Antonio Silva for Strikeforce|work=MMA Weekly|date=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Kyle knocked Silva down with a powerful right hand and delivered many shots on the ground but was unable to finish.

March 31, 1980) is an American professional [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] and [[boxing|boxer]] currently competing in the [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] division. A professional competitor since 2001, Kyle has competed for the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], the [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]], [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], the [[World Series of Fighting]], [[Absolute Championship Berkut]], [[Pancrase]], [[King of the Cage]], and is the former [[List of KOTC champions#Light Heavyweight Championship|King of the Cage Light Heavyweight Champion]].\n\n==Background==\nKyle is from [[Boise, Idaho]]. He attended [[Nampa High School]] and was friends with the late [[Justin Eilers]], who Kyle would actually end up fighting in his second fight for the UFC. Eilers and a friend who were both two grades ahead of Kyle, taught him [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] techniques when he was a sophomore in high school. Kyle was also a talented football player, playing fullback for [[Butte College]] in [[Oroville, California]] and [[Eastern Oregon University]]. During his early mixed martial arts career he split time between fighting and playing football. He was invited to a spring camp for the [[San Francisco 49ers]], but ultimately decided to focus on [[mixed martial arts]].<ref name=\"411mania.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/MMA/columns/180490/411-Fighter-Profile-04.04.11:-Mike-Kyle.htm |title=411MANIA  |work=411 Fighter Profile 04.04.11: Mike Kyle |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019162412/http://www.411mania.com/MMA/columns/180490/411-Fighter-Profile-04.04.11%3A-Mike-Kyle.htm |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n===Early career===\nKyle held an undefeated amateur record of 3\u20130 before turning professional. Kyle made his professional debut on March 10, 2001, when he was 18 years old and won by [[Knockout|TKO]] only 90 seconds into the fight. He then won his next two fights, also by punches before debuting in the [[King of the Cage]] promotion. Kyle made his King of the Cage debut in a fight for the [[List of KOTC champions|King of the Cage Super Heavyweight Championship]] against then [[List of KOTC champions|King of the Cage Super Heavyweight Champion]] [[Dan Bobish]]. Kyle, who then weighed 275 lbs. was outweighed by Bobish, who was 55 lbs. bigger than Kyle. Despite rocking Bobish early in the fight and almost pulling off the upset, Kyle was handed his first career loss after he submitted due to punches. In his next [[King of the Cage|KOTC]] bout, Kyle made his [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] debut against future [[List of KOTC champions|King of the Cage Heavyweight Champion]] [[Paul Buentello]]. Kyle lost after he was knocked out from punches. After losing to Buentello, the San Jose-based [[American Kickboxing Academy]] invited Kyle to train. He accepted and has been training with AKA ever since.<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\nIn his next fight, Kyle made his debut in the [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]], and snapped his two-fight losing streak with a knockout win. The 4\u20132 Kyle then fought in the IFC and again won by strikes as his opponent tapped out due to punches. Kyle then also won his next two fights, which included another win under the WEC banner.<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\n===Ultimate Fighting Championship===\nKyle made his [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] debut against [[Wes Sims (fighter)|Wes Sims]] winning via KO at 4:59 of round one. Sims took the fight a days notice notice after Kyle's original opponent filled into the main event after [[Tim Sylvia]] failed a drug test. Kyle dominated the entire first round and knocked Sims out at 4:59. Sims protested after the fight that Kyle had bitten him on the chest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onzuka.com/news_2004April3.html |title=Hawaii Martial Arts News & Rumors \u2013 Dedicated to Hawaii-Specific Martial Arts News & Rumors |publisher=Onzuka.com |accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> During the post-fight interview, a bite mark could clearly be seen on Sims' left [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral muscle]]. This marks the first time a bite has ever happened in a UFC fight since its inception at [[UFC 1]] in 1993, when [[Gerard Gordeau]] bit [[Royce Gracie]] in the championship match. Kyle still denies any wrongdoing.\n\nKyle then fought the late [[Justin Eilers]] in a [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] bout. This was a significant match up as Eilers was a friend of Kyle's who had actually introduced Kyle to the sport of mixed martial arts. Kyle lost the fight when he was knocked out from a punch 74 seconds into the first round.<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\nHe then fought former [[List of WEC champions#Heavyweight Championship|WEC Heavyweight Champion]] [[James Irvin (fighter)|James Irvin]] at [[UFC 51]] winning via knockout in the first round. Despite this relatively notable win in the UFC, Kyle requested his release in from the UFC to compete in [[Japan]].\n\n===Post-UFC===\nKyle then left the UFC and had planned to fight in the [[PRIDE Fighting Championships]] in Japan. However, the plan fell through and in his next bout he fought in Japan's [[Pancrase]] where he defeated Japanese legend [[Tsuyoshi Kohsaka]]. Kyle won the fight via (technical) decision in round three after ringside doctors ruled Kohsaka unable to continue. Kyle had cut down from 245 lbs. to 230 lbs. for the fight. He then fought against [[Devin Cole]] at [[WEC 18|WEC 18: Unfinished Business]], and lost by TKO. This was Kyle's first defeat in the [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]].<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\n===Strikeforce===\nHe then signed with [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], making his debut against [[Krzysztof Soszynski]] in a [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] bout at [[List of Strikeforce events|Strikeforce: Shamrock vs. Gracie]]. The fight was declared a technical draw after Soszynski was accidentally poked in the eye by Kyle. Kyle then fought [[Brian Olsen]] for the [[List of WEC champions#Heavyweight Championship|WEC Heavyweight Championship]] and was disqualified after he hit Olsen with illegal strikes, for which he was placed on the national suspension list, and given an 18-month ban. After throwing Olsen over his shoulder, Kyle hit Olsen, who was on his knees and therefore a grounded opponent, with a soccer kick and then repeatedly hit him with strikes, continuing to hit Olsen even after fight referee Josh Rosenthal had physically tried to separate them, and did not stop until referee Herb Dean ran into the cage to assist Rosenthal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmafanatics.blogspot.com/2006/05/mike-kyle-on-national-suspension-list.html|title=Mike Kyle on national suspension list for kicking a downed fighter|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe 10\u20135\u20131 Kyle then fought at [[List of Strikeforce events|Strikeforce: Shamrock vs. Le]] against former All-American [[wrestling|wrestler]] Wayne Cole in a [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] bout and lost after he was submitted from an [[armbar]]. Kyle then returned to the IFC and won his bout via knockout, and followed this up with another win, this time via unanimous decision, his first career decision win. Kyle then returned to Strikeforce to fight [[Rafael Cavalcante]] in a [[Light Heavyweight (MMA)|Light Heavyweight]] bout at [[List of Strikeforce events|Strikeforce: Lawler vs. Shields]]. Kyle picked up one of the biggest victories of his career, winning by knockout against the future [[List of Strikeforce champions|Strikeforce Light Heavyweight Champion]]. This was also significant because it was Calvacante's first decisive loss, as his only other defeat was by disqualification against [[Marcio Cruz]].<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\nAfter his huge win over Calvacante, Kyle fought against [[Fabr\u00edcio Werdum]] in a [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] bout at [[List of Strikeforce events|Strikeforce: Carano vs. Cyborg]] in [[San Jose, California]]. He lost the bout via [[guillotine choke]] submission.<ref name=\"411mania.com\"/>\n\nHe then fought Jeremy Freitag at Xtreme MMA Australia 1 winning via TKO due to knees in the third round.\n\n===King of the Cage===\nKyle next signed with [[King of the Cage]] and fought against [[Travis Wiuff]] in a [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] bout, initially winning by TKO (doctor stoppage) in the second round. However, it was changed to a no contest decision after it was determined Kyle hit Wiuff after the bell.\n\nIn his second fight with [[King of the Cage]] Kyle fought [[Jon Murphy (fighter)|Jon Murphy]] and won via TKO at 4:53 of round two. He then fought Tony Lopez for the [[King of the Cage#Current champions|King of the Cage Light Heavyweight Championship]] and won via split decision after a five-round battle, becoming the [[List of KOTC champions|King of the Cage Light Heavyweight Champion]].\n\n===Return to Strikeforce===\nKyle fought against Abongo Humphrey at [[List of Strikeforce events|Strikeforce Challengers: del Rosario vs. Mahe]]. Kyle won via submission in the second round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lowkick.com/UFC/ShoMMA-9-Rosario-vs-Mahe-Quick-Results-LowPick-winneers-announced-9203|title=ShoMMA 9: Rosario vs Mahe Results|accessdate=August 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728013059/http://www.lowkick.com/UFC/ShoMMA-9-Rosario-vs-Mahe-Quick-Results-LowPick-winneers-announced-9203|archive-date=July 28, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nKyle fought against Steve Oliver at Xtreme MMA Australia 3 Kyle won via TKO due to punches in round one, winning the XMMA Light Heavyweight Championship.\n\nKyle stepped in on late notice to fight [[Ant\u00f4nio Silva (fighter)|Ant\u00f4nio \"Bigfoot\" Silva]] at [[Strikeforce: Henderson vs. Babalu II]] on December 4 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in a Heavyweight bout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/mike-kyle-tapped-to-face-antonio-silva-for-strikeforce|title=Mike Kyle Tapped to Face Antonio Silva for Strikeforce|work=MMA Weekly|date=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Kyle knocked Silva down with a powerful right hand and delivered many shots on the ground but was unable to finish.

Former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] veteran [[Keith Jardine]] stepped in on short notice as his replacement.\n\nKyle was again scheduled to fight Mousasi at [[Strikeforce World Grand Prix: Barnett vs. Kharitonov]] but Mousasi withdrew for unknown reasons and was replaced by [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]] newcomer [[Marcos Rog\u00e9rio de Lima]]. Kyle won by unanimous decision, picking apart the younger fighter with [[boxing]] techniques.\n\nKyle was expected to face [[Gegard Mousasi]] at [[Strikeforce: Tate vs. Rousey]], but withdrew from the fight due to injury. He next faced [[Rafael Cavalcante]] in a rematch at [[Strikeforce 40]] in what would be a title eliminator match for the vacant [[List of Strikeforce champions#Light Heavyweight Championship|Strikeforce Light Heavyweight Championship]].

The ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' define \"asana\" as \"[a position that] is steady and comfortable\".<ref name=\"yogasutras\"/> Patanjali mentions the ability to sit for extended periods as one of the [[Ashtanga (eight limbs of yoga)|eight limbs of his system]].<ref name=\"yogasutras\">[[Patanjali]] ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga sutras]]'', Book II:29, 46</ref> Asanas are called '''yoga poses''' or '''yoga postures''' in English. \n\nThe 10th or 11th century ''[[Goraksha Samhita|Goraksha Sataka]]'' and the 15th century ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]'' identify 84 asanas; the 17th century ''Hatha Ratnavali'' provides a different list of 84 asanas, describing some of them. In the 20th century, [[Indian nationalism]] favoured [[physical culture]] in response to [[colonialism]]. In that environment, pioneers such as [[Yogendra]], [[Kuvalayananda]], and [[Krishnamacharya]] taught a new system of asanas (incorporating systems of exercise as well as traditional hatha yoga). Among Krishnamacharya's pupils were influential Indian yoga teachers including [[Pattabhi Jois]], founder of [[Ashtanga vinyasa yoga]], and [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], founder of [[Iyengar yoga]]. Together they described hundreds more asanas, revived the popularity of yoga, and brought it to the Western world. Many more asanas have been devised since Iyengar's 1966 ''[[Light on Yoga]]'' which described some 200 asanas. Hundreds more were illustrated by [[Dharma Mittra]].\n\nAsanas were claimed to provide both spiritual and physical benefits in medieval hatha yoga texts. More recently, studies have provided evidence that they improve flexibility, strength, and balance; to reduce stress and conditions related to it; and specifically to alleviate some diseases such as asthma<ref name=ross /><ref name=hayes /> and diabetes.<ref name=alexander />\n\nAsanas have appeared in culture for many centuries. Religious [[Indian art]] depicts figures of [[Buddha]], [[Shiva]], and [[Jain]] [[tirthankara]]s in [[lotus position]] and other meditation seats, and in the \"royal ease\" position, [[lalitasana]]. With the popularity of yoga as exercise, asanas feature commonly in [[novels]] and [[films]], and sometimes also in [[advertising]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n[[File:Yogi.

Hatha Yoga added the ability to cure diseases to this list.{{sfn|Mallinson|Singleton|2017|pp=92\u201395}} Not all Hindu scriptures agreed that asanas were beneficial. The 10th century ''[[Garuda Purana]]'' stated that \"the techniques of posture do not promote yoga.

The ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' define \"asana\" as \"[a position that] is steady and comfortable\".<ref name=\"yogasutras\"/> Patanjali mentions the ability to sit for extended periods as one of the [[Ashtanga (eight limbs of yoga)|eight limbs of his system]].<ref name=\"yogasutras\">[[Patanjali]] ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga sutras]]'', Book II:29, 46</ref> Asanas are called '''yoga poses''' or '''yoga postures''' in English. \n\nThe 10th or 11th century ''[[Goraksha Samhita|Goraksha Sataka]]'' and the 15th century ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]'' identify 84 asanas; the 17th century ''Hatha Ratnavali'' provides a different list of 84 asanas, describing some of them. In the 20th century, [[Indian nationalism]] favoured [[physical culture]] in response to [[colonialism]]. In that environment, pioneers such as [[Yogendra]], [[Kuvalayananda]], and [[Krishnamacharya]] taught a new system of asanas (incorporating systems of exercise as well as traditional hatha yoga). Among Krishnamacharya's pupils were influential Indian yoga teachers including [[Pattabhi Jois]], founder of [[Ashtanga vinyasa yoga]], and [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], founder of [[Iyengar yoga]]. Together they described hundreds more asanas, revived the popularity of yoga, and brought it to the Western world. Many more asanas have been devised since Iyengar's 1966 ''[[Light on Yoga]]'' which described some 200 asanas. Hundreds more were illustrated by [[Dharma Mittra]].\n\nAsanas were claimed to provide both spiritual and physical benefits in medieval hatha yoga texts. More recently, studies have provided evidence that they improve flexibility, strength, and balance; to reduce stress and conditions related to it; and specifically to alleviate some diseases such as asthma<ref name=ross /><ref name=hayes /> and diabetes.<ref name=alexander />\n\nAsanas have appeared in culture for many centuries. Religious [[Indian art]] depicts figures of [[Buddha]], [[Shiva]], and [[Jain]] [[tirthankara]]s in [[lotus position]] and other meditation seats, and in the \"royal ease\" position, [[lalitasana]]. With the popularity of yoga as exercise, asanas feature commonly in [[novels]] and [[films]], and sometimes also in [[advertising]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n[[File:Yogi.

With 9,086 fans in attendance, the Aeros and Harrisburg Senators played the first game at Canal Park.  The Aeros went on to finish the season with a record of 51\u201390.  Despite the last place record, the team drew a Double-A league-leading 473,272 fans to Canal Park that season.\n\nIn the 1998 season, the Aeros put together a 30-game \"worst-to-first\" turnaround; after finishing the prior year 34\u00bd games back, they proceeded to win the Southern Division that season by 8\u00bd games.

In 2006, the Aeros again posted the best regular-season record in the league, but lost the playoff title to [[Portland Sea Dogs|Portland]] after taking the series to a deciding fifth game.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, the Aeros advanced to the Eastern League Championship Series.  Although the Aeros won the ELCS in 2005, they were defeated in three consecutive trips from 2006 to 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the Aeros again advanced to the league championship and defeated the [[Connecticut Defenders]] (three games to one) capping a 95-win season and their third title in the last seven years.

The team, which plays in the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]], is the Double-A affiliate of the [[Cleveland Indians]].

The nickname \"RubberDucks\" refers to Akron's history in the rubber industry, in particular as the birthplace of tire and rubber companies such as [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]], [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], [[Goodrich Corporation|Goodrich]] and [[General Tire]].\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AkronAeros.PNG|thumb|left|upright=0.5|The team was known as the Akron Aeros between 1997 and 2013.]] -->\n[[Opening Day]] on April 10, 1997, marked the debut of the Akron Aeros.  With 9,086 fans in attendance, the Aeros and Harrisburg Senators played the first game at Canal Park.  The Aeros went on to finish the season with a record of 51\u201390.  Despite the last place record, the team drew a Double-A league-leading 473,272 fans to Canal Park that season.\n\nIn the 1998 season, the Aeros put together a 30-game \"worst-to-first\" turnaround; after finishing the prior year 34\u00bd games back, they proceeded to win the Southern Division that season by 8\u00bd games.  However, after losing in the playoffs that year, it would be three more years until the Aeros found their way back to the postseason.\n\nOn September 6, 1999, the Aeros set an Eastern League attendance record for three straight seasons and once again led all Double-A teams after 522,459 fans attended Canal Park in 1999.<ref name=\"aeros-hist\">[http://www.akronaeros.com/aeros-history.php Akron Aeros History]</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the team posted a 93\u201348 record, the third-highest win total in the Eastern League in 50 years.  They built on that success and finally won two league championships (their first since moving to Ohio) in 2003 and 2005.  In 2006, the Aeros again posted the best regular-season record in the league, but lost the playoff title to [[Portland Sea Dogs|Portland]] after taking the series to a deciding fifth game.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, the Aeros advanced to the Eastern League Championship Series.  Although the Aeros won the ELCS in 2005, they were defeated in three consecutive trips from 2006 to 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the Aeros again advanced to the league championship and defeated the [[Connecticut Defenders]] (three games to one) capping a 95-win season and their third title in the last seven years. Jared Head was named the playoff MVP.\n\nIn their first three seasons in Canal Park, the Aeros led all of Double-A in attendance, becoming the first team at that level to draw a half-million fans in a single season.\n\nThe team was sold by Mike Agganis to [[Ken Babby]] in October 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ohio.com/news/top-stories/ken-babby-takes-over-aeros-with-fan-experience-a-top-priority-and-no-name-change-in-plans-1.342334|title=Ken Babby takes over Aeros with fan experience a priority no name changes in plan |work=Akron Beacon Journal website |date=October 15, 2012 |accessdate=October 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2014\u2013present===\nOn October 29, 2013, the Akron Aeros officially changed their name to the Akron RubberDucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20131029&content_id=63448892&fext=.jsp&vkey=news_milb|title=You're the one: Akron RubberDucks|last=Hill|first=Benjamin|date=29 October 2013|publisher=MiLB.com|accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe RubberDucks won their first Eastern League Championship under the new name in 2016, sweeping Trenton 3-0.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

The downturn in industry in the late 20th century caused a loss of many jobs, leaving many people in poverty.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.
