The film features [[Prashanth]] and [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] in the lead roles, with [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]], [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] and [[Srividya]] playing other pivotal roles. The film's soundtrack is composed by [[A.R. Rahman]], mostly featuring music re-used from his own earlier soundtrack for the Hindi film ''[[Doli Saja Ke Rakhna]]''. Due to Rahman's unavailability, Praveen Gandhi signed [[Sabesh-Murali]] to quickly compose the background score of the film. The film opened in September 1999 and was remade in Kannada in 2007 as ''[[Sajni (film)|Sajni]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nKannan ([[Prashanth]]) is a young music shop employee. He dreams of a girl who wears gold anklets. One day he sees the feet of a running girl, and realises that she is the girl he has been dreaming of. He follows her. Kannan goes to a music college to repair music instruments. Gayathri ([[Simran (actress)|Simran]]), a college student, is the girl which Kannan found as his dream girl. She and her friends approach and request him to not repair the music instruments, as they are very old and unfit to use for the music contest. Kannan uses the opportunity to become close to her but Gayathri is angered by his behaviour. Kannan accompanies Gayathri to Bangalore for the music contest, where Gayathri sees Kannan getting money from a rival music band. On the day of the contest,  Gayathri and her team are shocked to learn that the song which they have composed was stolen by the other troop. She assumes that Kannan has stolen and sold their work for money despite Kannan's protest that he is innocent. Kannan lends her one of the love poems he had written for her, and she sings it in the contest and wins the prize. Gayathri understands that Kannan has no role in the stealing of the song and he got money from the troop for fixing their repaired music instruments. Gayathri now realised her mistake and rushes to apologize and accept his love. Kannan gets news that his father was injured and rushes home.\n\nKannan\u2019s father Rudramurthy ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]) is an registrar office who witnesses many marriages take place without the consent of couple's parents. He is against such marriages and tried to prevent one such marriage by advising the girl who had come to marry her lover and sending her home which led to quarrel and attack by groom and his friends.  Kannan understood that he is going to have a tough time with his love and his father who hates love marriages. Gayathri on other hand has a family with a father who is very depressed by one incident which happened in his life. Gayathri's friend and her lover commit suicide due to pressure put up by the parents against their love. This upsets Gayathri and she is scared on how to marry Kannan. Both Kannan and Gayathri plan to visit the family of the other, impress them, attract them and get permission for the marriage and set for their mission.\n\nGayathri sets out to Kannan's home as a daughter of troublesome neighbour of Kannan and Kannan sets to Gayathri's home only to earn a name of vagabond from her family. Both Gayathri and Kannan try their level best to get into the home of other's families and succeed to some extent. Gayathri manages to win the heart of Rudramurthy when she tried to stop his daughter who was about to run away from her home with her lover and succeed in that. This makes Rudramurthy accept her as his daughter-in-law. On the other hand, Kannan visits his home with much depression reason being failing to accomplish his mission. Kannan finds the reason for Gayathri's father Vengudu's condition as one incident. Vengudu is a music critic and his criticism plays a vital role in one's music career. Vengudu once made a bad criticism about a male vocalist in front of the audience and also in the next day newspaper which led the vocalist to commit suicide. The wife of vocalist shouts at him and curses him for bring her a fate. From then he stopped his critic job and has been living with remorse. Kannan attempts to solve his problem by visiting the vocalist's house and explains the current condition of Vengudu. He requests them forgive him and visit his home to which the lady accepts. On the day of the visit the lady proposes marriage alliance of her son who met Gayathri on the music contest at Bangalore with Vengudu's daughter Gayathri to which Vengudu accepts. On hearing about her marriage, Gayathri screams that she will not let this happen and goes to convince her father. On seeing her father, he falls at her feet and she is tongue tied as she finds her father has changed a lot and her marriage would bring him complete relief from his guilt.\n\nHowever, on the day of the marriage the groom sings one of the love songs written by Kannan for Gayathri and which she sang in the music contest. On hearing this song, Gayathri runs to Kannan. The groom explains to Vengudu that Kannan and Gayathri love each other very much, and not to separate them. Vengudu accepts them as he does not want to commit another mistake in his life and spend his life in guilt. Kannan and Gayathri are united together in the end.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prashanth]] as Kannan\n* [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] as Gayathri/Vaidheghi\n* [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]] as Vengudu\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Rudramurthy\n* [[Janagaraj]] as Nachimuthu\n* [[Ambika (actress)|Ambika]] as Sneha Varadharajan (Gayathri's principal)\n* [[Lavanya (actress)|Lavanya]] as Uma\n* [[Shanthi Williams]] as Kannan\u2019s mother\n* [[Sumithra (actress)|Sumithra]] as Gayathri\u2019s mother\n* [[S.

The film features [[Prashanth]] and [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] in the lead roles, with [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]], [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] and [[Srividya]] playing other pivotal roles. The film's soundtrack is composed by [[A.R. Rahman]], mostly featuring music re-used from his own earlier soundtrack for the Hindi film ''[[Doli Saja Ke Rakhna]]''. Due to Rahman's unavailability, Praveen Gandhi signed [[Sabesh-Murali]] to quickly compose the background score of the film. The film opened in September 1999 and was remade in Kannada in 2007 as ''[[Sajni (film)|Sajni]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nKannan ([[Prashanth]]) is a young music shop employee. He dreams of a girl who wears gold anklets. One day he sees the feet of a running girl, and realises that she is the girl he has been dreaming of. He follows her. Kannan goes to a music college to repair music instruments. Gayathri ([[Simran (actress)|Simran]]), a college student, is the girl which Kannan found as his dream girl. She and her friends approach and request him to not repair the music instruments, as they are very old and unfit to use for the music contest. Kannan uses the opportunity to become close to her but Gayathri is angered by his behaviour. Kannan accompanies Gayathri to Bangalore for the music contest, where Gayathri sees Kannan getting money from a rival music band. On the day of the contest,  Gayathri and her team are shocked to learn that the song which they have composed was stolen by the other troop. She assumes that Kannan has stolen and sold their work for money despite Kannan's protest that he is innocent. Kannan lends her one of the love poems he had written for her, and she sings it in the contest and wins the prize. Gayathri understands that Kannan has no role in the stealing of the song and he got money from the troop for fixing their repaired music instruments. Gayathri now realised her mistake and rushes to apologize and accept his love. Kannan gets news that his father was injured and rushes home.\n\nKannan\u2019s father Rudramurthy ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]) is an registrar office who witnesses many marriages take place without the consent of couple's parents. He is against such marriages and tried to prevent one such marriage by advising the girl who had come to marry her lover and sending her home which led to quarrel and attack by groom and his friends.  Kannan understood that he is going to have a tough time with his love and his father who hates love marriages. Gayathri on other hand has a family with a father who is very depressed by one incident which happened in his life. Gayathri's friend and her lover commit suicide due to pressure put up by the parents against their love. This upsets Gayathri and she is scared on how to get  married to Kannan. Both Kannan and Gayathri plan to visit the family of the other, impress them, attract them and get permission for the marriage and set for their mission.\n\nGayathri sets out to Kannan's home as a daughter of troublesome neighbour of Kannan and Kannan sets to Gayathri's home only to earn a name of vagabond from her family. Both Gayathri and Kannan try their level best to get into the home of other's families and succeed to some extent. Gayathri manages to win the heart of Rudramurthy when she tried to stop his daughter who was about to run away from her home with her lover and succeed in that. This makes Rudramurthy accept her as his daughter-in-law. On the other hand, Kannan visits his home with much depression reason being failing to accomplish his mission. Kannan finds the reason for Gayathri's father Vengudu's condition as one incident. Vengudu is a music critic and his criticism plays a vital role in one's music career. Vengudu once made a bad criticism about a male vocalist in front of the audience and also in the next day newspaper which led the vocalist to commit suicide. The wife of vocalist shouts at him and curses him for bring her a fate. From then he stopped his critic job and has been living with remorse. Kannan attempts to solve his problem by visiting the vocalist's house and explains the current condition of Vengudu. He requests them forgive him and visit his home to which the lady accepts. On the day of the visit the lady proposes marriage alliance of her son who met Gayathri on the music contest at Bangalore with Vengudu's daughter Gayathri to which Vengudu accepts. On hearing about her marriage, Gayathri screams that she will not let this happen and goes to convince her father. On seeing her father, he falls at her feet and she is tongue tied as she finds her father has changed a lot and her marriage would bring him complete relief from his guilt.\n\nHowever, on the day of the marriage the groom sings one of the love songs written by Kannan for Gayathri and which she sang in the music contest. On hearing this song, Gayathri runs to Kannan. The groom explains to Vengudu that Kannan and Gayathri love each other very much, and not to separate them. Vengudu accepts them as he does not want to commit another mistake in his life and spend his life in guilt. Kannan and Gayathri are united together in the end.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prashanth]] as Kannan\n* [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] as Gayathri/Vaidheghi\n* [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]] as Vengudu\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Rudramurthy\n* [[Janagaraj]] as Nachimuthu\n* [[Ambika (actress)|Ambika]] as Sneha Varadharajan (Gayathri's principal)\n* [[Lavanya (actress)|Lavanya]] as Uma\n* [[Shanthi Williams]] as Kannan\u2019s mother\n* [[Sumithra (actress)|Sumithra]] as Gayathri\u2019s mother\n* [[S.

During his sophomore year, Curry also set the single-season [[NCAA]] record for three-pointers made, and was then selected by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick in the [[2009 NBA Draft]].\n\nIn [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2014\u201315]], Curry won his first MVP award and led the Warriors to their first [[2015 NBA Finals|championship]] since 1975.

He surpassed that record in [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2015]] with 286, and again in [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2016]] with 402.

shooting style.<ref name=\"Davis\"/> The increase in three-point shooting is partly due to NBA teams incorporating it in their attempts to defeat the Warriors or copy the Warriors' style of play, and to young people wanting to imitate Curry's shooting range.<ref name=\"Dougherty\"/><ref name=\"O'Connell\"/> Although this has led to players becoming good at or improving their three-point shot, it has also set unrealistic standards because Curry's range is unique.<ref name=\"Dougherty\"/> Curry regularly takes shots from between 30 and 35 feet.<ref name=\"Goldsberry\"/> He shoots 54 percent from this range, while the NBA makes 35 percent of its threes overall and under 22 percent from between 30 and 35 feet.<ref name=\"Goldsberry\"/> He can make the shots with elite ball handling, off the dribble, and often with an extremely quick release, from anywhere on the court and with one or more defenders on him.<ref name=\"Davis\"/> Curry said that he is sure coaches tell their high school players that shooting the way he does takes work and time.<ref name=\"Dougherty\"/> Jesse Dougherty of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that \"coaches have to explain that while Curry's skill set is something to aspire to, his game is built on fundamentals\" and that \"while the Warriors have become the NBA's gold standard and make all those social-media-bound plays, the root of their success is ball movement.\"<ref name=\"Dougherty\"/>\n\nKirk Goldsberry of [[ESPN]] opined that \"one of the keys to [Curry's] greatness is his range\" and that \"Curry isn't just the best 3-point shooter ever, he's the best deep 3-point shooter ever.\"<ref name=\"Goldsberry\"/> Sally Jenkins of ''The Washington Post'' stated that he \"moves around behind the three-point line in an ever-widening arc, sinking long distance shots so cleanly that the net seems to snap like fresh laundry in a breeze\" and that a highlight is the \"sheer preposterousness of his shots, and the rate at which he is sinking the most far-fetched of them.\" She said that \"in one stretch he hit a mind-expanding 67 percent between 28 and 50 feet.\"<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/> Warriors Coach Steve Kerr stated that Curry's hand-eye coordination \"is as great as anyone I've ever seen.\"<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/> Jeff Austin of [[Octagon (sports agency)|Octagton]] concluded that Curry \"had to develop tremendous strength in his wrists to shoot and maintain that form from 40 and 50 feet.\"<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/> Goldsberry stated that \"no player in the history of the NBA has combined range, volume and efficiency from downtown as well as Curry\" and that \"Curry's jumper is so lethal that he has become the most efficient volume scorer on the planet.\"<ref name=\"Goldsberry\"/> His range and efficiency drove the developers of the ''[[NBA 2K]]'' video game series, in which Curry is featured, to worry that his abilities could not be replicated on screen.<ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\nAlthough Curry is commonly cited

He pays a tax for his great teammates.\"<ref name=\"Windhorst\"/> [[Scottie Pippen]], who won six NBA titles with the [[Chicago Bulls]], said that Curry's \"willingness to sacrifice for [Kevin Durant] is one of the great stories in history\" because Curry welcomed Durant, who is also a top player, to the Warriors without ego. \"If you have a mind for the game, you know that it takes sacrifice to be great.

During his sophomore year, Curry also set the single-season [[NCAA]] record for three-pointers made, and was then selected by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick in the [[2009 NBA Draft]].\n\nIn [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2014\u201315]], Curry won his first MVP award and led the Warriors to their first [[2015 NBA Finals|championship]] since 1975.

shooting style.<ref name=\"Davis\"/> The increase in three-point shooting is partly due to NBA teams incorporating it in their attempts to defeat the Warriors or copy the Warriors' style of play, and to young people wanting to imitate Curry's shooting range.<ref name=\"Dougherty\"/><ref name=\"O'Connell\"/> Although this has led to players becoming good at or improving their three-point shot, it has also set unrealistic standards because Curry's range is unique.<ref name=\"Dougherty\"/> Curry regularly takes shots from between 30 and 35 feet.<ref name=\"Goldsberry\"/> He shoots 54 percent from this range, while the NBA makes 35 percent of its threes overall and under 22 percent from between 30 and 35 feet.<ref name=\"Goldsberry\"/> He can make the shots with elite ball handling, off the dribble, and often with an extremely quick release, from anywhere on the court and with one or more defenders on him.<ref name=\"Davis\"/> Curry said that he is sure coaches tell their high school players that shooting the way he does takes work and time.<ref name=\"Dougherty\"/> Jesse Dougherty of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that \"coaches have to explain that while Curry's skill set is something to aspire to, his game is built on fundamentals\" and that \"while the Warriors have become the NBA's gold standard and make all those social-media-bound plays, the root of their success is ball movement.\"<ref name=\"Dougherty\"/>\n\nKirk Goldsberry of [[ESPN]] opined that \"one of the keys to [Curry's] greatness is his range\" and that \"Curry isn't just the best 3-point shooter ever, he's the best deep 3-point shooter ever.\"<ref name=\"Goldsberry\"/> Sally Jenkins of ''The Washington Post'' stated that he \"moves around behind the three-point line in an ever-widening arc, sinking long distance shots so cleanly that the net seems to snap like fresh laundry in a breeze\" and that a highlight is the \"sheer preposterousness of his shots, and the rate at which he is sinking the most far-fetched of them.\" She said that \"in one stretch he hit a mind-expanding 67 percent between 28 and 50 feet.\"<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/> Warriors Coach Steve Kerr stated that Curry's hand-eye coordination \"is as great as anyone I've ever seen.\"<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/> Jeff Austin of [[Octagon (sports agency)|Octagton]] concluded that Curry \"had to develop tremendous strength in his wrists to shoot and maintain that form from 40 and 50 feet.\"<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/> Goldsberry stated that \"no player in the history of the NBA has combined range, volume and efficiency from downtown as well as Curry\" and that \"Curry's jumper is so lethal that he has become the most efficient volume scorer on the planet.\"<ref name=\"Goldsberry\"/> His range and efficiency drove the developers of the ''[[NBA 2K]]'' video game series, in which Curry is featured, to worry that his abilities could not be replicated on screen.<ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\nAlthough Curry is commonly cited

He pays a tax for his great teammates.\"<ref name=\"Windhorst\"/> [[Scottie Pippen]], who won six NBA titles with the [[Chicago Bulls]], said that Curry's \"willingness to sacrifice for [Kevin Durant] is one of the great stories in history\" because Curry welcomed Durant, who is also a top player, to the Warriors without ego. \"If you have a mind for the game, you know that it takes sacrifice to be great.

California''}}\n\n'''''Cohen v. California''''', 403 U.S. 15 (1971), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] prevented the conviction of Paul Robert Cohen for the crime of [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]] by wearing a jacket displaying \"Fuck [[Conscription in the United States#Vietnam War|the Draft]]\" in the public corridors of a California courthouse.\n\nThe Court ultimately found that displaying a mere four-letter word was not sufficient justification to allow states to restrict free speech and that free speech can be restricted only under severe circumstances beyond offensiveness. The ruling set a precedent used in future cases concerning the power of states to regulate free speech in order to maintain public civility.\n\n==Background==\n===Facts of the case===\nOn April 26, 1968, 19-year-old Paul Robert Cohen was arrested for wearing a jacket bearing the words \"Fuck the Draft\" inside the corridor of the [[Los Angeles]] [[Courthouse]].<ref>''Cohen v.

California'' and the Supreme Court of California's denial of review. The appeal court's ruling was cited in Bushman. Blackmun wrote that the case \"ought to be remanded to the California Court of Appeal for reconsideration in the light of the subsequently rendered decision by the State's highest tribunal in Bushman\" since the interpretation of section 415 used in the appeal court's ruling may no longer be the authoritative interpretation.<ref name=\"Cornell Cohen\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/15|title=Cohen v.

Village of Skokie''===\nThe ''[[National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie]]'' was a 1977 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case.

App. 3d 279 \u2013 CourtListener.com|website=CourtListener|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> The rulings in both courts found that, while the actions of the Nazi marchers were offensive to Jewish Skokie residents, mere offensiveness was not enough to justify curtailing free speech and assembly. In the Illinois Supreme Court ruling, the opinion states, \"The decisions of that [Supreme] court, particularly Cohen v. California (1971) ... in our opinion compel us to permit the demonstration as proposed, including display of the swastika.\"<ref name=\"Skokie v Nazis\">{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/illinois/supreme-court/1978/49769-6.html|title=Village of Skokie v. Nat'l Socialist Party of America|website=Justia Law|language=en|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, the ''Cohen'' ruling was used to justify whether the actions of the Nazi marchers could be classified as \"[[fighting words]]\", which are among several categories of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment. In U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'' (1942), fighting words were defined as \"those that inherently cause harm or are likely to result in an immediate disturbance\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/315/568/|title=Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942)|website=Justia Law|language=en|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref> In the Skokie ruling, the Court instead relied on the ruling from ''Cohen'' that stated that offensiveness was not a sufficient justification for curtailing free speech. Subsequently, the Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to prohibit the march on the grounds that a [[swastika]] was a \"fighting word\", as the offense it caused to the audience was irrelevant to the law.<ref name=\"Skokie v Nazis\" />\n\n===''R.A.V. v. St. Paul''===\n''[[R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul]]'' was a 1992 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case which ruled that [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]'s Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance was unconstitutional because it discriminated by the content of \"fighting words\". The Court stated that while the law applied to \"fighting words\", which are not protected under the First Amendment, it was unconstitutional because it specifically targeted fighting words that \"insult or incite violence on the basis of race, religion, or gender\".<ref name=\"R A V v St. Paul\">{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/377/|title=R.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;V. v.

In his opinion on the ruling, [[John Paul Stevens|Justice John Paul Stevens]] cited ''Cohen'' in his claim that \"we have consistently construed the 'fighting words' exception set forth in Chaplinsky narrowly.\"<ref name=\"R A V v St. Paul\" />\n\n===''The State of Washington v. Marc D. Montgomery''===\n\nIn ''State of Washington v. Marc D. Montgomery'', 15-year-old Montgomery successfully won an appeal overturning his convictions for disorderly conduct and possession of marijuana on the grounds of free speech. Montgomery was arrested after shouting obscenities, such as \"fucking pigs, fucking pig ass hole\" at two police officers passing in their patrol car. Citing ''Cohen v. California'', the Court ruled that Montgomery's words could not be classified as fighting words, and restricting speech based merely on its offensiveness would result in a \"substantial risk of suppressing ideas in the process\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://courts.mrsc.org/appellate/031wnapp/031wnapp0745.htm|title=31 Wn.

Pacifica Foundation|''Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation'' (1978)]], the Court ruled that the Commission could regulate broadcasts that were indecent, but not necessarily obscene. In the ruling, the Court stated that while the ''Cohen'' ruling disputed that Cohen's speech would offend unwilling viewers, and that no one in the courthouse had actually complained, the Commission was responding to a listener's complaint. Furthermore, the ruling noted that the while Cohen was sentenced to 30 days in jail, \"even the strongest civil penalty at the Commission's command does not include criminal prosecution.\"<ref name=\"FCC v Pacifica\">{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/438/726/|title=FCC v.

Fraser''===\n\nIn Supreme Court case [[Bethel School District v. Fraser|''Bethel School District v. Fraser'' (1986)]], the court ruled that public schools had the right to regulate speech that was indecent, but not necessarily obscene. The Court stated that while adults could not be prohibited from using offensive speech while making a political statement, this protection did not extend to public school students. The ruling cited [[New Jersey v. T. L. O.|''New Jersey v. T.L.O''.]], arguing that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/478/675/|title=Bethel Sch.

George Wright wrote that it would be reasonable to expect all speakers to maintain at least a minimum level of decorum in their speech, such that they do not disrespect \"substantial numbers of reasonably tolerant people\". Wright pushed back on claims made by other scholars that Cohen should not be censored because the word \"Fuck\" in the phrase \"Fuck the Draft\" expressed the depth of Cohen's emotion, and instead argued that it is risky to assume that a slogan, \"[[Profanity|profane]] or otherwise, is likely to be particularly apt in expressing deep frustrations.\" He further argued that Cohen's emotions should not be assumed from his willingness to offend. Subsequently, Wright claimed that the effect of speech on the level of public discourse should not be ignored.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=The Supreme Court Review|volume=1985|pages=149\u2013178|language=en|jstor = 3109499|last1 = Wright|first1 = R.

Mill for the Free Speech Clause|year=1985|doi=10.1086/scr.1985.3109499}}</ref> Legal scholar Archibald Cox similarly argued that the expression, \"Fuck the Draft\", in the ''Cohen'' ruling unnecessarily lowered the standard of public debate.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government|last=Cox|first=Archibald|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\nIn his [[retrospective]] on the ruling, legal scholar Thomas Krattenmaker points out that at the time of the ruling, uttering the word \"Fuck\" in public, especially in the presence of women, was exceptionally rare, and that it was not unreasonable that Cohen aimed to be offensive in his use of the word.<ref name=\"Krattenmaker 2012\">{{Cite journal|last=Krattenmaker|first=Thomas|date=2012|title=Looking Back at Cohen v.

However, Krattenmaker does argue that governments should perhaps have more power to regulate hurtful speech, and criticizes the Court's treatment of the captive audience problem for providing little direction for future rulings.<ref name=\"Krattenmaker 2012\" />\n\nLegal scholar William Cohen also noted the limitations of the ruling in providing guidance on whether profanity should still be protected in certain locations or given certain audiences. Cohen argues that because the ruling is \"narrowly limited to its facts\", it has not been used in future cases pertaining to the regulation of offensive speech, such as ''FCC v. Pacifica Foundation''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=William|date=1986-1987|title=A Look Back at Cohen v.

California''}}\n\n'''''Cohen v. California''''', 403 U.S. 15 (1971), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] prevented the conviction of Paul Robert Cohen for the crime of [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]] by wearing a jacket displaying \"Fuck [[Conscription in the United States#Vietnam War|the Draft]]\" in the public corridors of a California courthouse.\n\nThe Court ultimately found that displaying a mere four-letter word was not sufficient justification to allow states to restrict free speech and that free speech can be restricted only under severe circumstances beyond offensiveness. The ruling set a precedent used in future cases concerning the power of states to regulate free speech in order to maintain public civility.\n\n==Background==\n===Facts of the case===\nOn April 26, 1968, 19-year-old Paul Robert Cohen was arrested for wearing a jacket bearing the words \"Fuck the Draft\" inside the corridor of the [[Los Angeles]] [[Courthouse]].<ref>''Cohen v.

California'' and the Supreme Court of California's denial of review. The appeal court's ruling was cited in Bushman. Blackmun wrote that the case \"ought to be remanded to the California Court of Appeal for reconsideration in the light of the subsequently rendered decision by the State's highest tribunal in Bushman\" since the interpretation of section 415 used in the appeal court's ruling may no longer be the authoritative interpretation.<ref name=\"Cornell Cohen\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/15|title=Cohen v.

Village of Skokie''===\nThe ''[[National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie]]'' was a 1977 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case. It concerned the constitutionality of an injunction against members of the [[National Socialist Party of America]] prohibiting them from holding a march in [[Skokie, Illinois]], which had a large [[Jews|Jewish]] population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Farber|first=Daniel|date=1980|title=Civilizing Public Discourse: An Essay on Professor Bickel, Justice Harlan, and the Enduring Signicance of Cohen v.

App. 3d 279 \u2013 CourtListener.com|website=CourtListener|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> The rulings in both courts found that, while the actions of the Nazi marchers were offensive to Jewish Skokie residents, mere offensiveness was not enough to justify curtailing free speech and assembly. In the Illinois Supreme Court ruling, the opinion states, \"The decisions of that [Supreme] court, particularly Cohen v. California (1971) ... in our opinion compel us to permit the demonstration as proposed, including display of the swastika.\"<ref name=\"Skokie v Nazis\">{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/illinois/supreme-court/1978/49769-6.html|title=Village of Skokie v. Nat'l Socialist Party of America|website=Justia Law|language=en|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, the ''Cohen'' ruling was used to justify whether the actions of the Nazi marchers could be classified as \"[[fighting words]]\", which are among several categories of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment. In U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'' (1942), fighting words were defined as \"those that inherently cause harm or are likely to result in an immediate disturbance\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/315/568/|title=Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942)|website=Justia Law|language=en|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref> In the Skokie ruling, the Court instead relied on the ruling from ''Cohen'' that stated that offensiveness was not a sufficient justification for curtailing free speech. Subsequently, the Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to prohibit the march on the grounds that a [[swastika]] was a \"fighting word\", as the offense it caused to the audience was irrelevant to the law.<ref name=\"Skokie v Nazis\" />\n\n===''R.A.V. v. St. Paul''===\n''[[R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul]]'' was a 1992 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case which ruled that [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]'s Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance was unconstitutional because it discriminated by the content of \"fighting words\". The Court stated that while the law applied to \"fighting words\", which are not protected under the First Amendment, it was unconstitutional because it specifically targeted fighting words that \"insult or incite violence on the basis of race, religion, or gender\".<ref name=\"R A V v St. Paul\">{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/377/|title=R.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992)|website=Justia Law|language=en|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref> In its ruling, the Court acknowledged that while cross-burning was an abhorrent act, the ordinance was nevertheless void and the defendants could be prosecuted by other means. In his opinion on the ruling, [[John Paul Stevens|Justice John Paul Stevens]] cited ''Cohen'' in his claim that \"we have consistently construed the 'fighting words' exception set forth in Chaplinsky narrowly.\"<ref name=\"R A V v St. Paul\" />\n\n===''The State of Washington v. Marc D. Montgomery''===\n\nIn ''State of Washington v. Marc D. Montgomery'', 15-year-old Montgomery successfully won an appeal overturning his convictions for disorderly conduct and possession of marijuana on the grounds of free speech. Montgomery was arrested after shouting obscenities, such as \"fucking pigs, fucking pig ass hole\" at two police officers passing in their patrol car. Citing ''Cohen v. California'', the Court ruled that Montgomery's words could not be classified as fighting words, and restricting speech based merely on its offensiveness would result in a \"substantial risk of suppressing ideas in the process\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://courts.mrsc.org/appellate/031wnapp/031wnapp0745.htm|title=31 Wn.

Pacifica Foundation|''Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation'' (1978)]], the Court ruled that the Commission could regulate broadcasts that were indecent, but not necessarily obscene. In the ruling, the Court stated that while the ''Cohen'' ruling disputed that Cohen's speech would offend unwilling viewers, and that no one in the courthouse had actually complained, the Commission was responding to a listener's complaint. Furthermore, the ruling noted that the while Cohen was sentenced to 30 days in jail, \"even the strongest civil penalty at the Commission's command does not include criminal prosecution.\"<ref name=\"FCC v Pacifica\">{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/438/726/|title=FCC v.

Fraser''===\n\nIn Supreme Court case [[Bethel School District v. Fraser|''Bethel School District v. Fraser'' (1986)]], the court ruled that public schools had the right to regulate speech that was indecent, but not necessarily obscene. The Court stated that while adults could not be prohibited from using offensive speech while making a political statement, this protection did not extend to public school students. The ruling cited [[New Jersey v. T. L. O.|''New Jersey v. T.L.O''.]], arguing that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/478/675/|title=Bethel Sch.

Wilson'' (1972)\n*''New Jersey v. T.L.O'' (1985)\n\n== Scholarly response ==\nIn his critique of the ''Cohen'' ruling, Professor R. George Wright wrote that it would be reasonable to expect all speakers to maintain at least a minimum level of decorum in their speech, such that they do not disrespect \"substantial numbers of reasonably tolerant people\". Wright pushed back on claims made by other scholars that Cohen should not be censored because the word \"Fuck\" in the phrase \"Fuck the Draft\" expressed the depth of Cohen's emotion, and instead argued that it is risky to assume that a slogan, \"[[Profanity|profane]] or otherwise, is likely to be particularly apt in expressing deep frustrations.\" He further argued that Cohen's emotions should not be assumed from his willingness to offend. Subsequently, Wright claimed that the effect of speech on the level of public discourse should not be ignored.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=The Supreme Court Review|volume=1985|pages=149\u2013178|language=en|jstor = 3109499|last1 = Wright|first1 = R. George|title=A Rationale from J. S. Mill for the Free Speech Clause|year=1985|doi=10.1086/scr.1985.3109499}}</ref> Legal scholar Archibald Cox similarly argued that the expression, \"Fuck the Draft\", in the ''Cohen'' ruling unnecessarily lowered the standard of public debate.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government|last=Cox|first=Archibald|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\nIn his [[retrospective]] on the ruling, legal scholar Thomas Krattenmaker points out that at the time of the ruling, uttering the word \"Fuck\" in public, especially in the presence of women, was exceptionally rare, and that it was not unreasonable that Cohen aimed to be offensive in his use of the word.<ref name=\"Krattenmaker 2012\">{{Cite journal|last=Krattenmaker|first=Thomas|date=2012|title=Looking Back at Cohen v.

However, Krattenmaker does argue that governments should perhaps have more power to regulate hurtful speech, and criticizes the Court's treatment of the captive audience problem for providing little direction for future rulings.<ref name=\"Krattenmaker 2012\" />\n\nLegal scholar William Cohen also noted the limitations of the ruling in providing guidance on whether profanity should still be protected in certain locations or given certain audiences. Cohen argues that because the ruling is \"narrowly limited to its facts\", it has not been used in future cases pertaining to the regulation of offensive speech, such as ''FCC v. Pacifica Foundation''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=William|date=1986-1987|title=A Look Back at Cohen v.
