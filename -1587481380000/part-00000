Unlike the 201st decade (2001-2010), the term \"2000s (decade)\" is immune from the no year zero argument of its title in general (2000 was not part of the 1990s nor was 2010 included in the 2000s, but in the proceeding decade, the 2010s). If you wish to suggest otherwise or wish to discuss this matter, please refer to the article talk page. Thank You. -->  \n\nThe early part of the decade saw the long-time predicted breakthrough of economic giant [[Economy of China|China]], which had double-digit growth during nearly the whole decade. To a lesser extent, India also benefited from an economic boom, which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force. The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the [[subprime mortgage crisis|crisis in housing and credit]] in the United States in late 2007 and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions. The outbreak of this [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|global financial crisis]] sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world.\n\nThe growth of the [[Internet]] contributed to [[globalization]] during the decade, which allowed faster communication among people around the world;<ref>Ludden D (1998).

The first social networking sites were [[Friendster]], [[Myspace]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, respectively. Myspace was the most popular social networking website until June 2009 when Facebook overtook Myspace in the number of American users. The E-mail continued to be popular throughout the decade and began to replace \"[[snail mail]]\" as the primary way of sending letters and other messages to people in far away locations, though it has been available since 1971.\n\nThe [[War on Terror]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] began after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. The [[International Criminal Court]] was formed in 2002. A United States-led coalition invaded [[Iraq]], and the [[Iraq War]] led to the end of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s rule as Iraqi President and the [[Ba'ath Party]] in Iraq. [[Al-Qaeda]] and affiliated [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. The [[Second Congo War]], the deadliest conflict since World War II, ended in July 2003. Further wars that ended included the [[Algerian Civil War]], the [[Angolan Civil War]], the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]], the [[Second Liberian Civil War]], the [[Nepalese Civil War]], and the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. Wars that began included the [[conflict in the Niger Delta]], the [[Houthi insurgency in Yemen]], and the [[Mexican Drug War]].\n\n[[Climate change]] and [[global warming]] became household words in the 2000s. Predictions tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored organizations such as the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] gained influence, and studies such as the [[Stern Review|Stern report]] influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of countering climate change. The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) announced that the 2000s may have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 have occurred in this decade. The WMO's findings were later echoed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]].\n\nUsage of [[computer-generated imagery]] became more widespread in films during the 2000s. December 2009's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' became the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] for nearly a decade, before being overtaken by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' in 2019. Documentary and [[mockumentary]] films, such as ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' and ''[[Super Size Me]]'', were popular in the 2000s. 2004's ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' by [[Michael Moore]] is the highest grossing documentary of all time. Online films became popular, and conversion to [[digital cinema]] started.

As a result of this growth, many of these developing countries accumulated [[capital (economics)|capital]] and started investing abroad. Other countries, including the [[United Arab Emirates]], Australia, Brazil and Russia, benefited from increased demand for their mineral and energy resources that global growth generated. The hollowing out of manufacturing was felt in Japan and parts of the United States and Europe which had not been able to develop successful innovative industries. Opponents point out that the practice of offshore outsourcing by countries with higher wages leads to the reduction of their own domestic employment and domestic investment. As a result, many customer service jobs as well as jobs in the information technology sectors ([[data processing]], [[computer programming]], and [[technical support]]) in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have been or are potentially affected.\n\nWhile [[global trade]] rose in the decade (partially driven by China's entry into the [[WTO]] in 2001), there was little progress in the multilateral trading system. [[International trade]] continued to expand during the decade as emerging economies and developing countries, in particular China and South-Asian countries, benefited low wages costs and most often undervalued currencies.

Partially 3D and fully 2D games were still common in the industry early in the decade, but these have now become rare as developers look almost exclusively for fully 3D games to satisfy the increasing demand for them in the market. An exception to this trend is the indie gaming community, which often produces games featuring 'old-school' or retro gaming elements, such as [[Minecraft]] and [[Shadow Complex]]. These games, which are not developed by the industry giants, are often available in the form of downloadable content from services such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox Live]] or Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and usually cost much less than more major releases.\n\n''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' was released in Japan and later the United States, where it became immensely popular among teenagers.

Unlike the 201st decade (2001-2010), the term \"2000s (decade)\" is immune from the no year zero argument of its title in general (2000 was not part of the 1990s nor was 2010 included in the 2000s, but in the proceeding decade, the 2010s).

Thank You. -->  \n\nThe early part of the decade saw the long-time predicted breakthrough of economic giant [[Economy of China|China]], which had double-digit growth during nearly the whole decade. To a lesser extent, India also benefited from an economic boom, which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force. The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the [[subprime mortgage crisis|crisis in housing and credit]] in the United States in late 2007 and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions. The outbreak of this [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|global financial crisis]] sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world.\n\nThe growth of the [[Internet]] contributed to [[globalization]] during the decade, which allowed faster communication among people around the world;<ref>Ludden D (1998).

The first social networking sites were [[Friendster]], [[Myspace]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, respectively. Myspace was the most popular social networking website until June 2009 when Facebook overtook Myspace in the number of American users. The E-mail continued to be popular throughout the decade and began to replace \"[[snail mail]]\" as the primary way of sending letters and other messages to people in far away locations, though it has been available since 1971.\n\nThe [[War on Terror]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] began after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. The [[International Criminal Court]] was formed in 2002. A United States-led coalition invaded [[Iraq]], and the [[Iraq War]] led to the end of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s rule as Iraqi President and the [[Ba'ath Party]] in Iraq. [[Al-Qaeda]] and affiliated [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. The [[Second Congo War]], the deadliest conflict since World War II, ended in July 2003. Further wars that ended included the [[Algerian Civil War]], the [[Angolan Civil War]], the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]], the [[Second Liberian Civil War]], the [[Nepalese Civil War]], and the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. Wars that began included the [[conflict in the Niger Delta]], the [[Houthi insurgency in Yemen]], and the [[Mexican Drug War]].\n\n[[Climate change]] and [[global warming]] became household words in the 2000s. Predictions tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored organizations such as the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] gained influence, and studies such as the [[Stern Review|Stern report]] influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of countering climate change. The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) announced that the 2000s may have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 have occurred in this decade. The WMO's findings were later echoed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]].\n\nUsage of [[computer-generated imagery]] became more widespread in films during the 2000s. December 2009's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' became the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] for nearly a decade, before being overtaken by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' in 2019. Documentary and [[mockumentary]] films, such as ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' and ''[[Super Size Me]]'', were popular in the 2000s. 2004's ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' by [[Michael Moore]] is the highest grossing documentary of all time. Online films became popular, and conversion to [[digital cinema]] started.  Video game consoles released in this decade included the [[PlayStation 2]], the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], the [[GameCube]], the [[Wii]], the [[PlayStation 3]] and the [[Xbox 360]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n=={{Anchor|name}}Name for the decade==\n{{See also|Aughts}}\nIn the English-speaking world, a name for the decade was never universally accepted in the same manner as for decades, such as the '80s and the '90s.<ref name=\"news.yahoo.com\">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews_deca/ynews_deca_ts1010|first=Leah|last=Hitchings|title=Even with 10 years to decide, still no name for the decade|publisher=News.yahoo.com|date=December 8, 2000|accessdate=February 13, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117172425/https://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews_deca/ynews_deca_ts1010|archivedate=January 17, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Week-name\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theweek.com/article/index/103534/Why_cant_we_name_this_decade|title=Why can't we name this decade?|publisher=Theweek.com|date=November 30, 2009|accessdate=February 13, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215042846/http://theweek.com/article/index/103534/Why_cant_we_name_this_decade|archivedate=December 15, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC-name\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8436194.stm|work=BBC News| title=Decade dilemma|date=December 31, 2009|accessdate=April 21, 2010| first=Finlo| last=Rohrer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214202127/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8436194.stm|archivedate=December 14, 2013}}</ref> Orthographically, the decade can be written as the \"2000s\" or the {{\" '}}00s\".

An enormous loss of life and property value came in 2005 when [[Hurricane Katrina]] flooded nearly the entire city of [[New Orleans]]. The resulting political fallout was severely damaging to the [[George W. Bush]] administration because of its perceived failure to act promptly and effectively.

The 6th gen remained popular throughout the decade, but decreased somewhat in popularity after its 7th gen successors released technically starting in November 2005 with the release of Microsoft's Xbox 360, however, most people agree that 2006 is a 6th gen year since most games being released still released on 6th gen including the Xbox even though the 360 was already released, and the PlayStation 3 and the Wii didn't release until late 2006 which most people consider to be the true start of the 7th gen. It reached [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|7th Generation]] in the form of [[video game console|consoles]] like the [[Wii]], the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] by the mid-2000s. The number-one-selling game console of the decade, the [[PlayStation 2]], was released in 2000 and remained popular up to the end of the decade, even after the [[PlayStation 3]] was released. The [[PlayStation 2]] was discontinued in January 2013. [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]], originating in the mid-to-late 1990s, become a popular PC trend and virtual online worlds become a reality as games such as ''[[RuneScape]]'' (2001), ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' (2002), ''[[Eve Online]]'' (2003), ''[[Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided]]'' (2003), ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' (2004), and ''[[Everquest II]]'' (2004), ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'' (2007) and ''[[Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning]]'' (2008) are released. These worlds come complete with their own economies and social organization as directed by the players as a whole. The persistent online worlds allow the games to remain popular for many years. ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', premiered in 2004, remains one of the most popular games in PC gaming and is still being developed into the 2010s.\n\nThe ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series sparked a fad of Mature-rated video games based on including gang warfare, drug use, and perceived \"senseless violence\" into gameplay. Though violent video games date back to the early 1990s, they became much more common after 2000. Despite the controversy, the 2004 game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' became the best selling [[PlayStation 2]] game of all time, with 17.33 million copies sold for that console alone, from a total of 21.5 million in all formats by 2009;<ref name=\"guinness 2009\">{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_o9k7/page/108 108\u2013109]|isbn=1904994458|quote=''GTA: San Andreas'' is the best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time, with a massive 17.33 million copies sold.|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_o9k7/page/108}}</ref> as of 2011, 27.5 million copies of ''San Andreas'' were sold worldwide.<ref name=\"2011sales\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5840484/gta-iv-overtakes-san-andreas-in-lifetime-sales|title=GTA IV Overtakes San Andreas in Lifetime Sales [Correction]|publisher=Kotaku|first=Owen|last=Good|date=September 15, 2011|accessdate=September 12, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701162931/http://kotaku.com/5840484/gta-iv-overtakes-san-andreas-in-lifetime-sales|archivedate=July 1, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Call of Duty]] series was extremely popular during the 2000s, the diverse shooter franchise released multiple games throughout the 2000s that were positively critically reviewed and commercially successful.\n\n''[[Gears of War (series)|Gears of War]]'' was a critically acclaimed and commercially successful [[third-person shooter]] franchise that released two games during the mid-late 2000s.

During the decade 3D video games become the staple of the video-game industry, with 2D games nearly fading from the market. Partially 3D and fully 2D games were still common in the industry early in the decade, but these have now become rare as developers look almost exclusively for fully 3D games to satisfy the increasing demand for them in the market. An exception to this trend is the indie gaming community, which often produces games featuring 'old-school' or retro gaming elements, such as [[Minecraft]] and [[Shadow Complex]]. These games, which are not developed by the industry giants, are often available in the form of downloadable content from services such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox Live]] or Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and usually cost much less than more major releases.\n\n''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' was released in Japan and later the United States, where it became immensely popular among teenagers. Another music game, ''[[Guitar Hero]]'', was released in North America in 2005 and [[Cultural impact of the Guitar Hero series|had a huge cultural impact]] on both the music and video games industries. It became a worldwide billion-dollar franchise within three years, spawning several sequels and leading to the creation of a competing franchise, ''Rock Band''.\n\nJapanese media giant [[Nintendo]] released 9 out of the 10 top selling games of the 2000s, further establishing the company's dominance over the market.<ref>[http://top-10er.blogspot.com/2010/03/top-10-best-selling-video-games-2000.html Blogspot.com]\n\n[[Cartoon Network]] also released its \"biggest game ever\" on January 19, 2009, known as ''[[Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall]]''.

Swiss tennis player [[Roger Federer]] won 16 [[Grand Slam title]]s to become the most titled player.\n\nThe [[2006 Italian football scandal]], also known as \"''Calciopoli''\", involved Italy's top professional football leagues, [[Serie A]] and [[Serie B]]. The scandal was uncovered in May 2006 by Italian police, implicating league champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], and other major teams including [[A.C. Milan]], [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and [[Urbs Sportiva Reggina 1914|Reggina]] when a number of telephone interceptions showed a thick network of relations between team managers and referee organisations. Juventus were the champions of Serie A at the time. The teams have been accused of rigging games by selecting favourable referees.\n\nThe [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final]] in Berlin, [[Zinedine Zidane]] widely considered by experts and fans as one of the greatest football players of all time, was sent off in the 110th minute of the game, which was to be the last match of his career. After headbutting [[Marco Materazzi]] in the chest, Zidane did not participate in the penalty shootout, which Italy won 5\u20133. It was later discovered through interviews that Materazzi had insulted Zidane's mother and sister that last moment which is what led to Zidane's heightened anger and reaction.\n\nJanuary 11, 2007 \u2013 When English footballer [[David Beckham]] joined the [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]], he was given the highest player salary in the league's history; with his playing

It was employed extensively by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], in all branches of the German military. \n\nEnigma has an electromechanical [[rotor machine|rotor mechanism]] that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet. In typical use, one person enters text on the Enigma's keyboard and another person writes down which of 26 lights above the keyboard lights up at each key press. If plain text is entered, the lit-up letters are the encoded [[ciphertext]]. Entering ciphertext transforms it back into readable plaintext. The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress. The security of the system depends on Enigma machine settings that were changed daily, based on secret key lists distributed in advance, and on other settings that change for each message. The receiving station has to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message.\n\nAs used in practice, the Enigma encryption was broken from 1932 by [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic]] attacks from the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]], which passed its techniques to their French and British allies in 1939. Subsequently, a dedicated decryption centre was established by the United Kingdom at [[Bletchley Park]] as part of the [[Ultra]] program for the rest of the war. \n\nWhile Germany introduced a series of improvements to Enigma, and these hampered decryption efforts to varying degrees, they did not ultimately prevent Britain and its allies from exploiting Enigma-encoded messages as a major source of intelligence during the war. Many commentators say the flow of [[communications intelligence]] from Ultra's decryption of Enigma, [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] and other ciphers shortened the war significantly and may even have altered its outcome.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Intelligence in Warfare|last=Keegan|first=John, Sir|publisher=Alfred A.

Japanese and Italian models were also in use. With its adoption (in slightly modified form) by the German Navy in 1926 and the German Army and Air Force soon after, the name ''Enigma'' became widely known in military circles. Pre-war German military planning emphasized fast, mobile forces and tactics, later known as [[blitzkrieg]], which depend on radio communication for command and coordination. Since adversaries would likely intercept radio signals, messages would have to be protected with secure encoding. Compact and easily portable, the Enigma machine filled that need.\n\n=== Breaking Enigma ===\n{{Main|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}\n\nAround December 1932, [[Marian Rejewski]], a Polish mathematician and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]], while working at the [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w|Polish Cipher Bureau]], used the theory of permutations and flaws in the German military message encipherment procedures to break the message keys of the plugboard Enigma machine. Rejewski achieved this result without knowledge of the wiring of the machine, so the result did not allow the Poles to decrypt actual messages. The French spy [[Hans-Thilo Schmidt]] obtained access to German cipher materials that included the daily keys used in September and October 1932. Those keys included the plugboard settings. The French passed the material to the Poles, and Rejewski used some of that material and the message traffic in September and October to solve for the unknown rotor wiring. Consequently, the Polish mathematicians were able to build their own Enigma machines, which were called [[Polish Enigma double|Enigma doubles]]. Rejewski was aided by cryptanalysts [[Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]], both of whom had been recruited with Rejewski from [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144 University]]. The Polish Cipher Bureau developed techniques to defeat the plugboard and find all components of the daily key, which enabled the Cipher Bureau to read the German Enigma messages starting from January 1933. Over time, the German cryptographic procedures improved, and the Cipher Bureau developed techniques and designed mechanical devices to continue reading the Enigma traffic. As part of that effort, the Poles exploited quirks of the rotors, compiled catalogues, built a [[cyclometer]] to help make a catalogue with 100,000 entries, made [[Zygalski sheets]] and built the electro-mechanical [[Bomba (cryptography)|cryptologic bomb]] to search for rotor settings. In 1938, the Germans added complexity to the Enigma machines that finally became too expensive for the Poles to counter. The Poles had six ''bomby'', but when the Germans added two more rotors, ten times as many ''bomby'' were needed, and the Poles did not have the resources.{{sfn|Kozaczuk|1984|p=63}}\n\nOn 26 and 27 July 1939,<ref>Ralph Erskine: ''The Poles Reveal their Secrets&nbsp;\u2013 Alastair Dennistons's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry''.

The demonstration represented a vital basis for the later British continuation and effort.\n\nIn September 1939, British Military Mission 4, which included [[Colin Gubbins]] and [[Vera Atkins]], went to Poland to evacuate code-breakers [[Gwido Langer]], [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]] out of the country with their replica Enigma machines. The Poles were taken across the border into Atkins' native Romania, at the time a neutral country where some of them were interned. Atkins arranged for their release and onward travel to Western Europe to advise the French and British, who at the time were still unable to decrypt German messages.<ref>{{Citation |last= Stevenson |first= William |author-link= William Stevenson (Canadian writer) |title= Spymistress: The True Story of the Greatest Female Secret Agent of World War II |publisher= Arcade Publishing |isbn= 978-1611452310 }}</ref>\n\n[[Gordon Welchman]], who became head of [[Hut 6]] at Bletchley Park, has written: \"Hut 6 [[Ultra]] would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.\"{{sfn|Welchman|1982|p=289}} \n\nDuring the war, British cryptologists decrypted a vast number of messages enciphered on Enigma.

The mechanical subsystem consists of a [[alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]]; a set of rotating disks called ''rotors'' arranged adjacently along a [[axle|spindle]]; one of various stepping components to turn at least one rotor with each key press, and a series of lamps, one for each letter.\n\n=== Electrical pathway ===\n[[File:Enigma wiring kleur.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Enigma wiring diagram with arrows and the numbers 1 to 9 showing how current flows from key depression to a lamp being lit. The ''A'' key is encoded to the ''D'' lamp. D yields A, but A never yields A; this property was due to a patented feature unique to the Enigmas, and could be exploited by cryptanalysts in some situations.]]\nThe mechanical parts act by forming a varying [[electrical network|electrical circuit]]. When a key is pressed, one or more rotors rotate on the spindle. On the sides of the rotors are a series of electrical contacts that, after rotation, line up with contacts on the other rotors or fixed wiring on either end of the spindle. When the rotors are properly aligned, each key on the keyboard is connected to a unique electrical pathway through the series of contacts and internal wiring. Current, typically from a battery, flows through the pressed key, into the newly configured set of circuits and back out again, ultimately lighting one display [[Electric light|lamp]], which shows the output letter. For example, when encrypting a message starting ''ANX...'', the operator would first press the ''A'' key, and the ''Z'' lamp might light, so ''Z'' would be the first letter of the [[ciphertext]]. The operator would next press ''N'', and then ''X'' in the same fashion, and so on.\n\n[[File:Enigma-action.svg|thumb|upright|The scrambling action of Enigma's rotors is shown for two consecutive letters with the right-hand rotor moving one position between them.]]\nCurrent flowed from the battery (1) through a depressed bi-directional keyboard switch (2) to the plugboard (3). Next, it passed through the (unused in this instance, so shown closed) plug \"A\" (3) via the entry wheel (4), through the wiring of the three (Wehrmacht Enigma) or four (''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' M4 and ''Abwehr'' variants) installed rotors (5), and entered the reflector (6). The reflector returned the current, via an entirely different path, back through the rotors (5) and entry wheel (4), proceeding through plug \"S\" (7) connected with a cable (8) to plug \"D\", and another bi-directional switch (9) to light the appropriate lamp.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\">Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmatech.htm Technical details of the Enigma machine] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\nThe repeated changes of electrical path through an Enigma scrambler implemented a [[polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]] that provided Enigma's security. The diagram on the right shows how the electrical pathway changed with each key depression, which caused rotation of at least the right-hand rotor. Current passed into the set of rotors, into and back out of the reflector, and out through the rotors again. The greyed-out lines are other possible paths within each rotor; these are hard-wired from one side of each rotor to the other. The letter ''A'' encrypts differently with consecutive key presses, first to ''G'', and then to ''C''. This is because the right-hand rotor has stepped, sending the signal on a completely different route. Eventually other rotors step with a key press.\n\n=== Rotors ===\n[[File:Enigma rotors with alphabet rings.jpg|thumb|Enigma rotor assembly. In the Wehrmacht Enigma, the three installed movable rotors are sandwiched between two fixed wheels: the entry wheel, on the right, and the reflector on the left.]]\n{{Main|Enigma rotor details}}\nThe rotors (alternatively ''wheels'' or ''drums'', ''Walzen'' in German) formed the heart of an Enigma machine. Each rotor was a disc approximately {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter made from [[Ebonite]] or [[Bakelite]] with 26 [[brass]], spring-loaded, [[electrical contact]] pins arranged in a circle on one face; the other side housing the corresponding number of circular plates [[electrical contacts]]. The pins and contacts represent the [[alphabet]]&nbsp;\u2014 typically the 26 letters A\u2013Z, as will be assumed for the rest of this description. When the rotors were mounted side-by-side on the spindle, the pins of one rotor rested against the plate contacts of the neighbouring rotor, forming an electrical connection. Inside the body of the rotor, 26 wires connected each pin on one side to a contact on the other in a complex pattern. Most of the rotors were identified by Roman numerals, and each issued copy of rotor I was wired identically to all others. The same was true for the special thin beta and gamma rotors used in the M4 naval variant.\n\n[[File:enigma-rotors.jpg|thumb|left|Three Enigma rotors and the shaft, on which they are placed when in use.]]\nBy itself, a rotor performs only a very simple type of [[encryption]], a simple [[substitution cipher]]. For example, the pin corresponding to the letter ''E'' might be wired to the contact for letter ''T'' on the opposite face, and so on. Enigma's security came from using several rotors in series (usually three or four) and the regular stepping movement of the rotors, thus implementing a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.\n\nWhen placed in an Enigma, each rotor can be set to one of 26 possible positions. When inserted, it can be turned by hand using the grooved finger-wheel, which protrudes from the internal Enigma cover when closed. So that the operator can know the rotor's position, each had an ''alphabet tyre'' (or letter ring) attached to the outside of the rotor disc, with 26 characters (typically letters); one of these could be seen through the window, thus indicating the rotational position of the rotor. In early models, the alphabet ring was fixed to the rotor disc. A later improvement was the ability to adjust the alphabet ring relative to the rotor disc. The position of the ring was known as the ''Ringstellung'' (\"ring setting\"), and was a part of the initial setting prior to an operating session. In modern terms it was a part of the [[initialization vector]].\n\n[[File:Enigma rotors and spindle showing contacts rachet and notch.jpg|thumb|left|Two Enigma rotors showing electrical contacts, stepping ratchet (on the left) and notch (on the right-hand rotor opposite '''D''').]]\nEach rotor contained one or more notches that controlled rotor stepping. In the military variants, the notches are located on the alphabet ring.\n\nThe Army and Air Force Enigmas were used with several rotors, initially three. On 15 December 1938, this changed to five, from which three were chosen for a given session. Rotors were marked with [[Roman numerals]] to distinguish them: I, II, III, IV and V, all with single notches located at different points on the alphabet ring. This variation was probably intended as a security measure, but ultimately allowed the Polish [[Clock (cryptography)|Clock Method]] and British [[Banburismus]] attacks.\n\nThe Naval version of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' Enigma had always been issued with more rotors than the other services: At first six, then seven, and finally eight. The additional rotors were marked VI, VII and VIII, all with different wiring, and had two notches, resulting in more frequent turnover. The four-rotor Naval Enigma (M4) machine accommodated an extra rotor in the same space as the three-rotor version. This was accomplished by replacing the original reflector with a thinner one and by adding a thin fourth rotor. That fourth rotor was one of two types, ''Beta'' or ''Gamma'', and never stepped, but could be manually set to any of 26 positions. One of the 26 made the machine perform identically to the three-rotor machine.\n\n=== Stepping ===\nTo avoid merely implementing a simple (solvable) substitution cipher, every key press caused one or more rotors to step by one twenty-sixth of a full rotation, before the electrical connections were made. This changed the substitution alphabet used for encryption, ensuring that the cryptographic substitution was different at each new rotor position, producing a more formidable polyalphabetic substitution cipher. The stepping mechanism varied slightly from model to model. The right-hand rotor stepped once with each keystroke, and other rotors stepped less frequently.\n\n=== Turnover ===\n[[File:Enigma ratchet.png|thumb|The Enigma stepping motion seen from the side away from the operator. All three ratchet pawls (green) push in unison as a key is depressed. For the first rotor (1), which to the operator is the right-hand rotor, the ratchet (red) is always engaged, and steps with each keypress. Here, the middle rotor (2) is engaged, because the notch in the first rotor is aligned with the pawl; it will step (''turn over'') with the first rotor. The third rotor (3) is not engaged, because the notch in the second rotor is not aligned to the pawl, so it will not engage with the rachet.]]\nThe advancement of a rotor other than the left-hand one was called a ''turnover'' by the British. This was achieved by a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet and pawl]] mechanism. Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a ratchet. The alphabet ring of the rotor to the right normally prevented this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left. The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression.<ref name=\"doublestepping\" /> For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor. Similarly for rotors two and three. For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.\n\nThe first five rotors to be introduced (I\u2013V) contained one notch each, while the additional naval rotors VI, VII and VIII each had two notches. The position of the notch on each rotor was determined by the letter ring which could be adjusted in relation to the core containing the interconnections. The points on the rings at which they caused the next wheel to move were as follows.<ref>{{cite web| last=Sale|first=Tony|authorlink=Tony Sale|title=Technical specifications of the Enigma rotors| work=Technical Specification of the Enigma|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/rotorspec.htm|access-date=15 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+Position of turnover notches\n|-\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| Rotor\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| Turnover position(s)\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| BP mnemonic\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |I|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|R|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Royal\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |II|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|F|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Flags\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |III|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|W|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Wave\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |IV|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|K|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Kings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |V|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|A|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Above\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|VI, VII and VIII|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|A and N|||\n|}\n\nThe design also included a feature known as ''double-stepping''. This occurred when each pawl aligned with both the ratchet of its rotor and the rotating notched ring of the neighbouring rotor. If a pawl engaged with a ratchet through alignment with a notch, as it moved forward it pushed against both the ratchet and the notch, advancing both rotors. In a three-rotor machine, double-stepping affected rotor two only. If in moving forward the ratchet of rotor three was engaged, rotor two would move again on the subsequent keystroke, resulting in two consecutive steps. Rotor two also pushes rotor one forward after 26 steps, but since rotor one moves forward with every keystroke anyway, there is no double-stepping.<ref name=\"doublestepping\">{{cite journal |first=David |last=Hamer |title=Enigma: Actions Involved in the 'Double-Stepping' of the Middle Rotor |journal=Cryptologia |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=January 1997 |pages=47\u201350 |url=http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer/downloads/rotorpdf.zip |archivedate=19 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081659/http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer/downloads/rotorpdf.zip |format=zip |doi=10.1080/0161-119791885779}}</ref> This double-stepping caused the rotors to deviate from [[odometer]]-style regular motion.\n\n<!-- {|\n|-\n| ADM\n|-\n| ADN\n|-\n| ADO\n|-\n| ADP\n|-\n| ADQ\n|-\n| AER\n|-\n| AFS\n|-\n| AFT\n|-\n| AFU\n|} -->\nWith three wheels and only single notches in the first and second wheels, the machine had a period of 26\u00d725\u00d726&nbsp;= 16,900 (not 26\u00d726\u00d726, because of double-stepping).<ref name=\"doublestepping\" /> Historically, messages were limited to a few hundred letters, and so there was no chance of repeating any combined rotor position during a single session, denying cryptanalysts valuable clues.\n\nTo make room for the Naval fourth rotors, the reflector was made much thinner. The fourth rotor fitted into the space made available. No other changes were made, which eased the changeover. Since there were only three pawls, the fourth rotor never stepped, but could be manually set into one of 26 possible positions.\n\nA device that was designed, but not implemented before the war's end, was the ''L\u00fcckenf\u00fcllerwalze'' (gap-fill wheel) that implemented irregular stepping. It allowed field configuration of notches in all 26 positions. If the number of notches was a [[Coprime integers|relative prime]] of 26 and the number of notches were different for each wheel, the stepping would be more unpredictable. Like the Umkehrwalze-D it also allowed the internal wiring to be reconfigured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/lf/index.htm |title=L\u00fcckenf\u00fcllerwalze |publisher=Cryptomuseum.com |date= |access-date=17 July 2012}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n=== Entry wheel ===\nThe current entry wheel (''Eintrittswalze'' in German), or entry [[stator]], connects the [[plugboard]] to the rotor assembly. If the plugboard is not present, the entry wheel instead connects the keyboard and lampboard to the rotor assembly. While the exact wiring used is of comparatively little importance to security, it proved an obstacle to Rejewski's progress during his study of the rotor wirings. The commercial Enigma connects the keys in the order of their sequence on a [[QWERTZ]] keyboard: ''Q''&rarr;''A'', ''W''&rarr;''B'', ''E''&rarr;''C'' and so on. The military Enigma connects them in straight alphabetical order: ''A''&rarr;''A'', ''B''&rarr;''B'', ''C''&rarr;''C'', and so on. It took inspired guesswork for Rejewski to penetrate the modification.\n\n=== Reflector ===\n[[File:Enigma insides.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Internal mechanism of an Enigma machine showing the type B reflector and rotor stack.]]\nWith the exception of models ''A'' and ''B'', the last rotor came before a 'reflector' (German: ''Umkehrwalze'', meaning 'reversal rotor'), a patented feature unique to Enigma among the period's various rotor machines. The reflector connected outputs of the last rotor in pairs, redirecting current back through the rotors by a different route. The reflector ensured that Enigma would be [[Involution (mathematics)|self-reciprocal]]; thus, with two identically configured machines, a message could be encrypted on one and decrypted on the other, without the need for a bulky mechanism to switch between encryption and decryption modes. The reflector allowed a more compact design, but it also gave Enigma the property that no letter ever encrypted to itself. This was a severe cryptological flaw that was subsequently exploited by codebreakers.\n\nIn Model 'C', the reflector could be inserted in one of two different positions. In Model 'D', the reflector could be set in 26 possible positions, although it did not move during encryption. In the ''Abwehr'' Enigma, the reflector stepped during encryption in a manner similar to the other wheels.\n\nIn the German Army and Air Force Enigma, the reflector was fixed and did not rotate; there were four versions. The original version was marked 'A', and was replaced by ''Umkehrwalze B'' on 1 November 1937. A third version, ''Umkehrwalze C'' was used briefly in 1940, possibly by mistake, and was solved by [[Hut 6]].<ref name=\"ukwd-1\">Philip Marks, \"Umkehrwalze D: Enigma's Rewirable Reflector&nbsp;\u2014 Part I\", Cryptologia 25(2), April 2001, pp. 101\u2013141</ref> The fourth version, first observed on 2 January 1944, had a rewireable reflector, called ''Umkehrwalze D'', nick-named Uncle Dick by the British, allowing the Enigma operator to alter the connections as part of the key settings.{{Clear}}\n\n=== Plugboard ===\n[[File:Enigma-plugboard.jpg|right|thumb|The plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') was positioned at the front of the machine, below the keys. When in use during World War II, there were ten connections. In this photograph, just two pairs of letters have been swapped (A\u2194J and S\u2194O).]]\nThe plugboard (''Steckerbrett'' in German) permitted variable wiring that could be reconfigured by the operator (visible on the front panel of Figure 1; some of the patch cords can be seen in the lid). It was introduced on German Army versions in 1930, and was soon adopted by the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (German Navy). The plugboard contributed more cryptographic strength than an extra rotor. Enigma without a plugboard (known as ''unsteckered Enigma'') can be solved relatively straightforwardly using hand methods; these techniques are generally defeated by the plugboard, driving Allied cryptanalysts to develop special machines to solve it.\n\nA cable placed onto the plugboard connected letters in pairs; for example, ''E'' and ''Q'' might be a steckered pair. The effect was to swap those letters before and after the main rotor scrambling unit. For example, when an operator presses ''E'', the signal was diverted to ''Q'' before entering the rotors. Up to 13 steckered pairs might be used at one time, although only 10 were normally used.\n\nCurrent flowed from the keyboard through the plugboard, and proceeded to the entry-rotor or ''Eintrittswalze''. Each letter on the plugboard had two jacks. Inserting a plug disconnected the upper jack (from the keyboard) and the lower jack (to the entry-rotor) of that letter. The plug at the other end of the crosswired cable was inserted into another letter's jacks, thus switching the connections of the two letters.\n\n=== Accessories ===\n[[File:Enigma-printer-2.jpg|thumb|The ''Schreibmax'' was a printing unit which could be attached to the Enigma, removing the need for laboriously writing down the letters indicated on the light panel.]]\nOther features made various Enigma machines more secure or more convenient.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reuvers |first=Paul |title=Enigma accessories |year=2008 |url=http://www.jproc.ca/crypto/enigma_acc.html |access-date=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Schreibmax'' ====\nSome M4 Enigmas used the ''Schreibmax'', a small [[Printer (computing)|printer]] that could print the 26 letters on a narrow paper ribbon. This eliminated the need for a second operator to read the lamps and transcribe the letters. The ''Schreibmax'' was placed on top of the Enigma machine and was connected to the lamp panel. To install the printer, the lamp cover and light bulbs had to be removed. It improved both convenience and operational security; the printer could be installed remotely such that the signal officer operating the machine no longer had to see the decrypted [[plaintext]].\n\n==== ''Fernleseger\u00e4t'' ====\nAnother accessory was the remote lamp panel ''Fernleseger\u00e4t''. For machines equipped with the extra panel, the wooden case of the Enigma was wider and could store the extra panel. A lamp panel version could be connected afterwards, but that required, as with the ''Schreibmax'', that the lamp panel and light bulbs be removed.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\" /> The remote panel made it possible for a person to read the decrypted plaintext without the operator seeing it.\n\n==== ''Uhr'' ====\n[[File:Enigma-uhr-box.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Enigma Uhr attachment]]\nIn 1944, the ''Luftwaffe'' introduced a plugboard switch, called the ''Uhr'' (clock), a small box containing a switch with 40 positions. It replaced the standard plugs. After connecting the plugs, as determined in the daily key sheet, the operator turned the switch into one of the 40 positions, each producing a different combination of plug wiring. Most of these plug connections were, unlike the default plugs, not pair-wise.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\" /> In one switch position, the ''Uhr'' did not swap letters, but simply emulated the 13 stecker wires with plugs.\n\n=== Mathematical analysis ===\nThe Enigma transformation for each letter can be specified mathematically as a product of [[permutation]]s.{{sfn|Rejewski|1980}} Assuming a three-rotor German Army/Air Force Enigma, let {{mvar|P}} denote the plugboard transformation, {{mvar|U}} denote that of the reflector, and {{mvar|L}}, {{mvar|M}}, {{mvar|R}} denote those of the left, middle and right rotors respectively. Then the encryption {{mvar|E}} can be expressed as\n\n:<math>E=PRMLUL^{-1}M^{-1}R^{-1}P^{-1}.</math>\n\nAfter each key press, the rotors turn, changing the transformation. For example, if the right-hand rotor {{mvar|R}} is rotated {{mvar|n}} positions, the transformation becomes\n\n:<math>\\rho^nR\\rho^{-n},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the [[cyclic permutation]] mapping A to B, B to C, and so forth. Similarly, the middle and left-hand rotors can be represented as {{mvar|j}} and {{mvar|k}} rotations of {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|L}}. The encryption transformation can then be described as\n\n:<math>E=P\\left(\\rho^n R\\rho^{-n}\\right)\\left(\\rho^j M\\rho^{-j}\\right)\\left(\\rho^{k}L\\rho^{-k}\\right)U\\left(\\rho^kL^{-1}\\rho^{-k}\\right)\\left(\\rho^j M^{-1}\\rho^{-j}\\right)\\left(\\rho^n R^{-1}\\rho^{-n}\\right)P^{-1}.</math>\n\nCombining three rotors from a set of five, each of the 3 rotor settings with 26 positions, and the plugboard with ten pairs of letters connected, the military Enigma has 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 different settings (nearly 159 [[Names of large numbers|quintillion]] or about 67 [[bit]]s).<ref>{{YouTube | id=G2_Q9FoD-oQ | title=158,962,555,217,826,360,000&nbsp;\u2014 Numberphile}}</ref>\n\nNote that (5x4x3) x (26^3) x [26! / (6! x 10! x 2^10)] = 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 \u2248 2<sup>67.1</sup>\n\n== Operation ==\n=== Basic operation ===\n[[File:Encrypting and decrypting using an enigma machine.webm|thumb|Enciphering and deciphering using an Enigma machine]]\nA German Enigma operator would be given a plaintext message to encrypt. After setting up his machine, he would type the message on the Enigma keyboard. For each letter pressed, one lamp lit indicating a different letter according to a [[Pseudorandomness|pseudo-random]] substitution determined by the electrical pathways inside the machine. The letter indicated by the lamp would be recorded, typically by a second operator, as the [[cyphertext]] letter. The action of pressing a key also moved one or more rotors so that the next key press used a different electrical pathway, and thus a different substitution would occur even if the same plaintext letter were entered again. For each key press there was rotation of at least the right hand rotor and less often the other two, resulting in a different [[Pseudorandomness|substitution alphabet]] being used for every letter in the message. This process continued until the message was completed. The cyphertext recorded by the second operator would then be transmitted, usually by radio in [[Morse code]], to an operator of another Enigma machine. This operator would type in the cyphertext and&nbsp;\u2014 as long as all the settings of the deciphering machine were identical to those of the enciphering machine&nbsp;\u2014 for every key press the reverse substitution would occur and the plaintext message would emerge.\n\n=== Details ===\n[[File:Kenngruppenheft.jpg|thumb|German Kenngruppenheft (a U-boat [[codebook]] with grouped key codes).]]\n[[File:Enigma keylist 3 rotor.jpg|thumb|Monthly key list number 649 for the German Air Force Enigma, including settings for the reconfigurable reflector (which only change once every eight days).]]\nIn use, the Enigma required a list of daily key settings and auxiliary documents. In German military practice, communications were divided into separate networks, each using different settings. These communication nets were termed ''keys'' at [[Bletchley Park]], and were assigned [[code name]]s, such as ''Red'', ''Chaffinch'', and ''Shark''. Each unit operating in a network was given the same settings list for its Enigma, valid for a period of time. The procedures for German Naval Enigma were more elaborate and more secure than those in other services and employed auxiliary [[codebook]]s. Navy codebooks were printed in red, water-soluble ink on pink paper so that they could easily be destroyed if they were endangered or if the vessel was sunk.\n\nAn Enigma machine's setting (its [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] in modern terms; ''Schl\u00fcssel'' in German) specified each operator-adjustable aspect of the machine:\n* Wheel order (''Walzenlage'') \u2013 the choice of rotors and the order in which they are fitted.\n* Ring settings (''Ringstellung'') \u2013 the position of each alphabet ring relative to its rotor wiring.\n* Plug connections (''Steckerverbindungen'') \u2013 the pairs of letters in the plugboard that are connected together.\n* In very late versions, the wiring of the reconfigurable reflector.\n* Starting position of the rotors (''Grundstellung'') \u2013 chosen by the operator, should be different for each message.\n\nFor a message to be correctly encrypted and decrypted, both sender and receiver had to configure their Enigma in the same way; rotor selection and order, ring positions, plugboard connections and starting rotor positions must be identical. Except for the starting positions, these settings were established beforehand, distributed in key lists and changed daily. For example, the settings for the 18th day of the month in the German Luftwaffe Enigma key list number 649 (see image) were as follows:\n* Wheel order: IV, II, V\n* Ring settings: 15, 23, 26\n* Plugboard connections: EJ OY IV AQ KW FX MT PS LU BD\n* Reconfigurable reflector wiring: IU AS DV GL FT OX EZ CH MR KN BQ PW\n* Indicator groups: lsa zbw vcj rxn\n\nEnigma was designed to be secure even if the rotor wiring was known to an opponent, although in practice considerable effort protected the wiring configuration. If the wiring is secret, the total number of possible configurations has been calculated to be around {{val|3e114}} (approximately 380 bits); with known wiring and other operational constraints, this is reduced to around {{val|e=23}} (76 bits).<ref name=\"engima_cryptographic_mathematics\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/wwii/engima_cryptographic_mathematics.pdf|title=The Cryptographic Mathematics of Enigma|last=Miller|first=A.

A different initial rotor position was used for each message, a concept similar to an [[Initialization vector|initialisation vector]] in modern cryptography. The reason is that encrypting many messages with identical or near-identical settings (termed in cryptanalysis as being ''in [[Cryptanalysis#Depth|depth]]''), would enable an attack using a statistical procedure such as [[William F. Friedman|Friedman's]] [[Index of coincidence]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman| first=W.F.|authorlink=William F.

Publ 22|publisher=Riverbank Laboratories|location=Geneva, Illinois, USA|oclc=55786052|year=1922}}</ref> The starting position for the rotors was transmitted just before the ciphertext, usually after having been enciphered. The exact method used was termed the ''indicator procedure''. Design weakness and operator sloppiness in these indicator procedures were two of the main weaknesses that made cracking Enigma possible.\n\n[[File:Enigma-rotor-windows.jpg|left|thumb|Figure 2. With the inner lid down, the Enigma was ready for use. The finger wheels of the rotors protruded through the lid, allowing the operator to set the rotors, and their current position, here ''RDKP'', was visible to the operator through a set of windows.]]\nOne of the earliest ''indicator procedures'' for the Enigma was cryptographically flawed and allowed Polish cryptanalysts to make the initial breaks into the plugboard Enigma. The procedure had the operator set his machine in accordance with the secret settings that all operators on the net shared. The settings included an initial position for the rotors (the ''Grundstellung''), say, ''AOH''. The operator turned his rotors until ''AOH'' was visible through the rotor windows. At that point, the operator chose his own arbitrary starting position for the message he would send. An operator might select ''EIN'', and that became the ''message setting'' for that encryption session. The operator then typed ''EIN'' into the machine twice, this producing the encrypted indicator, for example ''XHTLOA''. This was then transmitted, at which point the operator would turn the rotors to his message settings, ''EIN'' in this example, and then type the plaintext of the message.\n\nAt the receiving end, the operator set the machine to the initial settings (''AOH'') and typed in the first six letters of the message (''XHTLOA''). In this example, ''EINEIN'' emerged on the lamps, so the operator would learn the ''message setting'' that the sender used to encrypt this message. The receiving operator would set his rotors to ''EIN'', type in the rest of the ciphertext, and get the deciphered message.\n\nThis indicator scheme had two weaknesses. First, the use of a global initial position (''Grundstellung'') meant all message keys used the same polyalphabetic substitution. In later indicator procedures, the operator selected his initial position for encrypting the indicator and sent that initial position in the clear. The second problem was the repetition of the indicator, which was a serious security flaw. The message setting was encoded twice, resulting in a relation between first and fourth, second and fifth, and third and sixth character. These security flaws enabled the Polish Cipher Bureau to break into the pre-war Enigma system as early as 1932. The early indicator procedure was subsequently described by German cryptanalysts as the \"faulty indicator technique\".{{sfn|Huttenhain|Fricke|1945|pp=4,5}}\n\nDuring World War II, codebooks were only used each day to set up the rotors, their ring settings and the plugboard. For each message, the operator selected a random start position, let's say ''WZA'', and a random message key, perhaps ''SXT''. He moved the rotors to the ''WZA'' start position and encoded the message key ''SXT''. Assume the result was ''UHL''. He then set up the message key, ''SXT'', as the start position and encrypted the message. Next, he transmitted the start position, ''WZA'', the encoded message key, ''UHL'', and then the ciphertext. The receiver set up the start position according to the first trigram, ''WZA'', and decoded the second trigram, ''UHL'', to obtain the ''SXT'' message setting. Next, he used this ''SXT'' message setting as the start position to decrypt the message. This way, each ground setting was different and the new procedure avoided the security flaw of double encoded message settings.<ref>Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmaproc.htm Enigma message procedures] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\nThis procedure was used by ''Wehrmacht'' and ''Luftwaffe'' only. The ''Kriegsmarine'' procedures on sending messages with the Enigma were far more complex and elaborate. Prior to encryption the message was encoded using the ''[[Kurzsignale|Kurzsignalheft]]'' code book. The ''Kurzsignalheft'' contained tables to convert sentences into four-letter groups. A great many choices were included, for example, logistic matters such as refuelling and rendezvous with supply ships, positions and grid lists, harbour names, countries, weapons, weather conditions, enemy positions and ships, date and time tables. Another codebook contained the ''[[Discriminant Book|Kenngruppen]]'' and ''Spruchschl\u00fcssel'': the key identification and message key.<ref>Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/kurzsignale.htm Kurzsignalen on German U-boats] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\n=== Additional details ===\nThe Army Enigma machine used only the 26 alphabet characters. Punctuation was replaced with rare character combinations. A space was omitted or replaced with an X. The X was generally used as full-stop.\n\nSome punctuation marks were different in other parts of the armed forces. The ''Wehrmacht'' replaced a comma with ZZ and the question mark with FRAGE or FRAQ.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' replaced the comma with Y and the question mark with UD. The combination CH, as in \"''Acht''\" (eight) or \"''Richtung''\" (direction), was replaced with Q (AQT, RIQTUNG). Two, three and four zeros were replaced with CENTA, MILLE and MYRIA.\n\nThe ''Wehrmacht'' and the ''Luftwaffe'' transmitted messages in groups of five characters.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'', using the four rotor Enigma, had four-character groups. Frequently used names or words were varied as much as possible. Words like ''Minensuchboot'' (minesweeper) could be written as MINENSUCHBOOT, MINBOOT, MMMBOOT or MMM354. To make cryptanalysis harder, messages were limited to 250 characters. Longer messages were divided into several parts, each using a different message key.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/egenproc/eniggnix.htm|title=The translated 1940 ''Enigma General Procedure''|publisher=codesandciphers.org.uk|access-date=16 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/officer/officerx.htm|title=The translated 1940 ''Enigma Officer and Staff Procedure''|publisher=codesandciphers.org.uk|access-date=16 October 2006}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n=== Example encoding process ===\nThe character substitutions by the Enigma machine as a whole can be expressed as a string of letters with each position occupied by the character that will replace the character at the corresponding position in the alphabet. For example, a given machine configuration that encoded A to L, B to U, C to S, ..., and Z to J could be represented compactly as\n\n LUSHQOXDMZNAIKFREPCYBWVGTJ\n\nand the encoding of a particular character by that configuration could be represented by highlighting the encoded character as in\n\n D > LUS(H)QOXDMZNAIKFREPCYBWVGTJ\n\nSince the operation of an Enigma machine encoding a message is a series of such configurations, each associated with a single character being encoded, a sequence of such representations can be used to represent the operation of the machine as it encodes a message.

For example, the 4th step in the encoding above can be expanded to show each of these stages using the same representation of mappings and highlighting for the encoded character:\n \n <nowiki>G > ABCDEF(G)HIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n&nbsp;  P EFMQAB(G)UINKXCJORDPZTHWVLYS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AE.BF.CM.DQ.HU.JN.LX.PR.SZ.VW\n&nbsp;  1 OFRJVM(A)ZHQNBXPYKCULGSWETDI&nbsp; N&nbsp; 03&nbsp; VIII\n&nbsp;  2 (N)UKCHVSMDGTZQFYEWPIALOXRJB&nbsp; U&nbsp; 17&nbsp; VI\n&nbsp;  3 XJMIYVCARQOWH(L)NDSUFKGBEPZT&nbsp; D&nbsp; 15&nbsp; V\n&nbsp;  4 QUNGALXEPKZ(Y)RDSOFTVCMBIHWJ&nbsp; C&nbsp; 25&nbsp; \u03b2\n&nbsp;  R RDOBJNTKVEHMLFCWZAXGYIPS(U)Q &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c\n&nbsp;  4 EVTNHQDXWZJFUCPIAMOR(B)SYGLK &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u03b2\n&nbsp;  3 H(V)GPWSUMDBTNCOKXJIQZRFLAEY &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; V\n&nbsp;  2 TZDIPNJESYCUHAVRMXGKB(F)QWOL &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VI\n&nbsp;  1 GLQYW(B)TIZDPSFKANJCUXREVMOH &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VIII\n&nbsp;  P E(F)MQABGUINKXCJORDPZTHWVLYS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AE.BF.CM.DQ.HU.JN.LX.PR.SZ.VW\n F < KPTXIG(F)MESAUHYQBOVJCLRZDNW</nowiki>\n\nHere the encoding begins trivially with the first \"mapping\" representing the keyboard (which has no effect), followed by the plugboard, configured as AE.BF.CM.DQ.HU.JN.LX.PR.SZ.VW which has no effect on 'G', followed by the VIII rotor in the 03 position, which maps G to A, then the VI rotor in the 17 position, which maps A to N, ..., and finally the plugboard again, which maps B to F, producing the overall mapping indicated at the final step: G to F.\n\n== Models ==\nThe Enigma family included multiple designs. The earliest were commercial models dating from the early 1920s. Starting in the mid-1920s, the German military began to use Enigma, making a number of security-related changes. Various nations either adopted or adapted the design for their own cipher machines.\n\n{|style=\"margin: 1em auto 0 auto;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Enigmas.jpg|upright=2.0|thumb|A selection of seven Enigma machines and paraphernalia exhibited at the U.S. [[National Cryptologic Museum]].

Richard Ritter]] founded the firm of Scherbius & Ritter. They approached the [[Reichsmarine|German Navy]] and Foreign Office with their design, but neither agency was interested. Scherbius & Ritter then assigned the patent rights to Gewerkschaft Securitas, who founded the ''Chiffriermaschinen Aktien-Gesellschaft'' (Cipher Machines Stock Corporation) on 9 July 1923; Scherbius and Ritter were on the board of directors.\n\n==== Enigma A (1923) ====\nChiffriermaschinen AG began advertising a rotor machine, ''Enigma model A'', which was exhibited at the Congress of the [[Universal Postal Union|International Postal Union]] in 1924. The machine was heavy and bulky, incorporating a [[typewriter]]. It measured 65\u00d745\u00d738&nbsp;cm and weighed about {{convert|50|kg|lb}}.\n\n==== Enigma B (1924) ====\nIn 1924 Enigma ''model B'' was introduced, and was of a similar construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyradio.com/publish/Articles/The_Enigma_Code_Breach/Pictures/enigma_type_b.jpg|title=image of Enigma Type B|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051021083422/http://www.armyradio.com/publish/Articles/The_Enigma_Code_Breach/Pictures/enigma_type_b.jpg|archivedate=21 October 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref> While bearing the Enigma name, both models ''A'' and ''B'' were quite unlike later versions: They differed in physical size and shape, but also cryptographically, in that they lacked the reflector.\n\n==== Enigma C (1926) ====\nThe reflector, suggested by Scherbius' colleague [[Willi Korn]], was introduced in ''Enigma C'' (1926).\n\n''Model C'' was smaller and more portable than its predecessors. It lacked a typewriter, relying on the operator; hence the informal name of \"glowlamp Enigma\" to distinguish it from models ''A'' and ''B''.\n\n==== Enigma D (1927) ====\nThe ''Enigma C'' quickly gave way to ''Enigma D'' (1927). This version was widely used, with shipments to Sweden, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, Spain, United States and Poland. In 1927 [[Hugh Foss]] at the British [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] was able to show that commercial Enigma machines could be broken, provided suitable cribs were available.<ref>Bletchley Park Trust Museum display</ref>\n\n===== \"Navy Cipher D\" =====\nOther countries used Enigma machines. The [[Italian Navy]] adopted the commercial Enigma as \"Navy Cipher D\". The Spanish also used commercial Enigma machines during their [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. British codebreakers succeeded in breaking these machines, which lacked a plugboard.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=23}} Enigma machines were also used by diplomatic services.\n\n==== Enigma H (1929) ====\n[[File:Enigma-8-rotor.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A rare 8-rotor printing Enigma model H (1929).]]\nThere was also a large, eight-rotor printing model, the ''Enigma H'', called ''Enigma II'' by the ''[[Reichswehr]]''. In 1933 the Polish Cipher Bureau detected that it was in use for high-level military communication, but it was soon withdrawn, as it was unreliable and jammed frequently.{{sfn|Kozaczuk|1984|p=28}}\n\n==== Enigma K ====\nThe Swiss used a version of Enigma called ''Model K'' or ''Swiss K'' for military and diplomatic use, which was very similar to commercial [[#Enigma D (1927)|Enigma D]]. The machine's code was cracked by Poland, France, the United Kingdom and the United States; the latter code-named it INDIGO. An ''Enigma T'' model, code-named ''Tirpitz'', was used by Japan.\n\n==== Typex ====\nOnce the British figured out Enigma's principle of operation, they fixed the problem with it and created their own, the [[Typex]], which the Germans believed to be unsolvable.<ref>{{YouTube | id=V4V2bpZlqx8 | title=Flaw in the Enigma Code&nbsp;\u2014 Numberphile}}</ref>\n\n=== Military Enigma ===\n==== Funkschl\u00fcssel C ====\nThe Reichsmarine was the first military branch to adopt Enigma. This version, named ''Funkschl\u00fcssel C'' (\"Radio cipher C\"), had been put into production by 1925 and was introduced into service in 1926.{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=39\u201341, 299}}\n\nThe keyboard and lampboard contained 29 letters&nbsp;\u2014 A-Z, \u00c4, \u00d6 and \u00dc&nbsp;\u2014 that were arranged alphabetically, as opposed to the QWERTZUI ordering.{{sfn|Ulbricht|2005|p=4}} The rotors had 28 contacts, with the letter ''X'' wired to bypass the rotors unencrypted.{{sfn|Stripp|1993}} Three rotors were chosen from a set of five{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=40, 299}} and the reflector could be inserted in one of four different positions, denoted \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4.{{sfn|Bauer|2000|p=108}} The machine was revised slightly in July 1933.{{sfn|Stripp|1993|loc=plate 3}}\n\n==== Enigma G (1928\u20131930) ====\nBy 15 July 1928,{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=41, 299}} the German Army (''[[Reichswehr]]'') had introduced their own exclusive version of the Enigma machine, the ''Enigma G''.\n\nThe ''[[Abwehr]]'' used the ''Enigma G'' (the ''Abwehr'' Enigma). This Enigma variant was a four-wheel unsteckered machine with multiple notches on the rotors. This model was equipped with a counter that incremented upon each key press, and so is also known as the \"counter machine\" or the ''Z\u00e4hlwerk'' Enigma.\n\n==== Wehrmacht Enigma I (1930\u20131938) ====\nEnigma machine G was modified to the ''Enigma I'' by June 1930.{{sfn|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=97}} Enigma I is also known as the ''Wehrmacht'', or \"Services\" Enigma, and was used extensively by German military services and other government organisations (such as the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn#Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (1924-1937)|railways]]{{sfn|Smith|2000|p= 73}}) before and during [[World War II]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-769-0229-10A, Frankreich, Guderian, \"Enigma\" cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heinz Guderian]] in the [[Battle of France]], with an Enigma machine. Note one soldier is keying in text while another writes down the results,]]\nThe major difference between ''Enigma I'' (German Army version from 1930), and commercial Enigma models was the addition of a plugboard to swap pairs of letters, greatly increasing cryptographic strength.\n\nOther differences included the use of a fixed reflector and the relocation of the stepping notches from the rotor body to the movable letter rings. The machine measured {{convert|28|x|34|x|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighed around {{convert|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Stripp\">Stripp, 1993</ref>\n\nIn August 1935, the Air Force introduced the Wehrmacht Enigma for their communications.{{sfn|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=97}}\n\n==== M3 (1934) ====\nBy 1930, the Reichswehr had suggested that the Navy adopt their machine, citing the benefits of increased security (with the plugboard) and easier interservice communications.{{sfn|Kahn|1991|p=43}} The Reichsmarine eventually agreed and in 1934<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=43}} says August 1934. {{harvnb|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=15}} say October 2004.</ref> brought into service the Navy version of the Army Enigma, designated ''Funkschl\u00fcssel'' ' or ''M3''.

In September, a man identifying himself as \"The Master\" sent a note demanding \u00a325,000 and threatening to destroy the machine if the ransom was not paid. In early October 2000, Bletchley Park officials announced that they would pay the ransom, but the stated deadline passed with no word from the blackmailer. Shortly afterward, the machine was sent anonymously to BBC journalist [[Jeremy Paxman]], missing three rotors.\n\nIn November 2000, an antiques dealer named Dennis Yates was arrested after telephoning ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' to arrange the return of the missing parts. The Enigma machine was returned to Bletchley Park after the incident. In October 2001, Yates was sentenced to ten months in prison and served three months.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1609168.stm|work=BBC News|title=Man jailed over Enigma machine|date=19 October 2001|access-date=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, the Spanish daily newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' reported that 28 Enigma machines had been discovered by chance in an attic of Army headquarters in Madrid.

The British [[Typex]] was originally derived from the Enigma patents; Typex even includes features from the patent descriptions that were omitted from the actual Enigma machine. The British paid no royalties for the use of the patents, to protect secrecy. The Typex implementation is not the same as that found in German or other Axis versions.\n\nA Japanese Enigma clone was codenamed GREEN by American cryptographers. Little used, it contained four rotors mounted vertically. In the United States, cryptologist [[William F. Friedman|William Friedman]] designed the [[M-325]], a machine logically similar, although not in construction.\n\nA unique rotor machine was constructed in 2002 by Netherlands-based Tatjana van Vark. This device makes use of 40-point rotors, allowing letters, numbers and some punctuation to be used; each rotor contains 509 parts.<ref>van Vark, Tatjana ''[http://www.tatjavanvark.nl/tvv1/pht10.html The coding machine]''</ref>\n\nMachines like the [[SIGABA]], [[NEMA (machine)|NEMA]], [[Typex]] and so forth, are deliberately not considered to be Enigma derivatives as their internal ciphering functions are not mathematically identical to the Enigma transform.\n\nSeveral software implementations exist, but not all exactly match Enigma behaviour. The most commonly used software derivative (that is not compliant with any hardware implementation of the Enigma) is at EnigmaCo.de. Many Java applet Enigmas only accept single letter entry, complicating use even if the applet is Enigma compliant. Technically, Enigma@home is the largest scale deployment of a software Enigma, but the decoding software does not implement encipherment making it a derivative (as all original machines could cipher and decipher).\n\nA user-friendly three-rotor simulator, where users can select rotors, use the plugboard and define new settings for the rotors and reflectors is available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://w1tp.com/enigma/enigma_w.zip|title=3 rotor download}}</ref> The output appears in separate windows which can be independently made \"invisible\" to hide decryption.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://membres.multimania.fr/pc1/enigma/ |title=Enigma at Multimania |access-date=2 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402015246/http://membres.multimania.fr/pc1/enigma/ |archive-date=2 April 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another includes an \"autotyping\" function which takes plaintext from a clipboard and converts it to cyphertext (or vice versa) at one of four speeds.

Turing was played by [[Derek Jacobi]], who also played Turing in a 1996 television adaptation of the play.\n* [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' (1995) is set against the backdrop of World War II [[Bletchley Park]] and cryptologists working to read Naval Enigma in [[Hut 8]].\n* [[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' (1999) prominently features the Enigma machine and efforts to break it, and portrays the German U-boat command under [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] using it in apparently deliberate ignorance of its penetration.\n* Enigma is featured in ''[[The Code Book]]'', a survey of the history of cryptography written by [[Simon Singh]] and published in 1999.\n* The Enigma machine is used as a key plot element in [[Century Rain]] by [[Alastair Reynolds]], set in an alternate Earth where technological research has stagnated and the Enigma is the highest level of encryption available both to civilians and military.\n\n; Films\n* ''[[Sekret Enigmy]]'' (1979; translation: ''The Enigma Secret''), is a Polish film dealing with Polish aspects of the subject.<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0079878}}</ref>\n* The plot of the film ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'' (released in 2000) revolves around an attempt by American, rather than British, forces to seize an Enigma machine from a German U-boat.\n* The 2001 war comedy film ''[[All the Queen's Men]]'' featured a fictitious British plot to capture an Engima machine by infiltrating the Enigma factory with men disguised as women.\n* Harris' book, with substantial changes in plot, was adapted as the film ''[[Enigma (2001 film)|Enigma]]'' (2001), directed by [[Michael Apted]] and starring [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Dougray Scott]]. The film was criticised for historical inaccuracies, including neglect of the role of [[Poland]]'s ''[[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w]]''. The film, like the book, makes a Pole the villain, who seeks to betray the secret of Enigma decryption.<ref>{{cite news |author=Laurence Peter|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8158782.stm |title=How Poles cracked Nazi Enigma secret |work=[[BBC News]]|date= 20 July 2009}}</ref>\n* The film ''[[The Imitation Game]]'' (2014) tells the story of [[Alan Turing]] and his attempts to crack the Enigma machine code during World War II.<ref name=ng />\n\n; Television\n* In the British television series ''[[The Bletchley Circle]]'', the [[Typex]] was used by the protagonists during the war, and in Season 2, Episode 4, they visit [[Bletchley Park]] to seek one out, in order to crack the code of the [[black market]] procurer and smuggler Marta, who used the Typex to encode her ledger.

It was employed extensively by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], in all branches of the German military. \n\nEnigma has an electromechanical [[rotor machine|rotor mechanism]] that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet. In typical use, one person enters text on the Enigma's keyboard and another person writes down which of 26 lights above the keyboard lights up at each key press. If plain text is entered, the lit-up letters are the encoded [[ciphertext]]. Entering ciphertext transforms it back into readable plaintext. The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress. The security of the system depends on Enigma machine settings that were changed daily, based on secret key lists distributed in advance, and on other settings that change for each message. The receiving station has to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message.\n\nAs used in practice, the Enigma encryption was broken from 1932 by [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic] attacks from the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]], which passed its techniques to their French and British allies in 1939. Subsequently, a dedicated decryption centre was established by the United Kingdom at [[Bletchley Park]] as part of the [[Ultra]] program for the rest of the war. \n\nWhile Germany introduced a series of improvements to Enigma, and these hampered decryption efforts to varying degrees, they did not ultimately prevent Britain and its allies from exploiting Enigma-encoded messages as a major source of intelligence during the war. Many commentators say the flow of [[communications intelligence]] from Ultra's decryption of Enigma, [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] and other ciphers shortened the war significantly and may even have altered its outcome.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Intelligence in Warfare|last=Keegan|first=John, Sir|publisher=Alfred A.

Japanese and Italian models were also in use. With its adoption (in slightly modified form) by the German Navy in 1926 and the German Army and Air Force soon after, the name ''Enigma'' became widely known in military circles. Pre-war German military planning emphasized fast, mobile forces and tactics, later known as [[blitzkrieg]], which depend on radio communication for command and coordination. Since adversaries would likely intercept radio signals, messages would have to be protected with secure encoding. Compact and easily portable, the Enigma machine filled that need.\n\n=== Breaking Enigma ===\n{{Main|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}\n\nAround December 1932, [[Marian Rejewski]], a Polish mathematician and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]], while working at the [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w|Polish Cipher Bureau]], used the theory of permutations and flaws in the German military message encipherment procedures to break the message keys of the plugboard Enigma machine. Rejewski achieved this result without knowledge of the wiring of the machine, so the result did not allow the Poles to decrypt actual messages. The French spy [[Hans-Thilo Schmidt]] obtained access to German cipher materials that included the daily keys used in September and October 1932. Those keys included the plugboard settings. The French passed the material to the Poles, and Rejewski used some of that material and the message traffic in September and October to solve for the unknown rotor wiring. Consequently, the Polish mathematicians were able to build their own Enigma machines, which were called [[Polish Enigma double|Enigma doubles]]. Rejewski was aided by cryptanalysts [[Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]], both of whom had been recruited with Rejewski from [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144 University]]. The Polish Cipher Bureau developed techniques to defeat the plugboard and find all components of the daily key, which enabled the Cipher Bureau to read the German Enigma messages starting from January 1933. Over time, the German cryptographic procedures improved, and the Cipher Bureau developed techniques and designed mechanical devices to continue reading the Enigma traffic. As part of that effort, the Poles exploited quirks of the rotors, compiled catalogues, built a [[cyclometer]] to help make a catalogue with 100,000 entries, made [[Zygalski sheets]] and built the electro-mechanical [[Bomba (cryptography)|cryptologic bomb]] to search for rotor settings. In 1938, the Germans added complexity to the Enigma machines that finally became too expensive for the Poles to counter. The Poles had six ''bomby'', but when the Germans added two more rotors, ten times as many ''bomby'' were needed, and the Poles did not have the resources.{{sfn|Kozaczuk|1984|p=63}}\n\nOn 26 and 27 July 1939,<ref>Ralph Erskine: ''The Poles Reveal their Secrets&nbsp;\u2013 Alastair Dennistons's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry''.

The demonstration represented a vital basis for the later British continuation and effort.\n\nIn September 1939, British Military Mission 4, which included [[Colin Gubbins]] and [[Vera Atkins]], went to Poland to evacuate code-breakers [[Gwido Langer]], [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]] out of the country with their replica Enigma machines. The Poles were taken across the border into Atkins' native Romania, at the time a neutral country where some of them were interned. Atkins arranged for their release and onward travel to Western Europe to advise the French and British, who at the time were still unable to decrypt German messages.<ref>{{Citation |last= Stevenson |first= William |author-link= William Stevenson (Canadian writer) |title= Spymistress: The True Story of the Greatest Female Secret Agent of World War II |publisher= Arcade Publishing |isbn= 978-1611452310 }}</ref>\n\n[[Gordon Welchman]], who became head of [[Hut 6]] at Bletchley Park, has written: \"Hut 6 [[Ultra]] would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.\"{{sfn|Welchman|1982|p=289}} \n\nDuring the war, British cryptologists decrypted a vast number of messages enciphered on Enigma. The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed \"[[Ultra]]\" by the British, was a substantial aid to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort.<ref>Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine, and the term \"Ultra\" has often been used almost synonymously with \"[[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma decrypts]]\". Ultra also encompassed decrypts of the German [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ 40 and 42 machines]] that were used by the German High Command, and decrypts of [[C-36 (cipher machine)|Hagelin ciphers]] and other Italian ciphers and codes, as well as of Japanese ciphers and codes such as [[Type B Cipher Machine|Purple]] and [[Japanese naval codes#JN-25|JN-25]].</ref>\n\nThough Enigma had some cryptographic weaknesses, in practice it was German procedural flaws, operator mistakes, failure to systematically introduce changes in encipherment procedures, and Allied capture of key tables and hardware that, during the war, enabled Allied cryptologists to succeed and \"turned the tide\" in the Allies' favour.{{sfn|Kahn|1991}}{{sfn|Stripp|1993}}\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe word ''[[:wikt:enigma|enigma]]'' is the Latin word for riddle, derived from the Ancient Greek word ''a\u00ednigma'' (\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1) used in English, but not native German.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2007-0705-502, Chiffriermaschine \"Enigma\".jpg|thumb|upright|Enigma in use, 1943]]\nLike other rotor machines, the Enigma machine is a combination of mechanical and electrical subsystems. The mechanical subsystem consists of a [[alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]]; a set of rotating disks called ''rotors'' arranged adjacently along a [[axle|spindle]]; one of various stepping components to turn at least one rotor with each key press, and a series of lamps, one for each letter.\n\n=== Electrical pathway ===\n[[File:Enigma wiring kleur.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Enigma wiring diagram with arrows and the numbers 1 to 9 showing how current flows from key depression to a lamp being lit. The ''A'' key is encoded to the ''D'' lamp. D yields A, but A never yields A; this property was due to a patented feature unique to the Enigmas, and could be exploited by cryptanalysts in some situations.]]\nThe mechanical parts act by forming a varying [[electrical network|electrical circuit]]. When a key is pressed, one or more rotors rotate on the spindle. On the sides of the rotors are a series of electrical contacts that, after rotation, line up with contacts on the other rotors or fixed wiring on either end of the spindle. When the rotors are properly aligned, each key on the keyboard is connected to a unique electrical pathway through the series of contacts and internal wiring. Current, typically from a battery, flows through the pressed key, into the newly configured set of circuits and back out again, ultimately lighting one display [[Electric light|lamp]], which shows the output letter. For example, when encrypting a message starting ''ANX...'', the operator would first press the ''A'' key, and the ''Z'' lamp might light, so ''Z'' would be the first letter of the [[ciphertext]]. The operator would next press ''N'', and then ''X'' in the same fashion, and so on.\n\n[[File:Enigma-action.svg|thumb|upright|The scrambling action of Enigma's rotors is shown for two consecutive letters with the right-hand rotor moving one position between them.]]\nCurrent flowed from the battery (1) through a depressed bi-directional keyboard switch (2) to the plugboard (3). Next, it passed through the (unused in this instance, so shown closed) plug \"A\" (3) via the entry wheel (4), through the wiring of the three (Wehrmacht Enigma) or four (''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' M4 and ''Abwehr'' variants) installed rotors (5), and entered the reflector (6). The reflector returned the current, via an entirely different path, back through the rotors (5) and entry wheel (4), proceeding through plug \"S\" (7) connected with a cable (8) to plug \"D\", and another bi-directional switch (9) to light the appropriate lamp.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\">Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmatech.htm Technical details of the Enigma machine] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\nThe repeated changes of electrical path through an Enigma scrambler implemented a [[polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]] that provided Enigma's security. The diagram on the right shows how the electrical pathway changed with each key depression, which caused rotation of at least the right-hand rotor. Current passed into the set of rotors, into and back out of the reflector, and out through the rotors again. The greyed-out lines are other possible paths within each rotor; these are hard-wired from one side of each rotor to the other. The letter ''A'' encrypts differently with consecutive key presses, first to ''G'', and then to ''C''. This is because the right-hand rotor has stepped, sending the signal on a completely different route. Eventually other rotors step with a key press.\n\n=== Rotors ===\n[[File:Enigma rotors with alphabet rings.jpg|thumb|Enigma rotor assembly. In the Wehrmacht Enigma, the three installed movable rotors are sandwiched between two fixed wheels: the entry wheel, on the right, and the reflector on the left.]]\n{{Main|Enigma rotor details}}\nThe rotors (alternatively ''wheels'' or ''drums'', ''Walzen'' in German) formed the heart of an Enigma machine. Each rotor was a disc approximately {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter made from [[Ebonite]] or [[Bakelite]] with 26 [[brass]], spring-loaded, [[electrical contact]] pins arranged in a circle on one face; the other side housing the corresponding number of circular plates [[electrical contacts]]. The pins and contacts represent the [[alphabet]]&nbsp;\u2014 typically the 26 letters A\u2013Z, as will be assumed for the rest of this description. When the rotors were mounted side-by-side on the spindle, the pins of one rotor rested against the plate contacts of the neighbouring rotor, forming an electrical connection. Inside the body of the rotor, 26 wires connected each pin on one side to a contact on the other in a complex pattern. Most of the rotors were identified by Roman numerals, and each issued copy of rotor I was wired identically to all others. The same was true for the special thin beta and gamma rotors used in the M4 naval variant.\n\n[[File:enigma-rotors.jpg|thumb|left|Three Enigma rotors and the shaft, on which they are placed when in use.]]\nBy itself, a rotor performs only a very simple type of [[encryption]], a simple [[substitution cipher]]. For example, the pin corresponding to the letter ''E'' might be wired to the contact for letter ''T'' on the opposite face, and so on. Enigma's security came from using several rotors in series (usually three or four) and the regular stepping movement of the rotors, thus implementing a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.\n\nWhen placed in an Enigma, each rotor can be set to one of 26 possible positions. When inserted, it can be turned by hand using the grooved finger-wheel, which protrudes from the internal Enigma cover when closed. So that the operator can know the rotor's position, each had an ''alphabet tyre'' (or letter ring) attached to the outside of the rotor disc, with 26 characters (typically letters); one of these could be seen through the window, thus indicating the rotational position of the rotor. In early models, the alphabet ring was fixed to the rotor disc. A later improvement was the ability to adjust the alphabet ring relative to the rotor disc. The position of the ring was known as the ''Ringstellung'' (\"ring setting\"), and was a part of the initial setting prior to an operating session. In modern terms it was a part of the [[initialization vector]].\n\n[[File:Enigma rotors and spindle showing contacts rachet and notch.jpg|thumb|left|Two Enigma rotors showing electrical contacts, stepping ratchet (on the left) and notch (on the right-hand rotor opposite '''D''').]]\nEach rotor contained one or more notches that controlled rotor stepping. In the military variants, the notches are located on the alphabet ring.\n\nThe Army and Air Force Enigmas were used with several rotors, initially three. On 15 December 1938, this changed to five, from which three were chosen for a given session. Rotors were marked with [[Roman numerals]] to distinguish them: I, II, III, IV and V, all with single notches located at different points on the alphabet ring. This variation was probably intended as a security measure, but ultimately allowed the Polish [[Clock (cryptography)|Clock Method]] and British [[Banburismus]] attacks.\n\nThe Naval version of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' Enigma had always been issued with more rotors than the other services: At first six, then seven, and finally eight. The additional rotors were marked VI, VII and VIII, all with different wiring, and had two notches, resulting in more frequent turnover. The four-rotor Naval Enigma (M4) machine accommodated an extra rotor in the same space as the three-rotor version. This was accomplished by replacing the original reflector with a thinner one and by adding a thin fourth rotor. That fourth rotor was one of two types, ''Beta'' or ''Gamma'', and never stepped, but could be manually set to any of 26 positions. One of the 26 made the machine perform identically to the three-rotor machine.\n\n=== Stepping ===\nTo avoid merely implementing a simple (solvable) substitution cipher, every key press caused one or more rotors to step by one twenty-sixth of a full rotation, before the electrical connections were made. This changed the substitution alphabet used for encryption, ensuring that the cryptographic substitution was different at each new rotor position, producing a more formidable polyalphabetic substitution cipher. The stepping mechanism varied slightly from model to model. The right-hand rotor stepped once with each keystroke, and other rotors stepped less frequently.\n\n=== Turnover ===\n[[File:Enigma ratchet.png|thumb|The Enigma stepping motion seen from the side away from the operator. All three ratchet pawls (green) push in unison as a key is depressed. For the first rotor (1), which to the operator is the right-hand rotor, the ratchet (red) is always engaged, and steps with each keypress. Here, the middle rotor (2) is engaged, because the notch in the first rotor is aligned with the pawl; it will step (''turn over'') with the first rotor. The third rotor (3) is not engaged, because the notch in the second rotor is not aligned to the pawl, so it will not engage with the rachet.]]\nThe advancement of a rotor other than the left-hand one was called a ''turnover'' by the British. This was achieved by a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet and pawl]] mechanism. Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a ratchet. The alphabet ring of the rotor to the right normally prevented this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left. The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression.<ref name=\"doublestepping\" /> For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor. Similarly for rotors two and three. For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.\n\nThe first five rotors to be introduced (I\u2013V) contained one notch each, while the additional naval rotors VI, VII and VIII each had two notches. The position of the notch on each rotor was determined by the letter ring which could be adjusted in relation to the core containing the interconnections. The points on the rings at which they caused the next wheel to move were as follows.<ref>{{cite web| last=Sale|first=Tony|authorlink=Tony Sale|title=Technical specifications of the Enigma rotors| work=Technical Specification of the Enigma|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/rotorspec.htm|access-date=15 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+Position of turnover notches\n|-\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| Rotor\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| Turnover position(s)\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| BP mnemonic\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |I|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|R|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Royal\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |II|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|F|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Flags\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |III|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|W|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Wave\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |IV|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|K|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Kings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |V|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|A|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Above\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|VI, VII and VIII|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|A and N|||\n|}\n\nThe design also included a feature known as ''double-stepping''. This occurred when each pawl aligned with both the ratchet of its rotor and the rotating notched ring of the neighbouring rotor. If a pawl engaged with a ratchet through alignment with a notch, as it moved forward it pushed against both the ratchet and the notch, advancing both rotors. In a three-rotor machine, double-stepping affected rotor two only. If in moving forward the ratchet of rotor three was engaged, rotor two would move again on the subsequent keystroke, resulting in two consecutive steps. Rotor two also pushes rotor one forward after 26 steps, but since rotor one moves forward with every keystroke anyway, there is no double-stepping.<ref name=\"doublestepping\">{{cite journal |first=David |last=Hamer |title=Enigma: Actions Involved in the 'Double-Stepping' of the Middle Rotor |journal=Cryptologia |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=January 1997 |pages=47\u201350 |url=http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer/downloads/rotorpdf.zip |archivedate=19 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081659/http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer/downloads/rotorpdf.zip |format=zip |doi=10.1080/0161-119791885779}}</ref> This double-stepping caused the rotors to deviate from [[odometer]]-style regular motion.\n\n<!-- {|\n|-\n| ADM\n|-\n| ADN\n|-\n| ADO\n|-\n| ADP\n|-\n| ADQ\n|-\n| AER\n|-\n| AFS\n|-\n| AFT\n|-\n| AFU\n|} -->\nWith three wheels and only single notches in the first and second wheels, the machine had a period of 26\u00d725\u00d726&nbsp;= 16,900 (not 26\u00d726\u00d726, because of double-stepping).<ref name=\"doublestepping\" /> Historically, messages were limited to a few hundred letters, and so there was no chance of repeating any combined rotor position during a single session, denying cryptanalysts valuable clues.\n\nTo make room for the Naval fourth rotors, the reflector was made much thinner. The fourth rotor fitted into the space made available. No other changes were made, which eased the changeover. Since there were only three pawls, the fourth rotor never stepped, but could be manually set into one of 26 possible positions.\n\nA device that was designed, but not implemented before the war's end, was the ''L\u00fcckenf\u00fcllerwalze'' (gap-fill wheel) that implemented irregular stepping. It allowed field configuration of notches in all 26 positions. If the number of notches was a [[Coprime integers|relative prime]] of 26 and the number of notches were different for each wheel, the stepping would be more unpredictable. Like the Umkehrwalze-D it also allowed the internal wiring to be reconfigured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/lf/index.htm |title=L\u00fcckenf\u00fcllerwalze |publisher=Cryptomuseum.com |date= |access-date=17 July 2012}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n=== Entry wheel ===\nThe current entry wheel (''Eintrittswalze'' in German), or entry [[stator]], connects the [[plugboard]] to the rotor assembly. If the plugboard is not present, the entry wheel instead connects the keyboard and lampboard to the rotor assembly. While the exact wiring used is of comparatively little importance to security, it proved an obstacle to Rejewski's progress during his study of the rotor wirings. The commercial Enigma connects the keys in the order of their sequence on a [[QWERTZ]] keyboard: ''Q''&rarr;''A'', ''W''&rarr;''B'', ''E''&rarr;''C'' and so on. The military Enigma connects them in straight alphabetical order: ''A''&rarr;''A'', ''B''&rarr;''B'', ''C''&rarr;''C'', and so on. It took inspired guesswork for Rejewski to penetrate the modification.\n\n=== Reflector ===\n[[File:Enigma insides.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Internal mechanism of an Enigma machine showing the type B reflector and rotor stack.]]\nWith the exception of models ''A'' and ''B'', the last rotor came before a 'reflector' (German: ''Umkehrwalze'', meaning 'reversal rotor'), a patented feature unique to Enigma among the period's various rotor machines. The reflector connected outputs of the last rotor in pairs, redirecting current back through the rotors by a different route. The reflector ensured that Enigma would be [[Involution (mathematics)|self-reciprocal]]; thus, with two identically configured machines, a message could be encrypted on one and decrypted on the other, without the need for a bulky mechanism to switch between encryption and decryption modes. The reflector allowed a more compact design, but it also gave Enigma the property that no letter ever encrypted to itself. This was a severe cryptological flaw that was subsequently exploited by codebreakers.\n\nIn Model 'C', the reflector could be inserted in one of two different positions. In Model 'D', the reflector could be set in 26 possible positions, although it did not move during encryption. In the ''Abwehr'' Enigma, the reflector stepped during encryption in a manner similar to the other wheels.\n\nIn the German Army and Air Force Enigma, the reflector was fixed and did not rotate; there were four versions. The original version was marked 'A', and was replaced by ''Umkehrwalze B'' on 1 November 1937. A third version, ''Umkehrwalze C'' was used briefly in 1940, possibly by mistake, and was solved by [[Hut 6]].<ref name=\"ukwd-1\">Philip Marks, \"Umkehrwalze D: Enigma's Rewirable Reflector&nbsp;\u2014 Part I\", Cryptologia 25(2), April 2001, pp. 101\u2013141</ref> The fourth version, first observed on 2 January 1944, had a rewireable reflector, called ''Umkehrwalze D'', nick-named Uncle Dick by the British, allowing the Enigma operator to alter the connections as part of the key settings.{{Clear}}\n\n=== Plugboard ===\n[[File:Enigma-plugboard.jpg|right|thumb|The plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') was positioned at the front of the machine, below the keys. When in use during World War II, there were ten connections. In this photograph, just two pairs of letters have been swapped (A\u2194J and S\u2194O).]]\nThe plugboard (''Steckerbrett'' in German) permitted variable wiring that could be reconfigured by the operator (visible on the front panel of Figure 1; some of the patch cords can be seen in the lid). It was introduced on German Army versions in 1930, and was soon adopted by the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (German Navy). The plugboard contributed more cryptographic strength than an extra rotor. Enigma without a plugboard (known as ''unsteckered Enigma'') can be solved relatively straightforwardly using hand methods; these techniques are generally defeated by the plugboard, driving Allied cryptanalysts to develop special machines to solve it.\n\nA cable placed onto the plugboard connected letters in pairs; for example, ''E'' and ''Q'' might be a steckered pair. The effect was to swap those letters before and after the main rotor scrambling unit. For example, when an operator presses ''E'', the signal was diverted to ''Q'' before entering the rotors. Up to 13 steckered pairs might be used at one time, although only 10 were normally used.\n\nCurrent flowed from the keyboard through the plugboard, and proceeded to the entry-rotor or ''Eintrittswalze''. Each letter on the plugboard had two jacks. Inserting a plug disconnected the upper jack (from the keyboard) and the lower jack (to the entry-rotor) of that letter. The plug at the other end of the crosswired cable was inserted into another letter's jacks, thus switching the connections of the two letters.\n\n=== Accessories ===\n[[File:Enigma-printer-2.jpg|thumb|The ''Schreibmax'' was a printing unit which could be attached to the Enigma, removing the need for laboriously writing down the letters indicated on the light panel.]]\nOther features made various Enigma machines more secure or more convenient.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reuvers |first=Paul |title=Enigma accessories |year=2008 |url=http://www.jproc.ca/crypto/enigma_acc.html |access-date=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Schreibmax'' ====\nSome M4 Enigmas used the ''Schreibmax'', a small [[Printer (computing)|printer]] that could print the 26 letters on a narrow paper ribbon. This eliminated the need for a second operator to read the lamps and transcribe the letters. The ''Schreibmax'' was placed on top of the Enigma machine and was connected to the lamp panel. To install the printer, the lamp cover and light bulbs had to be removed. It improved both convenience and operational security; the printer could be installed remotely such that the signal officer operating the machine no longer had to see the decrypted [[plaintext]].\n\n==== ''Fernleseger\u00e4t'' ====\nAnother accessory was the remote lamp panel ''Fernleseger\u00e4t''. For machines equipped with the extra panel, the wooden case of the Enigma was wider and could store the extra panel. A lamp panel version could be connected afterwards, but that required, as with the ''Schreibmax'', that the lamp panel and light bulbs be removed.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\" /> The remote panel made it possible for a person to read the decrypted plaintext without the operator seeing it.\n\n==== ''Uhr'' ====\n[[File:Enigma-uhr-box.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Enigma Uhr attachment]]\nIn 1944, the ''Luftwaffe'' introduced a plugboard switch, called the ''Uhr'' (clock), a small box containing a switch with 40 positions. It replaced the standard plugs. After connecting the plugs, as determined in the daily key sheet, the operator turned the switch into one of the 40 positions, each producing a different combination of plug wiring. Most of these plug connections were, unlike the default plugs, not pair-wise.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\" /> In one switch position, the ''Uhr'' did not swap letters, but simply emulated the 13 stecker wires with plugs.\n\n=== Mathematical analysis ===\nThe Enigma transformation for each letter can be specified mathematically as a product of [[permutation]]s.{{sfn|Rejewski|1980}} Assuming a three-rotor German Army/Air Force Enigma, let {{mvar|P}} denote the plugboard transformation, {{mvar|U}} denote that of the reflector, and {{mvar|L}}, {{mvar|M}}, {{mvar|R}} denote those of the left, middle and right rotors respectively. Then the encryption {{mvar|E}} can be expressed as\n\n:<math>E=PRMLUL^{-1}M^{-1}R^{-1}P^{-1}.</math>\n\nAfter each key press, the rotors turn, changing the transformation. For example, if the right-hand rotor {{mvar|R}} is rotated {{mvar|n}} positions, the transformation becomes\n\n:<math>\\rho^nR\\rho^{-n},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the [[cyclic permutation]] mapping A to B, B to C, and so forth. Similarly, the middle and left-hand rotors can be represented as {{mvar|j}} and {{mvar|k}} rotations of {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|L}}. The encryption transformation can then be described as\n\n:<math>E=P\\left(\\rho^n R\\rho^{-n}\\right)\\left(\\rho^j M\\rho^{-j}\\right)\\left(\\rho^{k}L\\rho^{-k}\\right)U\\left(\\rho^kL^{-1}\\rho^{-k}\\right)\\left(\\rho^j M^{-1}\\rho^{-j}\\right)\\left(\\rho^n R^{-1}\\rho^{-n}\\right)P^{-1}.</math>\n\nCombining three rotors from a set of five, each of the 3 rotor settings with 26 positions, and the plugboard with ten pairs of letters connected, the military Enigma has 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 different settings (nearly 159 [[Names of large numbers|quintillion]] or about 67 [[bit]]s).<ref>{{YouTube | id=G2_Q9FoD-oQ | title=158,962,555,217,826,360,000&nbsp;\u2014 Numberphile}}</ref>\n\nNote that (5x4x3) x (26^3) x [26! / (6! x 10! x 2^10)] = 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 \u2248 2<sup>67.1</sup>\n\n== Operation ==\n=== Basic operation ===\n[[File:Encrypting and decrypting using an enigma machine.webm|thumb|Enciphering and deciphering using an Enigma machine]]\nA German Enigma operator would be given a plaintext message to encrypt. After setting up his machine, he would type the message on the Enigma keyboard. For each letter pressed, one lamp lit indicating a different letter according to a [[Pseudorandomness|pseudo-random]] substitution determined by the electrical pathways inside the machine. The letter indicated by the lamp would be recorded, typically by a second operator, as the [[cyphertext]] letter. The action of pressing a key also moved one or more rotors so that the next key press used a different electrical pathway, and thus a different substitution would occur even if the same plaintext letter were entered again. For each key press there was rotation of at least the right hand rotor and less often the other two, resulting in a different [[Pseudorandomness|substitution alphabet]] being used for every letter in the message. This process continued until the message was completed. The cyphertext recorded by the second operator would then be transmitted, usually by radio in [[Morse code]], to an operator of another Enigma machine. This operator would type in the cyphertext and&nbsp;\u2014 as long as all the settings of the deciphering machine were identical to those of the enciphering machine&nbsp;\u2014 for every key press the reverse substitution would occur and the plaintext message would emerge.\n\n=== Details ===\n[[File:Kenngruppenheft.jpg|thumb|German Kenngruppenheft (a U-boat [[codebook]] with grouped key codes).]]\n[[File:Enigma keylist 3 rotor.jpg|thumb|Monthly key list number 649 for the German Air Force Enigma, including settings for the reconfigurable reflector (which only change once every eight days).]]\nIn use, the Enigma required a list of daily key settings and auxiliary documents. In German military practice, communications were divided into separate networks, each using different settings. These communication nets were termed ''keys'' at [[Bletchley Park]], and were assigned [[code name]]s, such as ''Red'', ''Chaffinch'', and ''Shark''. Each unit operating in a network was given the same settings list for its Enigma, valid for a period of time. The procedures for German Naval Enigma were more elaborate and more secure than those in other services and employed auxiliary [[codebook]]s. Navy codebooks were printed in red, water-soluble ink on pink paper so that they could easily be destroyed if they were endangered or if the vessel was sunk.\n\nAn Enigma machine's setting (its [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] in modern terms; ''Schl\u00fcssel'' in German) specified each operator-adjustable aspect of the machine:\n* Wheel order (''Walzenlage'') \u2013 the choice of rotors and the order in which they are fitted.\n* Ring settings (''Ringstellung'') \u2013 the position of each alphabet ring relative to its rotor wiring.\n* Plug connections (''Steckerverbindungen'') \u2013 the pairs of letters in the plugboard that are connected together.\n* In very late versions, the wiring of the reconfigurable reflector.\n* Starting position of the rotors (''Grundstellung'') \u2013 chosen by the operator, should be different for each message.\n\nFor a message to be correctly encrypted and decrypted, both sender and receiver had to configure their Enigma in the same way; rotor selection and order, ring positions, plugboard connections and starting rotor positions must be identical. Except for the starting positions, these settings were established beforehand, distributed in key lists and changed daily. For example, the settings for the 18th day of the month in the German Luftwaffe Enigma key list number 649 (see image) were as follows:\n* Wheel order: IV, II, V\n* Ring settings: 15, 23, 26\n* Plugboard connections: EJ OY IV AQ KW FX MT PS LU BD\n* Reconfigurable reflector wiring: IU AS DV GL FT OX EZ CH MR KN BQ PW\n* Indicator groups: lsa zbw vcj rxn\n\nEnigma was designed to be secure even if the rotor wiring was known to an opponent, although in practice considerable effort protected the wiring configuration. If the wiring is secret, the total number of possible configurations has been calculated to be around {{val|3e114}} (approximately 380 bits); with known wiring and other operational constraints, this is reduced to around {{val|e=23}} (76 bits).<ref name=\"engima_cryptographic_mathematics\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/wwii/engima_cryptographic_mathematics.pdf|title=The Cryptographic Mathematics of Enigma|last=Miller|first=A. Ray|publisher=National Security Agency|year=2001|ref=harv}}</ref> Users of Enigma were confident of its security, because of the large number of possibilities; it was not then feasible for an adversary to even begin to try a [[brute-force attack]].\n\n=== Indicator ===\n{{See also|Cryptanalysis#Indicator}}\nMost of the key was kept constant for a set time period, typically a day. A different initial rotor position was used for each message, a concept similar to an [[Initialization vector|initialisation vector]] in modern cryptography. The reason is that encrypting many messages with identical or near-identical settings (termed in cryptanalysis as being ''in [[Cryptanalysis#Depth|depth]]''), would enable an attack using a statistical procedure such as [[William F. Friedman|Friedman's]] [[Index of coincidence]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman| first=W.F.|authorlink=William F.

Publ 22|publisher=Riverbank Laboratories|location=Geneva, Illinois, USA|oclc=55786052|year=1922}}</ref> The starting position for the rotors was transmitted just before the ciphertext, usually after having been enciphered. The exact method used was termed the ''indicator procedure''. Design weakness and operator sloppiness in these indicator procedures were two of the main weaknesses that made cracking Enigma possible.\n\n[[File:Enigma-rotor-windows.jpg|left|thumb|Figure 2. With the inner lid down, the Enigma was ready for use. The finger wheels of the rotors protruded through the lid, allowing the operator to set the rotors, and their current position, here ''RDKP'', was visible to the operator through a set of windows.]]\nOne of the earliest ''indicator procedures'' for the Enigma was cryptographically flawed and allowed Polish cryptanalysts to make the initial breaks into the plugboard Enigma. The procedure had the operator set his machine in accordance with the secret settings that all operators on the net shared. The settings included an initial position for the rotors (the ''Grundstellung''), say, ''AOH''. The operator turned his rotors until ''AOH'' was visible through the rotor windows. At that point, the operator chose his own arbitrary starting position for the message he would send. An operator might select ''EIN'', and that became the ''message setting'' for that encryption session. The operator then typed ''EIN'' into the machine twice, this producing the encrypted indicator, for example ''XHTLOA''. This was then transmitted, at which point the operator would turn the rotors to his message settings, ''EIN'' in this example, and then type the plaintext of the message.\n\nAt the receiving end, the operator set the machine to the initial settings (''AOH'') and typed in the first six letters of the message (''XHTLOA''). In this example, ''EINEIN'' emerged on the lamps, so the operator would learn the ''message setting'' that the sender used to encrypt this message. The receiving operator would set his rotors to ''EIN'', type in the rest of the ciphertext, and get the deciphered message.\n\nThis indicator scheme had two weaknesses. First, the use of a global initial position (''Grundstellung'') meant all message keys used the same polyalphabetic substitution. In later indicator procedures, the operator selected his initial position for encrypting the indicator and sent that initial position in the clear. The second problem was the repetition of the indicator, which was a serious security flaw. The message setting was encoded twice, resulting in a relation between first and fourth, second and fifth, and third and sixth character. These security flaws enabled the Polish Cipher Bureau to break into the pre-war Enigma system as early as 1932. The early indicator procedure was subsequently described by German cryptanalysts as the \"faulty indicator technique\".{{sfn|Huttenhain|Fricke|1945|pp=4,5}}\n\nDuring World War II, codebooks were only used each day to set up the rotors, their ring settings and the plugboard. For each message, the operator selected a random start position, let's say ''WZA'', and a random message key, perhaps ''SXT''. He moved the rotors to the ''WZA'' start position and encoded the message key ''SXT''. Assume the result was ''UHL''. He then set up the message key, ''SXT'', as the start position and encrypted the message. Next, he transmitted the start position, ''WZA'', the encoded message key, ''UHL'', and then the ciphertext. The receiver set up the start position according to the first trigram, ''WZA'', and decoded the second trigram, ''UHL'', to obtain the ''SXT'' message setting. Next, he used this ''SXT'' message setting as the start position to decrypt the message. This way, each ground setting was different and the new procedure avoided the security flaw of double encoded message settings.<ref>Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmaproc.htm Enigma message procedures] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\nThis procedure was used by ''Wehrmacht'' and ''Luftwaffe'' only. The ''Kriegsmarine'' procedures on sending messages with the Enigma were far more complex and elaborate. Prior to encryption the message was encoded using the ''[[Kurzsignale|Kurzsignalheft]]'' code book. The ''Kurzsignalheft'' contained tables to convert sentences into four-letter groups. A great many choices were included, for example, logistic matters such as refuelling and rendezvous with supply ships, positions and grid lists, harbour names, countries, weapons, weather conditions, enemy positions and ships, date and time tables. Another codebook contained the ''[[Discriminant Book|Kenngruppen]]'' and ''Spruchschl\u00fcssel'': the key identification and message key.<ref>Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/kurzsignale.htm Kurzsignalen on German U-boats] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\n=== Additional details ===\nThe Army Enigma machine used only the 26 alphabet characters. Punctuation was replaced with rare character combinations. A space was omitted or replaced with an X. The X was generally used as full-stop.\n\nSome punctuation marks were different in other parts of the armed forces. The ''Wehrmacht'' replaced a comma with ZZ and the question mark with FRAGE or FRAQ.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' replaced the comma with Y and the question mark with UD. The combination CH, as in \"''Acht''\" (eight) or \"''Richtung''\" (direction), was replaced with Q (AQT, RIQTUNG). Two, three and four zeros were replaced with CENTA, MILLE and MYRIA.\n\nThe ''Wehrmacht'' and the ''Luftwaffe'' transmitted messages in groups of five characters.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'', using the four rotor Enigma, had four-character groups. Frequently used names or words were varied as much as possible. Words like ''Minensuchboot'' (minesweeper) could be written as MINENSUCHBOOT, MINBOOT, MMMBOOT or MMM354. To make cryptanalysis harder, messages were limited to 250 characters. Longer messages were divided into several parts, each using a different message key.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/egenproc/eniggnix.htm|title=The translated 1940 ''Enigma General Procedure''|publisher=codesandciphers.org.uk|access-date=16 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/officer/officerx.htm|title=The translated 1940 ''Enigma Officer and Staff Procedure''|publisher=codesandciphers.org.uk|access-date=16 October 2006}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n=== Example encoding process ===\nThe character substitutions by the Enigma machine as a whole can be expressed as a string of letters with each position occupied by the character that will replace the character at the corresponding position in the alphabet. For example, a given machine configuration that encoded A to L, B to U, C to S, ..., and Z to J could be represented compactly as\n\n LUSHQOXDMZNAIKFREPCYBWVGTJ\n\nand the encoding of a particular character by that configuration could be represented by highlighting the encoded character as in\n\n D > LUS(H)QOXDMZNAIKFREPCYBWVGTJ\n\nSince the operation of an Enigma machine encoding a message is a series of such configurations, each associated with a single character being encoded, a sequence of such representations can be used to represent the operation of the machine as it encodes a message. For example, the process of encoding the first sentence of the main body of the famous \"D\u00f6nitz message\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/msg/p1030681.htm|title=Message from D\u00f6nitz&nbsp;\u2014 1 May 1945|access-date=27 November 2018}}</ref> to\n\n RBBF PMHP HGCZ XTDY GAHG UFXG EWKB LKGJ\n\ncan be represented as\n\n 0001 F > KGWNT(R)BLQPAHYDVJIFXEZOCSMU CDTK 25 15 16 26\n 0002 O > UORYTQSLWXZHNM(B)VFCGEAPIJDK CDTL 25 15 16 01\n 0003 L > HLNRSKJAMGF(B)ICUQPDEYOZXWTV CDTM 25 15 16 02\n 0004 G > KPTXIG(F)MESAUHYQBOVJCLRZDNW CDUN 25 15 17 03\n 0005 E > XDYB(P)WOSMUZRIQGENLHVJTFACK CDUO 25 15 17 04\n 0006 N > DLIAJUOVCEXBN(M)GQPWZYFHRKTS CDUP 25 15 17 05\n 0007 D > LUS(H)QOXDMZNAIKFREPCYBWVGTJ CDUQ 25 15 17 06\n 0008 E > JKGO(P)TCIHABRNMDEYLZFXWVUQS CDUR 25 15 17 07\n 0009 S > GCBUZRASYXVMLPQNOF(H)WDKTJIE CDUS 25 15 17 08\n 0010 I > XPJUOWIY(G)CVRTQEBNLZMDKFAHS CDUT 25 15 17 09\n 0011 S > DISAUYOMBPNTHKGJRQ(C)LEZXWFV CDUU 25 15 17 10\n 0012 T > FJLVQAKXNBGCPIRMEOY(Z)WDUHST CDUV 25 15 17 11\n 0013 S > KTJUQONPZCAMLGFHEW(X)BDYRSVI CDUW 25 15 17 12\n 0014 O > ZQXUVGFNWRLKPH(T)MBJYODEICSA CDUX 25 15 17 13\n 0015 F > XJWFR(D)ZSQBLKTVPOIEHMYNCAUG CDUY 25 15 17 14\n 0016 O > FSKTJARXPECNUL(Y)IZGBDMWVHOQ CDUZ 25 15 17 15\n 0017 R > CEAKBMRYUVDNFLTXW(G)ZOIJQPHS CDVA 25 15 18 16\n 0018 T > TLJRVQHGUCXBZYSWFDO(A)IEPKNM CDVB 25 15 18 17\n 0019 B > Y(H)LPGTEBKWICSVUDRQMFONJZAX CDVC 25 15 18 18\n 0020 E > KRUL(G)JEWNFADVIPOYBXZCMHSQT CDVD 25 15 18 19\n 0021 K > RCBPQMVZXY(U)OFSLDEANWKGTIJH CDVE 25 15 18 20\n 0022 A > (F)CBJQAWTVDYNXLUSEZPHOIGMKR CDVF 25 15 18 21\n 0023 N > VFTQSBPORUZWY(X)HGDIECJALNMK CDVG 25 15 18 22\n 0024 N > JSRHFENDUAZYQ(G)XTMCBPIWVOLK CDVH 25 15 18 23\n 0025 T > RCBUTXVZJINQPKWMLAY(E)DGOFSH CDVI 25 15 18 24\n 0026 Z > URFXNCMYLVPIGESKTBOQAJZDH(W) CDVJ 25 15 18 25\n 0027 U > JIOZFEWMBAUSHPCNRQLV(K)TGYXD CDVK 25 15 18 26\n 0028 G > ZGVRKO(B)XLNEIWJFUSDQYPCMHTA CDVL 25 15 18 01\n 0029 E > RMJV(L)YQZKCIEBONUGAWXPDSTFH CDVM 25 15 18 02\n 0030 B > G(K)QRFEANZPBMLHVJCDUXSOYTWI CDWN 25 15 19 03\n 0031 E > YMZT(G)VEKQOHPBSJLIUNDRFXWAC CDWO 25 15 19 04\n 0032 N > PDSBTIUQFNOVW(J)KAHZCEGLMYXR CDWP 25 15 19 05\n\nwhere the letters following each mapping are the letters that appear at the windows at that stage (the only state changes visible to the operator) and the numbers show the underlying physical position of each rotor.\n\nThe character mappings for a given configuration of the machine are in turn the result of a series of such mappings applied by each pass through a component of the machine: the encoding of a character resulting from the application of a given component's mapping serves as the input to the mapping of the subsequent component.  For example, the 4th step in the encoding above can be expanded to show each of these stages using the same representation of mappings and highlighting for the encoded character:\n \n <nowiki>G > ABCDEF(G)HIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n&nbsp;  P EFMQAB(G)UINKXCJORDPZTHWVLYS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AE.BF.CM.DQ.HU.JN.LX.PR.SZ.VW\n&nbsp;  1 OFRJVM(A)ZHQNBXPYKCULGSWETDI&nbsp; N&nbsp; 03&nbsp; VIII\n&nbsp;  2 (N)UKCHVSMDGTZQFYEWPIALOXRJB&nbsp; U&nbsp; 17&nbsp; VI\n&nbsp;  3 XJMIYVCARQOWH(L)NDSUFKGBEPZT&nbsp; D&nbsp; 15&nbsp; V\n&nbsp;  4 QUNGALXEPKZ(Y)RDSOFTVCMBIHWJ&nbsp; C&nbsp; 25&nbsp; \u03b2\n&nbsp;  R RDOBJNTKVEHMLFCWZAXGYIPS(U)Q &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c\n&nbsp;  4 EVTNHQDXWZJFUCPIAMOR(B)SYGLK &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u03b2\n&nbsp;  3 H(V)GPWSUMDBTNCOKXJIQZRFLAEY &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; V\n&nbsp;  2 TZDIPNJESYCUHAVRMXGKB(F)QWOL &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VI\n&nbsp;  1 GLQYW(B)TIZDPSFKANJCUXREVMOH &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VIII\n&nbsp;  P E(F)MQABGUINKXCJORDPZTHWVLYS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AE.BF.CM.DQ.HU.JN.LX.PR.SZ.VW\n F < KPTXIG(F)MESAUHYQBOVJCLRZDNW</nowiki>\n\nHere the encoding begins trivially with the first \"mapping\" representing the keyboard (which has no effect), followed by the plugboard, configured as AE.BF.CM.DQ.HU.JN.LX.PR.SZ.VW which has no effect on 'G', followed by the VIII rotor in the 03 position, which maps G to A, then the VI rotor in the 17 position, which maps A to N, ..., and finally the plugboard again, which maps B to F, producing the overall mapping indicated at the final step: G to F.\n\n== Models ==\nThe Enigma family included multiple designs. The earliest were commercial models dating from the early 1920s. Starting in the mid-1920s, the German military began to use Enigma, making a number of security-related changes.

It measured 65\u00d745\u00d738&nbsp;cm and weighed about {{convert|50|kg|lb}}.\n\n==== Enigma B (1924) ====\nIn 1924 Enigma ''model B'' was introduced, and was of a similar construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyradio.com/publish/Articles/The_Enigma_Code_Breach/Pictures/enigma_type_b.jpg|title=image of Enigma Type B|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051021083422/http://www.armyradio.com/publish/Articles/The_Enigma_Code_Breach/Pictures/enigma_type_b.jpg|archivedate=21 October 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref> While bearing the Enigma name, both models ''A'' and ''B'' were quite unlike later versions: They differed in physical size and shape, but also cryptographically, in that they lacked the reflector.\n\n==== Enigma C (1926) ====\nThe reflector, suggested by Scherbius' colleague [[Willi Korn]], was introduced in ''Enigma C'' (1926).\n\n''Model C'' was smaller and more portable than its predecessors. It lacked a typewriter, relying on the operator; hence the informal name of \"glowlamp Enigma\" to distinguish it from models ''A'' and ''B''.\n\n==== Enigma D (1927) ====\nThe ''Enigma C'' quickly gave way to ''Enigma D'' (1927). This version was widely used, with shipments to Sweden, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, Spain, United States and Poland. In 1927 [[Hugh Foss]] at the British [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] was able to show that commercial Enigma machines could be broken, provided suitable cribs were available.<ref>Bletchley Park Trust Museum display</ref>\n\n===== \"Navy Cipher D\" =====\nOther countries used Enigma machines. The [[Italian Navy]] adopted the commercial Enigma as \"Navy Cipher D\". The Spanish also used commercial Enigma machines during their [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. British codebreakers succeeded in breaking these machines, which lacked a plugboard.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=23}} Enigma machines were also used by diplomatic services.\n\n==== Enigma H (1929) ====\n[[File:Enigma-8-rotor.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A rare 8-rotor printing Enigma model H (1929).]]\nThere was also a large, eight-rotor printing model, the ''Enigma H'', called ''Enigma II'' by the ''[[Reichswehr]]''. In 1933 the Polish Cipher Bureau detected that it was in use for high-level military communication, but it was soon withdrawn, as it was unreliable and jammed frequently.{{sfn|Kozaczuk|1984|p=28}}\n\n==== Enigma K ====\nThe Swiss used a version of Enigma called ''Model K'' or ''Swiss K'' for military and diplomatic use, which was very similar to commercial [[#Enigma D (1927)|Enigma D]]. The machine's code was cracked by Poland, France, the United Kingdom and the United States; the latter code-named it INDIGO. An ''Enigma T'' model, code-named ''Tirpitz'', was used by Japan.\n\n==== Typex ====\nOnce the British figured out Enigma's principle of operation, they fixed the problem with it and created their own, the [[Typex]], which the Germans believed to be unsolvable.<ref>{{YouTube | id=V4V2bpZlqx8 | title=Flaw in the Enigma Code&nbsp;\u2014 Numberphile}}</ref>\n\n=== Military Enigma ===\n==== Funkschl\u00fcssel C ====\nThe Reichsmarine was the first military branch to adopt Enigma. This version, named ''Funkschl\u00fcssel C'' (\"Radio cipher C\"), had been put into production by 1925 and was introduced into service in 1926.{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=39\u201341, 299}}\n\nThe keyboard and lampboard contained 29 letters&nbsp;\u2014 A-Z, \u00c4, \u00d6 and \u00dc&nbsp;\u2014 that were arranged alphabetically, as opposed to the QWERTZUI ordering.{{sfn|Ulbricht|2005|p=4}} The rotors had 28 contacts, with the letter ''X'' wired to bypass the rotors unencrypted.{{sfn|Stripp|1993}} Three rotors were chosen from a set of five{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=40, 299}} and the reflector could be inserted in one of four different positions, denoted \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4.{{sfn|Bauer|2000|p=108}} The machine was revised slightly in July 1933.{{sfn|Stripp|1993|loc=plate 3}}\n\n==== Enigma G (1928\u20131930) ====\nBy 15 July 1928,{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=41, 299}} the German Army (''[[Reichswehr]]'') had introduced their own exclusive version of the Enigma machine, the ''Enigma G''.\n\nThe ''[[Abwehr]]'' used the ''Enigma G'' (the ''Abwehr'' Enigma). This Enigma variant was a four-wheel unsteckered machine with multiple notches on the rotors. This model was equipped with a counter that incremented upon each key press, and so is also known as the \"counter machine\" or the ''Z\u00e4hlwerk'' Enigma.\n\n==== Wehrmacht Enigma I (1930\u20131938) ====\nEnigma machine G was modified to the ''Enigma I'' by June 1930.{{sfn|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=97}} Enigma I is also known as the ''Wehrmacht'', or \"Services\" Enigma, and was used extensively by German military services and other government organisations (such as the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn#Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (1924-1937)|railways]]{{sfn|Smith|2000|p= 73}}) before and during [[World War II]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-769-0229-10A, Frankreich, Guderian, \"Enigma\" cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heinz Guderian]] in the [[Battle of France]], with an Enigma machine. Note one soldier is keying in text while another writes down the results,]]\nThe major difference between ''Enigma I'' (German Army version from 1930), and commercial Enigma models was the addition of a plugboard to swap pairs of letters, greatly increasing cryptographic strength.\n\nOther differences included the use of a fixed reflector and the relocation of the stepping notches from the rotor body to the movable letter rings. The machine measured {{convert|28|x|34|x|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighed around {{convert|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Stripp\">Stripp, 1993</ref>\n\nIn August 1935, the Air Force introduced the Wehrmacht Enigma for their communications.{{sfn|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=97}}\n\n==== M3 (1934) ====\nBy 1930, the Reichswehr had suggested that the Navy adopt their machine, citing the benefits of increased security (with the plugboard) and easier interservice communications.{{sfn|Kahn|1991|p=43}} The Reichsmarine eventually agreed and in 1934<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=43}} says August 1934. {{harvnb|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=15}} say October 2004.</ref> brought into service the Navy version of the Army Enigma, designated ''Funkschl\u00fcssel'' ' or ''M3''.

In September, a man identifying himself as \"The Master\" sent a note demanding \u00a325,000 and threatening to destroy the machine if the ransom was not paid. In early October 2000, Bletchley Park officials announced that they would pay the ransom, but the stated deadline passed with no word from the blackmailer. Shortly afterward, the machine was sent anonymously to BBC journalist [[Jeremy Paxman]], missing three rotors.\n\nIn November 2000, an antiques dealer named Dennis Yates was arrested after telephoning ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' to arrange the return of the missing parts. The Enigma machine was returned to Bletchley Park after the incident. In October 2001, Yates was sentenced to ten months in prison and served three months.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1609168.stm|work=BBC News|title=Man jailed over Enigma machine|date=19 October 2001|access-date=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, the Spanish daily newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' reported that 28 Enigma machines had been discovered by chance in an attic of Army headquarters in Madrid.

The British [[Typex]] was originally derived from the Enigma patents; Typex even includes features from the patent descriptions that were omitted from the actual Enigma machine. The British paid no royalties for the use of the patents, to protect secrecy. The Typex implementation is not the same as that found in German or other Axis versions.\n\nA Japanese Enigma clone was codenamed GREEN by American cryptographers. Little used, it contained four rotors mounted vertically. In the United States, cryptologist [[William F. Friedman|William Friedman]] designed the [[M-325]], a machine logically similar, although not in construction.\n\nA unique rotor machine was constructed in 2002 by Netherlands-based Tatjana van Vark. This device makes use of 40-point rotors, allowing letters, numbers and some punctuation to be used; each rotor contains 509 parts.<ref>van Vark, Tatjana ''[http://www.tatjavanvark.nl/tvv1/pht10.html The coding machine]''</ref>\n\nMachines like the [[SIGABA]], [[NEMA (machine)|NEMA]], [[Typex]] and so forth, are deliberately not considered to be Enigma derivatives as their internal ciphering functions are not mathematically identical to the Enigma transform.\n\nSeveral software implementations exist, but not all exactly match Enigma behaviour. The most commonly used software derivative (that is not compliant with any hardware implementation of the Enigma) is at EnigmaCo.de. Many Java applet Enigmas only accept single letter entry, complicating use even if the applet is Enigma compliant. Technically, Enigma@home is the largest scale deployment of a software Enigma, but the decoding software does not implement encipherment making it a derivative (as all original machines could cipher and decipher).\n\nA user-friendly three-rotor simulator, where users can select rotors, use the plugboard and define new settings for the rotors and reflectors is available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://w1tp.com/enigma/enigma_w.zip|title=3 rotor download}}</ref> The output appears in separate windows which can be independently made \"invisible\" to hide decryption.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://membres.multimania.fr/pc1/enigma/ |title=Enigma at Multimania |access-date=2 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402015246/http://membres.multimania.fr/pc1/enigma/ |archive-date=2 April 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another includes an \"autotyping\" function which takes plaintext from a clipboard and converts it to cyphertext (or vice versa) at one of four speeds.

Turing was played by [[Derek Jacobi]], who also played Turing in a 1996 television adaptation of the play.\n* [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' (1995) is set against the backdrop of World War II [[Bletchley Park]] and cryptologists working to read Naval Enigma in [[Hut 8]].\n* [[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' (1999) prominently features the Enigma machine and efforts to break it, and portrays the German U-boat command under [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] using it in apparently deliberate ignorance of its penetration.\n* Enigma is featured in ''[[The Code Book]]'', a survey of the history of cryptography written by [[Simon Singh]] and published in 1999.\n* The Enigma machine is used as a key plot element in [[Century Rain]] by [[Alastair Reynolds]], set in an alternate Earth where technological research has stagnated and the Enigma is the highest level of encryption available both to civilians and military.\n\n; Films\n* ''[[Sekret Enigmy]]'' (1979; translation: ''The Enigma Secret''), is a Polish film dealing with Polish aspects of the subject.<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0079878}}</ref>\n* The plot of the film ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'' (released in 2000) revolves around an attempt by American, rather than British, forces to seize an Enigma machine from a German U-boat.\n* The 2001 war comedy film ''[[All the Queen's Men]]'' featured a fictitious British plot to capture an Engima machine by infiltrating the Enigma factory with men disguised as women.\n* Harris' book, with substantial changes in plot, was adapted as the film ''[[Enigma (2001 film)|Enigma]]'' (2001), directed by [[Michael Apted]] and starring [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Dougray Scott]]. The film was criticised for historical inaccuracies, including neglect of the role of [[Poland]]'s ''[[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w]]''. The film, like the book, makes a Pole the villain, who seeks to betray the secret of Enigma decryption.<ref>{{cite news |author=Laurence Peter|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8158782.stm |title=How Poles cracked Nazi Enigma secret |work=[[BBC News]]|date= 20 July 2009}}</ref>\n* The film ''[[The Imitation Game]]'' (2014) tells the story of [[Alan Turing]] and his attempts to crack the Enigma machine code during World War II.<ref name=ng />\n\n; Television\n* In the British television series ''[[The Bletchley Circle]]'', the [[Typex]] was used by the protagonists during the war, and in Season 2, Episode 4, they visit [[Bletchley Park]] to seek one out, in order to crack the code of the [[black market]] procurer and smuggler Marta, who used the Typex to encode her ledger. The Circle, forced to settle for using an Enigma, instead, successfully cracks the code.\n* In [[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]] [[List of Elementary episodes#Season 5 (2016\u201317)|season 5, episode 23]] (\"Scrambled\"), a drug smuggling gang uses a four-rotor Enigma machine as part of their effort to encrypt their communications.\n*In [[Bones (TV series)|Bones]] [[Bones (season 8)|season 8, episode 12]] (\"The Corpse in the Canopy\"), [[Jack Hodgins (Bones)|Dr. Jack Hodgins]] uses an Enigma machine to send information to [[Seeley Booth]] at the FBI in order to prevent [[List of Bones characters#Christopher Pelant|Christopher Pelant]], a master hacker, from spying on their communications.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ultra]]\n* [[Bletchley Park]]\n* [[Beaumanor Hall]], a stately home used during the Second World War for military intelligence\n* [[Joan Clarke]]\n* [[Erich Fellgiebel]]\n* [[Gisbert Hasenjaeger]]&nbsp;\u2014 responsible for Enigma security\n* [[Fritz Thiele]]\n* [[United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory]]\n* [[Arlington Hall]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bauer |first=F.

The community is predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]] by religion, as opposed to the [[Croats]] who are [[Roman Catholic]].\n\nIn some regions of modern-day Croatia, mainly in southern [[Dalmatia]], [[ethnic Serbs]] have been present from the [[Early Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=}} Serbs from modern-day Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina started actively migrating to Croatia in several migration waves after 1538 when the [[Emperor Ferdinand I]] granted them the right to settle on the territory of the [[Military Frontier]]. In exchange for land and exemption from taxation, they had to conduct military service and participate in the protection of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s border against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They populated the [[Dalmatian hinterland]], [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Syrmia|Western Syrmia]]. After the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918 (later renamed to Yugoslavia), a few thousand Serbs moved to Croatian territory. During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Serbs were targeted for extermination as part of [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide]] by [[Usta\u0161e]]. After the beginning of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia's proclamation of independence, the Serbs living in Croatia rebelled against the Croatian government and proclaimed the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) on parts of Croatian territory, which led to the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. After the Croatian Army's [[Operation Storm]], the RSK ceased to exist, its territory was reincorporated into Croatia, and approximately 200,000 Serbs fled the country.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there were 186,633 Serbs living in Croatia (4.4% of the population) which are recognized as a national minority by the Croatian Constitution and therefore have 3 permanent seats in the [[Croatian Parliament]].\n\n==Overview==\nTraditional elements of their identity are the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]], [[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic script]] and military history, while modern elements are [[Serbian language|language]] and [[Serbian literature|literature]], civic, social and political values, concern for ethnic status and national organisation, and celebration of the [[Liberation of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:514233-Srbi-u-Hrvatskoj-zabrinuti-da-ce-nestati|title=Srbi u Hrvatskoj zabrinuti da \u0107e nestati}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2011 census there were 186,633 ethnic [[Serbs]] living in Croatia, 4.4% of the total population.

The Venetian government welcomed immigrants, as they protected possessions against the Ottomans. The [[Morlachs]], former Ottoman subjects, helped Venice triple its size in Dalmatia. The bishop of Makarska described how many people migrated from the Ottoman Empire to Venetian territories. Major population movements into Venetian Dalmatia occurred during the 1670s and 1680s. In the summer of 1685, Cosmi, the Archbishop of Split, wrote that Morlach leader [[Stojan Jankovi\u0107]] had brought 300 families with him to Dalmatia, and also that around Trogir and Split there were 5,000 refugees from Ottoman lands, without food; this was seen as a serious threat to the defense of Dalmatia.

In 1918, it became part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which immediately joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe formation of the Serbian identity of Vlahs in Croatia began in the 18th century under the influence of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] (SPC), and most of the local Orthodox priests of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] who were educated in monasteries outside Croatia under the guidance of SPC clergy who came to the southwestern region of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] during the [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]] (1690\u20131739). In 1695, Serbian Patriarch [[Arsenije III \u010carnojevi\u0107]] organized the SPC's hierarchy in Croatia \u2013 the territory of the [[Military Frontier]] was 'subjugated' to the [[Eparchy of Gornji Karlovac]], and [[Vara\u017edin Generalate]] and the rest of Croatia to the [[Eparchy of Pakrac]] (since 1705). The [[Serbianisation]] of the Vlachs in southern Croatia was the result of the hierarchical linkage of Orthodox Vlachs from southern Croatian territories, at the time ruled by the Venetians, with the SPC in northern Croatia, which strengthened the ritual and ecclesiastical connection of the Vlachs with the Serb immigrants.<ref>Introduction by Mirko Valenti\u0107 in: Mile Bogovi\u0107: Katoli\u010dka Crkva i Pravoslavlje u Dalmaciji za vrijeme mleta\u010dke vladavine, Kr\u0161\u0107anska sada\u0161njost/\u0160kolska knjiga, Zagreb, 1993., p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, the Serbian thought began spreading among the Orthodox Christians in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]. At first through the religious denomination, and by the time as a sign of national affiliation. There was also a brief occurrence when certain Catholic intellectuals, predominantly in [[Dubrovnik]], were won over by the Serbian thought. They were known as \"Serb Catholics\".<ref>Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, predgovor u : Mihovio Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 10</ref> The reason for this was that Dalmatia and the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]], at the time ruled by [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]], were extremely disadvantaged so intellectuals did not want to link themselves to them, while at the same time they found newly created Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] with their idea of unification of the South Slavs, appealing. With the creation of [[Yugoslavia]], their political goals were achieved, and after that these \"one-time Serbs\" disappeared from the political stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/novosti/hrvatska/clanak/id/156882/pitanje-boskovica-dr-nikola-tolja-posrbljenje-dubrovcana-bio-je-cin-otpora-becu-i-pesti|title=Tolja: Posrbljenje Dubrov\u010dana bio je \u010din otpora Be\u010du i Pe\u0161ti|publisher=}}</ref> Such developments in the spread of Serbian thought in the Croatian lands were the result of Serbian politicians' plans dating back to the first half of the 19th century when Serbia wasn't an independent country, but a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. According to the 1844 [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]]'s Na\u010dertanije, they intended to establish a Serbian Empire on the territory of the collapsed Ottoman Empire. At first, its borders were supposed to be the borders of the Ottoman Empire and the Slavs in them, but they gradually expanded to the territory of present-day Croatia (including the Military Frointaire and Dalmatia).<ref name=\"auto\">Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, Prologue in: Mihovil Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 11</ref> To accomplish this, the ground had to be prepared, so that diplomacy and the military would have a stronger base for taking action. The bases for this was the Serbian state law, and where it wasn't possible to appropriate the land with it, the argument of nationality, and when that argument couldn't be applied, then it was necessary to \"create\" the Serbs among the target population, if not among all, then among the majority. The main target were Orthodox Christians in the neighboring, non-Serb countries. In 1848/50, Serbian government organized a secret network of agents who propagated the Serbian ideas. Those agents were concealed as cultural workers. The famous agents were [[Georgije Nikolajevi\u0107]] and [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The 'creation' of new Serbs was carried out by identification of Orthodox Christianity in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina only with Serbs.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/67500|title=The Serbian question in Croatian politics, 1848\u20131918|first=Markus|last=Tomislav|date=1 April 2011|journal=Review of Croatian History|volume=VI|issue=1}}</ref> Another argument used in the areas with no Orthodox Christians was identifying people who spoke [[Shtokavian]] with the Serbs. The idea \"all Shtokavians are Serbs\" was created by German Slavists in the 1850s, and was promoted by the Austrian government who wanted to equalize Croats and Serbs so that it could more easily rule the Croatian lands and in the next stage conquer Serbia and penetrate across [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"matica.hr\">http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/427/Srpski%20jezik%20nije%20\u0161tokavski/</ref> The idea was that it was easier to \"govern Belgrade and Zagreb if the same language was spoken in them\". Geostrategic position of Belgrade in relation to Zagreb further contributed to favoring the Serbs whom Austrians did not perceive as a danger, unlike Croats who had own language, politicians, national consciousness, laws, military tradition and prepared army, as well as international [[Election in Cetin|treaties which have affirmed their rights]], so Austrians needed someone (Serbs) to discipline the Croats. The same was done by Hungary which became a strong political factor after 1848 and that wished to expand into the [[Southeast Europe]], which was particularly strong during the reign of [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] over Croatia.<ref name=\"matica.hr\"/>\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Matija Ban]], poet and dramatist, member of [[Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik]]<br />'''Right:''' [[Josip Runjanin]], composer of [[Lijepa na\u0161a domovino|Croatian national anthem]]\n| width1    = 130\n| image1    = MatijaBan.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| image2    = Josip Runjanin.png\n}}\n[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutionary 1848]] and the process of building a modern Croatian nation resulted in closer co-operation between Croats and Serbs and recognition of their equality in the sense of [[Illyrian Movement]] (also known as the Croatian National Revival) and [[Yugoslavia]]n ideas. In the 1830s, ideas of the Illyrian Movement spread to Dalmatia. In 1835, Bo\u017eidar Petranovi\u0107 began publishing the ''Serbo-Dalmatian Magazine''.

However, since [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]], [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]] and [[Jovan Suboti\u0107]] started writing of Dalmatia as a \"Serbian land\", and the recognition of Serbia as an independent state at the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], the differences between Croats and Serbs in Dalmatia increased. Following Croat enthusiasm with the successful 1878 [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], during which many Croatian soldiers died, and them seeking unification of Dalmatia and the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, the conflict between Croats and Serbs was inevitable.<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\">{{cite web|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20000813/podlistak.htm|title=SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, NEDJELJA 13. kolovoza 2000. \u2013 podlistak: Preokret i odvajanje|website=arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr}}</ref> In 1879, Serbs from Bukovica voted for the Italian candidate instead of Croat [[Miho Klai\u0107]].<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\"/> This event was called by People's Party's supporters ''Bukovica betrail''.

He introduced Cyrillic in grammar school and equalized it with Latin, and allowed the use of Serbian flags.

During his reign, four out of eight Croatian county prefects, Deputy Ban and Speaker of the Croatian Parliament were Serbs, and Serbs occupied the highest ranks in the judiciary.

The community is predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]] by religion, as opposed to the [[Croats]] who are [[Roman Catholic]].\n\nIn some regions of modern-day Croatia, mainly in southern [[Dalmatia]], [[ethnic Serbs]] have been present from the [[Early Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=}} Serbs from modern-day Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina started actively migrating to Croatia in several migration waves after 1538 when the [[Emperor Ferdinand I]] granted them the right to settle on the territory of the [[Military Frontier]]. In exchange for land and exemption from taxation, they had to conduct military service and participate in the protection of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s border against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They populated the [[Dalmatian hinterland]], [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Syrmia|Western Syrmia]]. After the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918 (later renamed to Yugoslavia), a few thousand Serbs moved to Croatian territory. During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Serbs were targeted for extermination as part of [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide]] by [[Usta\u0161e]]. After the beginning of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia's proclamation of independence, the Serbs living in Croatia rebelled against the Croatian government and proclaimed the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) on parts of Croatian territory, which led to the [[Croatian War of Independence]].

The Venetian government welcomed immigrants, as they protected possessions against the Ottomans. The [[Morlachs]], former Ottoman subjects, helped Venice triple its size in Dalmatia. The bishop of Makarska described how many people migrated from the Ottoman Empire to Venetian territories. Major population movements into Venetian Dalmatia occurred during the 1670s and 1680s. In the summer of 1685, Cosmi, the Archbishop of Split, wrote that Morlach leader [[Stojan Jankovi\u0107]] had brought 300 families with him to Dalmatia, and also that around Trogir and Split there were 5,000 refugees from Ottoman lands, without food; this was seen as a serious threat to the defense of Dalmatia.

In 1918, it became part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which immediately joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe formation of the Serbian identity of Vlahs in Croatia began in the 18th century under the influence of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] (SPC), and most of the local Orthodox priests of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] who were educated in monasteries outside Croatia under the guidance of SPC clergy who came to the southwestern region of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] during the [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]] (1690\u20131739).

The [[Serbianisation]] of the Vlachs in southern Croatia was the result of the hierarchical linkage of Orthodox Vlachs from southern Croatian territories, at the time ruled by the Venetians, with the SPC in northern Croatia, which strengthened the ritual and ecclesiastical connection of the Vlachs with the Serb immigrants.<ref>Introduction by Mirko Valenti\u0107 in: Mile Bogovi\u0107: Katoli\u010dka Crkva i Pravoslavlje u Dalmaciji za vrijeme mleta\u010dke vladavine, Kr\u0161\u0107anska sada\u0161njost/\u0160kolska knjiga, Zagreb, 1993., p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, the Serbian thought began spreading among the Orthodox Christians in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]. At first through the religious denomination, and by the time as a sign of national affiliation. There was also a brief occurrence when certain Catholic intellectuals, predominantly in [[Dubrovnik]], were won over by the Serbian thought.

With the creation of [[Yugoslavia]], their political goals were achieved, and after that these \"one-time Serbs\" disappeared from the political stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/novosti/hrvatska/clanak/id/156882/pitanje-boskovica-dr-nikola-tolja-posrbljenje-dubrovcana-bio-je-cin-otpora-becu-i-pesti|title=Tolja: Posrbljenje Dubrov\u010dana bio je \u010din otpora Be\u010du i Pe\u0161ti|publisher=}}</ref> Such developments in the spread of Serbian thought in the Croatian lands were the result of Serbian politicians' plans dating back to the first half of the 19th century when Serbia wasn't an independent country, but a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. According to the 1844 [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]]'s Na\u010dertanije, they intended to establish a Serbian Empire on the territory of the collapsed Ottoman Empire. At first, its borders were supposed to be the borders of the Ottoman Empire and the Slavs in them, but they gradually expanded to the territory of present-day Croatia (including the Military Frointaire and Dalmatia).<ref name=\"auto\">Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, Prologue in: Mihovil Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 11</ref> To accomplish this, the ground had to be prepared, so that diplomacy and the military would have a stronger base for taking action. The bases for this was the Serbian state law, and where it wasn't possible to appropriate the land with it, the argument of nationality, and when that argument couldn't be applied, then it was necessary to \"create\" the Serbs among the target population, if not among all, then among the majority. The main target were Orthodox Christians in the neighboring, non-Serb countries. In 1848/50, Serbian government organized a secret network of agents who propagated the Serbian ideas. Those agents were concealed as cultural workers. The famous agents were [[Georgije Nikolajevi\u0107]] and [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The 'creation' of new Serbs was carried out by identification of Orthodox Christianity in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina only with Serbs.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/67500|title=The Serbian question in Croatian politics, 1848\u20131918|first=Markus|last=Tomislav|date=1 April 2011|journal=Review of Croatian History|volume=VI|issue=1}}</ref> Another argument used in the areas with no Orthodox Christians was identifying people who spoke [[Shtokavian]] with the Serbs. The idea \"all Shtokavians are Serbs\" was created by German Slavists in the 1850s, and was promoted by the Austrian government who wanted to equalize Croats and Serbs so that it could more easily rule the Croatian lands and in the next stage conquer Serbia and penetrate across [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"matica.hr\">http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/427/Srpski%20jezik%20nije%20\u0161tokavski/</ref> The idea was that it was easier to \"govern Belgrade and Zagreb if the same language was spoken in them\". Geostrategic position of Belgrade in relation to Zagreb further contributed to favoring the Serbs whom Austrians did not perceive as a danger, unlike Croats who had own language, politicians, national consciousness, laws, military tradition and prepared army, as well as international [[Election in Cetin|treaties which have affirmed their rights]], so Austrians needed someone (Serbs) to discipline the Croats. The same was done by Hungary which became a strong political factor after 1848 and that wished to expand into the [[Southeast Europe]], which was particularly strong during the reign of [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] over Croatia.<ref name=\"matica.hr\"/>\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Matija Ban]], poet and dramatist, member of [[Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik]]<br />'''Right:''' [[Josip Runjanin]], composer of [[Lijepa na\u0161a domovino|Croatian national anthem]]\n| width1    = 130\n| image1    = MatijaBan.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| image2    = Josip Runjanin.png\n}}\n[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutionary 1848]] and the process of building a modern Croatian nation resulted in closer co-operation between Croats and Serbs and recognition of their equality in the sense of [[Illyrian Movement]] (also known as the Croatian National Revival) and [[Yugoslavia]]n ideas. In the 1830s, ideas of the Illyrian Movement spread to Dalmatia. In 1835, Bo\u017eidar Petranovi\u0107 began publishing the ''Serbo-Dalmatian Magazine''. In the following thirty years, Croats and Serbs worked together in the 'national movement' (by using this neutral name they avoided conflicts) against the Austro-Hungarian unitarism and [[Autonomist Party|Italian nationalists]]. However, since [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]], [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]] and [[Jovan Suboti\u0107]] started writing of Dalmatia as a \"Serbian land\", and the recognition of Serbia as an independent state at the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], the differences between Croats and Serbs in Dalmatia increased. Following Croat enthusiasm with the successful 1878 [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], during which many Croatian soldiers died, and them seeking unification of Dalmatia and the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, the conflict between Croats and Serbs was inevitable.<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\">{{cite web|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20000813/podlistak.htm|title=SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, NEDJELJA 13. kolovoza 2000. \u2013 podlistak: Preokret i odvajanje|website=arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr}}</ref> In 1879, Serbs from Bukovica voted for the Italian candidate instead of Croat [[Miho Klai\u0107]].<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\"/> This event was called by People's Party's supporters ''Bukovica betrail''.
