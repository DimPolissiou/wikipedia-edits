What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one with a flat nose' and has as such been relied upon as a piece of evidence in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This difference of meaning is due to difference in the correct reading of the word ''Anasa''. Sayanacharya reads it as ''an-asa'' while Prof. Max Muller reads it as ''a-nasa''. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word. Secondly, as there is no other place where the Dasyus are described as noseless, there is no reason why the word should be read in such a manner as to give it an altogether new sense. It is only fair to read it as a synonym of ''Mridhravak''. There is therefore no evidence in support of the conclusion that the Dasyus belonged to a different race.<ref name=\"Sharma, Arvind 2005\"/>}}\n\nAmbedkar disputed various hypotheses of the Aryan homeland being [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|outside India]], and concluded the Aryan homeland was India itself.<ref>Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''\"Dr. B.

Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of [[reservation in India|reservations]] of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for members of [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|scheduled caste]]s and [[scheduled tribe]]s and [[Other Backward Class]], a system akin to [[affirmative action]]. India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures.<ref name=Sheth>{{cite journal|last=Sheth|first=D.

[[Balraj Madhok]] reportedly said, Ambedkar had clearly told the Kashmiri leader, [[Sheikh Abdullah]]: \"You wish India should protect your borders, she should build roads in your area, she should supply you food grains, and Kashmir should get equal status as India. But Government of India should have only limited powers and Indian people should have no rights in Kashmir. To give consent to this proposal, would be a treacherous thing against the interests of India and I, as the Law Minister of India, will never do it.\" Then Sk. Abdullah approached Nehru, who directed him to Gopal Swami Ayyangar, who in turn approached Sardar Patel, saying Nehru had promised Sk. Abdullah the special status. Patel got the Article passed while Nehru was on a foreign tour. On the day the article came up for discussion, Ambedkar did not reply to questions on it but did participate on other articles. All arguments were done by Krishna Swami Ayyangar.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Narender|title=Converted Kashmir: Memorial of Mistakes|year=1994|publisher=Utpal Publications|location=Delhi|chapter-url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|accessdate=17 September 2013|chapter=Chapter 26: Article 370|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905070936/http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|archivedate=5 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tilak |title=Why Ambedkar refused to draft Article 370 |url=http://india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207095529/http://www.india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 February 2004 |publisher=Indymedia India |accessdate=17 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Support to Uniform Civil Code===\n{{quote box\n| quoted = true\n| width = 280px\n| align = right\n| salign = right\n| quote = I personally do not understand why religion should be given this vast, expansive jurisdiction, so as to cover the whole of life and to prevent the legislature from encroaching upon that field.

Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms involve both the thoracic and abdominal aorta.\n* Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms comprise some or all of the aorta in both the chest and abdomen, and have components of both thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[File:Aortic aneurysm.jpg|right|thumb|Figure A shows a normal aorta. Figure B shows a thoracic aortic aneurysm (which is located behind the heart). Figure C shows an abdominal aortic aneurysm located below the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys.]]\nMost intact aortic aneurysms do not produce symptoms. As they enlarge, symptoms such as [[abdominal pain]] and [[back pain]] may develop. Compression of nerve roots may cause leg pain or numbness. Untreated, aneurysms tend to become progressively larger, although the rate of enlargement is unpredictable for any individual.  Rarely, clotted blood which lines most aortic aneurysms can break off and result in an [[Embolism|embolus]].\n\nAneurysms can be found on physical examination. Medical imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the anatomic extent of the aneurysm. In patients presenting with aneurysm of the arch of the aorta, a common sign is a hoarse voice from stretching of the left [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]], a branch of the vagus nerve that winds around the aortic arch to supply the muscles of the [[larynx]].\n\n===Abdominal aortic aneurysm===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of medical abbreviations]] -->\n{{main|Abdominal aortic aneurysm}}\n[[File:Abdominal aortic aneurysm.JPG|thumb|Abdominal aortic aneurysms (3,4 cm)]]\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are more common than their thoracic counterpart. One reason for this is that [[elastin]], the principal load-bearing protein present in the wall of the aorta, is reduced in the abdominal aorta as compared to the thoracic aorta. Another is that the abdominal aorta does not possess [[vasa vasorum]], the nutrient-supplying blood vessels within the wall of the aorta. Most AAA are ''[[Aneurysm#True and false|true aneurysms]]'' that involve all three layers ([[tunica intima]], [[tunica media]] and [[tunica adventitia]]). The prevalence of AAAs increases with age, with an average age of 65\u201370 at the time of diagnosis. AAAs have been attributed to [[atherosclerosis]], though other factors are involved in their formation.\n\nThe risk of rupture of an AAA is related to its diameter; once the aneurysm reaches about 5&nbsp;cm, the yearly risk of rupture may exceed the risks of surgical repair for an average-risk patient.  Rupture risk is also related to shape; so-called \"fusiform\" (long) aneurysms are considered less rupture prone than \"saccular\" (shorter, bulbous) aneurysms, the latter having more wall tension in a particular location in the aneurysm wall.\n\nBefore rupture, an AAA may present as a large, [[wiktionary:pulsatile|pulsatile]] mass above the [[Navel|umbilicus]]. A [[bruit]] may be heard from the turbulent flow in the aneurysm. Unfortunately, however, rupture may be the first hint of AAA. Once an aneurysm has ruptured, it presents with classic symptoms of abdominal pain which is severe, constant, and radiating to the back.\n\nThe diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be confirmed at the bedside by the use of [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]].  Rupture may be indicated by the presence of free fluid in the abdomen. A contrast-enhanced abdominal [[computed tomography|CT scan]] is the best test to diagnose an AAA and guide treatment options.\n\nOnly 10\u201325% of patients survive rupture due to large pre- and post-operative mortality. Annual mortality from ruptured aneurysms in the [[United States]] is about 15,000. Most are due to [[Abdominal aortic aneurysm|abdominal aneurysms]], with [[thoracic]] and thoracoabdominal aneurysms making up 1% to 4% of the total.\n\n===Aortic rupture===\n{{main|Aortic rupture}}\nAn aortic aneurysm can rupture from wall weakness. Aortic rupture is a surgical emergency, and has a high mortality even with prompt treatment. Weekend admission for ruptured aortic aneurysm is associated with an increased mortality compared with admission on a weekday, and this is likely due to several factors including a delay in prompt surgical intervention.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Groves EM, Khoshchehreh M, Le C, Malik S | date = Aug 2014 | title = Effects of weekend admission on the outcomes and management of ruptured aortic aneurysms | journal = J Vasc Surg | volume = 60 | issue = 2| pages = 318\u201324 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2014.02.052 | pmid=24709439 | pmc=4121436}}</ref>\n\n==Risk factors==\n*[[Coronary artery disease]]\n*[[Hypertension]]\n*[[Loeys-Dietz Syndrome]]\n*[[Hypercholesterolemia]]\n*[[Hyperhomocysteinemia]]\n*Elevated [[C-reactive protein]]\n*[[Tobacco]] use\n*[[Alcohol]] use\n*[[Peripheral vascular disease]]\n*[[Marfan syndrome]]\n*[[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome|Ehlers-Danlos]] type IV\n*[[Bicuspid aortic valve|Bicuspid Aortic Valve]]\n*[[Syphilis]]\n*[[IgG4-related disease]]\n*[[Pregnancy]]\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n[[File:6.5cmAAAwith3cmlumen.png|thumb|A 6.5cm AAA with a 3cm lumen]]\nAn aortic aneurysm can occur as a result of trauma, infection, or, most commonly, from an intrinsic abnormality in the [[elastin]] and [[collagen]] components of the aortic wall.

The most cost-efficient screening test is an abdominal aortic ultrasound study. Noting the results of several large, population-based screening trials, the US [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) now provides payment for one ultrasound study in male or female smokers aged 65 years or older (\"SAAAVE Act\").\n\n==Management==\nSurgery (open or endovascular) is the definitive treatment of an aortic aneurysm. Medical therapy is typically reserved for smaller aneurysms or for elderly, frail patients where the risks of surgical repair exceed the risks of non-operative therapy (observation alone).\n\n===Medical therapy===\nMedical therapy of aortic aneurysms involves strict [[blood pressure]] control. This does not treat the aortic aneurysm per se, but control of [[hypertension]] within tight blood pressure parameters may decrease the rate of expansion of the aneurysm.\n\nThe medical management of patients with aortic aneurysms, reserved for smaller aneurysms or frail patients, involves cessation of smoking, blood pressure control, use of [[statin]]s and occasionally [[beta blocker]]s. Ultrasound studies are obtained on a regular basis (i.e. every six or 12 months) to follow the size of the aneurysm.\n\n===Surgery===\nDecisions about repairing an aortic aneurysm are based on the balance between the risk of aneurysm rupture without treatment versus the risks of the treatment itself. For example, a small aneurysm in an elderly patient with severe [[cardiovascular disease]] would not be repaired. The chance of the small aneurysm rupturing is overshadowed by the risk of cardiac complications from the procedure to repair the aneurysm.\n\nThe risk of the repair procedure is two-fold. First, there is consideration of the risk of problems occurring during and immediately after the procedure itself (\"peri-procedural\" complications). Second, the effectiveness of the procedure must be taken into account, namely whether the procedure effectively protects the patient from aneurysm rupture over the long-term, and whether the procedure is durable so that secondary procedures, with their attendant risks, are not necessary over the life of the patient. These issues attain importance and should be considered when making a choice between different treatment options. A less invasive procedure (such as [[endovascular aneurysm repair]]) may be associated with fewer short-term risks to the patient (fewer peri-procedural complications) but secondary procedures may be necessary over long-term follow-up.\n\nThe definitive treatment for an aortic aneurysm may be surgical or endovascular repair.  The determination of surgical intervention is complex and determined on a per-case basis.  Risk of aneurysm rupture is weighed against procedural risk.

Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms involve both the thoracic and abdominal aorta.\n* Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms comprise some or all of the aorta in both the chest and abdomen, and have components of both thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[File:Aortic aneurysm.jpg|right|thumb|Figure A shows a normal aorta. Figure B shows a thoracic aortic aneurysm (which is located behind the heart). Figure C shows an abdominal aortic aneurysm located below the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys.]]\nMost intact aortic aneurysms do not produce symptoms. As they enlarge, symptoms such as [[abdominal pain]] and [[back pain]] may develop. Compression of nerve roots may cause leg pain or numbness. Untreated, aneurysms tend to become progressively larger, although the rate of enlargement is unpredictable for any individual.  Rarely, clotted blood which lines most aortic aneurysms can break off and result in an [[Embolism|embolus]].\n\nAneurysms can be found on physical examination. Medical imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the anatomic extent of the aneurysm. In patients presenting with aneurysm of the arch of the aorta, a common sign is a hoarse voice from stretching of the left [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]], a branch of the vagus nerve that winds around the aortic arch to supply the muscles of the [[larynx]].\n\n===Abdominal aortic aneurysm===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of medical abbreviations]] -->\n{{main|Abdominal aortic aneurysm}}\n[[File:Abdominal aortic aneurysm.JPG|thumb|Abdominal aortic aneurysms (3,4 cm)]]\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are more common than their thoracic counterpart. One reason for this is that [[elastin]], the principal load-bearing protein present in the wall of the aorta, is reduced in the abdominal aorta as compared to the thoracic aorta. Another is that the abdominal aorta does not possess [[vasa vasorum]], the nutrient-supplying blood vessels within the wall of the aorta. Most AAA are ''[[Aneurysm#True and false|true aneurysms]]'' that involve all three layers ([[tunica intima]], [[tunica media]] and [[tunica adventitia]]). The prevalence of AAAs increases with age, with an average age of 65\u201370 at the time of diagnosis. AAAs have been attributed to [[atherosclerosis]], though other factors are involved in their formation.\n\nThe risk of rupture of an AAA is related to its diameter; once the aneurysm reaches about 5&nbsp;cm, the yearly risk of rupture may exceed the risks of surgical repair for an average-risk patient.  Rupture risk is also related to shape; so-called \"fusiform\" (long) aneurysms are considered less rupture prone than \"saccular\" (shorter, bulbous) aneurysms, the latter having more wall tension in a particular location in the aneurysm wall.\n\nBefore rupture, an AAA may present as a large, [[wiktionary:pulsatile|pulsatile]] mass above the [[Navel|umbilicus]]. A [[bruit]] may be heard from the turbulent flow in the aneurysm. Unfortunately, however, rupture may be the first hint of AAA. Once an aneurysm has ruptured, it presents with classic symptoms of abdominal pain which is severe, constant, and radiating to the back.\n\nThe diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be confirmed at the bedside by the use of [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]].  Rupture may be indicated by the presence of free fluid in the abdomen. A contrast-enhanced abdominal [[computed tomography|CT scan]] is the best test to diagnose an AAA and guide treatment options.\n\nOnly 10\u201325% of patients survive rupture due to large pre- and post-operative mortality. Annual mortality from ruptured aneurysms in the [[United States]] is about 15,000. Most are due to [[Abdominal aortic aneurysm|abdominal aneurysms]], with [[thoracic]] and thoracoabdominal aneurysms making up 1% to 4% of the total.\n\n===Aortic rupture===\n{{main|Aortic rupture}}\nAn aortic aneurysm can rupture from wall weakness. Aortic rupture is a surgical emergency, and has a high mortality even with prompt treatment. Weekend admission for ruptured aortic aneurysm is associated with an increased mortality compared with admission on a weekday, and this is likely due to several factors including a delay in prompt surgical intervention.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Groves EM, Khoshchehreh M, Le C, Malik S | date = Aug 2014 | title = Effects of weekend admission on the outcomes and management of ruptured aortic aneurysms | journal = J Vasc Surg | volume = 60 | issue = 2| pages = 318\u201324 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2014.02.052 | pmid=24709439 | pmc=4121436}}</ref>\n\n==Risk factors==\n*[[Coronary artery disease]]\n*[[Hypertension]]\n*[[Loeys-Dietz Syndrome]]\n*[[Hypercholesterolemia]]\n*[[Hyperhomocysteinemia]]\n*Elevated [[C-reactive protein]]\n*[[Tobacco]] use\n*[[Alcohol]] use\n*[[Peripheral vascular disease]]\n*[[Marfan syndrome]]\n*[[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome|Ehlers-Danlos]] type IV\n*[[Bicuspid aortic valve|Bicuspid Aortic Valve]]\n*[[Syphilis]]\n*[[IgG4-related disease]]\n*[[Pregnancy]]\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n[[File:6.5cmAAAwith3cmlumen.png|thumb|A 6.5cm AAA with a 3cm lumen]]\nAn aortic aneurysm can occur as a result of trauma, infection, or, most commonly, from an intrinsic abnormality in the [[elastin]] and [[collagen]] components of the aortic wall.

The most cost-efficient screening test is an abdominal aortic ultrasound study. Noting the results of several large, population-based screening trials, the US [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) now provides payment for one ultrasound study in male or female smokers aged 65 years or older (\"SAAAVE Act\").\n\n==Management==\nSurgery (open or endovascular) is the definitive treatment of an aortic aneurysm. Medical therapy is typically reserved for smaller aneurysms or for elderly, frail patients where the risks of surgical repair exceed the risks of non-operative therapy (observation alone).\n\n===Medical therapy===\nMedical therapy of aortic aneurysms involves strict [[blood pressure]] control. This does not treat the aortic aneurysm per se, but control of [[hypertension]] within tight blood pressure parameters may decrease the rate of expansion of the aneurysm.\n\nThe medical management of patients with aortic aneurysms, reserved for smaller aneurysms or frail patients, involves cessation of smoking, blood pressure control, use of [[statin]]s and occasionally [[beta blocker]]s. Ultrasound studies are obtained on a regular basis (i.e. every six or 12 months) to follow the size of the aneurysm.\n\n===Surgery===\nDecisions about repairing an aortic aneurysm are based on the balance between the risk of aneurysm rupture without treatment versus the risks of the treatment itself. For example, a small aneurysm in an elderly patient with severe [[cardiovascular disease]] would not be repaired. The chance of the small aneurysm rupturing is overshadowed by the risk of cardiac complications from the procedure to repair the aneurysm.\n\nThe risk of the repair procedure is two-fold. First, there is consideration of the risk of problems occurring during and immediately after the procedure itself (\"peri-procedural\" complications). Second, the effectiveness of the procedure must be taken into account, namely whether the procedure effectively protects the patient from aneurysm rupture over the long-term, and whether the procedure is durable so that secondary procedures, with their attendant risks, are not necessary over the life of the patient. These issues attain importance and should be considered when making a choice between different treatment options. A less invasive procedure (such as [[endovascular aneurysm repair]]) may be associated with fewer short-term risks to the patient (fewer peri-procedural complications) but secondary procedures may be necessary over long-term follow-up.\n\nThe definitive treatment for an aortic aneurysm may be surgical or endovascular repair.  The determination of surgical intervention is complex and determined on a per-case basis.  Risk of aneurysm rupture is weighed against procedural risk.  The diameter of the aneurysm, its rate of growth, the presence or absence of [[Marfan syndrome]], [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndromes]] or similar connective tissue disorders, and other [[co-morbidities]]  are all important factors in the overall treatment.\n\nA rapidly expanding aneurysm should under normal circumstances be operated on as soon as feasible, as it has a greater chance of rupture. Slowly expanding aortic aneurysms may be followed by routine diagnostic testing (i.e.: [[CT scan]] or [[ultrasound]] imaging).\n\nFor abdominal aneurysms, the current treatment guidelines for abdominal aortic aneurysms suggest elective surgical repair when the diameter of the aneurysm is greater than {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}}. However, recent data on patients aged 60\u201376 suggest medical management for abdominal aneurysms with a diameter of less than {{convert|5.5|cm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)10137-X |title=Mortality results for randomised controlled trial of early elective surgery or ultrasonographic surveillance for small abdominal aortic aneurysms |journal=The Lancet |volume=352 |issue=9141 |pages=1649\u20131655 |year=1998 |pmid=9853436 }}</ref>\n\n====Open surgery====\n{{main|Open aortic surgery}}\nOpen surgery starts with exposure of the dilated portion of the aorta via an incision in the abdomen or abdomen and chest, followed by insertion of a synthetic ([[Dacron]] or [[Gore-Tex]]) graft (tube) to replace the diseased aorta. The graft is sewn in by hand to the non-diseased portions of the aorta, and the aneurysmal sac is closed around the graft.\n\nThe aorta and its branching arteries are cross-clamped during open surgery.

Article 87.3 says, \"An organic law will regulate the forms of exercise and requisites for a popular initiative for the presentation of propositions of law. In all cases, no fewer that 500,000 accredited signatures will be required. There shall be no such initiative in matters proper to organic law, treaties or laws of international character, nor in relation to the prerogative of mercy.\"<ref>''\"Una ley org\u00e1nica regular\u00e1 las formas de ejercicio y requisitos de la iniciativa popular para la presentaci\u00f3n de proposiciones de ley.

The relation of organic law with ordinary law is not a hierarchical relationship but one of ''competency'' (scope).<ref>L. Prakke, C. A. J. M. Kortmann, and J. C.
