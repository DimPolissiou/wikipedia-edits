The neurons in each cortex are selectively pruned, leaving connections that are made with the functionally appropriate processing centers. Therefore, the neurons in the [[visual cortex]] prune the synapses with neurons in the spinal cord, and the [[motor cortex]] severs connections with the superior colliculus. This variation of pruning is known as large-scaled stereotyped axon pruning. Neurons send long axon branches to appropriate and inappropriate target areas, and the inappropriate connections are eventually pruned away.<ref name=\"vander_1\">{{cite journal |last1=Vanderhaeghen|first1=P. |last2=Cheng|first2=HJ. |year=2010|title=Guidance Molecules in Axon Pruning and Cell Death |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology |volume=2|issue=6|pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a001859 |pmid=20516131 |pmc=2869516}}</ref>\n\nRegressive events refine the abundance of connections, seen in [[neurogenesis]], to create a specific and mature circuitry. [[Apoptosis]] and pruning are the two main methods of severing the undesired connections. In apoptosis, the neuron is killed and all connections associated with the neuron are also eliminated. In contrast, the neuron does not die in pruning, but requires the retraction of [[axon]]s from synaptic connections that are not functionally appropriate.\n\nIt is believed that the purpose of synaptic pruning is to remove unnecessary neuronal structures from the brain; as the human brain develops, the need to understand more complex structures becomes much more pertinent, and simpler associations formed at childhood are thought to be replaced by complex structures.<ref name=\"chechik_1\">{{cite journal |last1=Chechik|first1=Gal |last2=Meilijison|first2=Isaac |last3=Ruppin|first3=Eytan |year=1999|title=Neuronal Regulation: a mechanism for synaptic pruning during brain maturation|journal=Neural Computation|volume=11|issue=8|pages=2061\u201380|pmid=10578044 |doi=10.1162/089976699300016089|citeseerx=10.1.1.33.5048 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact it has several connotations with regulation of cognitive childhood development, pruning is thought to be a process of removing neurons which may have become damaged or degraded in order to further improve the \"networking\" capacity of a particular area of the brain.<ref name=\"chechik_1\" /> Furthermore, it has been stipulated that the mechanism not only works in regard to development and reparation, but also as a means of continually maintaining more efficient brain function by removing neurons by their synaptic efficiency.<ref name=\"chechik_1\" />\n\n=== Pruning in the maturing brain ===\nThe pruning that is associated with learning is known as small-scale axon terminal arbor pruning. Axons extend short axon terminal arbors toward neurons within a target area. Certain terminal arbors are pruned by competition. The selection of the pruned terminal arbors follow the \"use it or lose it\" principle seen in [[synaptic plasticity]]. This means synapses that are frequently used have strong connections while the rarely used synapses are eliminated. Examples seen in vertebrate include pruning of axon terminals in the [[neuromuscular junction]] in the [[peripheral nervous system]] and the pruning of [[climbing fiber]] inputs to the cerebellum in the [[central nervous system]].<ref name=\"vander_1\" />\n\nIn terms of humans, synaptic pruning has been observed through the inference of differences in the estimated numbers of [[glial cell]]s and neurons between children and adults, which differs greatly in the [[Medial dorsal nucleus|mediodorsal thalamic nucleus]].\n\nIn a study conducted in 2007 by [[Oxford University]], researchers compared 8 newborn human brains with those of 8 adults using estimates based upon size and evidence gathered from [[stereology|stereological]] [[fractionator|fractionation]]. They showed that, on average, estimates of adult neuron populations were 41% lower than those of the newborns in the region they measured, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.<ref name=\"abitz_p1\">{{cite journal |author=Abitz, Damgaard| year=2007|title=Excess of neurons in the human newborn mediodorsal thalamus compared with that of the adult |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=17|issue=11|pages=2573\u20132578 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhl163 |pmid=17218480|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in terms of glial cells, adults had far larger estimates than those in newborns; 36.3 million on average in adult brains, compared to 10.6 million in the newborn samples.<ref name=\"abitz_p1\" /> The structure of the brain is thought to change when [[Degenerative disease|degeneration]] and deafferentation occur in postnatal situations, although these phenomena have not been observed in some studies.<ref name=\"abitz_p1\" /> In the case of development, neurons which are in the process of loss via programmed cell death are unlikely to be re-used, but rather replaced by new neuronal structures or synaptic structures, and have been found to occur alongside the structural change in the sub-cortical [[gray matter]].\n\nSynaptic pruning is classified separately from the regressive events seen during older ages. While developmental pruning is experience dependent, the deteriorating connections that are synonymous with old age are not. The stereotyped pruning can be compared to the process of chiseling and molding of stone into a statue. Once the statue is complete, the weather will begin to erode the statue and this represents the experience-independent deletion of connections.\n\n===Forgetting problems with learning through pruning===\nAll attempts to construct [[artificial intelligence]] systems that learn by pruning connections that are disused have the problem that every time they learn something new, they [[catastrophic interference|forget everything they learned before]]. Since biological brains follow the same laws of physics as artificial intelligences, as all physical objects do, these researchers argue that if biological brains learned by pruning they would face the same catastrophic forgetting issues. This is pointed out as an especially severe problem if the learning is supposed to be part of a developmental process since retention of older knowledge is necessary for developmental types of learning, and as such it is argued that synaptic pruning cannot be a mechanism of mental development. It is argued that developmental types of learning must use other mechanisms that do not rely on synaptic pruning.<ref>John R. Riesenberg (2000). \"Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks\"</ref><ref>Gul Muhammad Khan (2017). \"Evolution of Artificial Neural Development: In search of learning genes\"</ref>\n\n==Energy saving for reproduction and discontinuous differences==\nOne theory of why many brains are synaptically pruned when a human or other primate grows up is that maintenance of synapses consume [[nutrient]]s which may be needed elsewhere in the body during growth and sexual maturation. This theory presupposes no mental function of synaptic pruning. The empirical observation that human brains fall into two distinct categories, one that reduces synaptic density by about 41% while growing up and another synaptically [[neoteny|neotenic]] type in which there is very little to no reduction of synaptic density, but no continuum between them, is explainable by this theory as an adaptation to physiologies with different nutritional needs in which one type needs to free up nutrients to get through puberty while the other can mature sexually by other redirections of nutrients that do not involve reducing the brain's consumtion of nutrients. Citing that most of the nutrient costs in the brain are in maintaining the brain cells and their synapses, rather than the firing itself, this theory explains the observation that some brains appear to continue pruning years after sexual maturation as a result of some brains having more robust synapses, allowing them to take years of neglect before the synaptic spines finally disintegrate. Another hypothesis that can explain the discontinuity is that of limited functional genetic space restricted by the fact that most of the human genome needs to lack sequence-specific functions to avoid too many deletirious mutations, predicting that evolution proceeds by a few of the mutations happening to have large effects while most mutations do not have any effects at all.<ref>Stanislas Dehaene (2014). \"Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts\"</ref><ref>P. Michael Conn (2011).\"Handbook of Models for Human Aging\" </ref>\n\n==Mechanisms==\nThe three models explaining synaptic pruning are axon degeneration, axon retraction, and axon shedding.  In all cases, the [[synapses]] are formed by a transient [[axon terminal]], and synapse elimination is caused by the axon pruning. Each model offers a different method in which the axon is removed to delete the synapse. In small-scale axon arbor pruning, neural activity is thought to be an important regulator,{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs support from a reliable source|date=March 2013}} but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. [[Hormones]] and [[trophic factor]]s are thought to be the main extrinsic factors regulating large-scale stereotyped axon pruning.<ref name=\"vander_1\" />\n\n===Axon degeneration===\nIn ''[[Drosophila]]'', there are extensive changes made to the nervous system during [[metamorphosis]]. Metamorphosis is triggered by [[ecdysone]], and during this period, extensive pruning and reorganization of the neural network occurs. Therefore, it is theorized that pruning in ''Drosophila'' is triggered by the activation of ecdysone receptors. [[Denervation]] studies at the neuromuscular junction of vertebrates have shown that the axon removal mechanism closely resembles [[Wallerian degeneration]].<ref name=\"low_1\">{{cite journal |last1=Low|first1=LK. |last2=Cheng|first2=HJ. |year=2006|title=Axon pruning: an essential step underlying the developmental plasticity of neuronal connections|journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|volume=361|issue=1473 |pages=1531\u20131544|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1883|pmid=16939973 |pmc=1664669}}</ref> However, the global and simultaneous pruning seen in ''Drosophilia'' differs from the mammalian nervous system pruning, which occurs locally and over multiple stages of development.<ref name=\"vander_1\" />\n\n===Axon retraction===\nAxon branches retract in a [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] to [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] manner. The axonal contents that are retracted are thought to be recycled to other parts of the axon. The biological mechanism with which axonal pruning occurs still remains unclear for the mammalian central nervous system. However, pruning has been associated with guidance molecules in mice. Guidance molecules serve to control axon pathfinding through repulsion, and also initiate pruning of exuberant synaptic connections. [[Semaphorin]] [[ligands]] and the receptors [[neuropilins]] and [[plexins]] are used to induce retraction of the axons to initiate hippocampo-septal and infrapyramidal bundle (IPB) pruning. Stereotyped pruning of the hippocampal projections have been found to be significantly impaired in mice that have a Plexin-A3 defect.  Specifically, axons that are connected to a transient target will retract once the Plexin-A3 receptors are activated by class 3 semaphorin ligands.  In IPB, the expression of mRNA for Sema3F is present in the [[hippocampus]] prenatally, lost postnatally and returns in the [[stratum oriens]]. Coincidentally, onset IPB pruning occurs around the same time. In the case of the hippocampal-septal projections, expression of mRNA for Sema3A was followed by the initiation of pruning after 3 days. This suggests that pruning is triggered once the ligand reaches threshold protein levels within a few days after detectable [[mRNA]] expression.<ref name=\"bagri_1\">{{cite journal |last1=Bagri|first1=Anil |last2=Cheng|first2=Hwai-Jong |last3=Yaron|first3=Avraham |last4=Pleasure|first4=Samuel J. |last5=Tessier-Lavigne|first5=Marc\n |year=2003 |title=Stereotyped Pruning of Long Hippocampal Axon Branches Triggered by Retraction Inducers of the Semaphorin Family |journal=Cell |volume=113|issue=3|pages=285\u2013299 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00267-8 |pmid=12732138}}</ref> Pruning of axons along the visual [[corticospinal tract]]  (CST) is defective in neuropilin-2 mutants and plexin-A3 and plexin-A4 double mutant mice.

[[Ephrin]] and the [[ephrin receptor]]s, Eph, have been found to regulate and direct retinal axon branches. Forward signaling between Ephrin-A and EphA, along the [[anterior]]-[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] axis, has been found to inhibit retinal axon branch formation posterior to a terminal zone. The forward signaling also promotes pruning of the axons that have reached into the terminal zone. However, it remains unclear whether the retraction mechanism seen in IPB pruning is applied in retinal axons.<ref name=\"Luo_1\">{{cite journal |last1=Luo|first1=L. |last2=Flanagan|first2=G |year=2007 |title=Development of Continuous and Discrete Neural Maps |journal=Neuron |volume=56|issue=2|pages=284\u2013300 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.10.014|pmid=17964246 }}</ref>\n\nReverse signaling between ephrin-B proteins and their Eph [[receptor tyrosine kinases]] have been found to initiate the retraction mechanism in the IPB. Ephrin-B3 is observed to transduce tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent reverse signals into hippocampal axons that trigger pruning of excessive IPB fibers.

The neurons in each cortex are selectively pruned, leaving connections that are made with the functionally appropriate processing centers. Therefore, the neurons in the [[visual cortex]] prune the synapses with neurons in the spinal cord, and the [[motor cortex]] severs connections with the superior colliculus. This variation of pruning is known as large-scaled stereotyped axon pruning. Neurons send long axon branches to appropriate and inappropriate target areas, and the inappropriate connections are eventually pruned away.<ref name=\"vander_1\">{{cite journal |last1=Vanderhaeghen|first1=P. |last2=Cheng|first2=HJ. |year=2010|title=Guidance Molecules in Axon Pruning and Cell Death |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology |volume=2|issue=6|pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a001859 |pmid=20516131 |pmc=2869516}}</ref>\n\nRegressive events refine the abundance of connections, seen in [[neurogenesis]], to create a specific and mature circuitry.

In contrast, the neuron does not die in pruning, but requires the retraction of [[axon]]s from synaptic connections that are not functionally appropriate.\n\nIt is believed that the purpose of synaptic pruning is to remove unnecessary neuronal structures from the brain; as the human brain develops, the need to understand more complex structures becomes much more pertinent, and simpler associations formed at childhood are thought to be replaced by complex structures.<ref name=\"chechik_1\">{{cite journal |last1=Chechik|first1=Gal |last2=Meilijison|first2=Isaac |last3=Ruppin|first3=Eytan |year=1999|title=Neuronal Regulation: a mechanism for synaptic pruning during brain maturation|journal=Neural Computation|volume=11|issue=8|pages=2061\u201380|pmid=10578044 |doi=10.1162/089976699300016089|citeseerx=10.1.1.33.5048 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact it has several connotations with regulation of cognitive childhood development, pruning is thought to be a process of removing neurons which may have become damaged or degraded in order to further improve the \"networking\" capacity of a particular area of the brain.<ref name=\"chechik_1\" /> Furthermore, it has been stipulated that the mechanism not only works in regard to development and reparation, but also as a means of continually maintaining more efficient brain function by removing neurons by their synaptic efficiency.<ref name=\"chechik_1\" />\n\n=== Pruning in the maturing brain ===\nThe pruning that is associated with learning is known as small-scale axon terminal arbor pruning. Axons extend short axon terminal arbors toward neurons within a target area. Certain terminal arbors are pruned by competition. The selection of the pruned terminal arbors follow the \"use it or lose it\" principle seen in [[synaptic plasticity]]. This means synapses that are frequently used have strong connections while the rarely used synapses are eliminated. Examples seen in vertebrate include pruning of axon terminals in the [[neuromuscular junction]] in the [[peripheral nervous system]] and the pruning of [[climbing fiber]] inputs to the cerebellum in the [[central nervous system]].<ref name=\"vander_1\" />\n\nIn terms of humans, synaptic pruning has been observed through the inference of differences in the estimated numbers of [[glial cell]]s and neurons between children and adults, which differs greatly in the [[Medial dorsal nucleus|mediodorsal thalamic nucleus]].\n\nIn a study conducted in 2007 by [[Oxford University]], researchers compared 8 newborn human brains with those of 8 adults using estimates based upon size and evidence gathered from [[stereology|stereological]] [[fractionator|fractionation]].

While developmental pruning is experience dependent, the deteriorating connections that are synonymous with old age are not. The stereotyped pruning can be compared to the process of chiseling and molding of stone into a statue. Once the statue is complete, the weather will begin to erode the statue and this represents the experience-independent deletion of connections.\n\n===Forgetting problems with learning through pruning===\nAll attempts to construct [[artificial intelligence]] systems that learn by pruning connections that are disused have the problem that every time they learn something new, they [[catastrophic interference|forget everything they learned before]]. Since biological brains follow the same laws of physics as artificial intelligences, as all physical objects do, these researchers argue that if biological brains learned by pruning they would face the same catastrophic forgetting issues. This is pointed out as an especially severe problem if the learning is supposed to be part of a developmental process since retention of older knowledge is necessary for developmental types of learning, and as such it is argued that synaptic pruning cannot be a mechanism of mental development. It is argued that developmental types of learning must use other mechanisms that do not rely on synaptic pruning.<ref>John R. Riesenberg (2000). \"Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks\"</ref><ref>Gul Muhammad Khan (2017). \"Evolution of Artificial Neural Development: In search of learning genes\"</ref>\n\n==Energy saving for reproduction and discontinuous differences==\nOne theory of why many brains are synaptically pruned when a human or other primate grows up is that maintenance of synapses consume [[nutrient]]s which may be needed elsewhere in the body during growth and sexual maturation. This theory presupposes no mental function of synaptic pruning. The empirical observation that human brains fall into two distinct categories, one that reduces synaptic density by about 41% while growing up and another synaptically [[neoteny|neotenic]] type in which there is very little to no reduction of synaptic density, but no continuum between them, is explainable by this theory as an adaptation to physiologies with different nutritional needs in which one type needs to free up nutrients to get through puberty while the other can mature sexually by other redirections of nutrients that do not involve reducing the brain's consumtion of nutrients. Citing that most of the nutrient costs in the brain are in maintaining the brain cells and their synapses, rather than the firing itself, this theory explains the observation that some brains appear to continue pruning years after sexual maturation as a result of some brains having more robust synapses, allowing them to take years of neglect before the synaptic spines finally disintegrate. Another hypothesis that can explain the discontinuity is that of limited functional genetic space restricted by the fact that most of the human genome needs to lack sequence-specific functions to avoid too many deletirious mutations, predicting that evolution proceeds by a few of the mutations happening to have large effects while most mutations do not have any effects at all.<ref>Stanislas Dehaene (2014). \"Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts\"</ref><ref>P. Michael Conn (2011).\"Handbook of Models for Human Aging\" </ref>\n\n==Mechanisms==\nThe three models explaining synaptic pruning are axon degeneration, axon retraction, and axon shedding.  In all cases, the [[synapses]] are formed by a transient [[axon terminal]], and synapse elimination is caused by the axon pruning. Each model offers a different method in which the axon is removed to delete the synapse. In small-scale axon arbor pruning, neural activity is thought to be an important regulator,{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs support from a reliable source|date=March 2013}} but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. [[Hormones]] and [[trophic factor]]s are thought to be the main extrinsic factors regulating large-scale stereotyped axon pruning.<ref name=\"vander_1\" />\n\n===Axon degeneration===\nIn ''[[Drosophila]]'', there are extensive changes made to the nervous system during [[metamorphosis]]. Metamorphosis is triggered by [[ecdysone]], and during this period, extensive pruning and reorganization of the neural network occurs. Therefore, it is theorized that pruning in ''Drosophila'' is triggered by the activation of ecdysone receptors. [[Denervation]] studies at the neuromuscular junction of vertebrates have shown that the axon removal mechanism closely resembles [[Wallerian degeneration]].<ref name=\"low_1\">{{cite journal |last1=Low|first1=LK. |last2=Cheng|first2=HJ. |year=2006|title=Axon pruning: an essential step underlying the developmental plasticity of neuronal connections|journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|volume=361|issue=1473 |pages=1531\u20131544|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1883|pmid=16939973 |pmc=1664669}}</ref> However, the global and simultaneous pruning seen in Drosophilia differs from the mammalian nervous system pruning, which occurs locally and over multiple stages of development.<ref name=\"vander_1\" />\n\n===Axon retraction===\nAxon branches retract in a [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] to [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] manner. The axonal contents that are retracted are thought to be recycled to other parts of the axon. The biological mechanism with which axonal pruning occurs still remains unclear for the mammalian central nervous system. However, pruning has been associated with guidance molecules in mice. Guidance molecules serve to control axon pathfinding through repulsion, and also initiate pruning of exuberant synaptic connections. [[Semaphorin]] [[ligands]] and the receptors [[neuropilins]] and [[plexins]] are used to induce retraction of the axons to initiate hippocampo-septal and infrapyramidal bundle (IPB) pruning. Stereotyped pruning of the hippocampal projections have been found to be significantly impaired in mice that have a Plexin-A3 defect.  Specifically, axons that are connected to a transient target will retract once the Plexin-A3 receptors are activated by class 3 semaphorin ligands.  In IPB, the expression of mRNA for Sema3F is present in the [[hippocampus]] prenatally, lost postnatally and returns in the [[stratum oriens]]. Coincidentally, onset IPB pruning occurs around the same time. In the case of the hippocampal-septal projections, expression of mRNA for Sema3A was followed by the initiation of pruning after 3 days. This suggests that pruning is triggered once the ligand reaches threshold protein levels within a few days after detectable [[mRNA]] expression.<ref name=\"bagri_1\">{{cite journal |last1=Bagri|first1=Anil |last2=Cheng|first2=Hwai-Jong |last3=Yaron|first3=Avraham |last4=Pleasure|first4=Samuel J. |last5=Tessier-Lavigne|first5=Marc\n |year=2003 |title=Stereotyped Pruning of Long Hippocampal Axon Branches Triggered by Retraction Inducers of the Semaphorin Family |journal=Cell |volume=113|issue=3|pages=285\u2013299 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00267-8 |pmid=12732138}}</ref> Pruning of axons along the visual [[corticospinal tract]]  (CST) is defective in neuropilin-2 mutants and plexin-A3 and plexin-A4 double mutant mice.

[[Ephrin]] and the [[ephrin receptor]]s, Eph, have been found to regulate and direct retinal axon branches. Forward signaling between Ephrin-A and EphA, along the [[anterior]]-[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] axis, has been found to inhibit retinal axon branch formation posterior to a terminal zone. The forward signaling also promotes pruning of the axons that have reached into the terminal zone.

When applying the same hypothesis to surrounding four villages (also named with Dhab prefix), it is notable that all those villages hold minimum of one \"Dhab\" or pond which provides an evidence that four villages are named after existence of one or more natural pond (Dhab) around them.\n\n==People==\n\n===Occupation===\n[[File:Dhab Kalan The Chappar.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|A view of the village ''Dhab Kalan''.]]\nMost of the people are formers by occupation but new generation have trend towards government and private services.
