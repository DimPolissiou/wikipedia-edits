Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]] at the 2010 census, making Bangkok the nation's [[primate city]], dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.\n\nBangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the 15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] in 1768 and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe [[Tiger Cub Economies|Asian investment boom]] in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care, and has emerged as a centre for the arts, fashion, and entertainment. The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its [[red-light district]]s. The [[Grand Palace]] and [[Buddhist temple]]s including [[Wat Arun]] and [[Wat Pho]] stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of [[Khaosan Road]] and [[Patpong]]. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations, and has been named the world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.\n\nBangkok's rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure. An inadequate road network, despite an extensive [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]], together with substantial private car usage, have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion, which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem. Five rapid transit lines are now in operation, with more systems under construction or planned by the national government and the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Bangkok}}\n[[File:La Loubere map of Bangkok (English).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An engraved map titled &quot;A Map of Bancock&quot;, showing a walled settlement on the west of a river, and a fort on the east|Map of 17th-century Bangkok, from [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]]'s ''Du Royaume de Siam'']]\n\nThe history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, when it was a village on the west bank of the [[Chao Phraya River]], under the rule of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]].<ref name=\"Tipawan\"/> Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance. Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of [[Siege of Bangkok|a siege in 1688]] in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the [[Konbaung dynasty|Burmese Empire]] in 1767, the newly crowned King [[Taksin]] established his capital at the town, which became the base of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. In 1782, King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] (Rama I) succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank's [[Rattanakosin Island]], thus founding the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]. The [[City Pillar]] was erected on 21 April 1782, which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\nBangkok's economy gradually expanded through international trade, first with China, then with Western merchants returning in the early-to-mid 19th century. As the capital, Bangkok was the centre of Siam's modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late-19th century. The reigns of Kings [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV, 1851\u201368) and [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V, 1868\u20131910) saw the introduction of the steam engine, printing press, rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city, as well as formal education and healthcare. Bangkok became the centre stage for power struggles between the military and political elite as the country [[Siamese revolution of 1932|abolished absolute monarchy in 1932]].\n\n[[File:View of the city of Bangkok 1822.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of the city from British diplomat [[John Crawfurd]]'s embassy in 1822]]\nAs Thailand allied with Japan [[Thailand in World War II|in World War II]], Bangkok was subjected to [[Bombing of Bangkok in World War II|Allied bombing]], but rapidly grew in the post-war period as a result of US aid and government-sponsored investment. Bangkok's role as a US military [[R&R (military)|R&R]] destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination. Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and migration from rural areas into Bangkok; its population surged from 1.8&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million in the 1960s.\n\nFollowing the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok.<ref>Baker & Pongpaichit 2005, pp. 37\u201341, 45, 52\u201371, 149\u2013150, 162, 199\u2013204.</ref> Rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s, until it was stalled by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. By then, many public and social issues had emerged, among them the strain on infrastructure reflected in the city's notorious traffic jams. Bangkok's role as the nation's political stage continues to be seen in strings of popular protests, from the student uprisings in [[14 October 1973 uprising|1973]] and [[Thammasat University massacre|1976]], anti-military demonstrations [[Black May (1992)|in 1992]], and successive anti-government demonstrations by opposing groups from 2008 on.\n\nAdministration of the city was first formalized by King Chulalongkorn in 1906, with the establishment of [[Monthon]] Krung Thep Phra Maha Nakhon ({{lang|th|\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23}}) as a national subdivision. In 1915 the ''monthon'' was split into several provinces, the administrative boundaries of which have since further changed. The city in its current form was created in 1972 with the formation of the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA), following the merger of Phra Nakhon Province on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and Thonburi Province on the west during the previous year.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\n==Name==\nThe origin of the name ''Bangkok'' ({{lang|th|\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e01}}, pronounced in Thai as {{IPA-th|b\u0101\u02d0\u014b k\u0254\u0300\u02d0k||Th-Bangkok.ogg}}), is unclear.

Although [[urban planning]] policies date back to the commission of the \"Litchfield Plan\" in 1960, which set out strategies for land use, transportation and general infrastructure improvements, zoning regulations were not fully implemented until 1992. As a result, the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion, both horizontally as [[ribbon development]]s extended along newly built roads, and vertically, with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in commercial areas.<ref>{{cite book|first=Medhi |last=Krongkaew |chapter=The changing urban system in a fast-growing city and economy: The case of Bangkok and Thailand |editor1-first=Fu-chen |editor1-last=Lo |editor2-first=Yue-man |editor2-last=Yeung |title=Emerging World Cities in Pacific Asia |publisher=United Nations University Press |year=1996|isbn=978-92-808-0907-7|page=322}}</ref> The city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces. The highly populated and growing cities of [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]], [[Pak Kret]], [[Rangsit (city)|Rangsit]] and [[Mueang Samut Prakan District|Samut Prakan]] are effectively now suburbs of Bangkok. Nevertheless, large agricultural areas remain within the city proper at its eastern and western fringes.

It is the site of the Grand Palace and the City Pillar Shrine, primary symbols of the city's founding, as well as important Buddhist temples. Phra Nakhon, along with the neighbouring Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong Districts, formed what was the city proper in the late 19th century. Many traditional neighbourhoods and markets are found here, including the Chinese settlement of Sampheng. The city was expanded toward Dusit District in the early 19th century, following King Chulalongkorn's relocation of the royal household to the new [[Dusit Palace]]. The buildings of the palace, including the neoclassical [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]], as well as the [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] and [[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] which leads to it from the Grand Palace, reflect the heavy influence of European architecture at the time. Major government offices line the avenue, as does the [[Democracy Monument]]. The area is the site of the country's seat of power as well as the city's most popular tourist landmarks.\n\n[[File:View from Baiyoke Sky Hotel, Bangkok (7053110333) cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=A lot of high-rise buildings|The [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] area appears as a sea of high-rise buildings from [[Baiyoke Tower II]], the third-tallest building in Bangkok.]]\n\nIn contrast with the low-rise historic areas, the business district on [[Si Lom Road|Si Lom]] and [[Sathon Road|Sathon]] Roads in Bang Rak and Sathon Districts teems with skyscrapers. It is the site of many of the country's major corporate headquarters, but also of some of the city's [[red-light district]]s. The [[Siam area|Siam]] and [[Ratchaprasong]] areas in Pathum Wan are home to some of the largest shopping malls in [[Southeast Asia]]. Numerous retail outlets and hotels also stretch along [[Sukhumvit Road]] leading southeast through Watthana and Khlong Toei Districts. More office towers line the streets branching off Sukhumvit, especially [[Asok Montri Road|Asok Montri]], while upmarket housing is found in many of its [[soi|''soi''s]] ('alley' or 'lane').\n\nBangkok lacks a single distinct [[central business district]]. Instead, the areas of Siam and Ratchaprasong serve as a \"central shopping district\" containing many of the bigger malls and commercial areas in the city, as well as [[Siam Station]], the only transfer point between the city's two elevated train lines.<ref name=\"McGrath CSD\">{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1= Brian |editor1-last= Benites |editor1-first= Cecilia |editor2-last= Lyster |editor2-first= Clare |title= Regarding Public Space |date=2005 |publisher= Princeton Architectural Press |location= New York|isbn= 9781568985442 |pages=46\u201353 |chapter= Bangkok's CSD}}</ref> The [[Victory Monument (Bangkok)|Victory Monument]] in Ratchathewi District is among its most important road junctions, serving over 100 bus lines as well as an elevated train station.

Most of the high-density development areas are within the {{convert|113|km2|adj=on}} area encircled by the [[Ratchadaphisek Road|Ratchadaphisek]] inner ring road. Ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets, and office buildings also cluster around Ratchayothin Intersection in Chatuchak District to the north. Farther from the city centre, most areas are primarily mid- or low-density residential. The Thonburi side of the city is less developed, with fewer high rises. With the exception of a few secondary urban centres, Thonburi, in the same manner as the outlying eastern districts, consists mostly of residential and rural areas.\n\nWhile most of Bangkok's streets are fronted by vernacular [[shophouse]]s, the largely unrestricted building euphoria of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban area of skyscrapers and high rises of contrasting and clashing styles.<ref>Hamilton 2000, pp.&nbsp;465\u2013466.</ref> There are 581 skyscrapers over {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} tall in the city.

Royal palaces and temples as well as several museums constitute its major historical and cultural tourist attractions. Shopping and dining experiences offer a wide range of choices and prices. The city is also famous for its dynamic nightlife. Although Bangkok's [[sex tourism]] scene is well known to foreigners, it is usually not openly acknowledged by locals or the government.\n\n[[File:Khao San Road at night by kevinpoh.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Night scene on a pedestrian street, with many people and street vendors; shops along the street bearing brightly lit signs with names like &quot;99Fashion&quot;, &quot;Brick Bar&quot;, &quot;Mulligans Irish Bar&quot;, and Pepsi and McDonald&#39;s logos|[[Khao San Road]] is lined by budget accommodation, shops and bars catering to tourists.]]\nAmong Bangkok's well-known sights are the Grand Palace and major Buddhist temples, including [[Wat Phra Kaew]], [[Wat Pho]], and [[Wat Arun]]. The [[Giant Swing]] and [[Erawan Shrine]] demonstrate Hinduism's deep-rooted influence in Thai culture. [[Vimanmek Mansion]] in Dusit Palace is famous as the world's largest teak building, while the [[Jim Thompson House]] provides an example of traditional [[Thai architecture]]. Other major museums include the [[Bangkok National Museum]] and the [[Royal Barge National Museum]]. Cruises and boat trips on the Chao Phraya and Thonburi's canals offer views of some of the city's traditional architecture and ways of life on the waterfront.<ref>Thavisin et al. (eds) 2006, pp.&nbsp;63\u201369.</ref>\n\nShopping venues, many of which are popular with both tourists and locals, range from the shopping centres and department stores concentrated in Siam and Ratchaprasong to the sprawling [[Chatuchak Weekend Market]]. [[Taling Chan Floating Market]] is among the few such markets in Bangkok. Yaowarat is known for its shops as well as street-side food stalls and restaurants, which are also found throughout the city. [[Khao San Road]] has long been famous as a destination for [[backpacker tourism]], with its budget accommodation, shops and bars attracting visitors from all over the world.\n\nBangkok has a reputation overseas as a major destination in the sex industry. Although [[Prostitution in Thailand|prostitution is technically illegal]] and is rarely openly discussed in Thailand, it commonly takes place among massage parlours, saunas and hourly hotels, serving foreign tourists as well as locals. Bangkok has acquired the nickname \"Sin City of Asia\" for its level of sex tourism.<ref name=\"EmmonsEveland2011\">{{cite book|last1=Emmons|first1=Ron|last2=Eveland|first2=Jennifer|last3=White|first3=Daniel|title=Frommer's Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OnMMOZhn54C&pg=PA79|accessdate=8 April 2012|date=28 June 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00979-6|page=79}}</ref>\n\nIssues often encountered by foreign tourists include scams, overcharging and dual pricing.

The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. [[Conspicuous consumption]] serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts.<ref>Hamilton 2000, p.&nbsp;468.</ref> Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.\n\nA distinct feature of Bangkok is the ubiquity of [[street vendor]]s selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It has been estimated that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Street Vendors in Asia: A Review|first=Sharit K |last=Bhowmik |journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=28 May \u2013 4 June 2005 |pages=2256\u20132264}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, however, the BMA, with support from the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (Thailand's ruling military junta), began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space. Many famous market neighbourhoods were affected, including [[Khlong Thom, Bangkok|Khlong Thom]], [[Saphan Lek]], and the flower market at [[Pak Khlong Talat]]. Nearly 15,000 vendors were evicted from 39 public areas in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nualkhair|first1=Chawadee|title=Bangkok's street food under threat from gentrification|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/feb/12/bangkok-street-food-stalls-under-threat|accessdate=13 February 2017|work=The Guardian|date=12 February 2017}}</ref> While some applauded the efforts to focus on pedestrian rights, others have expressed concern that [[gentrification]] would lead to the loss of the city's character and adverse changes to people's way of life.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mokkhasen|first1=Sasiwan|title=Vanishing Bangkok: What is the Capital Being Remade Into, And For Whom?|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/bangkok/2016/07/05/reorganization/|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=Khaosod English|date=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Sauers|first1=Craig|title=Bangkok's disappearing street food|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160817-bangkoks-disappearing-street-food|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=BBC Travel|date=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Festivals and events===\n[[File:Ratchadamnoen King80 arch.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An elaborate double archway above a road, with pictures of King Bhumibol Adulyadej; trees decorated with lights|[[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] is annually decorated with lights and displays in celebration of [[King Bhumibol]]'s birthday.]]\nThe residents of Bangkok celebrate many of Thailand's annual festivals. During [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] on 13\u201315 April, traditional rituals as well as water fights take place throughout the city. [[Loi Krathong]], usually in November, is accompanied by the Golden Mount Fair. New Year celebrations take place at many venues, the most prominent being the plaza in front of [[CentralWorld]]. Observances related to the royal family are held primarily in Bangkok. Wreaths are laid at King Chulalongkorn's equestrian statue in the Royal Plaza on 23 October, which is King Chulalongkorn Memorial Day. The present king's and queen's birthdays, respectively on 5 December and 12 August, are marked as Thailand's national Father's Day and national Mother's Day. These national holidays are celebrated by royal audiences on the day's eve, in which the king or queen gives a speech, and public gatherings on the day of the observance. The king's birthday is also marked by the [[Thai Royal Guards parade|Royal Guards' parade]].\n\n[[Sanam Luang]] is the site of the Thai Kite, Sport and Music Festival, usually held in March, and the [[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]] which takes place in May. The Red Cross Fair at the beginning of April is held at Suan Amporn and the Royal Plaza, and features numerous booths offering goods, games and exhibits. The [[Chinese New Year]] (January\u2013February) and [[Vegetarian Festival]] (September\u2013October) are celebrated widely by the Chinese community, especially in Yaowarat.<ref>Thavisin et al.

All six national terrestrial channels, Channels [[Channel 3 (Thailand)|3]], [[Channel 5 (Thailand)|5]] and [[Channel 7 (Thailand)|7]], [[Modernine TV|Modernine]], [[National Broadcasting Services of Thailand Television|NBT]] and [[Thai PBS]], have headquarters and main studios in the capital. With the exception of local news segments broadcast by the NBT, all programming is done in Bangkok and repeated throughout the provinces. However, this centralised model is weakening with the rise of cable television, which has many local providers. There are numerous cable and satellite [[List of television stations in Bangkok|channels based in Bangkok]]. [[TrueVisions]] is the major subscription television provider in Bangkok and Thailand, and it also carries international programming. Bangkok was home to 40 of Thailand's 311 FM radio stations and 38 of its 212 AM stations in 2002.<ref name=\"Kavi\"/> Broadcast media reform stipulated by the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] has been progressing slowly, although many community radio stations have emerged in the city.\n\nLikewise, Bangkok has dominated the [[Thai film industry]] since its inception. Although film settings normally feature locations throughout the country, the city is home to all major film studios. Bangkok has dozens of [[List of cinemas in Thailand|cinemas and multiplexes]], and the city hosts two major film festivals annually, the [[Bangkok International Film Festival]] and the [[World Film Festival of Bangkok]].\n\n===Art===\n[[File:BKK Art and Culture Centre (II).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A modern-looking building with a smooth curved exterior on the corner of a road junction with several paintings on the wall|The [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], the city's major public contemporary art venue, was opened in 2008 after many delays.]]\n\nTraditional [[Thai art]], long developed within religious and royal contexts, continues to be sponsored by various government agencies in Bangkok, including the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]]' Office of Traditional Arts. The SUPPORT Foundation in Chitralada Palace sponsors traditional and folk handicrafts. Various communities throughout the city still practice their traditional crafts, including the production of ''[[khon]]'' masks, alms bowls, and classical musical instruments. The [[National Gallery of Thailand|National Gallery]] hosts permanent collection of traditional and modern art, with temporary contemporary exhibits. Bangkok's [[contemporary art]] scene has slowly grown from relative obscurity into the public sphere over the past two decades. Private galleries gradually emerged to provide exposure for new artists, including the [[Patravadi Theatre]] and [[H Gallery]]. The centrally located [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], opened in 2008 following a fifteen-year lobbying campaign, is now the largest public exhibition space in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Center Stage|first=John|last=Krich |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123623705280938041|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> There are also many other [[List of museums and art galleries in Bangkok|art galleries and museums]], including the privately owned [[Museum of Contemporary Art (Bangkok)|Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\nThe city's performing arts scene features traditional theatre and dance as well as Western-style plays. ''Khon'' and other traditional dances are regularly performed at the [[National Theatre (Thailand)|National Theatre]] and [[Salachalermkrung Royal Theatre]], while the [[Thailand Cultural Centre]] is a newer multi-purpose venue which also hosts musicals, orchestras and other events. [[List of theatres in Bangkok|Numerous venues]] regularly feature a variety of performances throughout the city.\n<!-- Can't use this since it's pretty much unreferenced and not really the right tone. If someone could rework the paragraph please do so.\nThe arts in Bangkok have developed almost exclusively and anonymously in the services of Theravada Buddhism since the Ayutthaya period and continuing to the present day by incorporating Western elements which is called the [[Rattanakosin style|Rattanakosin]] or Bangkok style. Nowadays, the modern art scene is centred around Bangkok as the capital of [[contemporary art]] in the region, while traditional art can be found in many commercial areas in the old city as well as temples and palaces throughout the city. There are also a number of artists who prefer to live and work outside the metropolis. The number of artists is constantly on the rise, so an increasing variety of works are available on the art market. Many art galleries in Bangkok tend to sell work restricted to traditional rural motifs. The artists creating this type of art are often influenced by traditional Buddhist beliefs and motifs, and are popular among the general Thai public. Nevertheless, some Thai artists are breaking away from these norms by addressing more controversial issues in their work, for example the loss of traditional values and the obsession with money in today's society.\n-->\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Sepak Takraw Bangkok.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several men playing a ball game; two of them jumping mid-air on either side of a net about eye-level high, appearing to be kicking the ball over the net; graffiti on a wall in the background|Games of [[sepak takraw]] can be spotted throughout Bangkok's parks and streets.]]\n\nAs is the national trend, [[association football]] and [[Muay Thai]] dominate Bangkok's spectator sport scene.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c \u0e01\u0e35\u0e2c\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e35\u0e40\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e17\u0e35\u0e27\u0e35 |url=https://positioningmag.com/60100 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=Positioning Magazine |date=16 April 2015 |language=th}}</ref> [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]], [[Bangkok United F.C.|Bangkok United]], [[Port F.C.|Port]] and [[Police Tero F.C.|Police Tero]] are major [[Thai League (football)|Thai League]] clubs based in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/313608/blemishes-in-the-beautiful-game |title=Blemishes in the beautiful game |newspaper=Bangkok Post|last=Post reporters|date=23 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Hanif |title=A year of unfulfilled expectations |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/1557354/a-year-of-unfulfilled-expectations |work=Bangkok Post |date=13 October 2018}}</ref> while the [[Rajadamnern Stadium|Rajadamnern]] and [[Lumpini Stadium|Lumpini]] stadiums are the main kickboxing venues.\n\nWhile [[sepak takraw]] can be seen played in open spaces throughout the city, football and other modern sports are now the norm.

[[Charoen Krung Road]], the first to be built by Western techniques, was completed in 1864. Since then, the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city. A complex elevated [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]] helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and electric trams served the city from 1894 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first [[rapid transit]] system began operation. Older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and [[Water transport in Bangkok|boat services]] which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals. Taxis appear in the form of cars, motorcycles, and \"''[[tuk-tuk]]''\" auto rickshaws.\n\nBangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the [[Thai highway network|national highway]] and [[Rail transport in Thailand|rail networks]], as well as by domestic flights to and from the city's two international airports. Its centuries-old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through Khlong Toei Port.\n\nThe BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department. However, many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems, and much of transport-related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government.\n\n===Roads===\nRoad-based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok. Due to the city's organic development, its streets do not follow an organized grid structure. Forty-eight major roads link the different areas of the city, branching into smaller streets and lanes (''[[soi]]'') which serve local neighbourhoods. Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city, while several expressway and [[Thai motorway network|motorway]] routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces.\n\n[[File:TrafficInBangkok.jpg|thumb|left|Traffic jams, seen here on [[Ratchadamri Road]], are common in Bangkok.]]\n\nBangkok's rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued\u2014in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Developing Integrated Emission Strategies for Existing Land-transport |url=http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |publisher=Clean Air Initiative |accessdate=15 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603110642/http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}</ref> These increases, in the face of limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s.

Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]] at the 2010 census, making Bangkok the nation's [[primate city]], dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.\n\nBangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the 15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] in 1768 and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe [[Tiger Cub Economies|Asian investment boom]] in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care, and has emerged as a centre for the arts, fashion, and entertainment. The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its [[red-light district]]s. The [[Grand Palace]] and [[Buddhist temple]]s including [[Wat Arun]] and [[Wat Pho]] stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of [[Khaosan Road]] and [[Patpong]]. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations, and has been named the world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.\n\nBangkok's rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure. An inadequate road network, despite an extensive [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]], together with substantial private car usage, have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion, which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem. Five rapid transit lines are now in operation, with more systems under construction or planned by the national government and the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Bangkok}}\n[[File:La Loubere map of Bangkok (English).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An engraved map titled &quot;A Map of Bancock&quot;, showing a walled settlement on the west of a river, and a fort on the east|Map of 17th-century Bangkok, from [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]]'s ''Du Royaume de Siam'']]\n\nThe history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, when it was a village on the west bank of the [[Chao Phraya River]], under the rule of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]].<ref name=\"Tipawan\"/> Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance. Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of [[Siege of Bangkok|a siege in 1688]] in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the [[Konbaung dynasty|Burmese Empire]] in 1767, the newly crowned King [[Taksin]] established his capital at the town, which became the base of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. In 1782, King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] (Rama I) succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank's [[Rattanakosin Island]], thus founding the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]. The [[City Pillar]] was erected on 21 April 1782, which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\nBangkok's economy gradually expanded through international trade, first with China, then with Western merchants returning in the early-to-mid 19th century. As the capital, Bangkok was the centre of Siam's modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late-19th century. The reigns of Kings [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV, 1851\u201368) and [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V, 1868\u20131910) saw the introduction of the steam engine, printing press, rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city, as well as formal education and healthcare.

Bangkok's role as a US military [[R&R (military)|R&R]] destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination. Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and migration from rural areas into Bangkok; its population surged from 1.8&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million in the 1960s.\n\nFollowing the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok.<ref>Baker & Pongpaichit 2005, pp. 37\u201341, 45, 52\u201371, 149\u2013150, 162, 199\u2013204.</ref> Rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s, until it was stalled by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]].

Although [[urban planning]] policies date back to the commission of the \"Litchfield Plan\" in 1960, which set out strategies for land use, transportation and general infrastructure improvements, zoning regulations were not fully implemented until 1992. As a result, the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion, both horizontally as [[ribbon development]]s extended along newly built roads, and vertically, with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in commercial areas.<ref>{{cite book|first=Medhi |last=Krongkaew |chapter=The changing urban system in a fast-growing city and economy: The case of Bangkok and Thailand |editor1-first=Fu-chen |editor1-last=Lo |editor2-first=Yue-man |editor2-last=Yeung |title=Emerging World Cities in Pacific Asia |publisher=United Nations University Press |year=1996|isbn=978-92-808-0907-7|page=322}}</ref> The city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces. The highly populated and growing cities of [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]], [[Pak Kret]], [[Rangsit (city)|Rangsit]] and [[Mueang Samut Prakan District|Samut Prakan]] are effectively now suburbs of Bangkok. Nevertheless, large agricultural areas remain within the city proper at its eastern and western fringes. Land use in the city consists of 23 percent residential use, 24 percent agriculture, and 30 percent used for commerce, industry, and government.<ref name=\"BMA geo\"/> The BMA's City Planning Department (CPD) is responsible for planning and shaping further development.

It is the site of the Grand Palace and the City Pillar Shrine, primary symbols of the city's founding, as well as important Buddhist temples. Phra Nakhon, along with the neighbouring Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong Districts, formed what was the city proper in the late 19th century. Many traditional neighbourhoods and markets are found here, including the Chinese settlement of Sampheng. The city was expanded toward Dusit District in the early 19th century, following King Chulalongkorn's relocation of the royal household to the new [[Dusit Palace]]. The buildings of the palace, including the neoclassical [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]], as well as the [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] and [[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] which leads to it from the Grand Palace, reflect the heavy influence of European architecture at the time. Major government offices line the avenue, as does the [[Democracy Monument]]. The area is the site of the country's seat of power as well as the city's most popular tourist landmarks.\n\n[[File:View from Baiyoke Sky Hotel, Bangkok (7053110333) cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=A lot of high-rise buildings|The [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] area appears as a sea of high-rise buildings from [[Baiyoke Tower II]], the third-tallest building in Bangkok.]]\n\nIn contrast with the low-rise historic areas, the business district on [[Si Lom Road|Si Lom]] and [[Sathon Road|Sathon]] Roads in Bang Rak and Sathon Districts teems with skyscrapers. It is the site of many of the country's major corporate headquarters, but also of some of the city's [[red-light district]]s. The [[Siam area|Siam]] and [[Ratchaprasong]] areas in Pathum Wan are home to some of the largest shopping malls in [[Southeast Asia]]. Numerous retail outlets and hotels also stretch along [[Sukhumvit Road]] leading southeast through Watthana and Khlong Toei Districts. More office towers line the streets branching off Sukhumvit, especially [[Asok Montri Road|Asok Montri]], while upmarket housing is found in many of its [[soi|''soi''s]] ('alley' or 'lane').\n\nBangkok lacks a single distinct [[central business district]]. Instead, the areas of Siam and Ratchaprasong serve as a \"central shopping district\" containing many of the bigger malls and commercial areas in the city, as well as [[Siam Station]], the only transfer point between the city's two elevated train lines.<ref name=\"McGrath CSD\">{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1= Brian |editor1-last= Benites |editor1-first= Cecilia |editor2-last= Lyster |editor2-first= Clare |title= Regarding Public Space |date=2005 |publisher= Princeton Architectural Press |location= New York|isbn= 9781568985442 |pages=46\u201353 |chapter= Bangkok's CSD}}</ref> The [[Victory Monument (Bangkok)|Victory Monument]] in Ratchathewi District is among its most important road junctions, serving over 100 bus lines as well as an elevated train station. From the monument, [[Phahonyothin Road|Phahonyothin]] and [[Ratchawithi Road|Ratchawithi]]&nbsp;/ Din Daeng Roads respectively run north and east linking to major residential areas. Most of the high-density development areas are within the {{convert|113|km2|adj=on}} area encircled by the [[Ratchadaphisek Road|Ratchadaphisek]] inner ring road. Ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets, and office buildings also cluster around Ratchayothin Intersection in Chatuchak District to the north. Farther from the city centre, most areas are primarily mid- or low-density residential. The Thonburi side of the city is less developed, with fewer high rises. With the exception of a few secondary urban centres, Thonburi, in the same manner as the outlying eastern districts, consists mostly of residential and rural areas.\n\nWhile most of Bangkok's streets are fronted by vernacular [[shophouse]]s, the largely unrestricted building euphoria of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban area of skyscrapers and high rises of contrasting and clashing styles.<ref>Hamilton 2000, pp.&nbsp;465\u2013466.</ref> There are 581 skyscrapers over {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} tall in the city.

The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. [[Conspicuous consumption]] serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts.<ref>Hamilton 2000, p.&nbsp;468.</ref> Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.\n\nA distinct feature of Bangkok is the ubiquity of [[street vendor]]s selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It has been estimated that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Street Vendors in Asia: A Review|first=Sharit K |last=Bhowmik |journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=28 May \u2013 4 June 2005 |pages=2256\u20132264}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, however, the BMA, with support from the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (Thailand's ruling military junta), began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space. Many famous market neighbourhoods were affected, including [[Khlong Thom, Bangkok|Khlong Thom]], [[Saphan Lek]], and the flower market at [[Pak Khlong Talat]].

During [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] on 13\u201315 April, traditional rituals as well as water fights take place throughout the city. [[Loi Krathong]], usually in November, is accompanied by the Golden Mount Fair. New Year celebrations take place at many venues, the most prominent being the plaza in front of [[CentralWorld]]. Observances related to the royal family are held primarily in Bangkok. Wreaths are laid at King Chulalongkorn's equestrian statue in the Royal Plaza on 23 October, which is King Chulalongkorn Memorial Day. The present king's and queen's birthdays, respectively on 5 December and 12 August, are marked as Thailand's national Father's Day and national Mother's Day. These national holidays are celebrated by royal audiences on the day's eve, in which the king or queen gives a speech, and public gatherings on the day of the observance. The king's birthday is also marked by the [[Thai Royal Guards parade|Royal Guards' parade]].\n\n[[Sanam Luang]] is the site of the Thai Kite, Sport and Music Festival, usually held in March, and the [[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]] which takes place in May. The Red Cross Fair at the beginning of April is held at Suan Amporn and the Royal Plaza, and features numerous booths offering goods, games and exhibits. The [[Chinese New Year]] (January\u2013February) and [[Vegetarian Festival]] (September\u2013October) are celebrated widely by the Chinese community, especially in Yaowarat.<ref>Thavisin et al.

With the exception of local news segments broadcast by the NBT, all programming is done in Bangkok and repeated throughout the provinces. However, this centralised model is weakening with the rise of cable television, which has many local providers. There are numerous cable and satellite [[List of television stations in Bangkok|channels based in Bangkok]]. [[TrueVisions]] is the major subscription television provider in Bangkok and Thailand, and it also carries international programming. Bangkok was home to 40 of Thailand's 311 FM radio stations and 38 of its 212 AM stations in 2002.<ref name=\"Kavi\"/> Broadcast media reform stipulated by the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] has been progressing slowly, although many community radio stations have emerged in the city.\n\nLikewise, Bangkok has dominated the [[Thai film industry]] since its inception. Although film settings normally feature locations throughout the country, the city is home to all major film studios. Bangkok has dozens of [[List of cinemas in Thailand|cinemas and multiplexes]], and the city hosts two major film festivals annually, the [[Bangkok International Film Festival]] and the [[World Film Festival of Bangkok]].\n\n===Art===\n[[File:BKK Art and Culture Centre (II).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A modern-looking building with a smooth curved exterior on the corner of a road junction with several paintings on the wall|The [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], the city's major public contemporary art venue, was opened in 2008 after many delays.]]\n\nTraditional [[Thai art]], long developed within religious and royal contexts, continues to be sponsored by various government agencies in Bangkok, including the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]]' Office of Traditional Arts. The SUPPORT Foundation in Chitralada Palace sponsors traditional and folk handicrafts. Various communities throughout the city still practice their traditional crafts, including the production of ''[[khon]]'' masks, alms bowls, and classical musical instruments. The [[National Gallery of Thailand|National Gallery]] hosts permanent collection of traditional and modern art, with temporary contemporary exhibits. Bangkok's [[contemporary art]] scene has slowly grown from relative obscurity into the public sphere over the past two decades. Private galleries gradually emerged to provide exposure for new artists, including the [[Patravadi Theatre]] and [[H Gallery]]. The centrally located [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], opened in 2008 following a fifteen-year lobbying campaign, is now the largest public exhibition space in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Center Stage|first=John|last=Krich |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123623705280938041|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> There are also many other [[List of museums and art galleries in Bangkok|art galleries and museums]], including the privately owned [[Museum of Contemporary Art (Bangkok)|Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\nThe city's performing arts scene features traditional theatre and dance as well as Western-style plays.

Nowadays, the modern art scene is centred around Bangkok as the capital of [[contemporary art]] in the region, while traditional art can be found in many commercial areas in the old city as well as temples and palaces throughout the city. There are also a number of artists who prefer to live and work outside the metropolis. The number of artists is constantly on the rise, so an increasing variety of works are available on the art market. Many art galleries in Bangkok tend to sell work restricted to traditional rural motifs. The artists creating this type of art are often influenced by traditional Buddhist beliefs and motifs, and are popular among the general Thai public. Nevertheless, some Thai artists are breaking away from these norms by addressing more controversial issues in their work, for example the loss of traditional values and the obsession with money in today's society.\n-->\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Sepak Takraw Bangkok.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several men playing a ball game; two of them jumping mid-air on either side of a net about eye-level high, appearing to be kicking the ball over the net; graffiti on a wall in the background|Games of [[sepak takraw]] can be spotted throughout Bangkok's parks and streets.]]\n\nAs is the national trend, [[association football]] and [[Muay Thai]] dominate Bangkok's spectator sport scene.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c \u0e01\u0e35\u0e2c\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e35\u0e40\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e17\u0e35\u0e27\u0e35 |url=https://positioningmag.com/60100 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=Positioning Magazine |date=16 April 2015 |language=th}}</ref> [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]], [[Bangkok United F.C.|Bangkok United]], [[Port F.C.|Port]] and [[Police Tero F.C.|Police Tero]] are major [[Thai League (football)|Thai League]] clubs based in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/313608/blemishes-in-the-beautiful-game |title=Blemishes in the beautiful game |newspaper=Bangkok Post|last=Post reporters|date=23 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Hanif |title=A year of unfulfilled expectations |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/1557354/a-year-of-unfulfilled-expectations |work=Bangkok Post |date=13 October 2018}}</ref> while the [[Rajadamnern Stadium|Rajadamnern]] and [[Lumpini Stadium|Lumpini]] stadiums are the main kickboxing venues.\n\nWhile [[sepak takraw]] can be seen played in open spaces throughout the city, football and other modern sports are now the norm.

[[Charoen Krung Road]], the first to be built by Western techniques, was completed in 1864. Since then, the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city. A complex elevated [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]] helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and electric trams served the city from 1894 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first [[rapid transit]] system began operation. Older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and [[Water transport in Bangkok|boat services]] which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals. Taxis appear in the form of cars, motorcycles, and \"''[[tuk-tuk]]''\" auto rickshaws.\n\nBangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the [[Thai highway network|national highway]] and [[Rail transport in Thailand|rail networks]], as well as by domestic flights to and from the city's two international airports. Its centuries-old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through Khlong Toei Port.\n\nThe BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department. However, many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems, and much of transport-related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government.\n\n===Roads===\nRoad-based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok. Due to the city's organic development, its streets do not follow an organized grid structure. Forty-eight major roads link the different areas of the city, branching into smaller streets and lanes (''[[soi]]'') which serve local neighbourhoods. Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city, while several expressway and [[Thai motorway network|motorway]] routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces.\n\n[[File:TrafficInBangkok.jpg|thumb|left|Traffic jams, seen here on [[Ratchadamri Road]], are common in Bangkok.]]\n\nBangkok's rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued\u2014in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Developing Integrated Emission Strategies for Existing Land-transport |url=http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |publisher=Clean Air Initiative |accessdate=15 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603110642/http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}</ref> These increases, in the face of limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s.

Bangkok became not only a place where immigrants and provincial Thais go for job opportunities, but also for a chance to receive a university degree. [[Ramkhamhaeng University]] emerged in 1971 as Thailand's first open university; it now has the highest enrolment in the country. The demand for higher education has led to the founding of many other universities and colleges, both public and private. While many universities have been established in major provinces, the Greater Bangkok region remains home to the greater majority of institutions, and the city's tertiary education scene remains over-populated with non-Bangkokians. The situation is not limited to higher education, either. In the 1960s, 60 to 70 percent of 10- to 19-year-olds who were in school had migrated to Bangkok for secondary education. This was due to both a lack of secondary schools in the provinces and perceived higher standards of education in the capital.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Sukanya|last=Nitungkorn |title=The problems of secondary education expansion in Thailand |journal=Southeast Asian Studies|volume=26|issue=1|date=June 1988 |url=http://kyoto-seas.org/pdf/26/1/260102.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> Although this discrepancy has since largely abated, tens of thousands of students still compete for places in Bangkok's leading schools.

Both were members of the Cambridge University Kinema Club. He is given the pseudonym \"Roger East\" in Isherwood's early memoir ''Lions and Shadows''; Burford later married Stella Wilkinson, who appears as \"Polly\" in the same book. The two men corresponded throughout the 1930s and Burford's letters are preserved in Isherwood's papers. <ref>David Garrett Izzo, ''Christopher Isherwood Encyclopedia'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co., 2005, 28</ref> After graduating he published the well-received \"realist\" novel ''Kay Walters, A Woman of the People'' in 1928. He remained active in British literary circles, publishing his poetry regularly in \"little magazines\" such as ''Seed'' and ''Booster'' and becoming a member of the editorial board of the poetry magazine ''Delta'' in April 1938.

Getting thirstier by the second, the infant Ishmael scraped the land with his feet, where suddenly water sprang out.

Electric pumps draw the water, which is available throughout the Masjid al-Haram via water fountains and dispensing containers near the Tawaf area.<ref name=survey/>\n\n[[Hydrogeology|Hydrogeologically]], the well is in the ''Wadi Ibrahim'' (Valley of Abraham). The upper half of the well is in the sandy alluvium of the valley, lined with stone masonry except for the top metre (3&nbsp;ft) which has a concrete \"collar\". The lower half is in the bedrock. Between the alluvium and the bedrock is a {{convert|1/2|m|adj=on}} section of permeable weathered rock, lined with stone, and it is this section that provides the main water entry into the well. Water in the well comes from absorbed rainfall in the Wadi Ibrahim, as well as run-off from the local hills. Since the area has become more and more settled, water from absorbed rainfall on the Wadi Ibrahim has decreased.\n\nThe [[Saudi Geological Survey]] has a \"Zamzam Studies and Research Centre\" which analyses the technical properties of the well in detail. Water levels were monitored by [[hydrograph]], which in more recent times has changed to a digital monitoring system that tracks the water level, electric conductivity, [[pH]], [[Reduction potential|Eh]] and temperature. All of this information is made continuously available via the Internet. Other wells throughout the valley have also been established, some with digital recorders, to monitor the response of the local [[aquifer]] system.<ref name=survey/>\n\nZamzam water is colourless and odorless, but has a distinct taste, with a pH of 7.5\u20137.7, and so is slightly alkaline.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51712613 |title=Water quality of bottled water in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A comparative study with Riyadh municipal and Zamzam water |journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part A |volume=46 |issue=13 |pages=1519\u20131528 |date=October 12, 2011 |doi=10.1080/10934529.2011.609109|pmid=21992118 |last1 = Alfadul|first1 = Sulaiman M.|last2=Khan |first2=Mujahid A. }}</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=3|[[Mass concentration (chemistry)|Mineral concentration]]<br/><small>as reported by researchers at [[King Saud University]]</small><ref>Nour Al Zuhair, et al.

The Zamzam Well is located approximately {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} east of the Kaaba.<ref name=survey/>  In other Islamic tradition, [[Muhammad]]'s heart was extracted from his body, washed with the water of Zamzam, and then was restored in its original position, after which it was filled with faith and wisdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hadithcollection.com/sahihmuslim/Sahih%20Muslim%20Book%2001.%20Faith/sahih-muslim-book-001-hadith-number-0314.html|title=Sahih Muslim Book 001, Hadith Number 0314|publisher=Hadith Collection}}</ref>\n\n== Technical information ==\nThe Zamzam well was excavated by hand, and is about {{cvt|30|m|-1}} deep and {{convert|1.08|to|2.66|m|abbr=on}} in diameter. It taps groundwater from the [[wadi]] [[alluvium]] and some from the [[bedrock]]. Originally water from the well was drawn via ropes and buckets, but today the well itself is in a basement room where it can be seen behind glass panels (visitors are not allowed to enter). Electric pumps draw the water, which is available throughout the Masjid al-Haram via water fountains and dispensing containers near the Tawaf area.<ref name=survey/>\n\n[[Hydrogeology|Hydrogeologically]], the well is in the ''Wadi Ibrahim'' (Valley of Abraham). The upper half of the well is in the sandy alluvium of the valley, lined with stone masonry except for the top metre (3&nbsp;ft) which has a concrete \"collar\". The lower half is in the bedrock. Between the alluvium and the bedrock is a {{convert|1/2|m|adj=on}} section of permeable weathered rock, lined with stone, and it is this section that provides the main water entry into the well. Water in the well comes from absorbed rainfall in the Wadi Ibrahim, as well as run-off from the local hills. Since the area has become more and more settled, water from absorbed rainfall on the Wadi Ibrahim has decreased.\n\nThe [[Saudi Geological Survey]] has a \"Zamzam Studies and Research Centre\" which analyses the technical properties of the well in detail. Water levels were monitored by [[hydrograph]], which in more recent times has changed to a digital monitoring system that tracks the water level, electric conductivity, [[pH]], [[Reduction potential|Eh]] and temperature. All of this information is made continuously available via the Internet. Other wells throughout the valley have also been established, some with digital recorders, to monitor the response of the local [[aquifer]] system.<ref name=survey/>\n\nZamzam water is colourless and odorless, but has a distinct taste, with a pH of 7.5\u20137.7, and so is slightly alkaline.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51712613 |title=Water quality of bottled water in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A comparative study with Riyadh municipal and Zamzam water |journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part A |volume=46 |issue=13 |pages=1519\u20131528 |date=October 12, 2011 |doi=10.1080/10934529.2011.609109|pmid=21992118 |last1 = Alfadul|first1 = Sulaiman M.|last2=Khan |first2=Mujahid A. }}</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=3|[[Mass concentration (chemistry)|Mineral concentration]]<br/><small>as reported by researchers at [[King Saud University]]</small><ref>Nour Al Zuhair, et al.

Their uniqueness does not depend on a central registration authority or coordination between the parties generating them, unlike most other numbering schemes. While the [[probability]] that a UUID will be duplicated is not zero, it is close enough to zero to be negligible.\n\nThus, anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify something with near certainty that the identifier does not duplicate one that has already been, or will be, created to identify something else. Information labeled with UUIDs by independent parties can therefore be later combined into a single database or transmitted on the same channel, with a negligible probability of duplication.\n\nAdoption of UUIDs is widespread, with many computing platforms providing support for generating them and for parsing their textual representation.\n\n==History==\nUUIDs were originally used in the [[Apollo Computer|Apollo]] [[Network Computing System]] (NCS) and later in the [[Open Software Foundation]]'s (OSF) [[Distributed Computing Environment]] (DCE). The initial design of DCE UUIDs was based on the NCS UUIDs,<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Zahn\n  | first = Lisa\n  | title = Network Computing Architecture\n  | page = 10\n  | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]\n  | year = 1990\n  | isbn = 978-0-13-611674-5 }}</ref> whose design was in turn inspired by the ([[64-bit computing|64-bit]]) unique identifiers defined and used pervasively in [[Domain/OS]], an [[operating system]] also designed by Apollo Computer.  Later, the [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms adopted the DCE design as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs).  RFC 4122 registered a [[URN]] namespace for UUIDs<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" /> and recapitulated the earlier specifications, with the same technical content. By the time <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> was published as a proposed [[IETF]] standard, the [[ITU]] had also standardized UUIDs, based on the previous standards and early versions of <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki>.\n\n==Standards==\nUUIDs are standardized by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) as part of the [[Distributed Computing Environment]] (DCE).<ref name=\"cde_spec\">{{cite web\n| publisher = The Open Group\n| year = 1997\n| title = CDE 1.1: Remote Procedure Call\n| url = http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9629399/apdxa.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"dce_spec\">{{cite web\n| publisher = The Open Group\n| year = 1997\n| title = DCE 1.1: Authentication and Security Services\n| url = http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9696989899/chap5.htm#tagcjh_08_02_01_01}}</ref>\n\nUUIDs are documented as part of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 11578:1996 \"[[Information technology]]&nbsp;\u2013 Open Systems Interconnection&nbsp;\u2013 [[Remote procedure call|Remote Procedure Call]] (RPC)\" and more recently in ITU-T Rec.

X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8.\n\n==Format==\nIn its canonical textual representation, the 16 [[Octet (computing)|octets]] of a UUID are represented as 32 [[hexadecimal]] (base-16) digits, displayed in 5 groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters (32 hexadecimal characters and 4 hyphens). For example:\n: <code>123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</code>\n: <code>xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</code>\n\nThe 4 bit M and the 1 to 3 bit N fields code the format of the UUID itself.\nThe 4 bits of digit <code>M</code> are the UUID version, and the 1 to 3 most significant bits of digit <code>N</code> code the UUID variant. (See [[Universally_unique_identifier#Variants|below.]]) In the example, ''M'' is <code>1</code>, and ''N'' is <code>a</code> (10xx<sub>2</sub>), meaning that this is a version-1, variant-1  UUID; that is, a time-based <nowiki>DCE/RFC 4122 UUID</nowiki>.\n\nThe canonical 8-4-4-4-12 format string is based on the record layout for the 16 bytes of the UUID:<ref name=\"RFC 4122\"/> \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ UUID record layout\n|-\n!

A UUID presented as a URN appears as follows:<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n: <code><nowiki>urn:uuid:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</nowiki></code>\n\n==Encoding==\nThe binary encoding of UUIDs varies between systems. Variant 1 UUIDs, nowadays the most common variant, are encoded in a [[big-endian]] format. For example, <code>00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff</code> is encoded as the bytes <code>00 11 22 33</code> <code>44 55</code> <code>66 77</code> <code>88 99</code> <code>aa bb cc dd ee ff</code>.\n\nVariant 2 UUIDs, historically used in Microsoft's [[Component Object Model|COM/OLE libraries]], use a [[mixed-endian]] format, whereby the first three components of the UUID are [[little-endian]], and the last two are [[big-endian]]. For example, <code>00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff</code> is encoded as the bytes <code>33 22 11 00</code> <code>55 44</code> <code>77 66</code> <code>88 99</code> <code>aa bb cc dd ee ff</code>.\n\n==Variants==\nOne of the variants defined by <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki>, variant 0 (indicated by the one-bit pattern 0xxx<sub>2</sub>, ''N''\u00a0=\u00a0<code>0..7</code>), is for backwards compatibility with the now-obsolete Apollo [[Network Computing System]] 1.5 UUID format developed around 1988.  In this format, the first 6 octets of the UUID are a 48-bit timestamp (the number of 4-microsecond units of time since 1 Jan 1980 UTC); the next 2 octets are reserved; the next octet is the \"address family\"; and the final 7 octets are a 56-bit host ID in the form specified by the address family.  Though different in detail, the similarity with modern version-1 UUIDs is evident. The variant bits in the current UUID specification coincide with the high bits of the address family octet in NCS UUIDs. Though the address family could hold values in the range 0..255, only the values 0..13 were ever defined. Accordingly, the variant-0 bit pattern <code>0xxx</code> avoids conflicts with historical NCS UUIDs, should any still exist in databases.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://opensource.apple.com/source/CF/CF-299.35/Base.subproj/uuid.c.auto.html |title=uuid.c}}</ref>\n\nThe 3-bit variant bit pattern 111x<sub>2</sub> (''N''\u00a0=\u00a0<code>e..f</code>) is reserved for possible future variants.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\nThe other two variants, variants 1 and 2, are used by the current UUID specifications.  Variant-1 UUIDs (10xx<sub>2</sub> ''N''\u00a0=\u00a0<code>8..b</code>, 2 bits) are referred to as <nowiki>RFC 4122/DCE 1.1 UUIDs</nowiki>, or \"Leach\u2013Salz\" UUIDs, after the authors of the original [[Internet Draft]]. Variant 2 (110x<sub>2</sub> ''N''\u00a0=\u00a0<code>c..d</code>, 3 bits) is characterized in the RFC as \"reserved, Microsoft Corporation backward compatibility\" and was used for early GUIDs on the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform.  Variant bits aside, the two variants are the same, except that when reduced to a binary form for storage or transmission, variant-1 UUIDs use \"network\" (big-endian) byte order, while variant-2 GUIDs use \"native\" (little-endian) byte order for some subfields of the UUID.  In their textual representations, variants 1 and 2 are the same, except for the variant bits.\n\nWhen byte swapping is required to convert between the big-endian byte order of variant 1 and the little-endian byte order of variant 2, the fields above define the swapping.  The first three fields are unsigned 32- and 16-bit integers and are subject to swapping, while the last two fields consist of uninterpreted bytes, not subject to swapping.  This byte swapping applies even for versions 3, 4, and 5, where the canonical fields do not correspond to the content of the UUID.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\nNote that while some important GUIDs, such as the identifier for the [[Component Object Model]] [[IUnknown]] interface, are nominally variant-2 UUIDs, many identifiers generated and used in Microsoft Windows software and referred to as \"GUIDs\" are standard variant-1 <nowiki>RFC 4122/DCE 1.1</nowiki> network-byte-order UUIDs, rather than little-endian variant-2 UUIDs.  The current version of the Microsoft <code>guidgen</code> tool produces standard variant-1 UUIDs. Some Microsoft documentation states that \"GUID\" is a synonym for \"UUID\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246025.aspx |title=Globally Unique Identifiers |website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref> as standardized in <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki>. <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> itself states that UUIDs \"are also known as GUIDs\". All this suggests that \"GUID\", while originally referring to a variant of UUID used by Microsoft, has become simply an alternative name for UUID, with both variant-1 and variant-2 GUIDs being extant.\n\n==Versions==\nFor both variants 1 and 2, five \"versions\" are defined in the standards, and each version may be more appropriate than the others in specific use cases.  Version is indicated by the <code>M</code> in the string representation.\n\nVersion-1 UUIDs are generated from a time and a node id (usually the [[MAC address]]); version-2 UUIDs are generated from an identifier (usually a group or user id), time, and a node id; versions 3 and 5 produce deterministic UUIDs generated by hashing a [[namespace]] identifier and name; and version-4 UUIDs are generated using a [[Randomness|random]] or [[Pseudorandomness|pseudo-random]] number.\n\n===Nil UUID===\n\nThe \"nil\" UUID, a special case, is the UUID <code>00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</code>; that is, all bits set to zero.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\n===Version 1 (date-time and MAC address)===\nVersion 1 concatenates the 48-bit [[MAC address]] of the \"node\" (that is, the computer generating the UUID), with a 60-bit timestamp, being the number of 100-[[nanosecond]] intervals since midnight 15 October 1582 [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), the date on which the [[Gregorian calendar]] was first adopted.  <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> states that the time value rolls over around 3400 AD,<ref name=\"RFC 4122\"/> depending on the algorithm used, which implies that the 60-bit timestamp is a signed quantity. However some software, such as the libuuid library, treats the timestamp as unsigned, putting the rollover time in 5236 AD.<ref name=\"e2fsprogs\"/>\n\nA 13- or 14-bit \"uniquifying\" clock sequence extends the timestamp in order to handle cases where the processor clock does not advance fast enough, or where there are multiple processors and UUID generators per node. When UUIDs are generated faster than the system clock could advance, the lower bits of the timestamp fields can be generated by incrementing it every time a UUID is being generated, to simulate a high resolution timestamp.  With each version 1 UUID corresponding to a single point in space (the node) and time (intervals and clock sequence), the chance of two properly generated version-1 UUIDs being unintentionally the same is practically nil.  Since the time and clock sequence total 74 bits, 2<sup>74</sup> (1.8{{e|22}}, or 18 sextillion) version-1 UUIDs can be generated per node id, at a maximal average rate of 163 billion per second per node id.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\nIn contrast to other UUID versions, version-1 and -2 UUIDs based on MAC addresses from [[network card]]s rely for their uniqueness in part on an identifier issued by a central registration authority, namely the [[Organizationally unique identifier|Organizationally Unique Identifier]] (OUI) part of the MAC address, which is issued by the [[IEEE]] to manufacturers of networking equipment.<ref name=\"IEEE-RA\">\n{{cite book\n  | url = http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/\n  | last =The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Incorporated (IEEE)\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Registration authority\n  | date = 1963-01-01  \n  | location = \n}}</ref> The uniqueness of version-1 and version-2 UUIDs based on network-card MAC addresses also depends on network-card manufacturers properly assigning unique MAC addresses to their cards, which like other manufacturing processes is subject to error.\n\nUsage of the node's network card MAC address for the node id means that a version-1 UUID can be tracked back to the computer that created it. Documents can sometimes be traced to the computers where they were created or edited through UUIDs embedded into them by [[word processing]] software. This [[privacy]] hole was used when locating the creator of the [[Melissa (computer virus)|Melissa virus]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Tracking Melissa's Alter Egos | first = Luke | last = Reiter | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | website = [[ZDNet]] | date = 1999-04-02 | url = http://www.zdnet.com/news/tracking-melissas-alter-egos/101974 | accessdate = 2017-01-16 }}</ref>\n\n<nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> does allow the MAC address in a version-1 (or 2) UUID to be replaced by a random 48-bit node id, either because the node does not have a MAC address, or because it is not desirable to expose it.  In that case, the RFC requires that the least significant bit of the first octet of the node id should be set to 1.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" /> This corresponds to the [[multicast]] bit in MAC addresses, and setting it serves to differentiate UUIDs where the node id is randomly generated from those based on MAC addresses from network cards, which typically have [[unicast]] MAC addresses.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\">{{cite IETF |title=A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace |rfc=4122 |first1=P. |last1=Leach |first2=M. |last2=Mealling |first3=R. |last3=Salz |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] |year=2005 |accessdate=2017-01-17}}</ref>\n\n===Version 2 (date-time and MAC address, DCE security version)===\n<nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> reserves version 2 for \"DCE security\" UUIDs; but it does not provide any details. For this reason, many UUID implementations omit version 2.  However, the specification of version-2 UUIDs is provided by the DCE 1.1 Authentication and Security Services specification.<ref name=\"dce_spec\" />\n\nVersion-2 UUIDs are similar to version 1, except that the least significant 8 bits of the clock sequence are replaced by a \"local domain\" number, and the least significant 32 bits of the timestamp are replaced by an integer identifier meaningful within the specified local domain. On [[POSIX]] systems, local-domain numbers 0 and 1 are for user ids ([[User identifier|UIDs]]) and group ids ([[Group identifier|GIDs]]) respectively, and other local-domain numbers are site-defined.<ref name=\"dce_spec\" />  On non-POSIX systems, all local domain numbers are site-defined.\n\nThe ability to include a 40-bit domain/identifier in the UUID comes with a tradeoff. On the one hand, 40 bits allow about 1&nbsp;trillion domain/identifier values per node id.  On the other hand, with the clock value truncated to the 28 most significant bits, compared to 60 bits in version 1, the clock in a version 2 UUID will \"tick\" only once every 429.49\u00a0seconds, a little more than 7\u00a0minutes, as opposed to every 100\u00a0nanoseconds for version 1.  And with a clock sequence of only 6\u00a0bits, compared to 14 bits in version 1, only 64 unique UUIDs per node/domain/identifier can be generated per 7-minute clock tick, compared to 16,384 clock sequence values for version 1.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kuchling |first1=A. M. |title=What's New in Python 2.5 |url=https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.5.html |website=Python.org |accessdate=23 January 2016 |ref=Python2.5RelNotes}}</ref>  Thus, Version 2 may not be suitable for cases where UUIDs are required, per node/domain/identifier, at a rate exceeding about 1 per 7 seconds.\n\n===Versions 3 and 5 (namespace name-based)===\nVersion-3 and version-5 UUIDs are generated by [[Cryptographic hash function|hashing]] a [[namespace]] identifier and name. Version 3 uses [[MD5]] as the hashing algorithm, and version 5 uses [[SHA-1]].<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\nThe namespace identifier is itself a UUID. The specification provides UUIDs to represent the namespaces for [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s, [[fully qualified domain name]]s, [[object identifier]]s, and [[X.500]] [[LDAP|distinguished name]]s; but any desired UUID may be used as a namespace designator.\n\nTo determine the version-3 UUID corresponding to a given namespace and name, the UUID of the namespace is transformed to a string of bytes, concatenated with the input name, then hashed with MD5, yielding 128 bits.  Then 6 or 7 bits are replaced by fixed values, the 4-bit version (e.g. 0011<sub>2</sub> for version 3), and the 2- or 3-bit UUID \"variant\" (e.g. 10<sub>2</sub> indicating a <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> UUIDs, or 110<sub>2</sub> indicating a legacy Microsoft GUID). Since 6 or 7 bits are thus predetermined, only 121 or 122 bits contribute to the uniqueness of the UUID.\n\nVersion-5 UUIDs are similar, but SHA-1 is used instead of MD5. Since SHA-1 generates 160-bit digests, the digest is truncated to 128 bits before the version and variant bits are replaced.\n\nVersion-3 and version-5 UUIDs have the property that the same namespace and name will map to the same UUID. However, neither the namespace nor name can be determined from the UUID, even if one of them is specified, except by brute-force search.\n\n<nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> recommends version 5 (SHA-1) over version 3 (MD5) and counsels against use of UUIDs of either version as security credentials.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\n===Version 4 (random)===\nA version 4 UUID is randomly generated.  As in other UUIDs, 4 bits are used to indicate version 4, and 2 or 3 bits to indicate the variant (10<sub>2</sub> or 110<sub>2</sub> for variants 1 and 2 respectively). Thus, for variant 1 (that is, most UUIDs) a random version-4 UUID will have 6 predetermined variant and version bits, leaving 122 bits for the randomly generated part, for a total of 2<sup>122</sup>, or 5.3{{e|36}} (5.3&nbsp;[[Names_of_large_numbers|undecillion]]) possible version-4 variant-1 UUIDs.  There are half as many possible version-4 variant-2 UUIDs (legacy GUIDs) because there is one less random bit available, 3 bits being consumed for the variant.\n\n==Collisions==\n[[Collision (computer science)|Collision]] occurs when the same UUID is generated more than once and assigned to different referents. In the case of standard version-1 and version-2 UUIDs using unique MAC addresses from network cards, collisions can occur only when an implementation varies from the standards, either inadvertently or intentionally.\n\nIn contrast to version 1 and 2, UUIDs using randomly generated node ids, hash-based version-3 and version-5 UUIDs, and random version-4 UUIDs, collisions can occur even without implementation problems, albeit with a probability so small that it can normally be ignored. This probability can be computed precisely based on analysis of the [[birthday problem]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/36065/1/1159.pdf |first1=Paulo |last1=Jesus |first2=Carlos |last2=Baquero |first3=Paula |last3=Almaeida |title=ID Generation in Mobile Environments |website=Repositorium.Sdum.Uminho.pt }}</ref>\n\nFor example, the number of random version-4 UUIDs which need to be generated in order to have a 50% probability of at least one collision is 2.71&nbsp;quintillion, computed as follows:<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Mathis\n | first = Frank H.\n |date= June 1991\n | title = A Generalized Birthday Problem\n | journal = SIAM Review\n | volume = 33\n | issue = 2\n | pages = 265\u2013270\n | issn = 0036-1445\n | pmc =\n | doi = 10.1137/1033051\n | bibcode =\n | oclc = 37699182\n | jstor = 2031144\n | citeseerx = 10.1.1.5.5851\n }}</ref>\n: <math>n \\approx \\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + 2 \\times \\ln(2) \\times 2^{122}} \\approx 2.71 \\times 10^{18}.</math>\n\nThis number is equivalent to generating 1&nbsp;billion UUIDs per second for about 85&nbsp;years.

This so-called \"COMB\" (combined time-GUID) approach made the UUIDs non-standard and significantly more likely to be duplicated, as Nilsson acknowledged, but Nilsson only required uniqueness within the application.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nilsson |first=Jimmy |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=25862 |title=InformIT |publisher=InformIT |accessdate=2012-06-20|date=2002-03-08 }}</ref>.

The term '''globally unique identifier''' ('''GUID''') is also used, typically in software created by [[Microsoft]].\n\nWhen generated according to the standard methods, UUIDs are for practical purposes unique. Their uniqueness does not depend on a central registration authority or coordination between the parties generating them, unlike most other numbering schemes. While the [[probability]] that a UUID will be duplicated is not zero, it is close enough to zero to be negligible.\n\nThus, anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify something with near certainty that the identifier does not duplicate one that has already been, or will be, created to identify something else. Information labeled with UUIDs by independent parties can therefore be later combined into a single database or transmitted on the same channel, with a negligible probability of duplication.\n\nAdoption of UUIDs is widespread, with many computing platforms providing support for generating them and for parsing their textual representation.\n\n==History==\nUUIDs were originally used in the [[Apollo Computer|Apollo]] [[Network Computing System]] (NCS) and later in the [[Open Software Foundation]]'s (OSF) [[Distributed Computing Environment]] (DCE). The initial design of DCE UUIDs was based on the NCS UUIDs,<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Zahn\n  | first = Lisa\n  | title = Network Computing Architecture\n  | page = 10\n  | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]\n  | year = 1990\n  | isbn = 978-0-13-611674-5 }}</ref> whose design was in turn inspired by the ([[64-bit computing|64-bit]]) unique identifiers defined and used pervasively in [[Domain/OS]], an [[operating system]] also designed by Apollo Computer.  Later, the [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms adopted the DCE design as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs).  RFC 4122 registered a [[URN]] namespace for UUIDs<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" /> and recapitulated the earlier specifications, with the same technical content. By the time <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> was published as a proposed [[IETF]] standard, the [[ITU]] had also standardized UUIDs, based on the previous standards and early versions of <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki>.\n\n==Standards==\nUUIDs are standardized by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) as part of the [[Distributed Computing Environment]] (DCE).<ref name=\"cde_spec\">{{cite web\n| publisher = The Open Group\n| year = 1997\n| title = CDE 1.1: Remote Procedure Call\n| url = http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9629399/apdxa.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"dce_spec\">{{cite web\n| publisher = The Open Group\n| year = 1997\n| title = DCE 1.1: Authentication and Security Services\n| url = http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9696989899/chap5.htm#tagcjh_08_02_01_01}}</ref>\n\nUUIDs are documented as part of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 11578:1996 \"[[Information technology]]&nbsp;\u2013 Open Systems Interconnection&nbsp;\u2013 [[Remote procedure call|Remote Procedure Call]] (RPC)\" and more recently in ITU-T Rec.

X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8.\n\n==Format==\nIn its canonical textual representation, the 16 [[Octet (computing)|octets]] of a UUID are represented as 32 [[hexadecimal]] (base-16) digits, displayed in 5 groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters (32 hexadecimal characters and 4 hyphens). For example:\n: <code>123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</code>\n: <code>xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</code>\n\nThe 4 bit M and the 1 to 3 bit N fields code the format of the UUID itself.\nThe 4 bits of digit <code>M</code> are the UUID version, and the 1 to 3 most significant bits of digit <code>N</code> code the UUID variant. (See [[Universally_unique_identifier#Variants|below.]]) In the example, ''M'' is <code>1</code>, and ''N'' is <code>a</code> (10xx<sub>2</sub>), meaning that this is a version-1, variant-1  UUID; that is, a time-based <nowiki>DCE/RFC 4122 UUID</nowiki>.\n\nThe canonical 8-4-4-4-12 format string is based on the record layout for the 16 bytes of the UUID:<ref name=\"RFC 4122\"/> \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ UUID record layout\n|-\n!

A UUID presented as a URN appears as follows:<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n: <code><nowiki>urn:uuid:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</nowiki></code>\n\n==Encoding==\nThe binary encoding of UUIDs varies between systems. Variant 1 UUIDs, nowadays the most common variant, are encoded in a [[big-endian]] format. For example, <code>00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff</code> is encoded as the bytes <code>00 11 22 33</code> <code>44 55</code> <code>66 77</code> <code>88 99</code> <code>aa bb cc dd ee ff</code>.\n\nVariant 2 UUIDs, historically used in Microsoft's [[Component Object Model|COM/OLE libraries]], use a [[mixed-endian]] format, whereby the first three components of the UUID are [[little-endian]], and the last two are [[big-endian]]. For example, <code>00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff</code> is encoded as the bytes <code>33 22 11 00</code> <code>55 44</code> <code>77 66</code> <code>88 99</code> <code>aa bb cc dd ee ff</code>.\n\n==Variants==\nOne of the variants defined by <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki>, variant 0 (indicated by the one-bit pattern 0xxx<sub>2</sub>, ''N''\u00a0=\u00a0<code>0..7</code>), is for backwards compatibility with the now-obsolete Apollo [[Network Computing System]] 1.5 UUID format developed around 1988.  In this format, the first 6 octets of the UUID are a 48-bit timestamp (the number of 4-microsecond units of time since 1 Jan 1980 UTC); the next 2 octets are reserved; the next octet is the \"address family\"; and the final 7 octets are a 56-bit host ID in the form specified by the address family.  Though different in detail, the similarity with modern version-1 UUIDs is evident. The variant bits in the current UUID specification coincide with the high bits of the address family octet in NCS UUIDs. Though the address family could hold values in the range 0..255, only the values 0..13 were ever defined. Accordingly, the variant-0 bit pattern <code>0xxx</code> avoids conflicts with historical NCS UUIDs, should any still exist in databases.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://opensource.apple.com/source/CF/CF-299.35/Base.subproj/uuid.c.auto.html |title=uuid.c}}</ref>\n\nThe 3-bit variant bit pattern 111x<sub>2</sub> (''N''\u00a0=\u00a0<code>e..f</code>) is reserved for possible future variants.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\nThe other two variants, variants 1 and 2, are used by the current UUID specifications.  Variant-1 UUIDs (10xx<sub>2</sub> ''N''\u00a0=\u00a0<code>8..b</code>, 2 bits) are referred to as <nowiki>RFC 4122/DCE 1.1 UUIDs</nowiki>, or \"Leach\u2013Salz\" UUIDs, after the authors of the original [[Internet Draft]]. Variant 2 (110x<sub>2</sub> ''N''\u00a0=\u00a0<code>c..d</code>, 3 bits) is characterized in the RFC as \"reserved, Microsoft Corporation backward compatibility\" and was used for early GUIDs on the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform.  Variant bits aside, the two variants are the same, except that when reduced to a binary form for storage or transmission, variant-1 UUIDs use \"network\" (big-endian) byte order, while variant-2 GUIDs use \"native\" (little-endian) byte order for some subfields of the UUID.  In their textual representations, variants 1 and 2 are the same, except for the variant bits.\n\nWhen byte swapping is required to convert between the big-endian byte order of variant 1 and the little-endian byte order of variant 2, the fields above define the swapping.  The first three fields are unsigned 32- and 16-bit integers and are subject to swapping, while the last two fields consist of uninterpreted bytes, not subject to swapping.  This byte swapping applies even for versions 3, 4, and 5, where the canonical fields do not correspond to the content of the UUID.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\nNote that while some important GUIDs, such as the identifier for the [[Component Object Model]] [[IUnknown]] interface, are nominally variant-2 UUIDs, many identifiers generated and used in Microsoft Windows software and referred to as \"GUIDs\" are standard variant-1 <nowiki>RFC 4122/DCE 1.1</nowiki> network-byte-order UUIDs, rather than little-endian variant-2 UUIDs.  The current version of the Microsoft <code>guidgen</code> tool produces standard variant-1 UUIDs. Some Microsoft documentation states that \"GUID\" is a synonym for \"UUID\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246025.aspx |title=Globally Unique Identifiers |website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref> as standardized in <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki>. <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> itself states that UUIDs \"are also known as GUIDs\". All this suggests that \"GUID\", while originally referring to a variant of UUID used by Microsoft, has become simply an alternative name for UUID, with both variant-1 and variant-2 GUIDs being extant.\n\n==Versions==\nFor both variants 1 and 2, five \"versions\" are defined in the standards, and each version may be more appropriate than the others in specific use cases.  Version is indicated by the <code>M</code> in the string representation.\n\nVersion-1 UUIDs are generated from a time and a node id (usually the [[MAC address]]); version-2 UUIDs are generated from an identifier (usually a group or user id), time, and a node id; versions 3 and 5 produce deterministic UUIDs generated by hashing a [[namespace]] identifier and name; and version-4 UUIDs are generated using a [[Randomness|random]] or [[Pseudorandomness|pseudo-random]] number.\n\n===Nil UUID===\n\nThe \"nil\" UUID, a special case, is the UUID <code>00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</code>; that is, all bits set to zero.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\n===Version 1 (date-time and MAC address)===\nVersion 1 concatenates the 48-bit [[MAC address]] of the \"node\" (that is, the computer generating the UUID), with a 60-bit timestamp, being the number of 100-[[nanosecond]] intervals since midnight 15 October 1582 [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), the date on which the [[Gregorian calendar]] was first adopted.  <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> states that the time value rolls over around 3400 AD,<ref name=\"RFC 4122\"/> depending on the algorithm used, which implies that the 60-bit timestamp is a signed quantity. However some software, such as the libuuid library, treats the timestamp as unsigned, putting the rollover time in 5236 AD.<ref name=\"e2fsprogs\"/>\n\nA 13- or 14-bit \"uniquifying\" clock sequence extends the timestamp in order to handle cases where the processor clock does not advance fast enough, or where there are multiple processors and UUID generators per node. When UUIDs are generated faster than the system clock could advance, the lower bits of the timestamp fields can be generated by incrementing it every time a UUID is being generated, to simulate a high resolution timestamp.  With each version 1 UUID corresponding to a single point in space (the node) and time (intervals and clock sequence), the chance of two properly generated version-1 UUIDs being unintentionally the same is practically nil.  Since the time and clock sequence total 74 bits, 2<sup>74</sup> (1.8{{e|22}}, or 18 sextillion) version-1 UUIDs can be generated per node id, at a maximal average rate of 163 billion per second per node id.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\nIn contrast to other UUID versions, version-1 and -2 UUIDs based on MAC addresses from [[network card]]s rely for their uniqueness in part on an identifier issued by a central registration authority, namely the [[Organizationally unique identifier|Organizationally Unique Identifier]] (OUI) part of the MAC address, which is issued by the [[IEEE]] to manufacturers of networking equipment.<ref name=\"IEEE-RA\">\n{{cite book\n  | url = http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/\n  | last =The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Incorporated (IEEE)\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Registration authority\n  | date = 1963-01-01  \n  | location = \n}}</ref> The uniqueness of version-1 and version-2 UUIDs based on network-card MAC addresses also depends on network-card manufacturers properly assigning unique MAC addresses to their cards, which like other manufacturing processes is subject to error.\n\nUsage of the node's network card MAC address for the node id means that a version-1 UUID can be tracked back to the computer that created it. Documents can sometimes be traced to the computers where they were created or edited through UUIDs embedded into them by [[word processing]] software. This [[privacy]] hole was used when locating the creator of the [[Melissa (computer virus)|Melissa virus]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Tracking Melissa's Alter Egos | first = Luke | last = Reiter | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | website = [[ZDNet]] | date = 1999-04-02 | url = http://www.zdnet.com/news/tracking-melissas-alter-egos/101974 | accessdate = 2017-01-16 }}</ref>\n\n<nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> does allow the MAC address in a version-1 (or 2) UUID to be replaced by a random 48-bit node id, either because the node does not have a MAC address, or because it is not desirable to expose it.  In that case, the RFC requires that the least significant bit of the first octet of the node id should be set to 1.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" /> This corresponds to the [[multicast]] bit in MAC addresses, and setting it serves to differentiate UUIDs where the node id is randomly generated from those based on MAC addresses from network cards, which typically have [[unicast]] MAC addresses.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\">{{cite IETF |title=A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace |rfc=4122 |first1=P. |last1=Leach |first2=M. |last2=Mealling |first3=R. |last3=Salz |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] |year=2005 |accessdate=2017-01-17}}</ref>\n\n===Version 2 (date-time and MAC address, DCE security version)===\n<nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> reserves version 2 for \"DCE security\" UUIDs; but it does not provide any details. For this reason, many UUID implementations omit version 2.  However, the specification of version-2 UUIDs is provided by the DCE 1.1 Authentication and Security Services specification.<ref name=\"dce_spec\" />\n\nVersion-2 UUIDs are similar to version 1, except that the least significant 8 bits of the clock sequence are replaced by a \"local domain\" number, and the least significant 32 bits of the timestamp are replaced by an integer identifier meaningful within the specified local domain. On [[POSIX]] systems, local-domain numbers 0 and 1 are for user ids ([[User identifier|UIDs]]) and group ids ([[Group identifier|GIDs]]) respectively, and other local-domain numbers are site-defined.<ref name=\"dce_spec\" />  On non-POSIX systems, all local domain numbers are site-defined.\n\nThe ability to include a 40-bit domain/identifier in the UUID comes with a tradeoff. On the one hand, 40 bits allow about 1&nbsp;trillion domain/identifier values per node id.  On the other hand, with the clock value truncated to the 28 most significant bits, compared to 60 bits in version 1, the clock in a version 2 UUID will \"tick\" only once every 429.49\u00a0seconds, a little more than 7\u00a0minutes, as opposed to every 100\u00a0nanoseconds for version 1.  And with a clock sequence of only 6\u00a0bits, compared to 14 bits in version 1, only 64 unique UUIDs per node/domain/identifier can be generated per 7-minute clock tick, compared to 16,384 clock sequence values for version 1.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kuchling |first1=A. M. |title=What's New in Python 2.5 |url=https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.5.html |website=Python.org |accessdate=23 January 2016 |ref=Python2.5RelNotes}}</ref>  Thus, Version 2 may not be suitable for cases where UUIDs are required, per node/domain/identifier, at a rate exceeding about 1 per 7 seconds.\n\n===Versions 3 and 5 (namespace name-based)===\nVersion-3 and version-5 UUIDs are generated by [[Cryptographic hash function|hashing]] a [[namespace]] identifier and name. Version 3 uses [[MD5]] as the hashing algorithm, and version 5 uses [[SHA-1]].<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\nThe namespace identifier is itself a UUID. The specification provides UUIDs to represent the namespaces for [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s, [[fully qualified domain name]]s, [[object identifier]]s, and [[X.500]] [[LDAP|distinguished name]]s; but any desired UUID may be used as a namespace designator.\n\nTo determine the version-3 UUID corresponding to a given namespace and name, the UUID of the namespace is transformed to a string of bytes, concatenated with the input name, then hashed with MD5, yielding 128 bits.  Then 6 or 7 bits are replaced by fixed values, the 4-bit version (e.g. 0011<sub>2</sub> for version 3), and the 2- or 3-bit UUID \"variant\" (e.g. 10<sub>2</sub> indicating a <nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> UUIDs, or 110<sub>2</sub> indicating a legacy Microsoft GUID). Since 6 or 7 bits are thus predetermined, only 121 or 122 bits contribute to the uniqueness of the UUID.\n\nVersion-5 UUIDs are similar, but SHA-1 is used instead of MD5. Since SHA-1 generates 160-bit digests, the digest is truncated to 128 bits before the version and variant bits are replaced.\n\nVersion-3 and version-5 UUIDs have the property that the same namespace and name will map to the same UUID. However, neither the namespace nor name can be determined from the UUID, even if one of them is specified, except by brute-force search.\n\n<nowiki>RFC 4122</nowiki> recommends version 5 (SHA-1) over version 3 (MD5) and counsels against use of UUIDs of either version as security credentials.<ref name=\"RFC 4122\" />\n\n===Version 4 (random)===\nA version 4 UUID is randomly generated.  As in other UUIDs, 4 bits are used to indicate version 4, and 2 or 3 bits to indicate the variant (10<sub>2</sub> or 110<sub>2</sub> for variants 1 and 2 respectively). Thus, for variant 1 (that is, most UUIDs) a random version-4 UUID will have 6 predetermined variant and version bits, leaving 122 bits for the randomly generated part, for a total of 2<sup>122</sup>, or 5.3{{e|36}} (5.3&nbsp;[[Names_of_large_numbers|undecillion]]) possible version-4 variant-1 UUIDs.  There are half as many possible version-4 variant-2 UUIDs (legacy GUIDs) because there is one less random bit available, 3 bits being consumed for the variant.\n\n==Collisions==\n[[Collision (computer science)|Collision]] occurs when the same UUID is generated more than once and assigned to different referents. In the case of standard version-1 and version-2 UUIDs using unique MAC addresses from network cards, collisions can occur only when an implementation varies from the standards, either inadvertently or intentionally.\n\nIn contrast to version 1 and 2, UUIDs using randomly generated node ids, hash-based version-3 and version-5 UUIDs, and random version-4 UUIDs, collisions can occur even without implementation problems, albeit with a probability so small that it can normally be ignored. This probability can be computed precisely based on analysis of the [[birthday problem]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/36065/1/1159.pdf |first1=Paulo |last1=Jesus |first2=Carlos |last2=Baquero |first3=Paula |last3=Almaeida |title=ID Generation in Mobile Environments |website=Repositorium.Sdum.Uminho.pt }}</ref>\n\nFor example, the number of random version-4 UUIDs which need to be generated in order to have a 50% probability of at least one collision is 2.71&nbsp;quintillion, computed as follows:<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Mathis\n | first = Frank H.\n |date= June 1991\n | title = A Generalized Birthday Problem\n | journal = SIAM Review\n | volume = 33\n | issue = 2\n | pages = 265\u2013270\n | issn = 0036-1445\n | pmc =\n | doi = 10.1137/1033051\n | bibcode =\n | oclc = 37699182\n | jstor = 2031144\n | citeseerx = 10.1.1.5.5851\n }}</ref>\n: <math>n \\approx \\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + 2 \\times \\ln(2) \\times 2^{122}} \\approx 2.71 \\times 10^{18}.</math>\n\nThis number is equivalent to generating 1&nbsp;billion UUIDs per second for about 85&nbsp;years.

For example, in 2002 Jimmy Nilsson reported a significant improvement in performance with Microsoft SQL Server when the version-4 UUIDs being used as keys were modified to include a non-random suffix based on system time. This so-called \"COMB\" (combined time-GUID) approach made the UUIDs non-standard and significantly more likely to be duplicated, as Nilsson acknowledged, but Nilsson only required uniqueness within the application.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nilsson |first=Jimmy |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=25862 |title=InformIT |publisher=InformIT |accessdate=2012-06-20|date=2002-03-08 }}</ref>.
