Then he took a two-year hiatus from movies, before starring as past-his-prime rodeo star in the adventure-romance ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'' (1979).  This film reunited him with [[Jane Fonda]] and which finished at No. 9 in the box office for 1980.<ref name=\"Michael Gebert 1996, pg. 355\">Michael Gebert, ''The Encyclopedia of Movie Awards'', St. Martin's Paperbacks, New York, 1996, pg. 355.</ref> Later that year he appeared in the prison drama ''[[Brubaker]]'' (1980), playing a [[prison warden]] attempting to reform the system. As well, his directoral debut, ''[[Ordinary People]]'', which followed the disintegration of an upper-class American family after the death of a son, was one of the most critically and publicly acclaimed films of the decade, winning four Oscars, including Best Director for Redford himself, and Best Picture.\n\nSoon after that, he starred in the baseball drama ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984).<ref name=tca/> Sydney Pollack's ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985), with Redford in the male lead role opposite [[Meryl Streep]], became a large box office success (combined 1985 and 1986 grossess placed it at No. 5 for 1986),<ref name=\"Michael Gebert 1996, pg. 401\">Michael Gebert, ''The Encyclopedia of Movie Awards'', St. Martin's Paperbacks, New York, 1996, pg. 401.</ref> won a Golden Globe for Best Picture,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/bohemian-rhapsody-worst-reviewed-golden-globes-winner-since-80s-2429215 | title='Bohemian Rhapsody' is the worst-reviewed Golden Globes winner in 33 years | work=[[NME]] | date=January 10, 2019 | accessdate=January 14, 2019 | first=John | last=Earls | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110151752/https://www.nme.com/news/bohemian-rhapsody-worst-reviewed-golden-globes-winner-since-80s-2429215 | archive-date=January 10, 2019 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> and won seven [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], including Best Picture.

After that, his second directorial project, ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' (1987), failed to generate the same level of attention as ''Ordinary People''.\n\nRedford continued as a major star throughout the 1990s and 2000s. He released his third film as a director, ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'', in 1992, which was a return to mainstream success for Redford as a director and brought a young [[Brad Pitt]] to greater prominence. In 1993, Redford played what became one of his most popular and recognized roles, starring in ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'' as a millionaire businessman who tests a couple's morals; the film became one of the year's biggest hits. He co-starred with [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in the newsroom romance ''[[Up Close & Personal]]'' (1996), and with [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] and a young [[Scarlett Johansson]] in ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'' (1998), which he also directed.<ref name=tca/> Redford also continued work in films with political contexts, such as ''[[Havana (film)|Havana]]'' (1990), playing Jack Weil, a professional gambler in 1959 Cuba during the Revolution, as well as ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' (1992), in which he co-starred with [[River Phoenix]] and [[Sidney Poitier]], his first teaming with the star who had experienced film success several years before Redford.\n\nHe appeared as a disgraced Army general sent to prison in the prison drama ''[[The Last Castle]]'' (2001), directed by Rod Lurie. In the same year, Redford reteamed with [[Brad Pitt]] for ''[[Spy Game]]'', another success for the pair but with Redford switching this time from director to actor. During that time, he planned to direct and star in a sequel of ''The Candidate''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2002/10/24/robert-redford-plans-candidate-sequel/|title=Robert Redford plans ''Candidate'' sequel|website=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=December 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230233514/https://ew.com/article/2002/10/24/robert-redford-plans-candidate-sequel/|archive-date=December 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> but the project never happened.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/09/the-candidate-and-the-sequel-that-never-was/502301/|title=The Candidate and the Sequel That Never Was \u2013 The Atlantic|last=Garber|first=Megan|website=The Atlantic|access-date=December 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230181344/https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/09/the-candidate-and-the-sequel-that-never-was/502301/|archive-date=December 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Redford, a leading environmental activist, narrated the IMAX documentary ''[[Sacred Planet]]'' (2004), a sweeping journey across the globe to some of its most exotic and endangered places. In ''[[The Clearing (film)|The Clearing]]'' (2004), a thriller co-starring Helen Mirren, Redford was a successful businessman whose kidnapping unearths the secrets and inadequacies that led to his achieving the American Dream.\n\nRedford stepped back into producing with ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'' (2004), a coming-of-age road film about a young medical student, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, and his friend Alberto Granado. It also explored the political and social issues of South America that influenced Guevara and shaped his future.  With five years spent on the film's making, Redford was credited by director Walter Salles for being instrumental in getting it made and released.\n\nBack in front of the camera, Redford received good notices for his role in director [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]]'s ''[[An Unfinished Life]]'' (2005) as a cantankerous rancher who is forced to take in his estranged daughter-in-law (Jennifer Lopez)\u2014whom he blames for his son's death\u2014and the granddaughter he never knew he had when they fled an abusive relationship.  The film, which sat on the shelf for many months while its distributor Miramax was restructured, was generally dismissed as clich\u00e9d and overly sentimental. Meanwhile, Redford returned to familiar territory when he reteamed with [[Meryl Streep]] 22 years after they starred in ''Out of Africa'', for his personal project ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'' (2007), which also starred [[Tom Cruise]]. After a great deal of hype, the film opened to mixed reviews and disappointing box office.\n\nRedford appeared in the 2011 documentary ''[[Buck (film)|Buck]]'' by [[Cindy Meehl]], where he discussed his experiences with title subject [[Buck Brannaman]] during the production of ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]''. In 2012, Redford directed ''[[The Company You Keep (film)|The Company You Keep]]'', in which he starred as a former Weather Underground activist who goes on the run after a journalist discovers his identity. In 2013, he starred in ''[[All Is Lost]]'', directed by J.C. Chandor, about a man lost at sea. He received acclaim for his performance in the film, in which he is its only cast member and there is almost no dialogue. Redford was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]], his first Best Actor nomination for a Golden Globe, and won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor]], his first time winning an acting honour from that group (he had been nominated in 1969 for ''Downhill Racer'').\n\nIn April 2014, Redford appeared in the [[Marvel Studios]] superhero film ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' playing [[Alexander Pierce]], the head of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and leader of the [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] cell operating the Triskelion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/robert-redford-confirms-captain-america-winter-soldier-role-153202834.html |title=Robert Redford Confirms Captain America: The Winter Soldier Role |publisher=[[Yahoo!

As early as 1969, Redford had served as the executive producer for ''[[Downhill Racer]]''.<ref name=tca/> His first film as director was 1980's Best Picture winner ''[[Ordinary People]]'', a drama about the slow disintegration of an [[upper-middle class]] family, for which he won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].<ref name=tca/> Redford was credited with obtaining a powerful dramatic performance from [[Mary Tyler Moore]], as well as superb work from [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Timothy Hutton]], who also won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].\n\nRedford did not direct again until ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' (1988), a well-crafted, though not commercially successful, screen version of [[John Nichols (American writer)|John Nichols]]' acclaimed novel of the Southwest. ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' is the story of the people of Milagro, New Mexico (based on the real town of [[Truchas, New Mexico|Truchas]] in northern New Mexico), overcoming big developers who set about to ruin their community and force them out because of tax increases.  Other directorial projects have included the period drama ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'' (1992), based on [[Norman Maclean]]'s novella, and the expos\u00e9 ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' (1994), about the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s.<ref name=tca/> In the latter film, Redford worked from a screenplay by [[Paul Attanasio]] with noted cinematographer [[Michael Ballhaus]] and a strong cast that featured [[Paul Scofield]], [[John Turturro]], [[Rob Morrow]], and [[Ralph Fiennes]]. Redford handpicked Morrow for his part in the film (Morrow's only high-profile feature film role to date), because he liked his work on ''[[Northern Exposure]]''. Redford also directed [[Matt Damon]] and [[Will Smith]] in ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' (2000). In 2010, Redford released ''[[The Conspirator]]'', a period drama revolving around the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Despite a subject matter of personal interest to Redford, the film received mixed reviews and proved to be a flop at the box office. In 2012, he directed the political thriller [[The Company You Keep (film)|'' The Company You Keep'']] starring himself, [[Shia LaBeouf]] and [[Julie Christie]].\n\n== Awards ==\n{{main|List of awards and nominations received by Robert Redford}}\n[[File:2005 Kennedy Center honorees.jpg|thumb|300px|right|U.S. President [[George W.

In 1993, Redford played what became one of his most popular and recognized roles, starring in ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'' as a millionaire businessman who tests a couple's morals; the film became one of the year's biggest hits.

In ''[[The Clearing (film)|The Clearing]]'' (2004), a thriller co-starring Helen Mirren, Redford was a successful businessman whose kidnapping unearths the secrets and inadequacies that led to his achieving the American Dream.\n\nRedford stepped back into producing with ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'' (2004), a coming-of-age road film about a young medical student, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, and his friend Alberto Granado. It also explored the political and social issues of South America that influenced Guevara and shaped his future.  With five years spent on the film's making, Redford was credited by director Walter Salles for being instrumental in getting it made and released.\n\nBack in front of the camera, Redford received good notices for his role in director [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]]'s ''[[An Unfinished Life]]'' (2005) as a cantankerous rancher who is forced to take in his estranged daughter-in-law (Jennifer Lopez)\u2014whom he blames for his son's death\u2014and the granddaughter he never knew he had when they fled an abusive relationship.  The film, which sat on the shelf for many months while its distributor Miramax was restructured, was generally dismissed as clich\u00e9d and overly sentimental. Meanwhile, Redford returned to familiar territory when he reteamed with [[Meryl Streep]] 22 years after they starred in ''Out of Africa'', for his personal project ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'' (2007), which also starred [[Tom Cruise]]. After a great deal of hype, the film opened to mixed reviews and disappointing box office.\n\nRedford appeared in the 2011 documentary ''[[Buck (film)|Buck]]'' by [[Cindy Meehl]], where he discussed his experiences with title subject [[Buck Brannaman]] during the production of ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]''. In 2012, Redford directed ''[[The Company You Keep (film)|The Company You Keep]]'', in which he starred as a former Weather Underground activist who goes on the run after a journalist discovers his identity. In 2013, he starred in ''[[All Is Lost]]'', directed by J.C. Chandor, about a man lost at sea. He received acclaim for his performance in the film, in which he is its only cast member and there is almost no dialogue. Redford was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]], his first Best Actor nomination for a Golden Globe, and won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor]], his first time winning an acting honour from that group (he had been nominated in 1969 for ''Downhill Racer'').\n\nIn April 2014, Redford appeared in the [[Marvel Studios]] superhero film ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' playing [[Alexander Pierce]], the head of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and leader of the [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] cell operating the Triskelion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/robert-redford-confirms-captain-america-winter-soldier-role-153202834.html |title=Robert Redford Confirms Captain America: The Winter Soldier Role |publisher=[[Yahoo!

As early as 1969, Redford had served as the executive producer for ''[[Downhill Racer]]''.<ref name=tca/> His first film as director was 1980's Best Picture winner ''[[Ordinary People]]'', a drama about the slow disintegration of an [[upper-middle class]] family, for which he won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].<ref name=tca/> Redford was credited with obtaining a powerful dramatic performance from [[Mary Tyler Moore]], as well as superb work from [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Timothy Hutton]], who also won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].\n\nRedford did not direct again until ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' (1988), a well-crafted, though not commercially successful, screen version of [[John Nichols (American writer)|John Nichols]]' acclaimed novel of the Southwest. ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' is the story of the people of Milagro, New Mexico (based on the real town of [[Truchas, New Mexico|Truchas]] in northern New Mexico), overcoming big developers who set about to ruin their community and force them out because of tax increases.  Other directorial projects have included the period drama ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'' (1992), based on [[Norman Maclean]]'s novella, and the expos\u00e9 ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' (1994), about the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s.<ref name=tca/> In the latter film, Redford worked from a screenplay by [[Paul Attanasio]] with noted cinematographer [[Michael Ballhaus]] and a strong cast that featured [[Paul Scofield]], [[John Turturro]], [[Rob Morrow]], and [[Ralph Fiennes]]. Redford handpicked Morrow for his part in the film (Morrow's only high-profile feature film role to date), because he liked his work on ''[[Northern Exposure]]''. Redford also directed [[Matt Damon]] and [[Will Smith]] in ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' (2000). In 2010, Redford released ''[[The Conspirator]]'', a period drama revolving around the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Despite a subject matter of personal interest to Redford, the film received mixed reviews and proved to be a flop at the box office. In 2012, he directed the political thriller [[The Company You Keep (film)|'' The Company You Keep'']] starring himself, [[Shia LaBeouf]] and [[Julie Christie]].\n\n== Awards ==\n{{main|List of awards and nominations received by Robert Redford}}\n[[File:2005 Kennedy Center honorees.jpg|thumb|300px|right|U.S. President [[George W.

Bush]] was the catalyst for his political intrigue, this link between political thought and music became much more evident upon the 2018 release of The Voidz\u2019 album, ''Virtue,'' through which he more explicitly expresses politically-charged ideas.<ref name=\":3\" /> Doing so, Casablancas explains, is using his music as a \u201cmeans to an end to make the world a better place.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> The music industry, according to Casablancas, operates quite similarly to the political world, where \u201cwhoever\u2019s propaganda\u2019s the loudest\u201d is what is popular, regardless of its quality.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2016 Casablancas interviewed [[Henry Giroux]], during which they discuss the idea of whether or not the average American identifies that there are still existing struggles and conflicts that need to be addressed within the country.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rolling Stone|title=Julian Casablancas Interviews Henry Giroux|date=2016-09-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLRWPsIzSOo&list=RD94hM2wkA1mw&index=3|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> Amongst various other issues impending on society today, Casablancas is most concerned with the idea that institutions have become more powerful than democratic government.<ref name=\":3\" /> He proposes that there is a perpetual conflict between those who understand that the democratic nature of the U.S. is lost and those who seek to keep it that way.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is in this way that the music industry reflects the nature of politics- quality and integrity is compromised under the control of capitalist greed.\n\nCasablancas cites some of his most politically influential figures as [[Oliver Stone]], [[Chris Hedges]], [[Jesse Ventura]], and [[Howard Zinn]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He notes [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] as his favorite philosopher, whose work, Casablancas claims, held truth as an important standard value.<ref name=\":3\" /> He recognizes [[Paul Robeson]] as someone who used his musical platform to help further his serious political intrigue and as someone who, therefore, serves as a role model for politically engaged musicians.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCasablancas has been a guest on ''[[Redacted Tonight]]'', as well as included its host, Lee Camp, as an opener for a Voidz show in Houston, Texas in October 2018.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCasablancas endorsed Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], and performed with his band at a rally in the [[University of New Hampshire]] the night before the New Hampshire primary.<ref> {{url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/the-strokes-bernie-sanders-rally-in-new-hampshire/}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy

Bush]] was the catalyst for his political intrigue, this link between political thought and music became much more evident upon the 2018 release of The Voidz\u2019 album, ''Virtue,'' through which he more explicitly expresses politically-charged ideas.<ref name=\":3\" /> Doing so, Casablancas explains, is using his music as a \u201cmeans to an end to make the world a better place.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> The music industry, according to Casablancas, operates quite similarly to the political world, where \u201cwhoever\u2019s propaganda\u2019s the loudest\u201d is what is popular, regardless of its quality.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2016 Casablancas interviewed [[Henry Giroux]], during which they discuss the idea of whether or not the average American identifies that there are still existing struggles and conflicts that need to be addressed within the country.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rolling Stone|title=Julian Casablancas Interviews Henry

most concerned with the idea that institutions have become more powerful than democratic government.<ref name=\":3\" /> He proposes that there is a perpetual conflict between those who understand that the democratic nature of the U.S. is lost and those who seek to keep it that way.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is in this way that the music industry reflects the nature of politics- quality and integrity is compromised under the control of capitalist greed.\n\nCasablancas cites some of his most politically influential figures as [[Oliver Stone]], [[Chris Hedges]], [[Jesse Ventura]], and [[Howard Zinn]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He notes [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] as his favorite philosopher, whose work, Casablancas claims, held truth as an important standard value.<ref name=\":3\" /> He recognizes [[Paul Robeson]] as someone who used his musical platform to help further his serious political intrigue and as someone who, therefore, serves as a role model for politically engaged musicians.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCasablancas has been a guest on ''[[Redacted Tonight]]'', as well as included its host, Lee Camp, as an opener for a Voidz show in Houston, Texas in October 2018.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCasablancas endorsed Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], and performed with his band at a rally in the
