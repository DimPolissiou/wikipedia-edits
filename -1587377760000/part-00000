Deliberate phallic imagery is found in ancient cultures and in the links to ancient cultures found in traditional artifacts.\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] celebrated phallic festivals and built a shrine with an erect phallus to honor [[Hermes]], messenger of the gods. Those figures may be related to the [[ancient Egypt]]ian deity [[Min (god)|Min]] who was depicted holding his erect phallus. Figures of women with a phallus for a head have been found across Greece and [[Yugoslavia]]. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architectural tradition of ancient [[Babylon]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who were deeply superstitious, also often used phallic imagery in their architecture and domestic items. The ancient cultures of many parts of the [[Far East]], including [[Indonesia]], [[India]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]], used the phallus as a symbol of fertility in motifs on their temples and in other areas of everyday life.\n\nScholars of [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[feminism]] have pointed out the symbolic nature of phallic architecture, especially large [[skyscrapers]] which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and political authority. Towers and other vertical structures may unintentionally or perhaps subconsciously have those connotations. There are many examples of modern architecture that can be interpreted as phallic, but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.\n\n==History and background==\n===Antiquity===\n[[File:Phallic Pre-History items at Auberge de Provence 01.jpg|thumb|Phallic [[Pre-History|Temple period]] (3,500 B.C. - 2,500 B.C.) items at the [[National Museum of Archaeology, Malta|National Museum of Archaeology]], Malta<ref>Sagina, Claudia (2015), [https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=qR5TCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA104 The Archeology of Malta], Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|9781107006690}}, p. 104.</ref>]]\n\nThe worship of the phallus has existed since the [[Stone Age]], and was particularly prevalent during the [[Neolithic]] period and the [[Bronze Age]].<ref name=\"Patrick2008\">{{cite book|last=Patrick|first=John|title=Huge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pdREL8ufWpgC&pg=PA9|accessdate=17 September 2012|date=30 May 2008|publisher=STARbooks Press|isbn=978-1-934187-29-6|page=9}}</ref>\n\nPhallic architecture became prominent in [[ancient Egypt]] and Greece, where genitalia and human sexuality received a high degree of attention.

Private bedrooms were designed to \"thrust out from the circular ring of the building, metaphorically representing penetration, the circular ring representing the vaginal passage and womb of the female.<ref name=\"Singley\"/>\n\nThe second revised design is said to \"subliminate both elevated site and female gender\" with a \"lonely phallus\", without the original planned animated circular ring representing the female reproductive organs.<ref name=\"Singley\"/> Ledoux drew upon phallic and sexually charged inspiration in other buildings which he designed. His design of Besan\u00e7on Theatre for instance was fueled by the exigencies of prostitution and ancient sexual ritual.<ref name=\"Singley\"/> However, in comparison to the likes of [[Jean-Jacques Lequeu]], who gained notoriety for his pornographic architectural concoctions, Ledoux's architectural inspiration was relatively mild, and he is said to have omitted towers from his designs on occasion as he was aware that they would be frowned upon shamefully by general society as a too obvious representation of the phallus; Ledoux's \"missing erection\" is explained to this effect in Jacques Lecan's ''Significance of the Missing Phalus''.<ref name=\"Singley\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Oscar Reutersv\u00e4rd]], the interest in neoclassical architecture in the 18th century was synonymous with and motivated by a similar interest in masculine virility.<ref name=\"Singley\"/> Works such as [[Francesco Colonna (writer)|Francesco Colonna]]'s ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' (1467) and [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]'s ''[[Campo Marzio]]'' (1762) show profoundly the ancient influence of phallic architecture in design and worship, and contain numerous illustrations of Priapic temples and architecture.<ref name=\"Singley\"/> Piranesi in particular is said to have offered a \"prototype for the mysterious architecture of phallic worship that more closely resembles the houses of pleasure\" in his etchings.<ref name=\"Singley\"/>\n\nHe located two designs for the Bustum Caesaris Augusti, concluding that they were based upon sexual ritual, with \"two phallic plans penetrating the semicircular cubicula\".  Piranesi believed that the purpose of the phallic designs were to celebrate virility and male regenerative power.<ref name=\"Singley\"/> Other commentators such as [[Carl August Ehrensv\u00e4rd]] also provided illustrations and analysis of Priapic temples and the meaning of phallic architecture.<ref name=\"Singley\"/> A work of note to this effect is ''Neoclassical Temple of Virility and the Buildings with a Phallic Shaped Plan'' (1977) of the Institute for Art History of the [[University of Lund]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"Singley\"/>\n\nIn America, especially in [[Chicago]] and [[New York City|New York]], and numerous other global cities, high rise skyscrapers of phallic shape grew up in the 20th century.

Deliberate phallic imagery is found in ancient cultures and in the links to ancient cultures found in traditional artifacts.\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] celebrated phallic festivals and built a shrine with an erect phallus to honor [[Hermes]], messenger of the gods. Those figures may be related to the [[ancient Egypt]]ian deity [[Min (god)|Min]] who was depicted holding his erect phallus. Figures of women with a phallus for a head have been found across Greece and [[Yugoslavia]]. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architectural tradition of ancient [[Babylon]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who were deeply superstitious, also often used phallic imagery in their architecture and domestic items. The ancient cultures of many parts of the [[Far East]], including [[Indonesia]], [[India]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]], used the phallus as a symbol of fertility in motifs on their temples and in other areas of everyday life.\n\nScholars of [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[feminism]] have pointed out the symbolic nature of phallic architecture, especially large [[skyscrapers]] which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and political authority. Towers and other vertical structures may unintentionally or perhaps subconsciously have those connotations. There are many examples of modern architecture that can be interpreted as phallic, but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.\n\n==History and background==\n===Antiquity===\n[[File:Phallic Pre-History items at Auberge de Provence 01.jpg|thumb|Phallic [[Pre-History|Temple period]] (3,500 B.C. - 2,500 B.C.) items at the [[National Museum of Archaeology, Malta|National Museum of Archaeology]], Malta<ref>Sagina, Claudia (2015), [https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=qR5TCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA104 The Archeology of Malta], Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|9781107006690}}, p. 104.</ref>]]\n\nThe worship of the phallus has existed since the [[Stone Age]], and was particularly prevalent during the [[Neolithic]] period and the [[Bronze Age]].<ref name=\"Patrick2008\">{{cite book|last=Patrick|first=John|title=Huge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pdREL8ufWpgC&pg=PA9|accessdate=17 September 2012|date=30 May 2008|publisher=STARbooks Press|isbn=978-1-934187-29-6|page=9}}</ref>\n\nPhallic architecture became prominent in [[ancient Egypt]] and Greece, where genitalia and human sexuality received a high degree of attention.

Private bedrooms were designed to \"thrust out from the circular ring of the building, metaphorically representing penetration, the circular ring representing the vaginal passage and womb of the female.<ref name=\"Singley\"/>\n\nThe second revised design is said to \"subliminate both elevated site and female gender\" with a \"lonely phallus\", without the original planned animated circular ring representing the female reproductive organs.<ref name=\"Singley\"/> Ledoux drew upon phallic and sexually charged inspiration in other buildings which he designed. His design of Besan\u00e7on Theatre for instance was fueled by the exigencies of prostitution and ancient sexual ritual.<ref name=\"Singley\"/> However, in comparison to the likes of [[Jean-Jacques Lequeu]], who gained notoriety for his pornographic architectural concoctions, Ledoux's architectural inspiration was relatively mild, and he is said to have omitted towers from his designs on occasion as he was aware that they would be frowned upon shamefully by general society as a too obvious representation of the phallus; Ledoux's \"missing erection\" is explained to this effect in Jacques Lecan's ''Significance of the Missing Phalus''.<ref name=\"Singley\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Oscar Reutersv\u00e4rd]], the interest in neoclassical architecture in the 18th century was synonymous with and motivated by a similar interest in masculine virility.<ref name=\"Singley\"/> Works such as [[Francesco Colonna (writer)|Francesco Colonna]]'s ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' (1467) and [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]'s ''[[Campo Marzio]]'' (1762) show profoundly the ancient influence of phallic architecture in design and worship, and contain numerous illustrations of Priapic temples and architecture.<ref name=\"Singley\"/> Piranesi in particular is said to have offered a \"prototype for the mysterious architecture of phallic worship that more closely resembles the houses of pleasure\" in his etchings.<ref name=\"Singley\"/>\n\nHe located two designs for the Bustum Caesaris Augusti, concluding that they were based upon sexual ritual, with \"two phallic plans penetrating the semicircular cubicula\".

The name is derived from the name of an [[extinct language]] called ''[[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]'' or ''Muysccubun'', once spoken by the people who lived on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] of which the city of [[Bogot\u00e1]] was the southern capital at the time of the Spanish [[Conquista]]. However, genetic and linguistic data now indicate that the original heart of Chibchan languages and Chibchan-speaking peoples may not have been in Colombia at all, but in the area of the [[Costa Rica]]-[[Panama]] border, where one finds the greatest variety of Chibchan languages.\n\n==External relations==\nA larger family called ''[[Macro-Chibchan]]'', which would contain the [[Misumalpan languages]], [[Xinca language|Xinca]], and [[Lenca language|Lenca]], was found convincing by Kaufman (1990).{{fcn|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Classification==\n* A\n** Waim\u00ed (Guaymi)\n*** [[Guaym\u00ed language|Guaym\u00ed]] (Ng\u00e4bere, Movere) \u2013 170,000 speakers, vulnerable in [[Panama]], endangered in [[Costa Rica]]\n*** [[Buglere language|Buglere]] (Bogot\u00e1) \u2013 18,000 speakers, endangered\n** [[Boruca language|Bor\u0169ca]] (Brunca) \u2013 140 speakers, moribund\n** [[Talamanca languages|Talamanca]]\n*** [[Huetar language|Huetar]] (G\u00fcetar) \u2020\n*** [[Bribri language|Bribri]] (Talamanca), 7,000 speakers \u2013 vulnerable in [[Costa Rica]], endangered in [[Panama]]\n*** [[Cab\u00e9car language|Cab\u00e9car]] (Talamanca) \u2013 8,800 speakers, vulnerable\n*** [[Teribe language|Teribe]] (Norte\u00f1o) \u2013 3,300 speakers, endangered\n* B\n** [[Paya language|Pech]] (Paya) \u2013 990 speakers, endangered\n** [[Dorasque language|Dorasque]] \u2020\n** [[Votic languages|Votic]]\n*** [[Rama language|Rama]] \u2013 740 speakers, moribund\n*** [[Voto language|Voto]] \u2020\n*** [[Mal\u00e9ku language|Mal\u00e9ku]] (Guatuso) \u2013 750 speakers, endangered\n*** [[Corobic\u00ed language|Corobic\u00ed]] \u2013 northwestern Costa Rica \u2020\n** Cuna\u2013Colombian\n*** [[Kuna language|Kuna]] (Dulegaya) \u2013 60,600 speakers, vulnerable in [[Panama]], endangered in [[Colombia]]\n*** Chibcha\u2013Motilon\n**** [[Bar\u00ed language|Bar\u00ed]] (Motil\u00f3n) \u2013 5,000 speakers, vulnerable\n**** Chibcha\u2013Tunebo\n***** [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] \u2020\n***** [[Duit language|Duit]] (Muisca) \u2020\n***** [[Uwa language|U'wa]] (Tunebo) \u2013 2,550 speakers, endangered\n***** [[Guanes|Guane]] \u2020 \u2013 Colombia\n*** Arwako\u2013Chimila\n**** [[Chimila language|Chimila]] \u2013 350 speakers, endangered\n**** Arwako\n***** [[Wiwa language|Wiwa]] (Malayo, Guamaca) \u2013 1,850 speakers, endangered\n***** [[Kankuamo language|Kankuamo]] \u2020\n***** [[Arhuaco language|Arhuaco]] (Ika) \u2013 8,000 speakers, vulnerable\n***** [[Kogi language|Kogi]] ([[Cogui]]) \u2013 9,910 speakers, vulnerable\n\nThe extinct languages of [[Santa Fe de Antioquia|Antioquia]], [[Old Cat\u00edo]] and [[Nutabe language|Nutabe]] have been shown to be Chibchan (Adelaar & Muysken, 2004:49). The language of the '''[[Tairona]]''' is unattested, apart from a single word, but may well be one of the Arwako languages still spoken in the Santa Marta range. The [[Zen\u00fa]] {{sc|aka}} Sin\u00fa language of northern Colombia is also sometimes included, as are the [[Malibu languages]], though without any factual basis.\n\n{{ill|Adolfo Constenla Uma\u00f1a|es}} argues that [[Cueva language|Cueva]], the extinct dominant language of Pre-Columbian Panama long assumed to be Chibchan based on a misinterpreted Kuna vocabulary, was actually [[Choco languages|Chocoan]], but there is little evidence.\n\nThe [[Cof\u00e1n language]] (Kof\u00e1n, Kofane, A'i) of Ecuador and Colombia has been erroneously included in Chibchan due to borrowed vocabulary.\n\n==Varieties==\nBelow is a full list of Chibchan language varieties listed by [[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968), including names of unattested varieties.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n;Rama group\n*'''Rama''' - language spoken around [[Bluefields]] Lagoon and on the [[Escondido River (Nicaragua)|Rama River]], Nicaragua.\n*'''Melchora''' - extinct language once spoken on the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan Melchoras River]], Nicaragua.
