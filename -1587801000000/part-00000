As a child, she trained as an Olympic gymnast and as a dancer. Her father died when she was 6. She moved to Texas with her family as a teenager in 1992 where she lived for one year. She and her family moved back to Guadalajara, and in 1994 Elis moved to Quer\u00e9taro Mexico to her aunt's. \nShe shortened her name to Elis, inspired by [[Elis Regina]].\n\n== Learning music ==\nAfter moving to Quer\u00e9taro, her aunt and uncle started her in music lessons, as all of her cousins studied music. Elis has been known to say that what she really wanted was to continue with her dancing in the hopes of becoming a professional dancer. She learned to play the Saxophone and music in general, but by a twist of fate some of her friends signed her up (unbeknownst to her) for a singing contest at school in Quer\u00e9taro, where she ended up in second place. It was there she realized that she wanted a career as a singer.\nElis then moved back to Guadalajara where, a year later, she started singing for the local band La Verdad No Importa, from where she was later fired because she \"didn\u2019t sing that good\". After that rejection she took singing and guitar lessons in order to start writing her own songs.\nIn 2000, after being in a couple of more local bands, she started formal music studies at CEDART for a couple of years. While studying there, she held a job doing press and PR for different concert promoters in Guadalajara.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 2002-2003: First demos ===\nShe interrupted her studies in 2002 and moved to [[London]] England for one year, where she began writing some of the songs she would later release as Elis Paprika. She held a job as a waitress during her stay in London. She returned to Guadalajara M\u00e9xico in 2003 where she started a band called The Paprikas, with a local musician named Raul Velazquez (not to be confused with Ra\u00fal \"Rul\" Velazquez, who would later be Elis\u2019 guitar player in The Black Pilgrims). At that point people began referring to her as \"Elis from the Paprikas\" or \"Elis Paprika\", the name she later adopted. After a few tries with The Paprikas, Elis recorded a demo for the song \"Sunny Day\", working with Shaboomy (later guitar player for [[Azul Violeta]]), and Eric Diaz, guitar player and bass player respectively from the band The Waitress<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/thewaitress The Waitress official band page]</ref> from Guadalajara M\u00e9xico. The Waitress was originally Elis\u2019 first solo project. The name of the band was inspired by her time working as a waitress in London and Guadalajara before making music. Once she began to be recognized as \"Elis Paprika\" and making more music apart from her project, Elis left The Waitress. The other members of The Waitress continued without her.\n\n=== 2004: ''Elis Paprika'' ===\nIn February 2004, Elis\u2019 showed the demo of \"Sunny Day\", to Luke Castillo, who was then playing guitar and singing for the band Becker. Luke liked what he heard and they started working together, and this is where Elis Paprika was formally established, with Luke Castillo on Guitar, Richo Acosta on Guitar, Chumino on Bass, and Chicho (also playing with the band Plastiko), on Drums. With this lineup, Elis recorded the demo for the song \"Give Me Love\". \nChicho left the band and Arnold Benz briefly became the drummer. They recorded demo versions of the songs \"Bitch\" and \"Texas\" with him.\nArnold left the band and Richo Acosta called Willy Gonzalez, from another band he played in, to take over the drums.\nLater, Jorge \"Gordo\" Miramontes came in on bass after Chumino left the band. At this point, and with this lineup, they all decided to work as a band instead of Elis being a solo artist. Elis Paprika then became the name of the band. \nTheir first live show as Elis Paprika took place in Guadalajara Jalisco M\u00e9xico, on December 14, 2004 at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara.\n\n=== 2005-2006: ''Give Me Love'' ===\nElis Paprika began playing in several venues and quickly ascended in Guadalajara's rock scene. They played Sol Radiante Festival, Zapopum Festival, and the Hard Rock Live at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara on several occasions. It was during one of these performances that people from Suave Records became interested in Elis Paprika, signing them in 2005. Under this label, Elis Paprika released the record ''Give Me Love'' in 2006, produced by Luke Castillo and Richo Acosta, and was licensed to [[Sony Music Mexico]] for its distribution in Mexico.\n\nThe first single, \"Give Me Love\", had a fast and big acceptance, and consequently Elis was invited to play at the Festival Vive Latino in 2006 and [[Corona Capital]], also in 2006. In August of that same year, Elis Paprika was named \"Band of the Month\" on [[MTV]]. After this, MTV invited Elis Paprika to perform live for a recording of the program ''Alerta''.\n\nThe song \"No Puedo\" was released as the second single in October 2006. In November 2006 [[Julieta Venegas]] invited Elis Paprika to play on her first [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] performance in Mexico City.\n\nAs all of this was taking place, contractual problems began to surface between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records.\n\n=== 2007\u20132008: ''EP2'', and Juan Gabriel tribute ===\nAfter the success of ''Give Me Love'', problems between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records increased to the point where the impulse the band had, came to a halt.\n\nIn early 2007, Elis requested Suave Records to release her, resulting in a lawsuit.\n\nLuke Castillo decided to leave the band to concentrate on his other band Becker, and Ram\u00f3n \"Zacky\" Velarde took his place in the band.\n\nElis recorded her voice for the original score of short film ''Jacinta'', winner of the Festival de Cine de Morelia, from director Karla Casta\u00f1eda, with music by Gilberto Cervantes.

EP2 was released that same year, but only through free download on the [[Internet]].\n\nEarly in 2008, Elis Paprika was invited to be a part of the [[Juan Gabriel]] tribute album called ''Amo al Divo de Ju\u00e1rez''. For this, Elis recorded her own version of the Juan Gabriel song \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\". The record came out, with her version of the song as one of the official singles.\n\nElis Paprika played on December 8, 2006 for a [[Green Peace]] event in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in a campaign against illegal fishing in protected waters.<ref>[https://www.proceso.com.mx/223794/garantizan-elizondo-y-cardenas-la-proteccion-del-golfo-de-california-greenpeace Link to article by Proceso Magazine about this Greenpeace event in Puerto Vallarta]</ref>\n\nIn late 2008 Elis and Suave Records settled their lawsuit, and the band was released from their contract with Suave Records, allowing Elis to concentrate on her band and performances. She signed under new management with Zepeda Bros.\n\n=== 2009: ''Express'' ===\nAt the beginning of 2009, \"Gordo\" quit the band, and was replaced by Omar \u201cLa Do\u00f1a\u201d Gil on bass, who stayed with the band until early 2010.\n\nElis Paprika began 2009 with new live performances and writing new songs, and in May of that year, entered the studio to record the songs that would eventually become her album \"Maldito\", produced by Guido Laris. Originally intended to be released as two separate EP's, the songs were recorded at Montecristo Studios in Mexico City, but once they were ready, it wouldn't be released until some time later, due to differences with her management over the way to handle promotion as an independent release, or through a label.\n\nThat summer, Sony Music M\u00e9xico invited Elis Paprika to be a part of ''Tributo A: Ana Jos\u00e9 Nacho (Mecano)'', a Mecano Tribute record, where she recorded her version of the song \"No Tienes Nada Que Perder\".\n\n[[Juan Gabriel]] invited Elis to perform live with him on one of his concerts at [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] in Mexico City, to sing her version of \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\" live.<ref>Video of Elis Paprika performing with Juan Gabriel at Auditorio Nacional Mexico [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9BXKpo83zc]</ref>\n\nAfter not being able to release the songs she recorded that May, Elis Paprika entered the studio once more in Guadalajara at Richo Acosta's studio to record new and previously unreleased songs. ''Express'' was released, produced by Richo Acosta, and licensed to EMI Music M\u00e9xico for distribution, in October 2009, being this her first record to officially be promoted since ''Give Me Love'' in 2006. The first single from ''Express'' was \"Tarde o Temprano\".\n\n=== 2010-2011: ''Maldito'' ===\nAfter differences with her bandmates, Elis decided in early 2010, in the middle of promoting ''Express'', not to continue working with the same musicians in her band. They went their separate ways and Elis went back to being a solo artist. This interrupted the promotion of ''Express''.\n \nLuke Castillo came back to play and support Elis on guitars, and had a major role in putting a band back together. Luke invited [[Paul Richards (artist)|Paul Richards]] to play bass, and two other members of the band Aurum from Guadalajara, Vela and Luis Angel, to play guitar and drums respectively.\n \nIn May 2010, Elis moved to Mexico City in order to continue and better the handling of her career and to promote future plans. Working with Zepeda Bros. Elis decided to finally use the songs that had been recorded a year before, and since these songs had been on hold for over a year, it was decided to released them as one LP, instead of the two EPs they were originally meant for. It was because of all the time that these songs were on hold, that she named the LP ''Maldito'', which in Spanish means \"Cursed\".\n\nMeanwhile, Elis began to make new acoustic performances of her songs in unplugged shows, featuring Ernesto \"Arbol\" Licona, and Ana L\u00eda Perez, on guitars. Ernesto Licona has been constantly playing guitar on Elis\u2019 performances ever since.\n \nThat August, Vela and Luis Angel retook their labors with Aurum, and Elis invited Raul \"Rul\" Velazquez to play guitar, and Jimmy Strike, from the band Cherry Strike from Guadalajara to play drums. With this lineup, Elis played the 212 Festival by RMX, in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico, on September 12, 2010. This concert marked the beginning of her \"Maldito Tour\".\n\nThat October, after a couple of shows, Jimmy left the band to retake activities with Cherry Strike, and Cachi Zazueta became the permanent drummer.\n \nMaldito was officially released in late November 2010 under Zepeda Bros., Warner Chappell M\u00e9xico, and Dr\u00e1gora Records. It hit stores nationwide in Mexico, and on [[iTunes]] internationally.\n\nThe Maldito Tour went on until mid-2011, reaching most of Mexico. During this tour, Elis played the [[Vive Latino]] Festival for the second time, on March 8, 2011.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esCfj-psnao Video of Elis Paprika performing at Vive Latino 2011]</ref> Maldito became the record to reposition her in Mexico's Rock scene.\n\nAt the end of the Maldito Tour, in July 2011, Elis ended her working relationship with, her then management office, Zepeda Bros. and continued as a completely independent artist, handling her own office. Elis recorded the single \"Love Love Love\" at Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco, produced by Luke Castillo, which was officially released on August 4, 2011, initially as a free download through [[SoundCloud]], as a \"thank you\" to all of her fans for the success of Maldito. \"Love Love Love\" is part of the Chilean movie ''Que Pena Tu Boda''{{'}}s soundtrack, as the main credits theme,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924354/soundtrack?ref_=tt_ql_trv_7 IMDb page for Que Pena Tu Boda soundtracks]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |title=Que Pena Tu Boda the movie\u2019s official web page |access-date=2012-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904215142/http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> making this Elis' debut in South America.\n\nIn October 2011, Elis along with Rul and Cachi, from her band, got together in Guadalajara to begin writing ''Animal''. That same month, they entered Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco to record the songs, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez.\n\n=== 2012-2013: ''Animal'' ===\nElis released ''Animal'' in February 2012, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez, under Dr\u00e1gora Records. For this record, her band since the Maldito Tour of 2010-2011, adopted the name The Black Pilgrims. The song \"Animal\" was the first single.\n\nIn January 2012, Luke Castillo left the band once again, to concentrate on studio work, and was replaced by Stepha Campbell on guitars. In July 2012, Paul Richards left the band.

As a child, she trained as an Olympic gymnast and as a dancer. Her father died when she was 6. She moved to Texas with her family as a teenager in 1992 where she lived for one year. She and her family moved back to Guadalajara, and in 1994 Elis moved to Quer\u00e9taro Mexico to her aunt's. \nShe shortened her name to Elis, inspired by [[Elis Regina]].\n\n== Learning music ==\nAfter moving to Quer\u00e9taro, her aunt and uncle started her in music lessons, as all of her cousins studied music. Elis has been known to say that what she really wanted was to continue with her dancing in the hopes of becoming a professional dancer. She learned to play the Saxophone and music in general, but by a twist of fate some of her friends signed her up (unbeknownst to her) for a singing contest at school in Quer\u00e9taro, where she ended up in second place. It was there she realized that she wanted a career as a singer.\nElis then moved back to Guadalajara where, a year later, she started singing for the local band La Verdad No Importa, from where she was later fired because she \"didn\u2019t sing that good\". After that rejection she took singing and guitar lessons in order to start writing her own songs.\nIn 2000, after being in a couple of more local bands, she started formal music studies at CEDART for a couple of years. While studying there, she held a job doing press and PR for different concert promoters in Guadalajara.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 2002-2003: First demos ===\nShe interrupted her studies in 2002 and moved to [[London]] England for one year, where she began writing some of the songs she would later release as Elis Paprika. She held a job as a waitress during her stay in London. She returned to Guadalajara M\u00e9xico in 2003 where she started a band called The Paprikas, with a local musician named Raul Velazquez (not to be confused with Ra\u00fal \"Rul\" Velazquez, who would later be Elis\u2019 guitar player in The Black Pilgrims). At that point people began referring to her as \"Elis from the Paprikas\" or \"Elis Paprika\", the name she later adopted. After a few tries with The Paprikas, Elis recorded a demo for the song \"Sunny Day\", working with Shaboomy (later guitar player for [[Azul Violeta]]), and Eric Diaz, guitar player and bass player respectively from the band The Waitress<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/thewaitress The Waitress official band page]</ref> from Guadalajara M\u00e9xico. The Waitress was originally Elis\u2019 first solo project. The name of the band was inspired by her time working as a waitress in London and Guadalajara before making music. Once she began to be recognized as \"Elis Paprika\" and making more music apart from her project, Elis left The Waitress. The other members of The Waitress continued without her.\n\n=== 2004: ''Elis Paprika'' ===\nIn February 2004, Elis\u2019 showed the demo of \"Sunny Day\", to Luke Castillo, who was then playing guitar and singing for the band Becker. Luke liked what he heard and they started working together, and this is where Elis Paprika was formally established, with Luke Castillo on Guitar, Richo Acosta on Guitar, Chumino on Bass, and Chicho (also playing with the band Plastiko), on Drums. With this lineup, Elis recorded the demo for the song \"Give Me Love\". \nChicho left the band and Arnold Benz briefly became the drummer. They recorded demo versions of the songs \"Bitch\" and \"Texas\" with him.\nArnold left the band and Richo Acosta called Willy Gonzalez, from another band he played in, to take over the drums.\nLater, Jorge \"Gordo\" Miramontes came in on bass after Chumino left the band. At this point, and with this lineup, they all decided to work as a band instead of Elis being a solo artist. Elis Paprika then became the name of the band. \nTheir first live show as Elis Paprika took place in Guadalajara Jalisco M\u00e9xico, on December 14, 2004 at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara.\n\n=== 2005-2006: ''Give Me Love'' ===\nElis Paprika began playing in several venues and quickly ascended in Guadalajara's rock scene. They played Sol Radiante Festival, Zapopum Festival, and the Hard Rock Live at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara on several occasions. It was during one of these performances that people from Suave Records became interested in Elis Paprika, signing them in 2005. Under this label, Elis Paprika released the record ''Give Me Love'' in 2006, produced by Luke Castillo and Richo Acosta, and was licensed to [[Sony Music Mexico]] for its distribution in Mexico.\n\nThe first single, \"Give Me Love\", had a fast and big acceptance, and consequently Elis was invited to play at the Festival Vive Latino in 2006 and [[Corona Capital]], also in 2006. In August of that same year, Elis Paprika was named \"Band of the Month\" on [[MTV]]. After this, MTV invited Elis Paprika to perform live for a recording of the program ''Alerta''.\n\nThe song \"No Puedo\" was released as the second single in October 2006. In November 2006 [[Julieta Venegas]] invited Elis Paprika to play on her first [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] performance in Mexico City.\n\nAs all of this was taking place, contractual problems began to surface between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records.\n\n=== 2007\u20132008: ''EP2'', and Juan Gabriel tribute ===\nAfter the success of ''Give Me Love'', problems between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records increased to the point where the impulse the band had, came to a halt.\n\nIn early 2007, Elis requested Suave Records to release her, resulting in a lawsuit.\n\nLuke Castillo decided to leave the band to concentrate on his other band Becker, and Ram\u00f3n \"Zacky\" Velarde took his place in the band.\n\nElis recorded her voice for the original score of short film ''Jacinta'', winner of the Festival de Cine de Morelia, from director Karla Casta\u00f1eda, with music by Gilberto Cervantes. ''Jacinta'' was also shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] that same year.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1206015/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast IMDb page for Jacinta Full Cast and Crew, mentioning Elis Paprika as singer for original score]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.moreliafilmfest.com/ficha.php?id=991 |title=Morelia Film Festival official web page |access-date=2012-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513191359/http://moreliafilmfest.com/ficha.php?id=991 |archive-date=2012-05-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh18GDdwhTc Jacinta Short Film. Final credits mention Elis Paprika as \"Vocal Interpretation\"]</ref>\n\nElis Paprika recorded ''EP2'' in 2007, but this second record did not see a formal release due to the lawsuit with Suave Records. EP2 was released that same year, but only through free download on the [[Internet]].\n\nEarly in 2008, Elis Paprika was invited to be a part of the [[Juan Gabriel]] tribute album called ''Amo al Divo de Ju\u00e1rez''. For this, Elis recorded her own version of the Juan Gabriel song \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\". The record came out, with her version of the song as one of the official singles.\n\nElis Paprika played on December 8, 2006 for a [[Green Peace]] event in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in a campaign against illegal fishing in protected waters.<ref>[https://www.proceso.com.mx/223794/garantizan-elizondo-y-cardenas-la-proteccion-del-golfo-de-california-greenpeace Link to article by Proceso Magazine about this Greenpeace event in Puerto Vallarta]</ref>\n\nIn late 2008 Elis and Suave Records settled their lawsuit, and the band was released from their contract with Suave Records, allowing Elis to concentrate on her band and performances. She signed under new management with Zepeda Bros.\n\n=== 2009: ''Express'' ===\nAt the beginning of 2009, \"Gordo\" quit the band, and was replaced by Omar \u201cLa Do\u00f1a\u201d Gil on bass, who stayed with the band until early 2010.\n\nElis Paprika began 2009 with new live performances and writing new songs, and in May of that year, entered the studio to record the songs that would eventually become her album \"Maldito\", produced by Guido Laris. Originally intended to be released as two separate EP's, the songs were recorded at Montecristo Studios in Mexico City, but once they were ready, it wouldn't be released until some time later, due to differences with her management over the way to handle promotion as an independent release, or through a label.\n\nThat summer, Sony Music M\u00e9xico invited Elis Paprika to be a part of ''Tributo A: Ana Jos\u00e9 Nacho (Mecano)'', a Mecano Tribute record, where she recorded her version of the song \"No Tienes Nada Que Perder\".\n\n[[Juan Gabriel]] invited Elis to perform live with him on one of his concerts at [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] in Mexico City, to sing her version of \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\" live.<ref>Video of Elis Paprika performing with Juan Gabriel at Auditorio Nacional Mexico [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9BXKpo83zc]</ref>\n\nAfter not being able to release the songs she recorded that May, Elis Paprika entered the studio once more in Guadalajara at Richo Acosta's studio to record new and previously unreleased songs. ''Express'' was released, produced by Richo Acosta, and licensed to EMI Music M\u00e9xico for distribution, in October 2009, being this her first record to officially be promoted since ''Give Me Love'' in 2006. The first single from ''Express'' was \"Tarde o Temprano\".\n\n=== 2010-2011: ''Maldito'' ===\nAfter differences with her bandmates, Elis decided in early 2010, in the middle of promoting ''Express'', not to continue working with the same musicians in her band. They went their separate ways and Elis went back to being a solo artist. This interrupted the promotion of ''Express''.\n \nLuke Castillo came back to play and support Elis on guitars, and had a major role in putting a band back together. Luke invited [[Paul Richards (artist)|Paul Richards]] to play bass, and two other members of the band Aurum from Guadalajara, Vela and Luis Angel, to play guitar and drums respectively.\n \nIn May 2010, Elis moved to Mexico City in order to continue and better the handling of her career and to promote future plans. Working with Zepeda Bros. Elis decided to finally use the songs that had been recorded a year before, and since these songs had been on hold for over a year, it was decided to released them as one LP, instead of the two EPs they were originally meant for. It was because of all the time that these songs were on hold, that she named the LP ''Maldito'', which in Spanish means \"Cursed\".\n\nMeanwhile, Elis began to make new acoustic performances of her songs in unplugged shows, featuring Ernesto \"Arbol\" Licona, and Ana L\u00eda Perez, on guitars. Ernesto Licona has been constantly playing guitar on Elis\u2019 performances ever since.\n \nThat August, Vela and Luis Angel retook their labors with Aurum, and Elis invited Raul \"Rul\" Velazquez to play guitar, and Jimmy Strike, from the band Cherry Strike from Guadalajara to play drums. With this lineup, Elis played the 212 Festival by RMX, in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico, on September 12, 2010. This concert marked the beginning of her \"Maldito Tour\".\n\nThat October, after a couple of shows, Jimmy left the band to retake activities with Cherry Strike, and Cachi Zazueta became the permanent drummer.\n \nMaldito was officially released in late November 2010 under Zepeda Bros., Warner Chappell M\u00e9xico, and Dr\u00e1gora Records. It hit stores nationwide in Mexico, and on [[iTunes]] internationally.\n\nThe Maldito Tour went on until mid-2011, reaching most of Mexico. During this tour, Elis played the [[Vive Latino]] Festival for the second time, on March 8, 2011.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esCfj-psnao Video of Elis Paprika performing at Vive Latino 2011]</ref> Maldito became the record to reposition her in Mexico's Rock scene.\n\nAt the end of the Maldito Tour, in July 2011, Elis ended her working relationship with, her then management office, Zepeda Bros. and continued as a completely independent artist, handling her own office. Elis recorded the single \"Love Love Love\" at Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco, produced by Luke Castillo, which was officially released on August 4, 2011, initially as a free download through [[SoundCloud]], as a \"thank you\" to all of her fans for the success of Maldito. \"Love Love Love\" is part of the Chilean movie ''Que Pena Tu Boda''{{'}}s soundtrack, as the main credits theme,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924354/soundtrack?ref_=tt_ql_trv_7 IMDb page for Que Pena Tu Boda soundtracks]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |title=Que Pena Tu Boda the movie\u2019s official web page |access-date=2012-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904215142/http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> making this Elis' debut in South America.\n\nIn October 2011, Elis along with Rul and Cachi, from her band, got together in Guadalajara to begin writing ''Animal''. That same month, they entered Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco to record the songs, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez.\n\n=== 2012-2013: ''Animal'' ===\nElis released ''Animal'' in February 2012, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez, under Dr\u00e1gora Records. For this record, her band since the Maldito Tour of 2010-2011, adopted the name The Black Pilgrims. The song \"Animal\" was the first single.\n\nIn January 2012, Luke Castillo left the band once again, to concentrate on studio work, and was replaced by Stepha Campbell on guitars. In July 2012, Paul Richards left the band.

This included replacing the obsolete steam-powered icebreakers with more powerful diesel-electric vessels and culminated with the construction of [[Lenin (1957 icebreaker)|the first nuclear-powered icebreaker]] in the late 1950s. The second phase, which began in the early 1970s and continued until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], further expanded the Soviet icebreaker fleet with new nuclear- and diesel-powered icebreakers that enabled uninterrupted year-round operation in the western part of the Northern Sea Route as well as extended the navigating season in the eastern sector.<ref name=\"poac95\">{{Citation|last1=Tsoy|first1=L.G.|last2=Stoyanov|first2=I.A.|last3=Mikhailichenko|first3=V.V.|last4=Livshits|first4=S.G.|contribution=Perspective types of Arctic icebreakers and their principal characteristics|year=1995|title=Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Port and Ocean Engineering under Arctic Conditions, 1995 (POAC'95)|volume=1|pages=13\u201326|contribution-url=http://www.poac.com/Papers/POAC95_V1_all.pdf}}</ref>\n\nWhile traffic volumes along the Northern Sea Route declined drastically in the early 1990s due to the slowdown of the Russian economy,<ref name=\"councilofeurope\">{{Citation|year=1998|title=Les D\u00e9fis Pour la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne \u00c0 L'aube de L'an 2000: Strat\u00e9gies Pour Un D\u00e9veloppement Durable Des Etats Du Nord de L'Europe|publisher=Council of Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pD0ys7ejE1IC|page=94}}</ref> a new fleet renewal program was nonetheless initiated. Studies by the [[Central Marine Research and Design Institute]] (CNIIMF) and the [[Central Design Bureau \"Iceberg\"]] resulted in \"icebreaker type size series\" ranging from 7-megawatt auxiliary icebreakers (LK-7) to a 110-megawatt nuclear-powered \"icebreaker-leaders\" (LK-110Ya). One of the proposed new icebreaker classes, LK-60Ya, was developed as a direct replacement for the previous-generation [[Arktika-class icebreaker|''Arktika''-class]] nuclear-powered icebreakers which had entered service in the late 1970s and seen widespread use in the Russian Arctic for decades.<ref name=\"poac95\" /> On the [[Dudinka]]\u2013[[Murmansk]] route, they were also intended to replace the shallow-draft nuclear-powered icebreakers [[Taymyr (1987 icebreaker)|''Taymyr'']] and [[Vaygach (1989 icebreaker)|''Vaygach'']] which operated primarily in the [[Yenisei River]] [[estuary]]. This was made possible by the dual-draft functionality of the new icebreakers, ability to de-ballast the vessel when approaching coastal areas. During the summer-autumn navigation season, the icebreakers would be used along the full length of the Northern Sea Route from Murmansk all the way to the [[Bering Strait]].<ref name=\"icetech94\">{{Citation|last=Tsoy|first=L.G.|contribution=New generation Arktika class nuclear icebreaker feasibility study|year=1994|title=Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Ships and Marine Structures in Cold Regions, 1994 (ICETECH'95)|pages=P1\u2013P8}}</ref>\n\nThe technical characteristics of the next-generation nuclear-powered icebreakers were drawn from the Russians' extensive operational experience from Arctic shipping. For example, it was determined that in order to ensure reliable year-round navigation in the western part of the Northern Sea Route, the icebreaker would have to be capable of breaking at least {{convert|2.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} ice, an improvement over the old ''Arktika''{{'}}s {{convert|2.3|m|ft|0|adj=on}} icebreaking capability. In addition, escorting Russian Arctic cargo ships such as the [[SA-15 (ship)|SA-15 type]] safely and efficiently in heavy ice conditions would require an icebreaker with a beam of {{convert|32|to|33|m|ft|0}} and a displacement of {{convert|34000|to|36000|t|LT}}.<ref name=\"poac95\" /><ref name=\"icetech94\" />\n\nAlthough the preliminary designs were developed already in the early 1990s,<ref name=\"icetech94\" /> the LK-60Ya design was finalized in 2009 as Project 22220 by Central Design Bureau \"Iceberg\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorship.com/news101/ships-and-shipyards/largest-icebreaker-construction-now-underway|title=Largest icebreaker construction now underway|date=26 January 2014|publisher=The Motorship|accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref> The construction of the [[lead ship]] was awarded to [[Saint Petersburg]]-based [[Baltic Shipyard]], part of the state-owned [[United Shipbuilding Corporation]], in August 2012 with a contract price of 36.959 billion [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (about US$1.16 billion).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/year-2012-news/august/552--baltic-shipyard-to-build-new-large-nuclear-powered-icebreaker-project-22220-lc-60ya.html|title=Baltic Shipyard to build new large nuclear-powered icebreaker (Project 22220 LC-60YA)|publisher=Navy Recognition|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref> A 84.4 billion ruble (about US$2.4 billion) follow-up contract for two additional vessels was signed in May 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.veus.de/index.php/de/news/128-baltic-shipyard-building-nuclear-icebreaker|title=Baltic Shipyard building nuclear icebreaker|publisher=VEUS e.V.|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://barentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2014/05/baltiysky-shipyard-build-three-new-icebreakers-2020-08-05|title=Baltiysky Shipyard to build three new icebreakers by 2020|publisher=Barents Observer|date=8 May 2014|accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref> and a second contract, worth over 100 billion rubles (about US$1.5 billion), for two more in August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.portnews.ru/digest/21237/|title=Atomflot Inks Contract for Another Two Nuclear-Powered Icebreakers|publisher=PortNews|date=5 September 2019|accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2019/08/russias-atomflot-orders-4th-5th-project-22220-nuclear-powered-icebreakers/|title=Russia\u2019s ATOMFLOT Orders 4th & 5th Project 22220 Nuclear-Powered Icebreakers|publisher=Naval News|date=11 August 2019|accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref> This brings the total number of Project 22220 nuclear-powered icebreakers under construction or on order to five.\n\nWith the Project 22220 icebreakers under construction, focus has moved to the development of even larger and more powerful nuclear-powered icebreakers known as [[Project 10510 icebreaker|Project 10510 Lider]].\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Sibir (Project 22220 nuclear-powered icebreaker) in December 2018.

This included replacing the obsolete steam-powered icebreakers with more powerful diesel-electric vessels and culminated with the construction of [[Lenin (1957 icebreaker)|the first nuclear-powered icebreaker]] in the late 1950s. The second phase, which began in the early 1970s and continued until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], further expanded the Soviet icebreaker fleet with new nuclear- and diesel-powered icebreakers that enabled uninterrupted year-round operation in the western part of the Northern Sea Route as well as extended the navigating season in the eastern sector.<ref name=\"poac95\">{{Citation|last1=Tsoy|first1=L.G.|last2=Stoyanov|first2=I.A.|last3=Mikhailichenko|first3=V.V.|last4=Livshits|first4=S.G.|contribution=Perspective types of Arctic icebreakers and their principal characteristics|year=1995|title=Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Port and Ocean Engineering under Arctic Conditions, 1995 (POAC'95)|volume=1|pages=13\u201326|contribution-url=http://www.poac.com/Papers/POAC95_V1_all.pdf}}</ref>\n\nWhile traffic volumes along the Northern Sea Route declined drastically in the early 1990s due to the slowdown of the Russian economy,<ref name=\"councilofeurope\">{{Citation|year=1998|title=Les D\u00e9fis Pour la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne \u00c0 L'aube de L'an 2000: Strat\u00e9gies Pour Un D\u00e9veloppement Durable Des Etats Du Nord de L'Europe|publisher=Council of Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pD0ys7ejE1IC|page=94}}</ref> a new fleet renewal program was nonetheless initiated. Studies by the [[Central Marine Research and Design Institute]] (CNIIMF) and the [[Central Design Bureau \"Iceberg\"]] resulted in \"icebreaker type size series\" ranging from 7-megawatt auxiliary icebreakers (LK-7) to a 110-megawatt nuclear-powered \"icebreaker-leaders\" (LK-110Ya). One of the proposed new icebreaker classes, LK-60Ya, was developed as a direct replacement for the previous-generation [[Arktika-class icebreaker|''Arktika''-class]] nuclear-powered icebreakers which had entered service in the late 1970s and seen widespread use in the Russian Arctic for decades.<ref name=\"poac95\" /> On the [[Dudinka]]\u2013[[Murmansk]] route, they were also intended to replace the shallow-draft nuclear-powered icebreakers [[Taymyr (1987 icebreaker)|''Taymyr'']] and [[Vaygach (1989 icebreaker)|''Vaygach'']] which operated primarily in the [[Yenisei River]] [[estuary]]. This was made possible by the dual-draft functionality of the new icebreakers, ability to de-ballast the vessel when approaching coastal areas. During the summer-autumn navigation season, the icebreakers would be used along the full length of the Northern Sea Route from Murmansk all the way to the [[Bering Strait]].<ref name=\"icetech94\">{{Citation|last=Tsoy|first=L.G.|contribution=New generation Arktika class nuclear icebreaker feasibility study|year=1994|title=Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Ships and Marine Structures in Cold Regions, 1994 (ICETECH'95)|pages=P1\u2013P8}}</ref>\n\nThe technical characteristics of the next-generation nuclear-powered icebreakers were drawn from the Russians' extensive operational experience from Arctic shipping. For example, it was determined that in order to ensure reliable year-round navigation in the western part of the Northern Sea Route, the icebreaker would have to be capable of breaking at least {{convert|2.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} ice, an improvement over the old ''Arktika''{{'}}s {{convert|2.3|m|ft|0|adj=on}} icebreaking capability. In addition, escorting Russian Arctic cargo ships such as the [[SA-15 (ship)|SA-15 type]] safely and efficiently in heavy ice conditions would require an icebreaker with a beam of {{convert|32|to|33|m|ft|0}} and a displacement of {{convert|34000|to|36000|t|LT}}.<ref name=\"poac95\" /><ref name=\"icetech94\" />\n\nAlthough the preliminary designs were developed already in the early 1990s,<ref name=\"icetech94\" /> the LK-60Ya design was finalized in 2009 as Project 22220 by Central Design Bureau \"Iceberg\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorship.com/news101/ships-and-shipyards/largest-icebreaker-construction-now-underway|title=Largest icebreaker construction now underway|date=26 January 2014|publisher=The Motorship|accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref> The construction of the [[lead ship]] was awarded to [[Saint Petersburg]]-based [[Baltic Shipyard]], part of the state-owned [[United Shipbuilding Corporation]], in August 2012 with a contract price of 36.959 billion [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (about US$1.16 billion).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/year-2012-news/august/552--baltic-shipyard-to-build-new-large-nuclear-powered-icebreaker-project-22220-lc-60ya.html|title=Baltic Shipyard to build new large nuclear-powered icebreaker (Project 22220 LC-60YA)|publisher=Navy Recognition|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref> A 84.4 billion ruble (about US$2.4 billion) follow-up contract for two additional vessels was signed in May 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.veus.de/index.php/de/news/128-baltic-shipyard-building-nuclear-icebreaker|title=Baltic Shipyard building nuclear icebreaker|publisher=VEUS e.V.|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://barentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2014/05/baltiysky-shipyard-build-three-new-icebreakers-2020-08-05|title=Baltiysky Shipyard to build three new icebreakers by 2020|publisher=Barents Observer|date=8 May 2014|accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref> and a second contract, worth over 100 billion rubles (about US$1.5 billion), for two more in August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.portnews.ru/digest/21237/|title=Atomflot Inks Contract for Another Two Nuclear-Powered Icebreakers|publisher=PortNews|date=5 September 2019|accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2019/08/russias-atomflot-orders-4th-5th-project-22220-nuclear-powered-icebreakers/|title=Russia\u2019s ATOMFLOT Orders 4th & 5th Project 22220 Nuclear-Powered Icebreakers|publisher=Naval News|date=11 August 2019|accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref> This brings the total number of Project 22220 nuclear-powered icebreakers under construction or on order to five.\n\nWith the Project 22220 icebreakers under construction, focus has moved to the development of even larger and more powerful nuclear-powered icebreakers known as [[Project 10510 icebreaker|Project 10510 Lider]].\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Sibir (Project 22220 nuclear-powered icebreaker) in December 2018.

It was founded on 20 May 1636 by [[Grace, Lady Manners]], who lived at [[Haddon Hall]], the current home of Lord and Lady Edward Manners, and has also in the past been known as the '''Bakewell Grammar School'''. It is now a member of the Peak 11 group of secondary schools in the Peak District.\n\n==History==\nLady Manners has a long history of providing education in the [[Peak District]] area. It began as a [[boys' school]], but later changed to admit girls as well. It was a successful [[grammar school]], but later changed to become a [[comprehensive school]].\n\n===Beginnings===\nIn May 1636 Grace, Lady Manners bought some land at [[Elton, Derbyshire|Elton]] which was to provide an annual income of \u00a315 for \"the mayntayninge of a Schoolemaister for ever to teach a free Schoole within the Townshippe of Bakewell, for the better instructinge of the male children of the Inhabitants of Bakewell and Great Rowsley aforesaid...\"\n\nThe [[schoolmaster]] would \"be appointed by the Lords of the Manor of Haddon, in the said Countie of Derby, being the heires or posteritie of the said Grace, Ladie Manners...\" and as with the Pursglove Grammar School in Tideswell, the deed stipulated that the schoolmaster was to remain unmarried, and \"if the said Schoolemaister shall at any time afterward marry, or shall live disorderly or scandalously, that then the said Schoolemaister shall have noe benefitt by the said Annuitie or rente charge, but shall be displaced from the said Schoole\". Additional to his annuity, the schoolmaster was permitted to take a registration fee of a [[shilling]] for each new boy. Additionally the schoolmaster would have received a pay rise following Grace's death as her 1649 [[Will (law)|will]] allowed for the all the monies generated by the land at Elton to be used for school use (during her life she had kept 25% of the income). The school is first referred to as a \"[[Grammar School|Grammer Schoole]]\" in her will.\n\nThe original school day ran from 7 to 11 a.m. and 1 to 5 p.m. \"except Sundays and holidays\".\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1806 the schoolmaster, Rev. M. Chapman handed over to the Rev. J. Browne who was appointed by the [[Duke of Rutland]] receiving an annual [[salary]] of \u00a350 and, for a while, the school became known as \"Mr. Browne's\".\n\nUp until now, the school had shared accommodation with the older Chantry School, South Church Street, Bakewell. In 1826, the school moved around the corner to The Old Town Hall, King Street. The Old Town Hall had been built in 1709 and, as well as being Town Hall, and Buttermarket, the upper floor had been used for [[Court]] and [[Quarter Sessions]].\n\nIn 1846 Rev. T. Hurst, a graduate of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], and a curate at the Parish Church, took over as schoolmaster.\n\nAccording to White's Directory of Derbyshire (1857)<ref name=white>{{cite web|url=http://www.n.f.wilson.btinternet.co.uk/474-488.htm |title=White's 1857 Directory of Derbyshire, pages 474\u2013488 |accessdate=16 November 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724083550/http://www.n.f.wilson.btinternet.co.uk/474-488.htm |archivedate=24 July 2008 }}</ref> \u2013\n\n{{cquote|Bakewell Grammar School, King street, established in 1637, (see Charities) is conducted by Mr Wm. Kay, L.C.P., assisted by the undernamed resident masters. The school is now in a very flourishing state, numbering 67 pupils, of whom 30 are boarders, 25 daily, and 12 foundation pupils. Mr. Wm. Kay, L.C.P., Head master. Mr. Ascough, second master. Mr. W. Mann, Third master. Herr J. B. Burke, German master. Mons. C. De St. Hubert, French and Drawing master... The New Market House is in King street, and the rooms above the basement are occupied by the Free Grammar school.}}\n\nUnder ''Charities'', White's Directory adds \"Lady Manners, in 1637, left a rent charge of \u00a315 per annum, out of lands at Elton, to a schoolmaster, for the instruction of male children of the township of Bakewell and Great Rowsley. The master also receives a voluntary addition of \u00a340 from the Duke of Rutland, making in the whole, \u00a355 per annum; and according to the revised regulations and rules, 20 youths are admitted on the foundation, on the payment of 1s. for registration, and instructed in English generally, Latin, and Greek. at 5s. 3d. per quarter. Mr. Wm. Kay, L.C.P., the master, has good accommodation for boarders, at his own residence, Bridge street.\"\n\nIn 1862 the school was briefly annexed to Mr. William Kay's private Grammar and Commercial Academy in Bridge Street but remained in the King Street premises. A School Inquiry Report of 1866 states that the Foundation had become \"a mere appendage and advertisement to an inferior commercial boarding school kept by the headmaster\". At this time \"there were then thirty-two [[boarding school|boarders]], fourteen [[day school|dayboys]] not on the Foundation, and seven who were\".\n\nWhen Mr. Kay died in 1874, Archdeacon Balston, then Vicar of Bakewell, and a former Headmaster of Eton, recommended that the school should be closed, and in the absence of a suitable successor the monies from Lady Manners' Foundation should be allowed to accumulate. The school closed in 1874, and remained closed for 22 years. Lady Manners School ceased to exist.\n\n===A new start===\nThe [[Charity Commission]]ers decided that a new building could be built \"to be used as a grammar school by day, earning through its examinations grants from the Science and Art Department, and as a centre for technical classes in the evenings\". The new school backed onto Bath Gardens and was opened on 22 September 1896. The school now admitted girls as well as boys \u2013 a pre-condition of the [[Derbyshire County Council|County Council]]'s grant of \u00a3600 towards the building costs. This was the first time an [[endowed School]] of this type had become [[co-educational]].\n\nThe school opened with fifty pupils on roll, all between the ages of eight and eighteen. The first Headmaster was Charles J. Mansford, B.A.(London).  Subjects taught were [[Religious Education|Religious Knowledge]], [[English language|English]], [[Classics]], [[Mathematics]], [[Science]], [[French language|French]] and [[Drawing]]. Boys did [[Woodwork]], girls did [[Domestic Science]]. The [[Bakewell Show Ground]] was used for games. Fees were \u00a32 per head, but this meant the school operated at a loss and so the County Council agreed to fund 12 [[scholarships]].\n\nThe school was one of the first to establish a more modern curriculum.

At that time there were three Houses established called Town, North and South. The planning for this took place during 1911 and the reason for creating the Houses was to help develop Sport in school so that, with a competitive dimension, students would enthusiastically play for their Houses. They provided a chance for students to achieve success and enjoy friendly yet meaningful competition. So Sports Day on 21 June 1912, which was actually the Fourteenth Annual Sports Day, was the first time that the Houses competed against one another for the Wrench Shield. The first ever winners were Town House (the equivalent of the current Glossop House).\n\nAfter the First World War, in 1919, the Houses were renamed and an extra House was added. The principle of allocation to the Houses was still geographical. The Houses were then called Nesfield (the South area \u2013 Matlock and beyond), Taylor (also South as far as Darley Dale), Glossop (the Bakewell 'Town' area) and Barker (the North). These names were those of Governors who had been especially important in the reopening of Lady Manners School in 1896.\n\nIn 1924 a new school was opened in Matlock (Ernest Bailey School) so fewer students came from that area and Nesfield House disappeared. Barker House also disappeared for a while at the end of 1937 because when Buxton College became a County School and the Ridgefield boarding annex was no longer needed, there were fewer students from the North area. This was a weakness of the principle of allocating students to Houses on a geographical basis. To confuse the situation a little further, there was also a 'School House' (photographs of its twenty or so members still exist for the period 1931 to 1941) which was for 'boarders'. This House did not seem to compete for the Inter-House trophies in quite the same way as the main Houses, but did have their own activities, organised internally for pupils living in the School House.   By 1938, coinciding with the effective occupation of the new school buildings on Shutts Lane, the main Houses were rearranged again, now numbering four: Elton, Haddon, Glossop and Taylor.\n\nIn 1947, just after the Second World War, there was another change when the number of Houses became three again and Barker reappeared, replacing Haddon and Elton. Competition between the Houses was no longer just on the basis of sport, and other activities had become important too.\n\nBy 1959 there were plans to create a fourth House again and this time the new House was to be named Cockerton. This naming was a tribute to the Cockerton family that had given over 50 years of service to the School, firstly with Mr VR Cockerton and then with his son Mr RWP Cockerton. Both had been School Governors and Mr VR Cockerton had been actively involved in the establishing of the current school site.\n\nSo ever since the early 1960s there have been four Houses \u2013 Barker, Cockerton, Glossop and Taylor \u2013 just like now \u2013 and students are no longer allocated to these Houses according to where they live, but according to which of the pairs of form tutor groups they are in.\n\n==New buildings==\nThe school has been repeatedly extended in recent years, from the Cavendish library (named for the family surname of the [[Dukes of Devonshire]], the influential aristocratic family of the nearby [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]] estate) in the 1990s to a new sixth form centre and sports facilities opened in 2005. This latest extension was funded partly by the sale of the school's boarding house, Castle Hill, which until its sale provided catered accommodation for school pupils. The boarding house closed in 2003.\n\n==Music and orchestra==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n[[Image:ladymannersschoolorchestraperformingattheroyalalberthall.jpg|320px|right|Lady Manners School Orchestra performing in the Schools' Prom at the Royal Albert Hall]]\nMusic is a major strength at the school with a wide variety of extra-curricular ensembles including Senior Orchestra (about 80 members), Senior Choir (about 100), Junior Choir (125), Brass Band (10), Senior Wind Band (60), Intermediate Strings, Junior Strings, Intermediate Wind Band, Junior Wind Band, Folk Group, clarinet choir, flute choir, etc.\n\nIn July 2004, the Lady Manners School Orchestra reached the national finals of the National Festival of Music for Youth and performed in the [[Royal Festival Hall]], London.\n\nIn July 2005, the orchestra, conducted by [[Robert Steadman]], was awarded \"outstanding performance\" at the National Festival Music for Youth Finals at [[Symphony Hall, Birmingham]] and in November 2005 they were invited to play at the Schools' Prom at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] where the 70+ strong orchestra performed a [[suite (music)|suite]] from [[John Williams|John Williams']] [[Film score|score]] from ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s [[Pomp and circumstance|''Pomp & Circumstance March No. 1'']] (''[[Land of Hope and Glory]]''') with indoor [[fireworks]] and a 5,000 strong audience singing along.\n\nIn July 2007 the school's Senior String Orchestra, also conducted by Robert Steadman, was awarded \"outstanding performance\" at the National Festival of Music for Youth at Symphony Hall, Birmingham performing a programme of Edward Elgar, Robert Steadman and [[Edvard Grieg]].\n\nIn July 2008, the music department managed to achieve the unprecedented by having 5 ensembles reach the National Festival of Music for Youth: the School Orchestra (who performed ''King Arthur'' a new work written by Jonathan Roberts (a 6th-form student), ''Nimrod'' from the \"[[Enigma Variations]]\" by Elgar and ''[[Riverdance]]'' by [[Bill Whelan]]; the String Orchestra who performed two movements from the '' [[St. Paul's Suite]]'' by [[Holst]], the ''Prelude from [[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' by [[Bernard Hermann]] and ''Frolicsome Finale'' from \"[[Simple Symphony]]\" by [[Benjamin Britten]]; the School Jazz Orchestra who performed a programme of four works including \"[[Birdland (composition)|Birdland]]\"; the School Brass Band; and the Senior String Quartet who performed [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] and [[Scott Joplin]].\n\nSince 2004, the music department has taken one ensemble on a short UK tour in the summer term. Most years this has been a combined brass and wind band who have visited places such as London, Edinburgh and Yorkshire giving a number of concerts. In 2009, the Senior Strings visited [[London]] and [[Oxford]] and gave performances in the Long Library, [[Blenheim Palace]] and [[Keble College]] chapel in Oxford. There are plans to take the Senior Orchestra to [[Hungary]] in summer 2010.\n\nLast year (2017), the school orchestra made it to the Music For Youth national competition, playing in the Birmingham main concert hall. In summer 2018, the senior windband are going on tour to Bamberg, Germany, being hosted by the school there.\n\n==Academic performance==\nIt gets well above average [[GCSE]] results and [[A-level]] results.  In 2010, GCSE results placed Lady Manners School 7th in Derbyshire, with 70% of students achieving 5 or more GCSEs at grades A* to C including English and Mathematics (the average in England was 53.5%).

It was founded on 20 May 1636 by [[Grace, Lady Manners]], who lived at [[Haddon Hall]], the current home of Lord and Lady Edward Manners, and has also in the past been known as the '''Bakewell Grammar School'''. It is now a member of the Peak 11 group of secondary schools in the Peak District.\n\n==History==\nLady Manners has a long history of providing education in the [[Peak District]] area. It began as a [[boys' school]], but later changed to admit girls as well. It was a successful [[grammar school]], but later changed to become a [[comprehensive school]].\n\n===Beginnings===\nIn May 1636 Grace, Lady Manners bought some land at [[Elton, Derbyshire|Elton]] which was to provide an annual income of \u00a315 for \"the mayntayninge of a Schoolemaister for ever to teach a free Schoole within the Townshippe of Bakewell, for the better instructinge of the male children of the Inhabitants of Bakewell and Great Rowsley aforesaid...\"\n\nThe [[schoolmaster]] would \"be appointed by the Lords of the Manor of Haddon, in the said Countie of Derby, being the heires or posteritie of the said Grace, Ladie Manners...\" and as with the Pursglove Grammar School in Tideswell, the deed stipulated that the schoolmaster was to remain unmarried, and \"if the said Schoolemaister shall at any time afterward marry, or shall live disorderly or scandalously, that then the said Schoolemaister shall have noe benefitt by the said Annuitie or rente charge, but shall be displaced from the said Schoole\". Additional to his annuity, the schoolmaster was permitted to take a registration fee of a [[shilling]] for each new boy. Additionally the schoolmaster would have received a pay rise following Grace's death as her 1649 [[Will (law)|will]] allowed for the all the monies generated by the land at Elton to be used for school use (during her life she had kept 25% of the income). The school is first referred to as a \"[[Grammar School|Grammer Schoole]]\" in her will.\n\nThe original school day ran from 7 to 11 a.m. and 1 to 5 p.m. \"except Sundays and holidays\".\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1806 the schoolmaster, Rev. M. Chapman handed over to the Rev. J. Browne who was appointed by the [[Duke of Rutland]] receiving an annual [[salary]] of \u00a350 and, for a while, the school became known as \"Mr. Browne's\".\n\nUp until now, the school had shared accommodation with the older Chantry School, South Church Street, Bakewell. In 1826, the school moved around the corner to The Old Town Hall, King Street. The Old Town Hall had been built in 1709 and, as well as being Town Hall, and Buttermarket, the upper floor had been used for [[Court]] and [[Quarter Sessions]].\n\nIn 1846 Rev. T. Hurst, a graduate of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], and a curate at the Parish Church, took over as schoolmaster.\n\nAccording to White's Directory of Derbyshire (1857)<ref name=white>{{cite web|url=http://www.n.f.wilson.btinternet.co.uk/474-488.htm |title=White's 1857 Directory of Derbyshire, pages 474\u2013488 |accessdate=16 November 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724083550/http://www.n.f.wilson.btinternet.co.uk/474-488.htm |archivedate=24 July 2008 }}</ref> \u2013\n\n{{cquote|Bakewell Grammar School, King street, established in 1637, (see Charities) is conducted by Mr Wm. Kay, L.C.P., assisted by the undernamed resident masters. The school is now in a very flourishing state, numbering 67 pupils, of whom 30 are boarders, 25 daily, and 12 foundation pupils. Mr. Wm. Kay, L.C.P., Head master. Mr. Ascough, second master. Mr. W. Mann, Third master. Herr J. B. Burke, German master. Mons. C. De St. Hubert, French and Drawing master... The New Market House is in King street, and the rooms above the basement are occupied by the Free Grammar school.}}\n\nUnder ''Charities'', White's Directory adds \"Lady Manners, in 1637, left a rent charge of \u00a315 per annum, out of lands at Elton, to a schoolmaster, for the instruction of male children of the township of Bakewell and Great Rowsley. The master also receives a voluntary addition of \u00a340 from the Duke of Rutland, making in the whole, \u00a355 per annum; and according to the revised regulations and rules, 20 youths are admitted on the foundation, on the payment of 1s. for registration, and instructed in English generally, Latin, and Greek. at 5s. 3d. per quarter. Mr. Wm. Kay, L.C.P., the master, has good accommodation for boarders, at his own residence, Bridge street.\"\n\nIn 1862 the school was briefly annexed to Mr. William Kay's private Grammar and Commercial Academy in Bridge Street but remained in the King Street premises. A School Inquiry Report of 1866 states that the Foundation had become \"a mere appendage and advertisement to an inferior commercial boarding school kept by the headmaster\". At this time \"there were then thirty-two [[boarding school|boarders]], fourteen [[day school|dayboys]] not on the Foundation, and seven who were\".\n\nWhen Mr. Kay died in 1874, Archdeacon Balston, then Vicar of Bakewell, and a former Headmaster of Eton, recommended that the school should be closed, and in the absence of a suitable successor the monies from Lady Manners' Foundation should be allowed to accumulate. The school closed in 1874, and remained closed for 22 years. Lady Manners School ceased to exist.\n\n===A new start===\nThe [[Charity Commission]]ers decided that a new building could be built \"to be used as a grammar school by day, earning through its examinations grants from the Science and Art Department, and as a centre for technical classes in the evenings\". The new school backed onto Bath Gardens and was opened on 22 September 1896. The school now admitted girls as well as boys \u2013 a pre-condition of the [[Derbyshire County Council|County Council]]'s grant of \u00a3600 towards the building costs. This was the first time an [[endowed School]] of this type had become [[co-educational]].\n\nThe school opened with fifty pupils on roll, all between the ages of eight and eighteen. The first Headmaster was Charles J. Mansford, B.A.(London).  Subjects taught were [[Religious Education|Religious Knowledge]], [[English language|English]], [[Classics]], [[Mathematics]], [[Science]], [[French language|French]] and [[Drawing]]. Boys did [[Woodwork]], girls did [[Domestic Science]]. The [[Bakewell Show Ground]] was used for games. Fees were \u00a32 per head, but this meant the school operated at a loss and so the County Council agreed to fund 12 [[scholarships]].\n\nThe school was one of the first to establish a more modern curriculum. An article in ''Review of Reviews'' (1898) says \"Within the school there is a School of Science, affiliated with South Kensington, about one half of the scholars being so classed. Girls are taught exactly the same science, for instance, as boys, and at the same time, in the same room. So far the science taught embraces Practical and Theoretical Chemistry, with Practical and Theoretical Physics\".<ref>[http://www.sciper.org/print/RR1-17-1-17.html ''Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread''] in ''Review of Reviews'', 17 (1898), 63\u201368 (accessed 16 November 2007)</ref>\n\n===The 20th century===\nIn 1900 two boarding houses were set up, at Dagnall for boys, and in The Avenue for girls, and in 1909 the Old Bath House (now Haig House) was bought as extra premises for Fifth and Sixth Form, and Staff.\n\nIn 1919 four [[acres]] of land who bought in Shutts Lane for use as a playing field.

The boarding house closed in 2003.\n\n==Music and orchestra==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n[[Image:ladymannersschoolorchestraperformingattheroyalalberthall.jpg|320px|right|Lady Manners School Orchestra performing in the Schools' Prom at the Royal Albert Hall]]\nMusic is a major strength at the school with a wide variety of extra-curricular ensembles including Senior Orchestra (about 80 members), Senior Choir (about 100), Junior Choir (125), Brass Band (10), Senior Wind Band (60), Intermediate Strings, Junior Strings, Intermediate Wind Band, Junior Wind Band, Folk Group, clarinet choir, flute choir, etc.\n\nIn July 2004, the Lady Manners School Orchestra reached the national finals of the National Festival of Music for Youth and performed in the [[Royal Festival Hall]], London.\n\nIn July 2005, the orchestra, conducted by [[Robert Steadman]], was awarded \"outstanding performance\" at the National Festival Music for Youth Finals at [[Symphony Hall, Birmingham]] and in November 2005 they were invited to play at the Schools' Prom at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] where the 70+ strong orchestra performed a [[suite (music)|suite]] from [[John Williams|John Williams']] [[Film score|score]] from ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s [[Pomp and circumstance|''Pomp & Circumstance March No. 1'']] (''[[Land of Hope and Glory]]''') with indoor [[fireworks]] and a 5,000 strong audience singing along.\n\nIn July 2007 the school's Senior String Orchestra, also conducted by Robert Steadman, was awarded \"outstanding performance\" at the National Festival of Music for Youth at Symphony Hall, Birmingham performing a programme of Edward Elgar, Robert Steadman and [[Edvard Grieg]].\n\nIn July 2008, the music department managed to achieve the unprecedented by having 5 ensembles reach the National Festival of Music for Youth: the School Orchestra (who performed ''King Arthur'' a new work written by Jonathan Roberts (a 6th-form student), ''Nimrod'' from the \"[[Enigma Variations]]\" by Elgar and ''[[Riverdance]]'' by [[Bill Whelan]]; the String Orchestra who performed two movements from the '' [[St. Paul's Suite]]'' by [[Holst]], the ''Prelude from [[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' by [[Bernard Hermann]] and ''Frolicsome Finale'' from \"[[Simple Symphony]]\" by [[Benjamin Britten]]; the School Jazz Orchestra who performed a programme of four works including \"[[Birdland (composition)|Birdland]]\"; the School Brass Band; and the Senior String Quartet who performed [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] and [[Scott Joplin]].\n\nSince 2004, the music department has taken one ensemble on a short UK tour in the summer term. Most years this has been a combined brass and wind band who have visited places such as London, Edinburgh and Yorkshire giving a number of concerts. In 2009, the Senior Strings visited [[London]] and [[Oxford]] and gave performances in the Long Library, [[Blenheim Palace]] and [[Keble College]] chapel in Oxford. There are plans to take the Senior Orchestra to [[Hungary]] in summer 2010.\n\nLast year (2017), the school orchestra made it to the Music For Youth national competition, playing in the Birmingham main concert hall. In summer 2018, the senior windband are going on tour to Bamberg, Germany, being hosted by the school there.\n\n==Academic performance==\nIt gets well above average [[GCSE]] results and [[A-level]] results.  In 2010, GCSE results placed Lady Manners School 7th in Derbyshire, with 70% of students achieving 5 or more GCSEs at grades A* to C including English and Mathematics (the average in England was 53.5%). In 2011, this was bettered with 76% of GCSE students achieving 5 or more GCSEs at A* to C including English and Mathematics.\n\n==Notable former pupils==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2011}}\n\n===Comprehensive===\n* [[Paul Aldred]], former Derbyshire cricketer.\n* [[Stephanie Hill]], [[Miss England]] 2017, represented England at [[Miss World 2017]] in Sanya, China.\n* [[Alex Hammond]], television presenter for Sky Sports\n* [[Annie Last]], professional mountain biker\n* Peter Lawton,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493387/ Peter Lawton biography at IMDb]</ref> actor known for his role as Craig Jackson in [[Emmerdale]]\n* [[Richard Lumsden]], actor, writer, composer and musician\n* [[Becky Measures]], radio DJ at [[Peak FM (North Derbyshire)|Peak FM]]\n* [[Madeleine Thompson]]\n* [[Laura Wade]], playwright\n* [[Judith Jepson]], British champion fellrunner\n\n===Grammar school===\n[[File:Nigel Shadbolt Royal Society.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Nigel Shadbolt FRS]]\n* [[Barry Askew]], former editor in 1981 of the ''[[News of the World]]'', from 1961\u201363 of the ''[[Matlock Mercury]]'', and from 1968\u201381 of the ''[[Sheffield Star]]''\n* [[Thomas Denman (Physician)|Thomas Denman]], (1733\u20131815) \u2013 physician<ref name=dnb>[[Dictionary of National Biography]] now in the public domain</ref>\n* [[Helen Goodman]], former Labour MP for [[Bishop Auckland (UK Parliament constituency)|Bishop Auckland]]\n* Alan Hoole OBE CMG, [[Governor of Anguilla]] from 1995\u201397 and [[Governor of Saint Helena]] from 1991\u201395\n* [[Billy Hughes (educationist)|Billy Hughes]], Labour MP from 1945\u201350 for [[Wolverhampton West (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton West]] and [[educator]]\n* Bryan Jefferson CB CBE, President from 1977\u201378 of [[The Concrete Society]] and from 1979\u201381 of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA)\n* [[Richard Lumsden]], British actor, writer, composer and musician, former husband of actress [[Sophie Thompson]]\n* [[Edward Milner]], landscape architect\n* Sir [[Maurice Oldfield]] CMG CBE, former director-general \u2013 \"C\" \u2013 from 1973\u201378 of [[MI6]] \n* [[Aydin \u00d6na\u00e7]], concert pianist, teacher,<ref name=\"Lady Manners\">{{cite web|title=Aidin Onac|url=http://folders.ladymanners.derbyshire.sch.uk/archives/aydin_onac.html|website=Lady Manners School Archives|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> Headmaster from 2010\u201317 of [[St Olave's Grammar School]]\n* Prof Henry Pawson MBE, Professor of Agriculture from 1948\u201357 at [[Newcastle University]]\n* [[Helen Peller]], British classical bassoonist and former student of [[Charles Cracknell]]\n* [[Julie Price (bassoonist)|Julie Price]], co-principal bassoonist of the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]]\n* Prof John Purseglove CMG, botanist, President from 1962\u201365 of the [[Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation]], expert on tropical crops\n* Sir [[Nigel Shadbolt]] FRS FREng, Principal since 2015 of [[Jesus College, Oxford]], founded the [[Web Science Trust]]\n* Michael Shooter CBE, President from 2002\u201305 of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]]\n* [[Alison Uttley]], writer\n* [[Phillip Whitehead]], former Labour MEP from 1994\u20132005 for the East Midlands, former chairman of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, television producer and Labour MP from 1970\u201383 for [[Derby North (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby North]]<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article784650.ece Philip Whitehead's Obituary in the Times]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links and sources==\n{{Commons category|Lady Manners School}}\n* [http://www.ladymanners.net The school's official website]\n* [http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0,,1578520,00.html Article by Roy Hattersley in THE GUARDIAN, 27 September 2005]\n* [http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/112996 2011 OFSTED Report]\n* \"The Story of the School of Grace Lady Manners, Bakewell\" by R.A.

However, throughout history there have been instances of the Bengali language being written in [[Perso-Arabic]]. The use of the [[Sylheti Nagari]] script also emerged in the [[Sylhet region]] of the Bengal.<ref name=\"bpedia\" />\n\nThe Bengali script is a [[cursive]] script with eleven [[grapheme]]s or signs denoting nine vowels and two [[diphthong]]s, and thirty-nine graphemes representing [[consonant]]s and other modifiers.<ref name=\"akhor\" /> There are no distinct [[Letter case|upper and lower case]] letter forms. The letters run from left to right and spaces are used to separate [[Word#Orthography|orthographic words]]. Bengali script has a distinctive horizontal line running along the tops of the graphemes that links them together called {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}} ''matra''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://banglasemantics.net/ |title=banglasemantics.net |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224112403/http://banglasemantics.net/ |archive-date=24 December 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nSince the Bengali script is an abugida, its consonant graphemes usually do not represent phonetic [[Segment (linguistics)|segments]], but carry an \"inherent\" vowel and thus are [[Syllable|syllabic]] in nature. The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a4}} {{IPA|[m'''\u0254'''t]}} \"opinion\" or {{IPA|[o]}}, as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} \"mind\", with variants like the more open {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''[[virama|h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4]]'' {{lang|bn|(\u09cd)}}, may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cd}} {{IPA|[m]}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final {{lang|bn|\u09a8}} in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} or the medial {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} in {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09be\u09ae\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u0261amla]}}).\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel [[allography|allographs]] above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[typographic ligature]]s. These allographs, called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar'', are [[diacritic]]al vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09bf}} {{IPA|[mi]}} represents the consonant {{IPA|[m]}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, where {{IPA|[i]}} is represented as the diacritical allograph{{lang|bn| \u09bf}} (called {{lang|bn|\u0987-\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''i-kar'') and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be}} {{IPA|[ma]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[mi]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c1}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c2}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c3}} {{IPA|[mri]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c7}} {{IPA|[me~m\u025b]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c8}} {{IPA|[moj]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cb}} {{IPA|[mo]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cc}} {{IPA|[mow]}} represent the same consonant {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} {{IPA|[m\u0254]}}.\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u0987}} {{IPA|[moj]}} \"ladder\" and in {{lang|bn|\u0987\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6}} {{IPA|[ili\u0283]}} \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel {{lang|bn|\u0987}} is used (cf. the dependent form{{lang|bn| \u09bf)}}. A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed ''ch\u00f4ndr\u00f4bindu'' {{lang|bn|(\u0981)}}, denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalisation]] of vowels (as in {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09be\u0981\u09a6}} {{IPA|[t\u0283\u00e3d]}} \"moon\"), the postposed ''\u00f4nusbar'' {{lang|bn|(\u0982)}} indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}} \"Bengali\") and the postposed ''bis\u00f4rg\u00f4'' {{lang|bn|(\u0983)}} indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0989\u0983!}} {{IPA|[uh]}} \"ouch!\") or the [[gemination]] of the following consonant (as in {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c1\u0983\u0996}} {{IPA|[duk\u02b0\u02d0\u0254]}} \"sorrow\").\n\nThe [[Bengali consonant clusters]] ({{lang|bn|\u09af\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u099e\u09cd\u099c\u09a8}} ''jukt\u00f4b\u00eanj\u00f4n'') are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist [[Bengali alphabet#Consonant conjuncts|a few visual formulas]] to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke {{lang|bn|\u0964}} ''da\u1e5bi'' \u2013 the Bengali equivalent of a [[full stop]] \u2013 have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\" />\n\nUnlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}} ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral {{lang|bn|\u09e9}} \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0}} ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel {{lang|bn|\u098f}} ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n===Orthographic depth===\nThe Bengali script in general has a comparatively [[orthographic depth|shallow orthography]], i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\" /> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters ({{lang|bn|\u09b6}}, {{lang|bn|\u09b7}}, and {{lang|bn|\u09b8}}) for the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the letter {{lang|bn|\u09b8}} retains the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u0996\u09b2\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sk\u02b0\u0254lon]}} \"fall\", {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sp\u0254ndon]}} \"beat\", etc. The letter {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} also retains the [[voiceless retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0282]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09b7\u09cd\u099f}} {{IPA|[k\u0254\u0282\u0288\u0254]}} \"suffering\", {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u0282\u0288\u02b0i]}} \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters ({{lang|bn|\u099c}} and {{lang|bn|\u09af}}) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal {{lang|bn|\u09a3}} {{IPA|[\u0273]}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as {{lang|bn|\u099f}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a0}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} and {{lang|bn|\u09a2}}), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09a4}} {{IPA|[\u025bto]}} \"so much\", {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a1\u09c7\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u025bkademi]}} \"academy\", {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09ac\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u025bmiba]}} \"amoeba\", {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09be}} {{IPA|[d\u025bk\u02b0a]}} \"to see\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4}} {{IPA|[b\u025bsto]}} \"busy\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u09a3}} {{IPA|[b\u025bkor\u0254n]}} \"grammar\".\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} or {{IPA|[o]}} depending on [[vowel harmony]] ({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09b8\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09a4\u09bf}}) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09ae}} {{IPA|[k\u0254m]}} \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd}} {{IPA|[k]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0282]}} is graphically realised as {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} and is pronounced {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} {{IPA|[rukk\u02b0o]}} \"coarse\") or {{IPA|[kk\u02b0o]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09a4\u09bf}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0oti]}} \"harm\") or even {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09ae\u09a4\u09be}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254mota]}} \"capability\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n===Uses===\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese and other languages is known as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. The script is known as the [[Bengali alphabet]] for Bengali and its dialects and the [[Assamese alphabet]] for [[Assamese language]] with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like the [[Meitei language]] in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali alphabet for centuries, though the [[Meitei script]] has been promoted in recent times.\n\n===Romanisation===\n{{Main|Romanisation of Bengali}}\n\nThere are various Romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or IAST system (based on diacritics),<ref name=\"IAST1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archivedate=12 February 2007\n | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\n | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration\n | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006\n}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case letters suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=\"ITRANS1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | publisher=Avinash Chopde\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123020111/http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | archive-date=23 January 2013\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref> and the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=\"NatLib\">{{cite web\n | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | date=1 April 1999\n | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2013 ISCII\n | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]]\n | page=32\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716225648/http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | archive-date=16 July 2012\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n\nIn the context of Bengali [[romanisation]], it is important to distinguish [[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, ''Abol Tabol'', ''Hasi Khusi'' and ''Sahoj Path'' in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Bengali grammar}}\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n===Word order===\nAs a [[Head-directionality parameter|head-final]] language, Bengali follows [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name=\"tb16\">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=\"UCLA1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | title=Bengali\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | work=UCLA Language Materials project\n | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715213818/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | archive-date=15 July 2007\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nYes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09bf}} ''-ki'', {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09be}} ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticised]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name=\"tb\" /> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]].

Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word ('''MW'''), a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]], must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. {{lang|bn|-\u099c\u09a8}} ''-j\u00f4n'' for humans). There is also the classifier ''-khana,'' and its diminutive form ''-khani'', which attach only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descriptive grammar of Bangla|last=Boyle David|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+Measure words\n|-\n!

However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09c1\u09a7\u09c1 \u098f\u0995'''\u099c\u09a8''' \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u0964}} ''Shudhu \u00eak-'''j\u00f4n''' thakbe.'' (lit. \"Only one-'''MW''' will remain.\") would be understood to mean \"Only one '''person''' will remain.\", given the semantic class implicit in {{lang|bn|-\u099c\u09a8}} ''-j\u00f4n''.\n\nIn this sense, all nouns in Bengali, unlike most other Indo-European languages, are similar to [[mass noun]]s.\n\n===Verbs===\nThere are two classes of verbs: [[finite verb|finite]] and non-finite. Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honour]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]].\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language Bangla language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706032246/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09c7 \u09b6\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u0995}} ''se shikkh\u00f4k'', (literally \"he teacher\").<ref name=\"hacce-bangali\">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkh\u00f4k hocche''. This is viewed as ungrammatical by other speakers, and speakers of this variety are sometimes (humorously) referred as \"hocche-Bangali\".</ref> In this respect, Bengali is similar to Russian and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

Furthermore, different dialects use more [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] vocabulary especially in different areas of Bangladesh and Muslim majority areas of [[West Bengal]]. Hindus, on the other hand, use more Sanskrit vocabulary than Muslims. While standard Bengali is based on the [[Bengali dialects|Nadia dialect]] spoken in the Hindu majority states of West Bengal, about 90% of Bengalis in Bangladesh (ca. 148 million) and 27% of Bengalis in West Bengal and 10% in Assam (ca. 36 million) are Muslim and speak a more \"persio-arabised\" version of Bengali instead of the more Sanskrit influenced Standard [[Bengali dialects|Nadia dialect]]. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly (67%) of tadbhavas, while tatsamas comprise only 25% of the total.<ref name=\"bhoumick\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tatsama Tatsama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706010902/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tatsama |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref><ref name=\"bhoumick1\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tadbhaba Tadbhaba] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706052525/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tadbhaba |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Loanwords from non-Indic languages comprise the remaining 8% of the vocabulary used in modern [[Bengali literature]].\n\nAccording to [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]], dictionaries from the early 20th century attributed about 50% of the Bengali vocabulary to native words (i.e., naturally modified [[Prakrit]] words, corrupted forms of [[Aryan]] words, and non Indo-European languages.

Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09b9\u09af\u09cb\u0997\u09bf\u09a4\u09be}} '''''sh\u00f4'''-h\u00f4-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' \"cooperation\", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress.\n\n===Consonant clusters===\n{{Main|Bengali consonant clusters}}\n\nNative Bengali words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side).

The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a4}} {{IPA|[m'''\u0254'''t]}} \"opinion\" or {{IPA|[o]}}, as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} \"mind\", with variants like the more open {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''[[virama|h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4]]'' {{lang|bn|(\u09cd)}}, may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cd}} {{IPA|[m]}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final {{lang|bn|\u09a8}} in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} or the medial {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} in {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09be\u09ae\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u0261amla]}}).\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel [[allography|allographs]] above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[typographic ligature]]s. These allographs, called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar'', are [[diacritic]]al vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09bf}} {{IPA|[mi]}} represents the consonant {{IPA|[m]}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, where {{IPA|[i]}} is represented as the diacritical allograph{{lang|bn| \u09bf}} (called {{lang|bn|\u0987-\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''i-kar'') and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be}} {{IPA|[ma]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[mi]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c1}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c2}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c3}} {{IPA|[mri]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c7}} {{IPA|[me~m\u025b]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c8}} {{IPA|[moj]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cb}} {{IPA|[mo]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cc}} {{IPA|[mow]}} represent the same consonant {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} {{IPA|[m\u0254]}}.\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u0987}} {{IPA|[moj]}} \"ladder\" and in {{lang|bn|\u0987\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6}} {{IPA|[ili\u0283]}} \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel {{lang|bn|\u0987}} is used (cf. the dependent form{{lang|bn| \u09bf)}}. A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed ''ch\u00f4ndr\u00f4bindu'' {{lang|bn|(\u0981)}}, denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalisation]] of vowels (as in {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09be\u0981\u09a6}} {{IPA|[t\u0283\u00e3d]}} \"moon\"), the postposed ''\u00f4nusbar'' {{lang|bn|(\u0982)}} indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}} \"Bengali\") and the postposed ''bis\u00f4rg\u00f4'' {{lang|bn|(\u0983)}} indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0989\u0983!}} {{IPA|[uh]}} \"ouch!\") or the [[gemination]] of the following consonant (as in {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c1\u0983\u0996}} {{IPA|[duk\u02b0\u02d0\u0254]}} \"sorrow\").\n\nThe [[Bengali consonant clusters]] ({{lang|bn|\u09af\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u099e\u09cd\u099c\u09a8}} ''jukt\u00f4b\u00eanj\u00f4n'') are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist [[Bengali alphabet#Consonant conjuncts|a few visual formulas]] to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke {{lang|bn|\u0964}} ''da\u1e5bi'' \u2013 the Bengali equivalent of a [[full stop]] \u2013 have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\" />\n\nUnlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}} ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral {{lang|bn|\u09e9}} \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0}} ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel {{lang|bn|\u098f}} ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n===Orthographic depth===\nThe Bengali script in general has a comparatively [[orthographic depth|shallow orthography]], i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\" /> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters ({{lang|bn|\u09b6}}, {{lang|bn|\u09b7}}, and {{lang|bn|\u09b8}}) for the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the letter {{lang|bn|\u09b8}} retains the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u0996\u09b2\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sk\u02b0\u0254lon]}} \"fall\", {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sp\u0254ndon]}} \"beat\", etc. The letter {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} also retains the [[voiceless retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0282]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09b7\u09cd\u099f}} {{IPA|[k\u0254\u0282\u0288\u0254]}} \"suffering\", {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u0282\u0288\u02b0i]}} \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters ({{lang|bn|\u099c}} and {{lang|bn|\u09af}}) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal {{lang|bn|\u09a3}} {{IPA|[\u0273]}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as {{lang|bn|\u099f}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a0}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} and {{lang|bn|\u09a2}}), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09a4}} {{IPA|[\u025bto]}} \"so much\", {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a1\u09c7\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u025bkademi]}} \"academy\", {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09ac\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u025bmiba]}} \"amoeba\", {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09be}} {{IPA|[d\u025bk\u02b0a]}} \"to see\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4}} {{IPA|[b\u025bsto]}} \"busy\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u09a3}} {{IPA|[b\u025bkor\u0254n]}} \"grammar\".\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} or {{IPA|[o]}} depending on [[vowel harmony]] ({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09b8\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09a4\u09bf}}) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09ae}} {{IPA|[k\u0254m]}} \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd}} {{IPA|[k]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0282]}} is graphically realised as {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} and is pronounced {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} {{IPA|[rukk\u02b0o]}} \"coarse\") or {{IPA|[kk\u02b0o]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09a4\u09bf}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0oti]}} \"harm\") or even {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09ae\u09a4\u09be}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254mota]}} \"capability\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n===Uses===\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese and other languages is known as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. The script is known as the [[Bengali alphabet]] for Bengali and its dialects and the [[Assamese alphabet]] for [[Assamese language]] with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like the [[Meitei language]] in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali alphabet for centuries, though the [[Meitei script]] has been promoted in recent times.\n\n===Romanisation===\n{{Main|Romanisation of Bengali}}\n\nThere are various Romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or IAST system (based on diacritics),<ref name=\"IAST1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archivedate=12 February 2007\n | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\n | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration\n | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006\n}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case letters suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=\"ITRANS1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | publisher=Avinash Chopde\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123020111/http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | archive-date=23 January 2013\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref> and the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=\"NatLib\">{{cite web\n | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | date=1 April 1999\n | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2013 ISCII\n | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]]\n | page=32\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716225648/http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | archive-date=16 July 2012\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n\nIn the context of Bengali [[romanisation]], it is important to distinguish [[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, ''Abol Tabol'', ''Hasi Khusi'' and ''Sahoj Path'' in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Bengali grammar}}\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n===Word order===\nAs a [[Head-directionality parameter|head-final]] language, Bengali follows [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name=\"tb16\">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=\"UCLA1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | title=Bengali\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | work=UCLA Language Materials project\n | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715213818/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | archive-date=15 July 2007\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nYes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09bf}} ''-ki'', {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09be}} ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticised]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name=\"tb\" /> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'' (singular) or {{lang|bn|-\u0997\u09c1\u09b2\u09cb}} ''-gulo'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].\n\nIn most of the Bengali grammar books, cases are divided in to 6 categories and an additional possessive case (possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in term of usages, cases are generally grouped in to only 4 categories.\n\n{| style=\"align:center; width:60%; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Singular noun inflection\n!\n!

Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word ('''MW'''), a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]], must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. {{lang|bn|-\u099c\u09a8}} ''-j\u00f4n'' for humans). There is also the classifier ''-khana,'' and its diminutive form ''-khani'', which attach only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descriptive grammar of Bangla|last=Boyle David|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+Measure words\n|-\n!

However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09c1\u09a7\u09c1 \u098f\u0995'''\u099c\u09a8''' \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u0964}} ''Shudhu \u00eak-'''j\u00f4n''' thakbe.''

Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honour]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]].\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language Bangla language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706032246/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09c7 \u09b6\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u0995}} ''se shikkh\u00f4k'', (literally \"he teacher\").<ref name=\"hacce-bangali\">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkh\u00f4k hocche''.
