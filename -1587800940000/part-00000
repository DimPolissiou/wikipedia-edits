As a child, she trained as an Olympic gymnast and as a dancer. Her father died when she was 6. She moved to Texas with her family as a teenager in 1992 where she lived for one year. She and her family moved back to Guadalajara, and in 1994 Elis moved to Quer\u00e9taro Mexico to her aunt's. \nShe shortened her name to Elis, inspired by [[Elis Regina]].\n\n== Learning music ==\nAfter moving to Quer\u00e9taro, her aunt and uncle started her in music lessons, as all of her cousins studied music. Elis has been known to say that what she really wanted was to continue with her dancing in the hopes of becoming a professional dancer. She learned to play the Saxophone and music in general, but by a twist of fate some of her friends signed her up (unbeknownst to her) for a singing contest at school in Quer\u00e9taro, where she ended up in second place. It was there she realized that she wanted a career as a singer.\nElis then moved back to Guadalajara where, a year later, she started singing for the local band La Verdad No Importa, from where she was later fired because she \"didn\u2019t sing that good\". After that rejection she took singing and guitar lessons in order to start writing her own songs.\nIn 2000, after being in a couple of more local bands, she started formal music studies at CEDART for a couple of years. While studying there, she held a job doing press and PR for different concert promoters in Guadalajara.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 2002-2003: First demos ===\nShe interrupted her studies in 2002 and moved to [[London]] England for one year, where she began writing some of the songs she would later release as Elis Paprika. She held a job as a waitress during her stay in London. She returned to Guadalajara M\u00e9xico in 2003 where she started a band called The Paprikas, with a local musician named Raul Velazquez (not to be confused with Ra\u00fal \"Rul\" Velazquez, who would later be Elis\u2019 guitar player in The Black Pilgrims). At that point people began referring to her as \"Elis from the Paprikas\" or \"Elis Paprika\", the name she later adopted. After a few tries with The Paprikas, Elis recorded a demo for the song \"Sunny Day\", working with Shaboomy (later guitar player for [[Azul Violeta]]), and Eric Diaz, guitar player and bass player respectively from the band The Waitress<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/thewaitress The Waitress official band page]</ref> from Guadalajara M\u00e9xico. The Waitress was originally Elis\u2019 first solo project. The name of the band was inspired by her time working as a waitress in London and Guadalajara before making music. Once she began to be recognized as \"Elis Paprika\" and making more music apart from her project, Elis left The Waitress. The other members of The Waitress continued without her.\n\n=== 2004: ''Elis Paprika'' ===\nIn February 2004, Elis\u2019 showed the demo of \"Sunny Day\", to Luke Castillo, who was then playing guitar and singing for the band Becker. Luke liked what he heard and they started working together, and this is where Elis Paprika was formally established, with Luke Castillo on Guitar, Richo Acosta on Guitar, Chumino on Bass, and Chicho (also playing with the band Plastiko), on Drums. With this lineup, Elis recorded the demo for the song \"Give Me Love\". \nChicho left the band and Arnold Benz briefly became the drummer. They recorded demo versions of the songs \"Bitch\" and \"Texas\" with him.\nArnold left the band and Richo Acosta called Willy Gonzalez, from another band he played in, to take over the drums.\nLater, Jorge \"Gordo\" Miramontes came in on bass after Chumino left the band. At this point, and with this lineup, they all decided to work as a band instead of Elis being a solo artist. Elis Paprika then became the name of the band. \nTheir first live show as Elis Paprika took place in Guadalajara Jalisco M\u00e9xico, on December 14, 2004 at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara.\n\n=== 2005-2006: ''Give Me Love'' ===\nElis Paprika began playing in several venues and quickly ascended in Guadalajara's rock scene. They played Sol Radiante Festival, Zapopum Festival, and the Hard Rock Live at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara on several occasions. It was during one of these performances that people from Suave Records became interested in Elis Paprika, signing them in 2005. Under this label, Elis Paprika released the record ''Give Me Love'' in 2006, produced by Luke Castillo and Richo Acosta, and was licensed to [[Sony Music Mexico]] for its distribution in Mexico.\n\nThe first single, \"Give Me Love\", had a fast and big acceptance, and consequently Elis was invited to play at the Festival Vive Latino in 2006 and [[Corona Capital]], also in 2006. In August of that same year, Elis Paprika was named \"Band of the Month\" on [[MTV]]. After this, MTV invited Elis Paprika to perform live for a recording of the program ''Alerta''.\n\nThe song \"No Puedo\" was released as the second single in October 2006. In November 2006 [[Julieta Venegas]] invited Elis Paprika to play on her first [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] performance in Mexico City.\n\nAs all of this was taking place, contractual problems began to surface between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records.\n\n=== 2007\u20132008: ''EP2'', and Juan Gabriel tribute ===\nAfter the success of ''Give Me Love'', problems between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records increased to the point where the impulse the band had, came to a halt.\n\nIn early 2007, Elis requested Suave Records to release her, resulting in a lawsuit.\n\nLuke Castillo decided to leave the band to concentrate on his other band Becker, and Ram\u00f3n \"Zacky\" Velarde took his place in the band.\n\nElis recorded her voice for the original score of short film ''Jacinta'', winner of the Festival de Cine de Morelia, from director Karla Casta\u00f1eda, with music by Gilberto Cervantes. ''Jacinta'' was also shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] that same year.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1206015/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast IMDb page for Jacinta Full Cast and Crew, mentioning Elis Paprika as singer for original score]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.moreliafilmfest.com/ficha.php?id=991 |title=Morelia Film Festival official web page |access-date=2012-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513191359/http://moreliafilmfest.com/ficha.php?id=991 |archive-date=2012-05-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh18GDdwhTc Jacinta Short Film. Final credits mention Elis Paprika as \"Vocal Interpretation\"]</ref>\n\nElis Paprika recorded ''EP2'' in 2007, but this second record did not see a formal release due to the lawsuit with Suave Records. EP2 was released that same year, but only through free download on the [[Internet]].\n\nEarly in 2008, Elis Paprika was invited to be a part of the [[Juan Gabriel]] tribute album called ''Amo al Divo de Ju\u00e1rez''. For this, Elis recorded her own version of the Juan Gabriel song \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\". The record came out, with her version of the song as one of the official singles.\n\nElis Paprika played on December 8, 2006 for a [[Green Peace]] event in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in a campaign against illegal fishing in protected waters.<ref>[https://www.proceso.com.mx/223794/garantizan-elizondo-y-cardenas-la-proteccion-del-golfo-de-california-greenpeace Link to article by Proceso Magazine about this Greenpeace event in Puerto Vallarta]</ref>\n\nIn late 2008 Elis and Suave Records settled their lawsuit, and the band was released from their contract with Suave Records, allowing Elis to concentrate on her band and performances. She signed under new management with Zepeda Bros.\n\n=== 2009: ''Express'' ===\nAt the beginning of 2009, \"Gordo\" quit the band, and was replaced by Omar \u201cLa Do\u00f1a\u201d Gil on bass, who stayed with the band until early 2010.\n\nElis Paprika began 2009 with new live performances and writing new songs, and in May of that year, entered the studio to record the songs that would eventually become her album \"Maldito\", produced by Guido Laris. Originally intended to be released as two separate EP's, the songs were recorded at Montecristo Studios in Mexico City, but once they were ready, it wouldn't be released until some time later, due to differences with her management over the way to handle promotion as an independent release, or through a label.\n\nThat summer, Sony Music M\u00e9xico invited Elis Paprika to be a part of ''Tributo A: Ana Jos\u00e9 Nacho (Mecano)'', a Mecano Tribute record, where she recorded her version of the song \"No Tienes Nada Que Perder\".\n\n[[Juan Gabriel]] invited Elis to perform live with him on one of his concerts at [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] in Mexico City, to sing her version of \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\" live.<ref>Video of Elis Paprika performing with Juan Gabriel at Auditorio Nacional Mexico [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9BXKpo83zc]</ref>\n\nAfter not being able to release the songs she recorded that May, Elis Paprika entered the studio once more in Guadalajara at Richo Acosta's studio to record new and previously unreleased songs. ''Express'' was released, produced by Richo Acosta, and licensed to EMI Music M\u00e9xico for distribution, in October 2009, being this her first record to officially be promoted since ''Give Me Love'' in 2006. The first single from ''Express'' was \"Tarde o Temprano\".\n\n=== 2010-2011: ''Maldito'' ===\nAfter differences with her bandmates, Elis decided in early 2010, in the middle of promoting ''Express'', not to continue working with the same musicians in her band. They went their separate ways and Elis went back to being a solo artist. This interrupted the promotion of ''Express''.\n \nLuke Castillo came back to play and support Elis on guitars, and had a major role in putting a band back together. Luke invited [[Paul Richards (artist)|Paul Richards]] to play bass, and two other members of the band Aurum from Guadalajara, Vela and Luis Angel, to play guitar and drums respectively.\n \nIn May 2010, Elis moved to Mexico City in order to continue and better the handling of her career and to promote future plans. Working with Zepeda Bros. Elis decided to finally use the songs that had been recorded a year before, and since these songs had been on hold for over a year, it was decided to released them as one LP, instead of the two EPs they were originally meant for. It was because of all the time that these songs were on hold, that she named the LP ''Maldito'', which in Spanish means \"Cursed\".\n\nMeanwhile, Elis began to make new acoustic performances of her songs in unplugged shows, featuring Ernesto \"Arbol\" Licona, and Ana L\u00eda Perez, on guitars. Ernesto Licona has been constantly playing guitar on Elis\u2019 performances ever since.\n \nThat August, Vela and Luis Angel retook their labors with Aurum, and Elis invited Raul \"Rul\" Velazquez to play guitar, and Jimmy Strike, from the band Cherry Strike from Guadalajara to play drums. With this lineup, Elis played the 212 Festival by RMX, in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico, on September 12, 2010. This concert marked the beginning of her \"Maldito Tour\".\n\nThat October, after a couple of shows, Jimmy left the band to retake activities with Cherry Strike, and Cachi Zazueta became the permanent drummer.\n \nMaldito was officially released in late November 2010 under Zepeda Bros., Warner Chappell M\u00e9xico, and Dr\u00e1gora Records. It hit stores nationwide in Mexico, and on [[iTunes]] internationally.\n\nThe Maldito Tour went on until mid-2011, reaching most of Mexico. During this tour, Elis played the [[Vive Latino]] Festival for the second time, on March 8, 2011.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esCfj-psnao Video of Elis Paprika performing at Vive Latino 2011]</ref> Maldito became the record to reposition her in Mexico's Rock scene.\n\nAt the end of the Maldito Tour, in July 2011, Elis ended her working relationship with, her then management office, Zepeda Bros. and continued as a completely independent artist, handling her own office. Elis recorded the single \"Love Love Love\" at Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco, produced by Luke Castillo, which was officially released on August 4, 2011, initially as a free download through [[SoundCloud]], as a \"thank you\" to all of her fans for the success of Maldito. \"Love Love Love\" is part of the Chilean movie ''Que Pena Tu Boda''{{'}}s soundtrack, as the main credits theme,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924354/soundtrack?ref_=tt_ql_trv_7 IMDb page for Que Pena Tu Boda soundtracks]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |title=Que Pena Tu Boda the movie\u2019s official web page |access-date=2012-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904215142/http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> making this Elis' debut in South America.\n\nIn October 2011, Elis along with Rul and Cachi, from her band, got together in Guadalajara to begin writing ''Animal''. That same month, they entered Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco to record the songs, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez.\n\n=== 2012-2013: ''Animal'' ===\nElis released ''Animal'' in February 2012, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez, under Dr\u00e1gora Records. For this record, her band since the Maldito Tour of 2010-2011, adopted the name The Black Pilgrims. The song \"Animal\" was the first single.\n\nIn January 2012, Luke Castillo left the band once again, to concentrate on studio work, and was replaced by Stepha Campbell on guitars. In July 2012, Paul Richards left the band. After playing with a couple of substitute bass players for a few months, Dylan Deville <ref>[http://musica.terra.com.mx/javiera-mena-y-elis-paprika-llenan-tlms-de-poder-femenino,4a3062db1c17b310VgnVCM3000009acceb0aRCRD.html Review of a performance by Elis Paprika and Javiera Mena for Terra Live Music, with Dylan Deville playing bass for Elis Paprika]</ref> joined The Black Pilgrims in November 2012.

As a child, she trained as an Olympic gymnast and as a dancer. Her father died when she was 6. She moved to Texas with her family as a teenager in 1992 where she lived for one year. She and her family moved back to Guadalajara, and in 1994 Elis moved to Quer\u00e9taro Mexico to her aunt's. \nShe shortened her name to Elis, inspired by [[Elis Regina]].\n\n== Learning music ==\nAfter moving to Quer\u00e9taro, her aunt and uncle started her in music lessons, as all of her cousins studied music. Elis has been known to say that what she really wanted was to continue with her dancing in the hopes of becoming a professional dancer. She learned to play the Saxophone and music in general, but by a twist of fate some of her friends signed her up (unbeknownst to her) for a singing contest at school in Quer\u00e9taro, where she ended up in second place. It was there she realized that she wanted a career as a singer.\nElis then moved back to Guadalajara where, a year later, she started singing for the local band La Verdad No Importa, from where she was later fired because she \"didn\u2019t sing that good\". After that rejection she took singing and guitar lessons in order to start writing her own songs.\nIn 2000, after being in a couple of more local bands, she started formal music studies at CEDART for a couple of years. While studying there, she held a job doing press and PR for different concert promoters in Guadalajara.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 2002-2003: First demos ===\nShe interrupted her studies in 2002 and moved to [[London]] England for one year, where she began writing some of the songs she would later release as Elis Paprika. She held a job as a waitress during her stay in London. She returned to Guadalajara M\u00e9xico in 2003 where she started a band called The Paprikas, with a local musician named Raul Velazquez (not to be confused with Ra\u00fal \"Rul\" Velazquez, who would later be Elis\u2019 guitar player in The Black Pilgrims). At that point people began referring to her as \"Elis from the Paprikas\" or \"Elis Paprika\", the name she later adopted. After a few tries with The Paprikas, Elis recorded a demo for the song \"Sunny Day\", working with Shaboomy (later guitar player for [[Azul Violeta]]), and Eric Diaz, guitar player and bass player respectively from the band The Waitress<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/thewaitress The Waitress official band page]</ref> from Guadalajara M\u00e9xico. The Waitress was originally Elis\u2019 first solo project. The name of the band was inspired by her time working as a waitress in London and Guadalajara before making music. Once she began to be recognized as \"Elis Paprika\" and making more music apart from her project, Elis left The Waitress. The other members of The Waitress continued without her.\n\n=== 2004: ''Elis Paprika'' ===\nIn February 2004, Elis\u2019 showed the demo of \"Sunny Day\", to Luke Castillo, who was then playing guitar and singing for the band Becker. Luke liked what he heard and they started working together, and this is where Elis Paprika was formally established, with Luke Castillo on Guitar, Richo Acosta on Guitar, Chumino on Bass, and Chicho (also playing with the band Plastiko), on Drums. With this lineup, Elis recorded the demo for the song \"Give Me Love\". \nChicho left the band and Arnold Benz briefly became the drummer. They recorded demo versions of the songs \"Bitch\" and \"Texas\" with him.\nArnold left the band and Richo Acosta called Willy Gonzalez, from another band he played in, to take over the drums.\nLater, Jorge \"Gordo\" Miramontes came in on bass after Chumino left the band. At this point, and with this lineup, they all decided to work as a band instead of Elis being a solo artist. Elis Paprika then became the name of the band. \nTheir first live show as Elis Paprika took place in Guadalajara Jalisco M\u00e9xico, on December 14, 2004 at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara.\n\n=== 2005-2006: ''Give Me Love'' ===\nElis Paprika began playing in several venues and quickly ascended in Guadalajara's rock scene. They played Sol Radiante Festival, Zapopum Festival, and the Hard Rock Live at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara on several occasions. It was during one of these performances that people from Suave Records became interested in Elis Paprika, signing them in 2005. Under this label, Elis Paprika released the record ''Give Me Love'' in 2006, produced by Luke Castillo and Richo Acosta, and was licensed to [[Sony Music Mexico]] for its distribution in Mexico.\n\nThe first single, \"Give Me Love\", had a fast and big acceptance, and consequently Elis was invited to play at the Festival Vive Latino in 2006 and [[Corona Capital]], also in 2006. In August of that same year, Elis Paprika was named \"Band of the Month\" on [[MTV]]. After this, MTV invited Elis Paprika to perform live for a recording of the program ''Alerta''.\n\nThe song \"No Puedo\" was released as the second single in October 2006. In November 2006 [[Julieta Venegas]] invited Elis Paprika to play on her first [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] performance in Mexico City.\n\nAs all of this was taking place, contractual problems began to surface between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records.\n\n=== 2007\u20132008: ''EP2'', and Juan Gabriel tribute ===\nAfter the success of ''Give Me Love'', problems between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records increased to the point where the impulse the band had, came to a halt.\n\nIn early 2007, Elis requested Suave Records to release her, resulting in a lawsuit.\n\nLuke Castillo decided to leave the band to concentrate on his other band Becker, and Ram\u00f3n \"Zacky\" Velarde took his place in the band.\n\nElis recorded her voice for the original score of short film ''Jacinta'', winner of the Festival de Cine de Morelia, from director Karla Casta\u00f1eda, with music by Gilberto Cervantes. ''Jacinta'' was also shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] that same year.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1206015/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast IMDb page for Jacinta Full Cast and Crew, mentioning Elis Paprika as singer for original score]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.moreliafilmfest.com/ficha.php?id=991 |title=Morelia Film Festival official web page |access-date=2012-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513191359/http://moreliafilmfest.com/ficha.php?id=991 |archive-date=2012-05-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh18GDdwhTc Jacinta Short Film. Final credits mention Elis Paprika as \"Vocal Interpretation\"]</ref>\n\nElis Paprika recorded ''EP2'' in 2007, but this second record did not see a formal release due to the lawsuit with Suave Records. EP2 was released that same year, but only through free download on the [[Internet]].\n\nEarly in 2008, Elis Paprika was invited to be a part of the [[Juan Gabriel]] tribute album called ''Amo al Divo de Ju\u00e1rez''. For this, Elis recorded her own version of the Juan Gabriel song \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\". The record came out, with her version of the song as one of the official singles.\n\nElis Paprika played on December 8, 2006 for a [[Green Peace]] event in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in a campaign against illegal fishing in protected waters.<ref>[https://www.proceso.com.mx/223794/garantizan-elizondo-y-cardenas-la-proteccion-del-golfo-de-california-greenpeace Link to article by Proceso Magazine about this Greenpeace event in Puerto Vallarta]</ref>\n\nIn late 2008 Elis and Suave Records settled their lawsuit, and the band was released from their contract with Suave Records, allowing Elis to concentrate on her band and performances. She signed under new management with Zepeda Bros.\n\n=== 2009: ''Express'' ===\nAt the beginning of 2009, \"Gordo\" quit the band, and was replaced by Omar \u201cLa Do\u00f1a\u201d Gil on bass, who stayed with the band until early 2010.\n\nElis Paprika began 2009 with new live performances and writing new songs, and in May of that year, entered the studio to record the songs that would eventually become her album \"Maldito\", produced by Guido Laris. Originally intended to be released as two separate EP's, the songs were recorded at Montecristo Studios in Mexico City, but once they were ready, it wouldn't be released until some time later, due to differences with her management over the way to handle promotion as an independent release, or through a label.\n\nThat summer, Sony Music M\u00e9xico invited Elis Paprika to be a part of ''Tributo A: Ana Jos\u00e9 Nacho (Mecano)'', a Mecano Tribute record, where she recorded her version of the song \"No Tienes Nada Que Perder\".\n\n[[Juan Gabriel]] invited Elis to perform live with him on one of his concerts at [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] in Mexico City, to sing her version of \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\" live.<ref>Video of Elis Paprika performing with Juan Gabriel at Auditorio Nacional Mexico [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9BXKpo83zc]</ref>\n\nAfter not being able to release the songs she recorded that May, Elis Paprika entered the studio once more in Guadalajara at Richo Acosta's studio to record new and previously unreleased songs. ''Express'' was released, produced by Richo Acosta, and licensed to EMI Music M\u00e9xico for distribution, in October 2009, being this her first record to officially be promoted since ''Give Me Love'' in 2006. The first single from ''Express'' was \"Tarde o Temprano\".\n\n=== 2010-2011: ''Maldito'' ===\nAfter differences with her bandmates, Elis decided in early 2010, in the middle of promoting ''Express'', not to continue working with the same musicians in her band. They went their separate ways and Elis went back to being a solo artist. This interrupted the promotion of ''Express''.\n \nLuke Castillo came back to play and support Elis on guitars, and had a major role in putting a band back together. Luke invited [[Paul Richards (artist)|Paul Richards]] to play bass, and two other members of the band Aurum from Guadalajara, Vela and Luis Angel, to play guitar and drums respectively.\n \nIn May 2010, Elis moved to Mexico City in order to continue and better the handling of her career and to promote future plans. Working with Zepeda Bros. Elis decided to finally use the songs that had been recorded a year before, and since these songs had been on hold for over a year, it was decided to released them as one LP, instead of the two EPs they were originally meant for. It was because of all the time that these songs were on hold, that she named the LP ''Maldito'', which in Spanish means \"Cursed\".\n\nMeanwhile, Elis began to make new acoustic performances of her songs in unplugged shows, featuring Ernesto \"Arbol\" Licona, and Ana L\u00eda Perez, on guitars. Ernesto Licona has been constantly playing guitar on Elis\u2019 performances ever since.\n \nThat August, Vela and Luis Angel retook their labors with Aurum, and Elis invited Raul \"Rul\" Velazquez to play guitar, and Jimmy Strike, from the band Cherry Strike from Guadalajara to play drums. With this lineup, Elis played the 212 Festival by RMX, in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico, on September 12, 2010. This concert marked the beginning of her \"Maldito Tour\".\n\nThat October, after a couple of shows, Jimmy left the band to retake activities with Cherry Strike, and Cachi Zazueta became the permanent drummer.\n \nMaldito was officially released in late November 2010 under Zepeda Bros., Warner Chappell M\u00e9xico, and Dr\u00e1gora Records. It hit stores nationwide in Mexico, and on [[iTunes]] internationally.\n\nThe Maldito Tour went on until mid-2011, reaching most of Mexico. During this tour, Elis played the [[Vive Latino]] Festival for the second time, on March 8, 2011.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esCfj-psnao Video of Elis Paprika performing at Vive Latino 2011]</ref> Maldito became the record to reposition her in Mexico's Rock scene.\n\nAt the end of the Maldito Tour, in July 2011, Elis ended her working relationship with, her then management office, Zepeda Bros. and continued as a completely independent artist, handling her own office. Elis recorded the single \"Love Love Love\" at Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco, produced by Luke Castillo, which was officially released on August 4, 2011, initially as a free download through [[SoundCloud]], as a \"thank you\" to all of her fans for the success of Maldito. \"Love Love Love\" is part of the Chilean movie ''Que Pena Tu Boda''{{'}}s soundtrack, as the main credits theme,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924354/soundtrack?ref_=tt_ql_trv_7 IMDb page for Que Pena Tu Boda soundtracks]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |title=Que Pena Tu Boda the movie\u2019s official web page |access-date=2012-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904215142/http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> making this Elis' debut in South America.\n\nIn October 2011, Elis along with Rul and Cachi, from her band, got together in Guadalajara to begin writing ''Animal''. That same month, they entered Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco to record the songs, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez.\n\n=== 2012-2013: ''Animal'' ===\nElis released ''Animal'' in February 2012, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez, under Dr\u00e1gora Records. For this record, her band since the Maldito Tour of 2010-2011, adopted the name The Black Pilgrims. The song \"Animal\" was the first single.\n\nIn January 2012, Luke Castillo left the band once again, to concentrate on studio work, and was replaced by Stepha Campbell on guitars. In July 2012, Paul Richards left the band. After playing with a couple of substitute bass players for a few months, Dylan Deville <ref>[http://musica.terra.com.mx/javiera-mena-y-elis-paprika-llenan-tlms-de-poder-femenino,4a3062db1c17b310VgnVCM3000009acceb0aRCRD.html Review of a performance by Elis Paprika and Javiera Mena for Terra Live Music, with Dylan Deville playing bass for Elis Paprika]</ref> joined The Black Pilgrims in November 2012.

Barbil has an average literacy rate of 72.18%. 16% of the population is under 6 years of age. Barbil has another about 50,000 people floating population from rest of India coming here for business travel and jobs.\n\n==Languages==\nAs the Barbil area has been dominated by Ho people, local tribal people widely speak in the [[Ho language]] [it is written with the \"Varang Kshiti\" (also \"Warang Chiti\" script)] as their mode of communication.Most people can speak, write all three languages [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Hindi]] & [[English language|English]].\n\n==Industry==\nBarbil is an industrialised town with a number of steel plants, iron ore pellet plants, ore crushers and mines. The area is very rich in iron ore. The other mineral found is manganese ore. The latest demand is for iron ore [[Iron ore#Beneficiation|fines]]. Nowadays the mines cannot meet up to the demand from the area. The iron ore which is benefited is also exported to China. This town also has Steel manufacturing, Iron ore pellet manufacturer and liquid oxygen production. A large number of industries have come up in the recent past. It remains to be seen how the government's directive increasing the cost of export of raw iron ore affects the economy of Barbil town. Some Government-run Industries have closed after incurring losses.\n\n==Transport==\n[[Barbil railway station]] under Chakradharpur division is on a by line in the [[Tatanagar\u2013Bilaspur section]] of the [[Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line]] Connecting the main line at Rajkharshavan station which is about 100&nbsp;km from Barbil . Barbil is connected to Howrah,  [[Kolkata]], Bhubaneshwar, Puri and Tatanagar [[Jamshedpur]] by train. Jan Shatabdi Express runs from Howrah to Barbil and one passenger train from Tatanagar to Barbil. Barbil is also connected to Bhubaneshwar & Puri by a daily-running Intercity Express train. Barbil-Chakradharpur Intercity Express (Daily) via Dongoaposi, Jhinkpani Chaibasa at Chakradharpur one can extend the journey to [[Rourkela]] or even [[Sambalpur]] Vizag Chennai Alleppy etc. towards south and Bilaspur Nagpur Mumbai towards West and also via Keonjhar Kendujhar. Jajpur road, Cuttack Bhubaneshwar for connecting trains.\n<ref>http://indiarailinfo.com/train/2472/238/7867</ref> (Puri-Barbil).\nBarbil is also connected to Kolkata, [[Kendujhar]] and [[Bhubaneshwar]] by road.\nPrior to January 2008, there was air service from Barbil. However, international & local flights can be connected via Netaji Subhas Airport (Dum Dum, Kolkata), and also from Biju Patnaik Airport Bhubaneshwar. The Airstrip at Barbil (Tonto) can be used for private and Chartered flights.\n\nThere are many many hotels and lodges located in this town. They are: Padma Inn, Hotel Prateek, Hotel Smita, Lucky India, Aadhar Hotel, Hotel Karrow, Hotel Indrapuri and The World pinaca.\n\n== Social activities ==\n\n'BIKASH MAHAL' is the pavilion where all the social, cultural and national day events are organised.\n\nThere are so many social organizations named Barbil Haalchal, 'NATIVE VOICE', PRAYAAS, Niladri, Sambad Sahitya Ghara, SEVA GROUP, MARWADI YUVA MANCH, SAHISTYA SANSADA, GURUDWARA SINGH SABHA BARBIL, BVP, N.D.C.C AND YBCC who carry out different social events in the town.\n\nA New Town Hall by the name of '''Sita Ram Rungta''' '''Town Hall Barbil''' has come up with all modern amenities and is fully air-conditioned. It has available seating capacity of 300, which can be extended to 500 by temporary arrangement.\n\n== Festivals ==\n\nPeople of Barbil celebrate together all the festivals during the year - like Durga Puja, Laxmi puja, Raja Sankranti, Ganesh Puja, Makar Sankranti, Sri Ram Naumi, Biswakarma Puja, Chhat Puja, Guru Nanak Day, Ramzan, Idd, Eid ul Zuha (bakrid), Muharram, Eid Miladun Nabi, Kali Puja etc. and National Festivals like Republic Day, Independence Day Gandhi Jayanti, and State Festivals like Odisha Day, Madhusudan Birthday etc..\n\nViswakarma puja is also celebrated together in Barbil. We can see various pendals all around the town in Viswakarma puja as lord Viswakarma is the lord of machines and of course Barbil is a hub of many industries and heavy machines and vehicles. People worship their machine shop and vehicles on this auspicious occasion. This festival usually falls in the month of September. Durgapuja is celebrated as a grand festival in kalinga nagar which is near to barbil. Lakhs of visitors are eagarly waited for this festival and join during the 4 day festival hails from nearby areas from jharkhand also.\n\n==Health==\n\nThe air of Barbil is laden with dust due to mining activities and passage of mineral-laden trucks in the night through the town as no bypass roads for heavy vehicles are being constructed by the government. \"People with a dust allergy are advised care before coming here\". In the year 2016 there was a rampant spread of Dengue here which rattled the administration. Hundred were affected and many of them died.\n\nDespite being an important centre it has Community Health Centre and needs urgent up gradation.\n\nPosts of various departments are vacant. Doctors of various specialities are needed here and can contact directly with District Collector @ckeonjhar for direct appointment.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Kendujhar district}}\n{{Municipalities of Odisha}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Kendujhar district]]\n[[Category:Iron ore mining in India]]\n[[Category:Mining in Odisha]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=June 2018}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{POV|date=November 2017}}\n{{original research|date=November 2017}}\n{{overly detailed|date=November 2017}}\n}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                            = Barbil\n| native_name                     = Bada Barabil\n| native_name_lang                = or\n| other_name                      = \n| nickname                        = \n| settlement_type                 = City\n| image_skyline                   = \n| image_alt                       = \n| image_caption                   = \n| pushpin_map                     = India Odisha#India\n| pushpin_label_position          = \n| pushpin_map_alt                 = \n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location in Odisha, India\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|22.12|N|85.40|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type                = Country\n| subdivision_name                = {{flag|India}}\n| subdivision_type1               = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1               = [[Odisha]]\n| subdivision_type2               = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name2               = [[Keonjhar district|Keonjhar]]\n| established_title               = <-- Established -->\n| established_date                = \n| founder                         = \n| named_for                       = \n| government_type                 = \n| governing_body                  = \n| unit_pref                       = Metric\n| area_footnotes                  = \n| area_rank                       = \n| area_total_km2                  = 80\n| elevation_footnotes             = \n| elevation_m                     = 477\n| population_total                = 125000\n| population_as_of                = 2017\n| population_rank                 = \n| population_density_km2          = 1168\n| population_demonym              = \n| population_footnotes            = \n| demographics_type1              = Languages\n| demographics1_title1            = Official\n| demographics1_info1             = [[Odia language|Odia]]\n| demographics1_title2           \n| timezone1                       = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1                     = +5:30\n| postal_code_type                = [[Postal Index Number|PIN]]\n| postal_code                     = 758035\n| area_code_type                  = Telephone code\n| area_code                       = 06767\n| registration_plate              = OD 09\n| blank1_name_sec1                = [[Human sex ratio|Sex ratio]]\n| blank1_info_sec1                = 894 [[male|\u2642]]/[[female|\u2640]]\n| website                         = {{URL|odisha.gov.in}}\n| footnotes                       = \n}}\n\n'''Barbil''' is a City and a [[Municipality]] in the [[Kendujhar district]] (also known as Iron City) of the state of [[Odisha]], [[India]].

Following the unification of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] into [[Unified Silla|Silla]] and [[Balhae]] in the late 7th century, Korea was ruled by the [[Goryeo dynasty]] (918\u20131392) and the [[Joseon dynasty]] (1392\u20131897). The succeeding [[Korean Empire]] was [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexed]] into the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1910. After [[World War II]], Korea was [[Division of Korea|divided]] into Soviet and U.S.-administered zones, with the latter becoming the Republic of Korea in August 1948. In 1950, a [[North Korea]]n invasion began the [[Korean War]] and after its end in 1953, the country's economy began to soar, recording the [[List of countries by GDP (real) per capita growth rate|fastest rise in average GDP per capita]] in the world between 1980 and 1990.

The Sui emperor, Wen Ti, launched a retaliatory attack on Kogury\u014f but met with reverses and turned back in mid-course. Yang Ti, the next Sui emperor, proceeded in 612 to mount an invasion of unprecedented magnitude, marshalling a huge force said to number over a million men. And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Kogury\u014f's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Kogury\u014f capital of P'y\u014fngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Kogury\u014f commander \u016clchi Mund\u014fk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper. Yang Ti continued to send his armies against Kogury\u014f but again without success, and before long his war-weakened empire crumbled.|year=1984}}</ref><ref name=\"Nahm\">{{cite book|last1=Nahm|first1=Andrew C.|title=A Panorama of 5000 Years: Korean History|date=2005|publisher=Hollym International Corporation|location=Seoul|isbn=978-0-930878-68-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/panoramaof5000ye0000nahm/page/18 18]|edition=Second revised|quote=China, which had been split into many states since the early 3rd century, was reunified by the Sui dynasty at the end of the 6th century.

However, the people of Kogury\u014f were united and they were able to repel the Chinese aggressors. In 612, Sui troops invaded Korea again, but Kogury\u014f forces fought bravely and destroyed Sui troops everywhere. General \u016clchi Mund\u014fk of Kogury\u014f completely wiped out some 300,000 Sui troops which came across the Yalu River in the battles near the Salsu River (now Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn River) with his ingenious military tactics.

At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese troops]]. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction, and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the [[Ilminism|One-People Principle]] (based on the German [[ideology]] of the ''[[Master race|Herrenvolk]]'') an effort to build an obedient citizenry through [[ethnicity|ethnic]] homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to [[nationalism]].<ref name=Hwang93>Su-kyoung Hwang, ''Korea's Grievous War.''

This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government.  This instability was broken by the [[May 16 coup|May 16, 1961, coup]] led by General [[Park Chung-hee]]. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] enforced by political repression.\n\nPark was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a [[Yusin Constitution|new constitution]], which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The [[Economy of South Korea|Korean economy]] developed significantly during Park's tenure.  The government developed the [[Expressways in South Korea|nationwide expressway system]], the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul subway system]], and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with [[Assassination of Park Chung-hee|his assassination]] in 1979.\n\nThe years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979 there came the [[Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth]] led by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]]. Following the Coup d'\u00e9tat, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of [[Jejudo]]. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency in the events of May 17, triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy, in particular in the city of [[Gwangju]], to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the [[Gwangju massacre|Gwangju Democratization Movement]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/752055.stm Flashback: The Kwangju massacre], May 17, 2000.</ref>\n\nChun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a [[Seoul National University]] student, [[Bak Jongcheol|Park Jong-chul]], was tortured to death.<ref>[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/184219.html \"20 years later, father still seeks truth in son's death\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173203/http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/184219.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}, ''The Hankyoreh'', January 15, 2007.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The [[Korean royal court cuisine]] once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.\n\nKorean cuisine is largely based on [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[tofu]], vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes, ''[[banchan]]'' (\ubc18\ucc2c), which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. [[Kimchi]] (\uae40\uce58), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with [[sesame oil]], ''[[doenjang]]'' (\ub41c\uc7a5), a type of [[fermented bean paste|fermented soybean paste]], [[Korean soy sauce|soy sauce]], salt, garlic, ginger, and ''[[gochujang]]'' (\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5), a hot pepper paste. Other well-known dishes are ''[[Bulgogi]]'' (\ubd88\uace0\uae30), grilled marinated beef, ''[[Gimbap]]'' (\uae40\ubc25), and ''[[Tteokbokki]]'' (\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774), a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.\n\nSoups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as ''[[guk]]'' (\uad6d) are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, ''tang'' (\ud0d5; \u6e6f) has less water, and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is ''[[jjigae]]'' (\ucc0c\uac1c), a [[stew]] that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.\n\nPopular [[Korean alcoholic beverages]] include [[Soju]], [[Makgeolli]] and [[Bokbunja ju]].\n\nKorea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal [[chopstick]]s. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.<ref>[http://article.joins.com/news/blognews/article.asp?listid=12803159 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \ub3d9\uc5913\uad6d\uc758 \uc813\uac00\ub77d \ubb38\ud654\ube44\uad50].

Many K-pop acts have also been able secure a strong overseas following using online social media platforms such as the video sharing website [[YouTube]].

Seoul hosted the [[1967 ABC Championship|1967]] and [[1995 ABC Championship|1995 Asian Basketball Championship]]. The [[Korea national basketball team]] has won a record number of 23 medals at the event to date.<ref>{{cite web |title=FIBA Asia Competition Archives |work=Competition Archives |publisher=International Basketball Federation FIBA |date=September 26, 2011 |url=http://www.fibaasia.net/Competition_Archives.aspx?id=2 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Korea Taekwondo Hanmadang 70.jpg|thumb|left|[[Taekwondo]], a Korean martial art and Olympic sport]]\nSouth Korea hosted the [[Asian Games]] in 1986 (Seoul), 2002 (Busan) and 2014 (Incheon).

The Sui emperor, Wen Ti, launched a retaliatory attack on Kogury\u014f but met with reverses and turned back in mid-course. Yang Ti, the next Sui emperor, proceeded in 612 to mount an invasion of unprecedented magnitude, marshalling a huge force said to number over a million men. And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Kogury\u014f's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Kogury\u014f capital of P'y\u014fngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Kogury\u014f commander \u016clchi Mund\u014fk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper.

At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese troops]]. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction, and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the [[Ilminism|One-People Principle]] (based on the German [[ideology]] of the ''[[Master race|Herrenvolk]]'') an effort to build an obedient citizenry through [[ethnicity|ethnic]] homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to [[nationalism]].<ref name=Hwang93>Su-kyoung Hwang, ''Korea's Grievous War.''

This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government.  This instability was broken by the [[May 16 coup|May 16, 1961, coup]] led by General [[Park Chung-hee]]. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] enforced by political repression.\n\nPark was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a [[Yusin Constitution|new constitution]], which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The [[Economy of South Korea|Korean economy]] developed significantly during Park's tenure.  The government developed the [[Expressways in South Korea|nationwide expressway system]], the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul subway system]], and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with [[Assassination of Park Chung-hee|his assassination]] in 1979.\n\nThe years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979 there came the [[Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth]] led by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]]. Following the Coup d'\u00e9tat, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of [[Jejudo]]. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency in the events of May 17, triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy, in particular in the city of [[Gwangju]], to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the [[Gwangju massacre|Gwangju Democratization Movement]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/752055.stm Flashback: The Kwangju massacre], May 17, 2000.</ref>\n\nChun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The [[Korean royal court cuisine]] once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.\n\nKorean cuisine is largely based on [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[tofu]], vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes, ''[[banchan]]'' (\ubc18\ucc2c), which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. [[Kimchi]] (\uae40\uce58), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with [[sesame oil]], ''[[doenjang]]'' (\ub41c\uc7a5), a type of [[fermented bean paste|fermented soybean paste]], [[Korean soy sauce|soy sauce]], salt, garlic, ginger, and ''[[gochujang]]'' (\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5), a hot pepper paste. Other well-known dishes are ''[[Bulgogi]]'' (\ubd88\uace0\uae30), grilled marinated beef, ''[[Gimbap]]'' (\uae40\ubc25), and ''[[Tteokbokki]]'' (\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774), a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.\n\nSoups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as ''[[guk]]'' (\uad6d) are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, ''tang'' (\ud0d5; \u6e6f) has less water, and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is ''[[jjigae]]'' (\ucc0c\uac1c), a [[stew]] that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.\n\nPopular [[Korean alcoholic beverages]] include [[Soju]], [[Makgeolli]] and [[Bokbunja ju]].\n\nKorea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal [[chopstick]]s. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.<ref>[http://article.joins.com/news/blognews/article.asp?listid=12803159 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \ub3d9\uc5913\uad6d\uc758 \uc813\uac00\ub77d \ubb38\ud654\ube44\uad50].

Many K-pop acts have also been able secure a strong overseas following using online social media platforms such as the video sharing website [[YouTube]]. South Korean singer [[PSY]] became an international sensation when his song \"[[Gangnam Style]]\" topped global music charts in 2012. <!--Do not add a list of groups here without first suggesting it at the Talk page.-->\n\nSince the success of the film ''[[Shiri (film)|Shiri]]'' in 1999, the [[Korean film]] industry has begun to gain recognition internationally. Domestic film has a dominant share of the market, partly because of the existence of [[screen quotas]] requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days a year.<ref>[http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_Ec_detail.htm?No=74142 \"S.Korea's Screen Quota Hinders Market Access\"], KBS World, July 16, 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Television in South Korea|South Korean television shows]] have become popular outside of Korea.

The district has an area of 5,165&nbsp;km\u00b2, and a population of 1,648,997 (2011 census). The town of [[Balangir]] is the district headquarters. The composition of the land is predominantly rural. Other important big & small towns in '''Balangir district''' are [[Titlagarh]], [[Patnagarh]], [[Kantabanji]], [[Loisinga|Loisingha]], [[Saintala]], Belpada, Tushra, [[Agalpur]], Deogaon, Chudapali, [[Biripali]], Bhalumunda, Bangomunda, Sindhekela, Turekela.\n\n== History ==\nThe district of Balangir is named after the headquarters towns of Balangir. This town was also the headquarters of the feudatory state of [[Patna (princely state)|Patna]] since the 1880s. The district of Balangir is flanked in the northwest by the Gandhamardan hills. Many hill streams traverse it. It is the land of [[Tantra|Tantrik]] culture. It is also notable for having experimented in the [[republic]]an form of Government that was overthrown by Ramai Deo.\n\n===Etymology===\n[[Image:Balangir palace.jpg|thumb|250px|''Royal Palace of [[Balangir]]]]\nBalaram Deo, the 19th Raja of [[Patna (princely state)]], founded a town called Balramgarh and shifted the capital of Patna state from [[Patnagarh]] to Balramgarh in the early 16th century. Subsequently, the town was renamed as Balangir from Balramgarh. After around 8 years of rule in Patna state, he was awarded the land from river Ang till the boundary of Bamra kingdom by his mother. Subsequently, he founded a kingdom named [[Sambalpur]], which went on to become a strong kingdom.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Orissa District Gazetteers: Balangir, Printed by the Superintendent, Orissa Government Press, 1966</ref>\n\n===Ancient History===\n[[Image:Indralath Temple.jpg|thumb|250px|''8th Century AD Indralath Temple at Ranipur-Jharial''.]]\nThe territory comprising the present district of Balangir was in ancient times a part of the [[South Kosala]] {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. According to tradition, the origin of South Kosala dates back to the time of [[Rama]] and scholars like Pargiter believe that Rama's long stay in that region gave rise to the name of South Kosala after his original homeland Kosala. According to Padmapurana, the kingdom of Kosala, after Rama, was divided between '''Lava''' and '''Kusa''', his two son. Later Kusa founded the city of '''Kusasthalipura''' and ruled over the southern half of Kosala (that included modern day [[Western Odisha]] and [[Chhattisgarh]] State){{citation needed|date=October 2017}}.\n\nDuring the time of Grammarian [[P\u0101\u1e47ini|Panini]] (5th Century B.C), a territory named Taitila [[Janapada]] flourished to the west of Kalinga and that territory has been associated by historians with the modern town of [[Titlagarh]] in Balangir district. Taitala Janapada was famous for trade in some commodities described by the Grammarian as \"Kadru\" the meaning of which may be either horse or cotton fabrics.<ref>Panini's Ashtadyayi VI. 2. 42</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Chetiya Jataka]], the capital of the [[Chedi Kingdom|Chedi]] country was '''Sothivatinagara''' which is the same as '''Suktimatipuri''' of [[Harivamsa]] and '''Suktisahvaya''' of the [[Mahabharata]] (Vana Parva). The epic (''Adi Parva'') also states that the capital of the Chedis was situated on the bank of river Suktimati which is the Sukhtel river of Balangir district<ref>D. C. Sircar Ancient Geography of India Pg.55</ref>\n\nThus the ancestors of King of Kalinga [[Kharavela]] were from the Balangir district as they were ruling over the territory drained by the Sukhtel river in Balangir, wherefrom they advanced towards the east and became the master of Kalinga by the 1st Century B.C. In the [[Hathigumpha inscription]], Kharavela refers to one Rajashri Vasu as his ancestor, who is probably the same as Vasu, the son of Abhichandra, the founder of Chedi Kingdom. This Vasu may also be identified with Uparichara Vasu of the Mahabharata (Adi Parva) where hs is described as the King of the Chedis who were ruling in the modern district of Balangir and Subarnapur.<ref>D. C. Sircar Ancient Geography of India</ref>\n\nBalangir region continued to be under the rule of Chedis during the 1st Century AD but in the 2nd century it came under the possession of the Satavahanas, whose king was Gautamiputra Satakarni. He is said to have built a magnificent vihara for his philosopher friend Nagarjuna on the ''Po Lo Mo Lo Ki Li'' or Parimalagir identified with the modern Gandharmardan hills.\n\n===Early history===\n[[Image:Chousatjogini.jpg|thumb|250px|''8th Century AD Chousath Jogini Temple, One out of the four such temple in India''.]]\nThe earliest noted history of Balangir district dates back to the third century BC. The earliest introduction and spread of Aryan religious practice in [[Dakshin Kosal|Dakhin Kosala]] came with the initial incursion of the Jain religion. According to [[Bhagavati Sutra]] and [[Harivamshapurana|Harivamsha Purana]], Mahavir started his earliest preaching of ''Dharma'' at Nalanda, Rajgriha, Paniya Bhumi and Siddharthagrama. According to some scholars, (D. C. Sircar) Punita Bhumi is a synonym of Paniya Bhumi as per ''Odra-Magadhi'' language. It is the same as Paniya Bhumi or Nagoloka, the present Nagpur, and it is further identified as Bhogapura, the modern Bastar, region of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Koraput]], [[Kalahandi]] and Balangir district of [[Odisha]].<ref>D. C. Sircar, Inscription of Orissa, Pg. 263</ref>\n\nIn some of the insctiptions found in Balangir and Sonepur district, it has been mentioned that this part of the land was known as Attavika during Ashoka's invasion of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] in 261 B.C.\n\nThe Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] visited ''Po Lo Mo Lo Ki Li'' monastery at modern Paikmal in the 7th Century AD. It was then having cloisters and lofty halls and those halls were arranged in five tiers each with four courts with temples containing life-size gold images of [[Buddha]]<ref>Yuan Chawng 'Journey of the West'</ref>\n\n[[Utkal University]] Archaeology Prof. Dr. Sadasiva Pradhan excavated the Gumagad site under Gudvela block near the Tel river valley in Balangir district, where he found that a strategic military hub existed in the 1st century BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kddf.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/gumagod.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819082133/http://kddf.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/gumagod.png |archivedate=2011-08-19 }}</ref> It was set up by a king contemporary to king Kharavela. Four copper plates were also found at Terssingha village which speaks of the Tel valley civilisation.

According to historians this area was known for its Tantra-Vidya throughout India. Somavanshi kings of Dakhin Koshal had built many temples here that can be dated back to the 8th-9th centuries AD. It is said that there were at least 200 temples covering an area of about half a mile in length and a quarter of a mile in width. The largest stone temple is '''Someswar Siva''', which was constructed by a Mattamayura Shaivacharya Gagana Siva whose inscription can be found on the lintel of the temple.\n\nRanipur-Jharial houses one among the five existing rare monuments of Hypaethral temples (temples without roofs) dedicated to 64 yoginis in India. The other three are at Hirapur near Bhubaneswar, Khajurao & Bheraghat near Jabalpur, and Dudhai near Lalitpur. The images at Ranipur-Jharial are made of sandstone. The temple of 64 yoginis of Ranipur-Jharial is famous not only for its architecture, but also for its religious significance. Three-faced Natraj Shiva idol stands at the centre of the temple encircled by 64 sculptures of the Yogini goddesses in various positions. Unfortunately with the curse of time, and also due to lack of care only 48 Yoginis are left by now.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kosal.org/|title=kosal.org|website=www.kosal.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007103548/http://kosal.org/|archivedate=7 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Chouhan Rule===\n[[Image:FLAG patna.jpeg|thumb|250px|''Official flag of the Royal Family of [[Balangir]]]]\nRamai Deo founded the kingdom of Patna in 1360 AD, and within a short span of its aggressive career become the head of the cluster of eighteen Garhs.

They together form the district of Balangir. [[Sonepur District|Sonepur]] was carved out as a separate district on April 1, 1993. The last ruler of Patna, Rajendra Narayan Singh Deo successfully made the transition to democratic politics. He became the [[List of Chief Ministers of Odisha|Chief Minister of Odisha]] from 1967 until 1971.\n\n===Recent developments===\nCurrently people of this district along with the nine other districts of western [[Odisha]] are demanding for a separate state called Koshal. According to unofficial sources around 20,000 people are migrating from Balangir every year to other states in search of work. More than 90% population in this district are staying below poverty line.\n\nThere is an Ordnance Factory of the [[Ordnance Factories Board]] which manufactures products for the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nOverall this western district of Odisha needs quick improvement to catch up with the other parts of the state and country. The government needs to take care of special responsibility towards the development like construction of roads, buildings, education to the people, developments like railway and air connectivity. For instance the nearest airport from any part of the district is Bhubaneswar, Raipur or Visakhapatnam which are minimum 7 hours journey from Balangir. Also the standard of living of the people needs to be improved by providing the minimum requirements to the people by providing jobs to them so that migration of the people from this part to other parts of the country could be avoided. At the same time, social menaces like dowry killing, and unsocial activities like theft, burglary and murder could be kept in control.\n\nOn May 13, 2010, Annual Credit Plan for the year 2010-2011 was launched with a projected plan outlay of Rs. 309.97 crores. Special programmes are envisaged to arrest the flow of labour to other states in search of work, popularly known as ''Dadan Shramik''.\n\n==Geography==\nThe district of Balangir is flanked in the north-west by the Gandhamardan hills, a name of the Ramayana Fame, and in the north-east by the rock-infested Mahanadi. It is traversed by many hill streams and is interspersed with the evergreen woodlands, the shelter of Bison and Sambar. The main forest area stretches along the western boundary bordering the [[Nuapada]], [[Kalahandi district]] and then turns to the east running parallel to the Gandhamardan range. This forest track is broken by occasional clearings and small settlements, but it mostly consists of thick vegetation in which bamboo of excellent quality grows and Sal, Sahaj, Piasal, Dhaura and Ebony form the principal timber. The crest of the range of Gandhamardan hills is fine platue, some ten miles long, with an average height of 3000 feet. For most part of this district lies on the north-west bank of river Tel, which form the boundary between his district and the district of [[Kalahandi]], [[Sonepur district|Sonepur]], [[Boudh district|Boudh]] and [[Kandhamal]].\n\n===Main rivers and tributaries===\n* [[Mahanadi]]\n* Tel\n* Undar, Lanth, Sungadh and Sukhtel (Tributaries of the Tel)\n* Ang\n* Jira\n* Saleshing\n\n===Hill System===\n[[Image:Matkhai.jpg|thumb|250px|''Mathkhai, The Sacred Hill on the outskirt of Balangir City also a Landmark of the District''.]]\n* Gandhamardan (3,296&nbsp;ft)\n* Butel (2,670&nbsp;ft)\n* Chahdli (2,630&nbsp;ft)\n* Thuta (2,056&nbsp;ft)\n* Bender (1,920&nbsp;ft)\n* Patpani\n* Chhatardandi\n* Matkhai (2,591)\n\n==Economy==\nIn 2006 the [[Ministry of Panchayati Raj]] named Balangir one of the country's 250 [[Poverty in India|most backward districts]] (out of a total of [[Districts of India|640]]).<ref name=brgf/> It is one of the 19 districts in [[Odisha]] currently receiving funds from the [[Backward Regions Grant Fund|Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme]] (BRGF).<ref name=brgf>{{cite web|author=Ministry of Panchayati Raj |date=September 8, 2009 |title=A Note on the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme |publisher=National Institute of Rural Development |url=http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405033402/http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Administrative setup==\nBolangir District has been divided into 3 Sub-Divisions and 14 Blocks.

Wandering teachers called Abadhanas were holding primary classes in towns and villages where they were teaching only reading, writing and arithmetic. The village Pathsalas were maintained by villagers where the Abadhanas were being engaged for teaching. Western education came to the district towards the end of the 19th century AD. It was in 1894 that an English School was started in Balangir Town by the then Maharaja Ramachandra and English education was introduced.\n\nDuring India's independence Balangir district had 39 High Schools for boys and 4 for girls and 119 Middle English Schools including 11 for girls. The total number of boys and girls in Secondary schools was 11,906 and 1,550 respectively.\n\n===Balangir medical college controversy===\nOne R V S Educational Trust of Coimbatore is going to establish the Bolangir Medical College as per the Government Notification dated 07-11-2009.

The district has an area of 5,165&nbsp;km\u00b2, and a population of 1,648,997 (2011 census). The town of [[Balangir]] is the district headquarters. The composition of the land is predominantly rural. Other important big & small towns in '''Balangir district''' are [[Titlagarh]], [[Patnagarh]], [[Kantabanji]], [[Loisinga|Loisingha]], [[Saintala]], Belpada, Tushra, [[Agalpur]], Deogaon, Chudapali, [[Biripali]], Bhalumunda, Bangomunda, Sindhekela, Turekela.\n\n== History ==\nThe district of Balangir is named after the headquarters towns of Balangir. This town was also the headquarters of the feudatory state of [[Patna (princely state)|Patna]] since the 1880s. The district of Balangir is flanked in the northwest by the Gandhamardan hills. Many hill streams traverse it. It is the land of [[Tantra|Tantrik]] culture. It is also notable for having experimented in the [[republic]]an form of Government that was overthrown by Ramai Deo.\n\n===Etymology===\n[[Image:Balangir palace.jpg|thumb|250px|''Royal Palace of [[Balangir]]]]\nBalaram Deo, the 19th Raja of [[Patna (princely state)]], founded a town called Balramgarh and shifted the capital of Patna state from [[Patnagarh]] to Balramgarh in the early 16th century. Subsequently, the town was renamed as Balangir from Balramgarh. After around 8 years of rule in Patna state, he was awarded the land from river Ang till the boundary of Bamra kingdom by his mother. Subsequently, he founded a kingdom named [[Sambalpur]], which went on to become a strong kingdom.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Orissa District Gazetteers: Balangir, Printed by the Superintendent, Orissa Government Press, 1966</ref>\n\n===Ancient History===\n[[Image:Indralath Temple.jpg|thumb|250px|''8th Century AD Indralath Temple at Ranipur-Jharial''.]]\nThe territory comprising the present district of Balangir was in ancient times a part of the [[South Kosala]] {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. According to tradition, the origin of South Kosala dates back to the time of [[Rama]] and scholars like Pargiter believe that Rama's long stay in that region gave rise to the name of South Kosala after his original homeland Kosala. According to Padmapurana, the kingdom of Kosala, after Rama, was divided between '''Lava''' and '''Kusa''', his two son. Later Kusa founded the city of '''Kusasthalipura''' and ruled over the southern half of Kosala (that included modern day [[Western Odisha]] and [[Chhattisgarh]] State){{citation needed|date=October 2017}}.\n\nDuring the time of Grammarian [[P\u0101\u1e47ini|Panini]] (5th Century B.C), a territory named Taitila [[Janapada]] flourished to the west of Kalinga and that territory has been associated by historians with the modern town of [[Titlagarh]] in Balangir district. Taitala Janapada was famous for trade in some commodities described by the Grammarian as \"Kadru\" the meaning of which may be either horse or cotton fabrics.<ref>Panini's Ashtadyayi VI. 2. 42</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Chetiya Jataka]], the capital of the [[Chedi Kingdom|Chedi]] country was '''Sothivatinagara''' which is the same as '''Suktimatipuri''' of [[Harivamsa]] and '''Suktisahvaya''' of the [[Mahabharata]] (Vana Parva). The epic (''Adi Parva'') also states that the capital of the Chedis was situated on the bank of river Suktimati which is the Sukhtel river of Balangir district<ref>D. C. Sircar Ancient Geography of India Pg.55</ref>\n\nThus the ancestors of King of Kalinga [[Kharavela]] were from the Balangir district as they were ruling over the territory drained by the Sukhtel river in Balangir, wherefrom they advanced towards the east and became the master of Kalinga by the 1st Century B.C. In the [[Hathigumpha inscription]], Kharavela refers to one Rajashri Vasu as his ancestor, who is probably the same as Vasu, the son of Abhichandra, the founder of Chedi Kingdom. This Vasu may also be identified with Uparichara Vasu of the Mahabharata (Adi Parva) where hs is described as the King of the Chedis who were ruling in the modern district of Balangir and Subarnapur.<ref>D. C. Sircar Ancient Geography of India</ref>\n\nBalangir region continued to be under the rule of Chedis during the 1st Century AD but in the 2nd century it came under the possession of the Satavahanas, whose king was Gautamiputra Satakarni. He is said to have built a magnificent vihara for his philosopher friend Nagarjuna on the ''Po Lo Mo Lo Ki Li'' or Parimalagir identified with the modern Gandharmardan hills.\n\n===Early history===\n[[Image:Chousatjogini.jpg|thumb|250px|''8th Century AD Chousath Jogini Temple, One out of the four such temple in India''.]]\nThe earliest noted history of Balangir district dates back to the third century BC. The earliest introduction and spread of Aryan religious practice in [[Dakshin Kosal|Dakhin Kosala]] came with the initial incursion of the Jain religion. According to [[Bhagavati Sutra]] and [[Harivamshapurana|Harivamsha Purana]], Mahavir started his earliest preaching of ''Dharma'' at Nalanda, Rajgriha, Paniya Bhumi and Siddharthagrama. According to some scholars, (D. C. Sircar) Punita Bhumi is a synonym of Paniya Bhumi as per ''Odra-Magadhi'' language. It is the same as Paniya Bhumi or Nagoloka, the present Nagpur, and it is further identified as Bhogapura, the modern Bastar, region of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Koraput]], [[Kalahandi]] and Balangir district of [[Odisha]].<ref>D. C. Sircar, Inscription of Orissa, Pg. 263</ref>\n\nIn some of the insctiptions found in Balangir and Sonepur district, it has been mentioned that this part of the land was known as Attavika during Ashoka\u2019s invasion of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] in 261 B.C.\n\nThe Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] visited ''Po Lo Mo Lo Ki Li'' monastery at modern Paikmal in the 7th Century AD.

According to historians this area was known for its Tantra-Vidya throughout India. Somavanshi kings of Dakhin Koshal had built many temples here that can be dated back to the 8th-9th centuries AD. It is said that there were at least 200 temples covering an area of about half a mile in length and a quarter of a mile in width. The largest stone temple is '''Someswar Siva''', which was constructed by a Mattamayura Shaivacharya Gagana Siva whose inscription can be found on the lintel of the temple.\n\nRanipur-Jharial houses one among the five existing rare monuments of Hypaethral temples (temples without roofs) dedicated to 64 yoginis in India. The other three are at Hirapur near Bhubaneswar, Khajurao & Bheraghat near Jabalpur, and Dudhai near Lalitpur. The images at Ranipur-Jharial are made of sandstone. The temple of 64 yoginis of Ranipur-Jharial is famous not only for its architecture, but also for its religious significance. Three-faced Natraj Shiva idol stands at the centre of the temple encircled by 64 sculptures of the Yogini goddesses in various positions. Unfortunately with the curse of time, and also due to lack of care only 48 Yoginis are left by now.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kosal.org/|title=kosal.org|website=www.kosal.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007103548/http://kosal.org/|archivedate=7 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Chouhan Rule===\n[[Image:FLAG patna.jpeg|thumb|250px|''Official flag of the Royal Family of [[Balangir]]]]\nRamai Deo founded the kingdom of Patna in 1360 AD, and within a short span of its aggressive career become the head of the cluster of eighteen Garhs.

More than 90% population in this district are staying below poverty line.\n\nThere is an Ordnance Factory of the [[Ordnance Factories Board]] which manufactures products for the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nOverall this western district of Odisha needs quick improvement to catch up with the other parts of the state and country. The government needs to take care of special responsibility towards the development like construction of roads, buildings, education to the people, developments like railway and air connectivity. For instance the nearest airport from any part of the district is Bhubaneswar, Raipur or Visakhapatnam which are minimum 7 hours journey from Balangir. Also the standard of living of the people needs to be improved by providing the minimum requirements to the people by providing jobs to them so that migration of the people from this part to other parts of the country could be avoided. At the same time, social menaces like dowry killing, and unsocial activities like theft, burglary and murder could be kept in control.\n\nOn May 13, 2010, Annual Credit Plan for the year 2010-2011 was launched with a projected plan outlay of Rs. 309.97 crores. Special programmes are envisaged to arrest the flow of labour to other states in search of work, popularly known as ''Dadan Shramik''.\n\n==Geography==\nThe district of Balangir is flanked in the north-west by the Gandhamardan hills, a name of the Ramayana Fame, and in the north-east by the rock-infested Mahanadi. It is traversed by many hill streams and is interspersed with the evergreen woodlands, the shelter of Bison and Sambar. The main forest area stretches along the western boundary bordering the [[Nuapada]], [[Kalahandi district]] and then turns to the east running parallel to the Gandhamardan range. This forest track is broken by occasional clearings and small settlements, but it mostly consists of thick vegetation in which bamboo of excellent quality grows and Sal, Sahaj, Piasal, Dhaura and Ebony form the principal timber. The crest of the range of Gandhamardan hills is fine platue, some ten miles long, with an average height of 3000 feet. For most part of this district lies on the north-west bank of river Tel, which form the boundary between his district and the district of [[Kalahandi]], [[Sonepur district|Sonepur]], [[Boudh district|Boudh]] and [[Kandhamal]].\n\n===Main rivers and tributaries===\n* [[Mahanadi]]\n* Tel\n* Undar, Lanth, Sungadh and Sukhtel (Tributaries of the Tel)\n* Ang\n* Jira\n* Saleshing\n\n===Hill System===\n[[Image:Matkhai.jpg|thumb|250px|''Mathkhai, The Sacred Hill on the outskirt of Balangir City also a Landmark of the District''.]]\n* Gandhamardan (3,296&nbsp;ft)\n* Butel (2,670&nbsp;ft)\n* Chahdli (2,630&nbsp;ft)\n* Thuta (2,056&nbsp;ft)\n* Bender (1,920&nbsp;ft)\n* Patpani\n* Chhatardandi\n* Matkhai (2,591)\n\n==Economy==\nIn 2006 the [[Ministry of Panchayati Raj]] named Balangir one of the country's 250 [[Poverty in India|most backward districts]] (out of a total of [[Districts of India|640]]).<ref name=brgf/> It is one of the 19 districts in [[Odisha]] currently receiving funds from the [[Backward Regions Grant Fund|Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme]] (BRGF).<ref name=brgf>{{cite web|author=Ministry of Panchayati Raj |date=September 8, 2009 |title=A Note on the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme |publisher=National Institute of Rural Development |url=http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405033402/http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Administrative setup==\nBolangir District has been divided into 3 Sub-Divisions and 14 Blocks.

The musical is based on [[Lynn Riggs]]' 1931 play, ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]''.  Set in farm country outside the town of [[Claremore, Oklahoma|Claremore]], [[Indian Territory]], in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry.  A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fianc\u00e9e, Ado Annie.\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened on March 31, 1943.  It was a box-office smash and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning 1955 [[Oklahoma!

Rodgers, with [[Lorenz Hart]], had produced over two dozen musicals since the 1920s, including such popular successes as ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938) and ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940).<ref>Secrest, pp. 403\u201304</ref>  Among other successes, Hammerstein had written the words for ''[[Rose-Marie]]'' (1924), ''[[The Desert Song]]'' (1926), ''[[The New Moon]]'' (1927) and ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927).  Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote musicals, songs and films, sharing an [[Academy Award]] for his song with [[Jerome Kern]], \"[[The Last Time I Saw Paris (song)|The Last Time I Saw Paris]]\", which was included in the 1941 film ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]''.<ref>[http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 \u201cOscar Hammerstein II\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217193407/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 |date=December 17, 2010 }}.  Songwriters Hall of Fame, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>  By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, and he became unreliable, prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.<ref>Layne, Joslyn. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p84807|pure_url=yes}} Lorenz Hart Biography], Allmusic, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>\n\n===Conception===\nIn 1931, the [[Theatre Guild]] produced [[Lynn Riggs]]'s ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', a play about settlers in [[Oklahoma]]'s Indian Territory. Though the play was not successful, ten years later in 1941, [[Theresa Helburn]], one of the Guild's producers, saw a summer-stock production supplemented with traditional [[folk song]]s and [[square dance]]s and decided the play could be the basis of a musical that might revive the struggling Guild. She contacted [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]], whose first successful [[Rodgers and Hart|collaboration]], ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', had been produced by the Theatre Guild in 1925.  Rodgers wanted to work on the project and obtained the rights for himself and Hart.  Rodgers had asked [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] to collaborate with him and Hart. During the tryouts of Rodgers and Hart's ''[[By Jupiter]]'' in 1941, Hammerstein had assured Rodgers that if Hart was ever unable to work, he would be willing to take his place.<ref name=Nolan>Nolan, pp. 1\u201325.</ref>  Coincidentally in 1942, Hammerstein had thought of musicalizing ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', but when he had approached [[Jerome Kern]] about it, the latter declined.  Hammerstein learned that Rodgers was seeking someone to write the book, and he eagerly took the opportunity.  Hart lost interest in the musical; he preferred contemporary, urbane shows that would showcase his witty lyric writing, and he found the farmers and cowhands in ''Green Grow the Lilacs'' corny and uninspiring. Moreover, spiraling downward, consumed by his longstanding alcoholism, Hart no longer felt like writing.  He embarked on a vacation to Mexico, advising Rodgers that Hammerstein would be a good choice of a new collaborator.<ref name=Kantor>Kantor and Malson, pp. 196\u2013202</ref><ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThis partnership allowed both Rodgers and Hammerstein to follow their preferred writing methods: Hammerstein preferred to write a complete lyric before it was set to music, and Rodgers preferred to set completed lyrics to music. In Rodgers' previous collaborations with Hart, Rodgers had always written the music first, since the unfocused Hart needed something on which to base his lyrics. Hammerstein's previous collaborators included composers [[Rudolf Friml]], [[Herbert Stothart]], [[Vincent Youmans]], and Kern, who all wrote music first, for which Hammerstein then wrote lyrics.  The role reversal in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership permitted Hammerstein to craft the lyrics into a fundamental part of the story so that the songs could amplify and intensify the story instead of diverting it.<ref name=Nolan/> As Rodgers and Hammerstein began developing the new musical, they agreed that their musical and dramatic choices would be dictated by the source material, ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', not by musical comedy conventions.<ref name=Kantor/>  Musicals of that era featured big production numbers, novelty acts, and show-stopping specialty dances; the libretti typically focused on humor, with little dramatic development, punctuated with songs that effectively halted the story for their duration.<ref name=Kenrick2>Kenrick, John.

Though [[Theresa Helburn]], codirector of the Theatre Guild, suggested [[Shirley Temple]] as Laurey and [[Groucho Marx]] as Ali Hakim, Rodgers and Hammerstein, with director [[Rouben Mamoulian|Rouben Mamoulian's]] support, insisted that performers more dramatically appropriate for the roles be cast.  As a result, there were no stars in the production, another unusual step.<ref name=Nolan/> The production was choreographed by [[Agnes de Mille]] (her first time choreographing a musical on Broadway), who provided one of the show's most notable and enduring features: a 15-minute first-act ballet finale (often referred to as the [[dream ballet]]) depicting Laurey's struggle to evaluate her suitors, Jud and Curly.<ref name=Kenrick2/>\n\nThe first title given to the work was ''Away We Go!'' which opened for out-of-town-tryouts in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]'s [[Shubert Theatre (New Haven)|Shubert Theatre]] on March 11, 1943.<ref>[http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php Information on the tryout from Capa.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511195305/http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php |date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref>  Expectations for the show were low; Hammerstein had written six flops in a row, and the show had no star power.

The New Haven and [[Boston]] audiences were enthusiastic, although the reviews were only fair. Of the changes made before the show went to Broadway, two would prove significant: the addition of the show-stopping [[Number (music)|musical number]], \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" and the decision to retitle the musical after that number.<ref>[[Helene Hanff|Hanff, Helene]].

He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a [[box social]] dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse. The man who wins each basket will eat lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long.  He attempts to persuade her by telling her that he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy (\"[[The Surrey with the Fringe on Top]]\"), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a rig.\n\nThe lonely, disturbed farm hand Jud Fry has become obsessed with Laurey and asks her to the dance.  She accepts to spite Curly, although she is afraid of Jud.  Meanwhile, cowboy Will Parker returns bedazzled and souvenir-laden from a trip to modern [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (\"[[Kansas City (Oklahoma!)|Kansas City]]\").  He won $50 (${{Inflation|US|50|1906|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) at the fair, which, according to his girlfriend Ado Annie's father, Andrew Carnes, is the money he needs to marry Ado Annie.  Unfortunately, he spent all the money on gifts for her. Will also purchased a \"Little Wonder\" (a metal tube used for looking at pictures, but with a hidden blade inside) for Ado Annie's father, unaware of its deadly secret. Later, Ado Annie confesses to Laurey that while Will has been away, she has been spending a lot of time with Ali Hakim, a [[Persia]]n peddler.  Laurey tells her she'll have to choose between them, but Ado Annie insists she loves them both (\"[[I Cain't Say No]]\").  Laurey and her friends prepare for the social, while Gertie Cummings flirts with Curly (her obnoxious laugh floating in to taunt Laurey).  Laurey tells her friends that she doesn't really care about Curly (\"[[Many a New Day]]\").\n\nAndrew Carnes discovers Annie with Ali Hakim.  After questioning Ado Annie about their relationship, he forces Hakim at gunpoint to agree to marry her.  Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation (\"[[It's a Scandal! It's a Outrage!]]\").  Curly discovers that Laurey is going to the box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead.  Afraid to tell Jud she won't go with him, Laurey tries to convince Curly (and herself) that she does not love him (\"[[People Will Say We're in Love]]\").  Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him.  Curly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him (\"Pore Jud Is Daid\").  Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud's resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride (\"[[Lonely Room]]\").\n\nConfused by her feelings for Curly and her fear of Jud, Laurey purchases a \"magic potion\" (referred to as [[smelling salts]], but actually [[laudanum]]) from Ali Hakim, which the unscrupulous peddler guarantees will reveal her true love.  She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves (\"Out of My Dreams\"), then falls asleep under the influence of the opiate (\"Dream Sequence\"). In an extended dream ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of what marriage to Curly would be like.  Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly. She cannot escape him, confused by her desires.  The dream makes her realize that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the dance with Jud; he has come for her, and they leave for the box social.\n\n===Act II===\nAt the social, during an upbeat [[square dance]] (\"The Farmer and the Cowman\"), the [[Range war|rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys]] over fences and water rights has led to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone.<ref>Carter, Tim. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn_RDxA6wxAC&pg=PA198&dq=Oklahoma+%22Aunt+Eller%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Oklahoma%20%22Aunt%20Eller%22&f=true \"Reading Oklahoma!\"] ''Oklahoma!: The Making of an American Musical'', Yale University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-300-10619-X}}, p. 177</ref> Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. In an effort to rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will's souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will's Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie's basket, not realizing that without the $50, he would no longer have the money her father insisted he needs to \"purchase\" marriage with her.  Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey's basket comes up for auction.  Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey's basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money.  Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket.  Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance.  Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (\"[[All Er Nuthin']]\").\n\nJud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her.  When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her.  She then fires him as her farmhand, screaming at him to get off her property.  Jud furiously threatens Laurey before he departs; Laurey bursts into tears and calls for Curly.  She tells him that she has fired Jud and is frightened by what Jud might do now.  Curly, seeing that she has turned to him for guidance and safety, reassures her and proposes to her, and she accepts (\"People Will Say We're In Love (Reprise)\"). He then realizes that he must now become a farmer. Afterward, Ali Hakim decides to leave the territory and bids Ado Annie goodbye after telling her Will is the man she should marry.\n\nThree weeks later, Laurey and Curly are married and everyone rejoices in celebration of the territory's impending statehood (\"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\"). During the celebration, Ali Hakim returns with his new wife, Gertie, whom he unwillingly married after being [[Forced marriage#Shotgun wedding|threatened by her father]] with a shotgun. A drunken Jud reappears, harasses Laurey by kissing her and punches Curly, and they begin a fistfight.  Jud attacks Curly with a knife and Curly dodges, causing Jud to fall on his own knife.  Jud soon dies. The wedding guests hold a makeshift trial for Curly, at Aunt Eller's urging, as the couple is due to leave for their honeymoon. The judge, Andrew Carnes, declares the verdict: \"not guilty!\" Curly and Laurey depart on their honeymoon in the [[Surrey (carriage)|surrey]] with the fringe on top (\"Finale Ultimo\").\n\n==Principal roles and notable performers==\n<!--this list is for stage performers only, please do not add film cast.

The film followed the stage version more closely than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein stage-to-film adaptation, although it divided the long first scene into several shorter scenes, changing the locations of several of the songs.  For example, \"Kansas City\" is performed at the train station, where Aunt Eller and other cowboys meet Will Parker just after he returns from Kansas City.  Lyrics in the song about a [[burlesque]] stripteaser were slightly changed to pass [[censorship|film censorship]].<ref name=\"Chapin\"/>  In a nod to ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', which was the basis of the musical, Jud attempts revenge on Curly and Laurey by burning a haystack they stand on, before Curly jumps down, landing on Jud and causing him to fall on his own knife.

It was the first U.S. [[cast album]] featuring the original Broadway cast of a musical.  It sold over a million copies, prompting the label to call the cast back into the studio to record three additional selections that had been left out of the first set. These were issued as ''Oklahoma! Volume Two''.  In 1949, Decca re-released the first set on LP but not the second set, which soon became a very rare collectors' item.  All subsequent LP releases were similarly incomplete. Finally in 2000, Decca Broadway went back to the original glass masters to generate a new high fidelity transfer of the complete song program and released it on CD, utilizing the original 78 album artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccabroadway.com/product/default.aspx?pid=56721&aid=96945 |title='Decca Broadway \u2013 Oklahoma' web page.

Musical Cyberspace, March 31, 2003, accessed September 26, 2010</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe original production of ''Oklahoma!'' was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' pronounced the musical \"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers's music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\".<ref name=Suskin/> In the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', Howard Barnes wrote, \"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended. ... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Louis Kronenberger of [[PM (newspaper)|''PM'']] opined that \"Mr. Hammerstein's lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart's at their best, but the songs in ''Oklahoma!'' call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\nIn the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', [[Burns Mantle]] declared that \"''Oklahoma!'' really is different \u2013 beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, ''Oklahoma!'' seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since [[Edna Ferber]]'s ''Show Boat''\".<ref name=Suskin/> ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' critic [[Burton Rascoe]] particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \"Out of My Dreams\" and \"All Er Nuthin'\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights. ...  They are spinetingling, out of this world.\"<ref name=Suskin/>  In ''[[The New York Sun]]'', [[Ward Morehouse]] commented that \"''Oklahoma!'' is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Lorenz Hart himself \"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in [[Sardi's]] restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\"<ref name=Nolan/>\n\nThe only negative review of the musical appeared in the ''[[New York Post]]'': The critic wrote that \"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\", stating that the score consisted of \"a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\"  She concluded that the show was \"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\n==Antecedents and influence==\nAccording to playwright and theatre writer Thomas Hischak, \"Not only is ''Oklahoma!'' the most important of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, it is also the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. ...  It is the first fully integrated musical play and its blending of song, character, plot and even dance would serve as the model for Broadway shows for decades.\"<ref>Hischak, p. 201</ref>  William Zinsser observed that ''Oklahoma!'' broke the old \"musical comedy conventions\", with the songs \"delving into character\" and advancing the plot.<ref>Zinsser, William.  ''Easy to Remember:The Great American Songwriters and Their Songs'', David R. Godine Publisher, 2006, {{ISBN|1-56792-325-9}}, p. 180</ref>  The show \"became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to ''Oklahoma!''\"<ref>Everett, p. 124.</ref>  ''Oklahoma!'' made Rodgers and Hammerstein \"the most important contributors to the musical-play form. ... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own\".<ref>Lubbock, Mark.

The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. [[Jerome Kern|Kern's]] exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization.\"<ref>Bordman, Gerald and Thomas Hischak, eds.

He concludes: \"But ''Oklahoma!'' was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom.\"<ref name=Mordden140/>\n\nCritic Andrea Most argues that the musical reflected author's and composer's Jewish heritage and desires for Jewish-Americans. Most asserts that the musical was written at a time when America presented Jews with an opportunity to gain privileged status by assimilating into mainstream American culture and passing as white Americans. Most claims that although there were rarely any identifiably Jewish characters in plays of this time period, characters such as Ali and Jud allowed for subtle Jewish representation, Ali embodying an accepted and friendly ideal for Jewish-Americans and Jud embodying Jewish-Americans' fear of becoming a marginalized minority like black Americans. He also feels that the play contained subtle odes to [[Zionism]] as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Most|first=Andrea|date=1998|title='We Know We Belong to the Land': The Theatricality of Assimilation in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Oklahoma!''|journal=PMLA|volume=113|issue=1|pages=77\u201389|doi=10.2307/463410|jstor=463410|issn=0030-8129}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n!

The musical is based on [[Lynn Riggs]]' 1931 play, ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]''.  Set in farm country outside the town of [[Claremore, Oklahoma|Claremore]], [[Indian Territory]], in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry.  A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fianc\u00e9e, Ado Annie.\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened on March 31, 1943.  It was a box-office smash and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning 1955 [[Oklahoma!

Rodgers, with [[Lorenz Hart]], had produced over two dozen musicals since the 1920s, including such popular successes as ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938) and ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940).<ref>Secrest, pp. 403\u201304</ref>  Among other successes, Hammerstein had written the words for ''[[Rose-Marie]]'' (1924), ''[[The Desert Song]]'' (1926), ''[[The New Moon]]'' (1927) and ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927).  Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote musicals, songs and films, sharing an [[Academy Award]] for his song with [[Jerome Kern]], \"[[The Last Time I Saw Paris (song)|The Last Time I Saw Paris]]\", which was included in the 1941 film ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]''.<ref>[http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 \u201cOscar Hammerstein II\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217193407/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 |date=December 17, 2010 }}.  Songwriters Hall of Fame, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>  By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, and he became unreliable, prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.<ref>Layne, Joslyn. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p84807|pure_url=yes}} Lorenz Hart Biography], Allmusic, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>\n\n===Conception===\nIn 1931, the [[Theatre Guild]] produced [[Lynn Riggs]]'s ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', a play about settlers in [[Oklahoma]]'s Indian Territory. Though the play was not successful, ten years later in 1941, [[Theresa Helburn]], one of the Guild's producers, saw a summer-stock production supplemented with traditional [[folk song]]s and [[square dance]]s and decided the play could be the basis of a musical that might revive the struggling Guild. She contacted [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]], whose first successful [[Rodgers and Hart|collaboration]], ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', had been produced by the Theatre Guild in 1925.  Rodgers wanted to work on the project and obtained the rights for himself and Hart.  Rodgers had asked [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] to collaborate with him and Hart. During the tryouts of Rodgers and Hart's ''[[By Jupiter]]'' in 1941, Hammerstein had assured Rodgers that if Hart was ever unable to work, he would be willing to take his place.<ref name=Nolan>Nolan, pp. 1\u201325.</ref>  Coincidentally in 1942, Hammerstein had thought of musicalizing ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', but when he had approached [[Jerome Kern]] about it, the latter declined.  Hammerstein learned that Rodgers was seeking someone to write the book, and he eagerly took the opportunity.  Hart lost interest in the musical; he preferred contemporary, urbane shows that would showcase his witty lyric writing, and he found the farmers and cowhands in ''Green Grow the Lilacs'' corny and uninspiring. Moreover, spiraling downward, consumed by his longstanding alcoholism, Hart no longer felt like writing.  He embarked on a vacation to Mexico, advising Rodgers that Hammerstein would be a good choice of a new collaborator.<ref name=Kantor>Kantor and Malson, pp. 196\u2013202</ref><ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThis partnership allowed both Rodgers and Hammerstein to follow their preferred writing methods: Hammerstein preferred to write a complete lyric before it was set to music, and Rodgers preferred to set completed lyrics to music. In Rodgers' previous collaborations with Hart, Rodgers had always written the music first, since the unfocused Hart needed something on which to base his lyrics. Hammerstein's previous collaborators included composers [[Rudolf Friml]], [[Herbert Stothart]], [[Vincent Youmans]], and Kern, who all wrote music first, for which Hammerstein then wrote lyrics.  The role reversal in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership permitted Hammerstein to craft the lyrics into a fundamental part of the story so that the songs could amplify and intensify the story instead of diverting it.<ref name=Nolan/> As Rodgers and Hammerstein began developing the new musical, they agreed that their musical and dramatic choices would be dictated by the source material, ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', not by musical comedy conventions.<ref name=Kantor/>  Musicals of that era featured big production numbers, novelty acts, and show-stopping specialty dances; the libretti typically focused on humor, with little dramatic development, punctuated with songs that effectively halted the story for their duration.<ref name=Kenrick2>Kenrick, John.

Though [[Theresa Helburn]], codirector of the Theatre Guild, suggested [[Shirley Temple]] as Laurey and [[Groucho Marx]] as Ali Hakim, Rodgers and Hammerstein, with director [[Rouben Mamoulian|Rouben Mamoulian's]] support, insisted that performers more dramatically appropriate for the roles be cast.  As a result, there were no stars in the production, another unusual step.<ref name=Nolan/> The production was choreographed by [[Agnes de Mille]] (her first time choreographing a musical on Broadway), who provided one of the show's most notable and enduring features: a 15-minute first-act ballet finale (often referred to as the [[dream ballet]]) depicting Laurey's struggle to evaluate her suitors, Jud and Curly.<ref name=Kenrick2/>\n\nThe first title given to the work was ''Away We Go!'' which opened for out-of-town-tryouts in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]'s [[Shubert Theatre (New Haven)|Shubert Theatre]] on March 11, 1943.<ref>[http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php Information on the tryout from Capa.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511195305/http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php |date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref>  Expectations for the show were low; Hammerstein had written six flops in a row, and the show had no star power.

The New Haven and [[Boston]] audiences were enthusiastic, although the reviews were only fair. Of the changes made before the show went to Broadway, two would prove significant: the addition of the show-stopping [[Number (music)|musical number]], \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" and the decision to retitle the musical after that number.<ref>[[Helene Hanff|Hanff, Helene]].

He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a [[box social]] dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse. The man who wins each basket will eat lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long.  He attempts to persuade her by telling her that he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy (\"[[The Surrey with the Fringe on Top]]\"), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a rig.\n\nThe lonely, disturbed farm hand Jud Fry has become obsessed with Laurey and asks her to the dance.  She accepts to spite Curly, although she is afraid of Jud.  Meanwhile, cowboy Will Parker returns bedazzled and souvenir-laden from a trip to modern [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (\"[[Kansas City (Oklahoma!)|Kansas City]]\").  He won $50 (${{Inflation|US|50|1906|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) at the fair, which, according to his girlfriend Ado Annie's father, Andrew Carnes, is the money he needs to marry Ado Annie.  Unfortunately, he spent all the money on gifts for her. Will also purchased a \"Little Wonder\" (a metal tube used for looking at pictures, but with a hidden blade inside) for Ado Annie's father, unaware of its deadly secret. Later, Ado Annie confesses to Laurey that while Will has been away, she has been spending a lot of time with Ali Hakim, a [[Persia]]n peddler.  Laurey tells her she'll have to choose between them, but Ado Annie insists she loves them both (\"[[I Cain't Say No]]\").  Laurey and her friends prepare for the social, while Gertie Cummings flirts with Curly (her obnoxious laugh floating in to taunt Laurey).  Laurey tells her friends that she doesn't really care about Curly (\"[[Many a New Day]]\").\n\nAndrew Carnes discovers Annie with Ali Hakim.  After questioning Ado Annie about their relationship, he forces Hakim at gunpoint to agree to marry her.  Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation (\"[[It's a Scandal! It's a Outrage!]]\").  Curly discovers that Laurey is going to the box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead.  Afraid to tell Jud she won't go with him, Laurey tries to convince Curly (and herself) that she does not love him (\"[[People Will Say We're in Love]]\").  Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him.  Curly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him (\"Pore Jud Is Daid\").  Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud's resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride (\"[[Lonely Room]]\").\n\nConfused by her feelings for Curly and her fear of Jud, Laurey purchases a \"magic potion\" (referred to as [[smelling salts]], but actually [[laudanum]]) from Ali Hakim, which the unscrupulous peddler guarantees will reveal her true love.  She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves (\"Out of My Dreams\"), then falls asleep under the influence of the opiate (\"Dream Sequence\"). In an extended dream ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of what marriage to Curly would be like.  Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly. She cannot escape him, confused by her desires.  The dream makes her realize that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the dance with Jud; he has come for her, and they leave for the box social.\n\n===Act II===\nAt the social, during an upbeat [[square dance]] (\"The Farmer and the Cowman\"), the [[Range war|rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys]] over fences and water rights has led to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone.<ref>Carter, Tim. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn_RDxA6wxAC&pg=PA198&dq=Oklahoma+%22Aunt+Eller%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Oklahoma%20%22Aunt%20Eller%22&f=true \"Reading Oklahoma!\"] ''Oklahoma!: The Making of an American Musical'', Yale University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-300-10619-X}}, p. 177</ref> Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. In an effort to rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will's souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will's Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie's basket, not realizing that without the $50, he would no longer have the money her father insisted he needs to \"purchase\" marriage with her.  Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey's basket comes up for auction.  Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey's basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money.  Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket.  Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance.  Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (\"[[All Er Nuthin']]\").\n\nJud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her.  When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her.  She then fires him as her farmhand, screaming at him to get off her property.  Jud furiously threatens Laurey before he departs; Laurey bursts into tears and calls for Curly.  She tells him that she has fired Jud and is frightened by what Jud might do now.  Curly, seeing that she has turned to him for guidance and safety, reassures her and proposes to her, and she accepts (\"People Will Say We're In Love (Reprise)\"). He then realizes that he must now become a farmer. Afterward, Ali Hakim decides to leave the territory and bids Ado Annie goodbye after telling her Will is the man she should marry.\n\nThree weeks later, Laurey and Curly are married and everyone rejoices in celebration of the territory's impending statehood (\"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\"). During the celebration, Ali Hakim returns with his new wife, Gertie, whom he unwillingly married after being [[Forced marriage#Shotgun wedding|threatened by her father]] with a shotgun. A drunken Jud reappears, harasses Laurey by kissing her and punches Curly, and they begin a fistfight.  Jud attacks Curly with a knife and Curly dodges, causing Jud to fall on his own knife.

The film followed the stage version more closely than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein stage-to-film adaptation, although it divided the long first scene into several shorter scenes, changing the locations of several of the songs.  For example, \"Kansas City\" is performed at the train station, where Aunt Eller and other cowboys meet Will Parker just after he returns from Kansas City.

It was the first U.S. [[cast album]] featuring the original Broadway cast of a musical.  It sold over a million copies, prompting the label to call the cast back into the studio to record three additional selections that had been left out of the first set. These were issued as ''Oklahoma! Volume Two''.  In 1949, Decca re-released the first set on LP but not the second set, which soon became a very rare collectors' item.  All subsequent LP releases were similarly incomplete. Finally in 2000, Decca Broadway went back to the original glass masters to generate a new high fidelity transfer of the complete song program and released it on CD, utilizing the original 78 album artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccabroadway.com/product/default.aspx?pid=56721&aid=96945 |title='Decca Broadway \u2013 Oklahoma' web page.

Musical Cyberspace, March 31, 2003, accessed September 26, 2010</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe original production of ''Oklahoma!'' was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' pronounced the musical \"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers's music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\".<ref name=Suskin/> In the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', Howard Barnes wrote, \"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended. ... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Louis Kronenberger of [[PM (newspaper)|''PM'']] opined that \"Mr. Hammerstein's lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart's at their best, but the songs in ''Oklahoma!'' call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\nIn the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', [[Burns Mantle]] declared that \"''Oklahoma!'' really is different \u2013 beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, ''Oklahoma!'' seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since [[Edna Ferber]]'s ''Show Boat''\".<ref name=Suskin/> ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' critic [[Burton Rascoe]] particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \"Out of My Dreams\" and \"All Er Nuthin'\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights. ...  They are spinetingling, out of this world.\"<ref name=Suskin/>  In ''[[The New York Sun]]'', [[Ward Morehouse]] commented that \"''Oklahoma!'' is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Lorenz Hart himself \"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in [[Sardi's]] restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\"<ref name=Nolan/>\n\nThe only negative review of the musical appeared in the ''[[New York Post]]'': The critic wrote that \"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\", stating that the score consisted of \"a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\"  She concluded that the show was \"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\n==Antecedents and influence==\nAccording to playwright and theatre writer Thomas Hischak, \"Not only is ''Oklahoma!'' the most important of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, it is also the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. ...  It is the first fully integrated musical play and its blending of song, character, plot and even dance would serve as the model for Broadway shows for decades.\"<ref>Hischak, p. 201</ref>  William Zinsser observed that ''Oklahoma!'' broke the old \"musical comedy conventions\", with the songs \"delving into character\" and advancing the plot.<ref>Zinsser, William.  ''Easy to Remember:The Great American Songwriters and Their Songs'', David R. Godine Publisher, 2006, {{ISBN|1-56792-325-9}}, p. 180</ref>  The show \"became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to ''Oklahoma!''\"<ref>Everett, p. 124.</ref>  ''Oklahoma!'' made Rodgers and Hammerstein \"the most important contributors to the musical-play form. ... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own\".<ref>Lubbock, Mark.

He concludes: \"But ''Oklahoma!'' was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom.\"<ref name=Mordden140/>\n\nCritic Andrea Most argues that the musical reflected author's and composer's Jewish heritage and desires for Jewish-Americans. Most asserts that the musical was written at a time when America presented Jews with an opportunity to gain privileged status by assimilating into mainstream American culture and passing as white Americans. Most claims that although there were rarely any identifiably Jewish characters in plays of this time period, characters such as Ali and Jud allowed for subtle Jewish representation, Ali embodying an accepted and friendly ideal for Jewish-Americans and Jud embodying Jewish-Americans' fear of becoming a marginalized minority like black Americans. He also feels that the play contained subtle odes to [[Zionism]] as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Most|first=Andrea|date=1998|title='We Know We Belong to the Land': The Theatricality of Assimilation in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Oklahoma!''|journal=PMLA|volume=113|issue=1|pages=77\u201389|doi=10.2307/463410|jstor=463410|issn=0030-8129}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n!
