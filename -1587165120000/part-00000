''Sale of Goods Act 1979''. [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]</ref> [[purchase order|requisition]], or a direct interaction with the ''buyer'' at the [[point of sale]]. There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the [[Commodity|item]], and the settlement of a [[price]], in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. The ''seller'', not the [[Purchasing|purchaser]], typically executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of [[payment]]. In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on behalf of the owner is known as a '''salesman''' or '''saleswoman''' or '''salesperson''', but this often refers to someone selling goods in a store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including ''[[salesclerk]]'', ''shop assistant'', and ''retail clerk''.\n\nIn common law countries, sales are governed generally by the [[common law]] and [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s. In the [[United States]], the laws governing sales of goods are somewhat uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adopted]] Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], albeit with some non-uniform variations.\n\n==Definition==\nA person or organization expressing an interest in acquiring the offered item of value is referred to as a potential buyer, prospective customer, or prospect. Buying and selling are understood to be two sides of the same \"coin\" or transaction. Both seller and buyer engage in a process of negotiation to consummate the exchange of values. The exchange, or selling, process has implied rules and identifiable stages. It is implied that the selling process will proceed fairly and ethically so that the parties end up nearly equally rewarded. The stages of selling, and buying, involve getting acquainted, assessing each party's need for the other's item of value, and determining if the values to be exchanged are equivalent or nearly so, or, in buyer's terms, \"worth the price\". Sometimes, sellers have to use their own experiences when selling products with appropriate discounts.<ref name=seller>{{cite journal |title=Buyer Success and Failure in Bargaining and Its Consequences |first=C. |last=Putthiwanit |first2=S.-H. |last2=Ho |journal=Australian Journal of Business and Management Research  |volume=1 |issue=5 |year=2011 |pages=83\u201392 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the skills required are different, from a management viewpoint, sales is a part of [[marketing]].<ref>Philip Kotler, ''Principles of Marketing,'' Prentice -Hall, 1980</ref> Sales often form a separate grouping in a corporate structure, employing separate specialist operatives known as ''salespersons'' (singular: ''salesperson''). Selling is considered by many to be a sort of [[persuasion|persuad]]ing \"art\".

[INFOGRAPHIC]|work=Sales Speaker Marc Wayshak|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}</ref> While the [[sales process]] refers to a systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, the definition of the selling is somewhat ambiguous due to the close nature of [[advertising]], [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[public relations]], and [[direct marketing]].\n\nSelling is the profession-wide term, much like [[marketing]] defines a profession. Recently, attempts have been made to clearly understand who is in the sales profession, and who is not.

Selling is the final stage in marketing which puts the plan into effect. A marketing plan includes pricing, promotion, place, and product (the 4 P's). A marketing department in an organization has the goals of increasing the desirability and value of the products and services to the customer and increasing the number and engagement of successful interactions between potential customers and the organization. Achieving this goal may involve the sales team using promotional techniques such as [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], [[publicity]], and [[public relations]], creating new sales channels, or creating new products. It can also include encouraging the potential customer to visit the organization's website, contact the organization for more information, or interact with the organization via social media channels such as Twitter, Facebook and [[blog]]s. Social values play a major role in consumer decision processes. Marketing is the whole of the work on persuasion made for the whole of the target people.

Petersen goes on to highlight that salespeople spend approximately 40 percent of their time preparing customer-facing deliverables while leveraging less than 50 percent of the materials created by marketing, adding to perceptions that marketing is out of touch with the customer and that sales is resistant to [[messaging]] and [[Marketing strategy|strategy]].\n\n==Methods==\n{{See also|Personal selling}}\n\n{{Prose|section|date=March 2017}}\nA sale can take place through:<ref>{{Cite book |title= Compendium of Professional Selling |publisher= United Professional Sales Association |date= n.d. |url= http://www.upsa-intl.org/index-4-cops.htm |isbn= <!--? --> |access-date= 2007-07-07 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070626141928/http://www.upsa-intl.org/index-4-cops.htm |archive-date= 2007-06-26 |url-status= dead }}\n</ref>\n\n* Agency-based sales\n** [[Complex sales]]\n** [[Consignment]]\n** [[Consultant|Consultative sales]]\n** [[Retail]] or [[consumer]]\n** Sales agents (for example in real estate or in manufacturing)\n** [[Sales outsourcing]] through direct branded representation\n** [[Telemarketing]] or telesales\n** Transaction sales\n* [[Business-to-business]] \u2013 Business-to-business (\"B2B\") sales are likely to be larger in terms of volume, economic value and complexity than business-to-consumer (\"B2C\") sales.

Because of this complexity, there is a need to manage the relationships between the buying and selling organizations, for example using Peter Cheverton's relationship models<ref>{{Cite book|title = Key Account Management 4th Edition|last = Peter|first = Cheverton|publisher = Kogan Page|year = 2008|isbn = 978 0 7494 5277 3|location = |pages = 90\u2013104}}</ref> and the stakeholder map by Anderson, Bryson and Crosby<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://cep.lse.ac.uk/seminarpapers/10-02-03-BRY.pdf|title = What To Do When Stakeholders Matter: A Guide to Stakeholder Identification and Analysis Techniques|last = John|first = Bryson|date = 10 Feb 2003|journal = London School of Economics and Political Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n* Channel sales, an indirect sales model, which differs from direct sales.

This is most often applied in large transactions.\n* Disclosed dual agent: This is where the salesman represents both parties in the sale and acts as a [[Mediation|mediator]] for the transaction. The role of the salesman here is to oversee that both parties receive an honest and fair deal.\n* Internet Sales Professionals: These people are primarily responsible for ensuring immediate response to the leads generated via social media, website or email campaigns.\n* Sales broker, seller agency, seller agent, [[Manufacturers' representative|seller representative]]: This is a traditional role where the salesman represents a person or company on the selling end of a deal.\n* Sales managers aim to implement various sales strategies and management techniques in order to facilitate improved [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] and increased sales volume. They are also responsible for coordinating the sales and marketing department as well as oversight concerning the [[Justice|fair]] and [[honesty|honest]] execution of the sales process by their agents.\n* Sales outsourcing involves direct branded representation where the sales representatives are recruited, hired, and managed by an external entity but hold quotas, represent themselves as the brand of the client, and report all activities (through their own [[sales management]] channels) back to the client. It is akin to a virtual extension of a sales force (see [[sales outsourcing]]).\n* Salesperson: The primary function of professional salespeople is to generate and close business resulting in revenue. The salesperson will accomplish their primary function through a variety of means including phone calls, email, social media, networking, and [[cold calling]].  The primary objective of the successful salesperson is to find the consumers to sell to.  Sales are often referred to as a \"numbers game\" because a general law of averages and pattern of successful closing of business will emerge through heightened sales activity. These activities include but are not limited to: locating prospects, fostering relationships with prospects, building trust with future clients, identifying and filling needs of consumers, and therefore turning prospective customers into actual ones. Many tools are used by successful salespeople, the most important of which is questioning which can be defined as a series of questions and resulting answers allowing the salesperson to understand a customer's goals and requirements relevant to the product they are selling. The creation of value or perceived value is the result of taking the information gathered, analyzing the goals and needs of the prospective customer and leveraging the products or services the salesperson's firm represents or sells in a way that most effectively achieves the prospective client's goals or suits their needs.  Effective salespeople will package their offering and present their proposed solution in a way that leads the prospective customer to the conclusion that they acquire the solution, resulting in revenue and profit for the salesperson and the organization they represent.\n* Transaction broker: This is where the salesperson represents neither party but handles the transaction only. The seller owes no responsibility to either party getting a fair or honest deal, just that all papers are handled properly.\n\n==={{anchord|Inside sales}} vs. {{anchord|outside sales}}===\nIn the United States, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] defines outside sales representatives as \"employees [who] sell their employer's products, services, or facilities to customers away from their employer's place(s) of business, in general, either at the customer's place of business or by selling door-to-door at the customer's home\" while defining those who work \"from the employer's location\" as inside sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/overtime/s1.htm |title=elaws - FLSA Overtime Security Advisor |publisher=[[United States Department of Labor]] |date= |access-date=2011-05-25 |archive-date=2011-10-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006052431/http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/overtime/s1.htm}}</ref> Inside sales generally involves attempting to [[closing (sales)|close business]] primarily over the phone via [[telemarketing]], while outside sales (or \"field\" sales) will usually involve initial phone work to book sales calls at the potential buyer's location to attempt to close the deal in person.

There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the [[Commodity|item]], and the settlement of a [[price]], in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. The ''seller'', not the [[Purchasing|purchaser]], typically executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of [[payment]]. In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on behalf of the owner is known as a '''salesman''' or '''saleswoman''' or '''salesperson''', but this often refers to someone selling goods in a store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including ''[[salesclerk]]'', ''shop assistant'', and ''retail clerk''.\n\nIn common law countries, sales are governed generally by the [[common law]] and [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s. In the [[United States]], the laws governing sales of goods are somewhat uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adopted]] Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], albeit with some non-uniform variations.\n\n==Definition==\nA person or organization expressing an interest in acquiring the offered item of value is referred to as a potential buyer, prospective customer, or prospect. Buying and selling are understood to be two sides of the same \"coin\" or transaction. Both seller and buyer engage in a process of negotiation to consummate the exchange of values. The exchange, or selling, process has implied rules and identifiable stages. It is implied that the selling process will proceed fairly and ethically so that the parties end up nearly equally rewarded. The stages of selling, and buying, involve getting acquainted, assessing each party's need for the other's item of value, and determining if the values to be exchanged are equivalent or nearly so, or, in buyer's terms, \"worth the price\". Sometimes, sellers have to use their own experiences when selling products with appropriate discounts.<ref name=seller>{{cite journal |title=Buyer Success and Failure in Bargaining and Its Consequences |first=C. |last=Putthiwanit |first2=S.-H. |last2=Ho |journal=Australian Journal of Business and Management Research  |volume=1 |issue=5 |year=2011 |pages=83\u201392 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the skills required are different, from a management viewpoint, sales is a part of [[marketing]].<ref>Philip Kotler, ''Principles of Marketing,'' Prentice -Hall, 1980</ref> Sales often form a separate grouping in a corporate structure, employing separate specialist operatives known as ''salespersons'' (singular: ''salesperson'').

Petersen goes on to highlight that salespeople spend approximately 40 percent of their time preparing customer-facing deliverables while leveraging less than 50 percent of the materials created by marketing, adding to perceptions that marketing is out of touch with the customer and that sales is resistant to [[messaging]] and [[Marketing strategy|strategy]].\n\n==Methods==\n{{See also|Personal selling}}\n\n{{Prose|section|date=March 2017}}\nA sale can take place through:<ref>{{Cite book |title= Compendium of Professional Selling |publisher= United Professional Sales Association |date= n.d. |url= http://www.upsa-intl.org/index-4-cops.htm |isbn= <!--? --> |access-date= 2007-07-07 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070626141928/http://www.upsa-intl.org/index-4-cops.htm |archive-date= 2007-06-26 |url-status= dead }}\n</ref>\n\n* Agency-based sales\n** [[Complex sales]]\n** [[Consignment]]\n** [[Consultant|Consultative sales]]\n** [[Retail]] or [[consumer]]\n** Sales agents (for example in real estate or in manufacturing)\n** [[Sales outsourcing]] through direct branded representation\n** [[Telemarketing]] or telesales\n** Transaction sales\n* [[Business-to-business]] \u2013 Business-to-business (\"B2B\") sales are likely to be larger in terms of volume, economic value and complexity than business-to-consumer (\"B2C\") sales. Often the complexity involves one business working closely with the other to define problems, to finding solutions, to supporting after-sale operation. Because of this complexity, there is a need to manage the relationships between the buying and selling organizations, for example using Peter Cheverton's relationship models<ref>{{Cite book|title = Key Account Management 4th Edition|last = Peter|first = Cheverton|publisher = Kogan Page|year = 2008|isbn = 978 0 7494 5277 3|location = |pages = 90\u2013104}}</ref> and the stakeholder map by Anderson, Bryson and Crosby<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://cep.lse.ac.uk/seminarpapers/10-02-03-BRY.pdf|title = What To Do When Stakeholders Matter: A Guide to Stakeholder Identification and Analysis Techniques|last = John|first = Bryson|date = 10 Feb 2003|journal = London School of Economics and Political Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n* Channel sales, an indirect sales model, which differs from direct sales.

This is most often applied in large transactions.\n* Disclosed dual agent: This is where the salesman represents both parties in the sale and acts as a [[Mediation|mediator]] for the transaction. The role of the salesman here is to oversee that both parties receive an honest and fair deal.\n* Internet Sales Professionals: These people are primarily responsible for ensuring immediate response to the leads generated via social media, website or email campaigns.\n* Sales broker, seller agency, seller agent, [[Manufacturers' representative|seller representative]]: This is a traditional role where the salesman represents a person or company on the selling end of a deal.\n* Sales managers aim to implement various sales strategies and management techniques in order to facilitate improved [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] and increased sales volume. They are also responsible for coordinating the sales and marketing department as well as oversight concerning the [[Justice|fair]] and [[honesty|honest]] execution of the sales process by their agents.\n* Sales outsourcing involves direct branded representation where the sales representatives are recruited, hired, and managed by an external entity but hold quotas, represent themselves as the brand of the client, and report all activities (through their own [[sales management]] channels) back to the client. It is akin to a virtual extension of a sales force (see [[sales outsourcing]]).\n* Salesperson: The primary function of professional salespeople is to generate and close business resulting in revenue. The salesperson will accomplish their primary function through a variety of means including phone calls, email, social media, networking, and [[cold calling]].  The primary objective of the successful salesperson is to find the consumers to sell to.  Sales are often referred to as a \"numbers game\" because a general law of averages and pattern of successful closing of business will emerge through heightened sales activity. These activities include but are not limited to: locating prospects, fostering relationships with prospects, building trust with future clients, identifying and filling needs of consumers, and therefore turning prospective customers into actual ones. Many tools are used by successful salespeople, the most important of which is questioning which can be defined as a series of questions and resulting answers allowing the salesperson to understand a customer's goals and requirements relevant to the product they are selling. The creation of value or perceived value is the result of taking the information gathered, analyzing the goals and needs of the prospective customer and leveraging the products or services the salesperson's firm represents or sells in a way that most effectively achieves the prospective client's goals or suits their needs.  Effective salespeople will package their offering and present their proposed solution in a way that leads the prospective customer to the conclusion that they acquire the solution, resulting in revenue and profit for the salesperson and the organization they represent.\n* Transaction broker: This is where the salesperson represents neither party but handles the transaction only. The seller owes no responsibility to either party getting a fair or honest deal, just that all papers are handled properly.\n\n==={{anchord|Inside sales}} vs. {{anchord|outside sales}}===\nIn the United States, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] defines outside sales representatives as \"employees [who] sell their employer's products, services, or facilities to customers away from their employer's place(s) of business, in general, either at the customer's place of business or by selling door-to-door at the customer's home\" while defining those who work \"from the employer's location\" as inside sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/overtime/s1.htm |title=elaws - FLSA Overtime Security Advisor |publisher=[[United States Department of Labor]] |date= |access-date=2011-05-25 |archive-date=2011-10-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006052431/http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/overtime/s1.htm}}</ref> Inside sales generally involves attempting to [[closing (sales)|close business]] primarily over the phone via [[telemarketing]], while outside sales (or \"field\" sales) will usually involve initial phone work to book sales calls at the potential buyer's location to attempt to close the deal in person. Some companies have an inside sales department that works with outside representatives and book their appointments for them.
