A longer variant is ''\u02beasta\u0121firu -ll\u0101ha rabb\u012b wa-\u02beat\u016bbu \u02beilayh{{smallsup|i}}'' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u063a\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0631\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0651\u064a \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062a\u064f\u0648\u0628\u064f \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650|link=no}}). It is considered one of the essential parts of worship in [[Islam]].\n\n==Etymology==\nIstighfar is derived from the Arabic root {{rtl-lang|ar|\u063a-\u0641-\u0631}}, which related the covering of a thing with that which will keep it clean.\n\n==Meaning==\n\"Istighfar\" means to pray to [[Allah]] that He may protect the [[supplicant]] from the [[evil]] consequences and poisonous influences of their transgressions and misdeeds, both in this world and the hereafter. Astaghfirullah literally translates to \"I seek forgiveness in Allah\". In a religious way, people can recite it during [[meditation]] or say it to others to show [[humility]]. That is to say that Allah is the greater or that goodness comes from Allah. In popular culture, people can say this if they see something wrong or shameful.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n== Necessity of Istighfar==\nIslam posits that human beings were created by Allah, with the ability to choose their own actions; either to do good deeds and obey Allah or choose to do evil deeds and disobey (Him).{{Quran-usc|76|3}} However, Allah in His immense mercy and wisdom, knowing the fact that human beings were prone to errors, and in order to prevent man from carrying the burden of His sin(s) forever, opened the door of seeking Istighfar (forgiveness) for His servants who might have (mistakenly) committed [[sin]] or submitted to His desires and ignored the dictates of his conscience. Thus, Istighfar is the weapon of believers against [[shaytan]] who tries to lead them into hell by inviting them to sin.\n\n==In the Qur'an==\nIstighfar, and some other names from the same root such as [[Ghafir]], [[Al-Ghafoor]], [[Ghaffar]], occur in the Qur'an more than seventy times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.islamicity.org/11211/forgiveness-and-repentance-in-islam/|title=Forgiveness and Repentance in Islam - IslamiCity|website=www.islamicity.org|language=en|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Quranic verses regarding Istighfar==\nIn the [[Qur'an]],  there are numerous [[\u0100yah|verses]] on the issue of Istighfar, in which Allah commands the believers to always seek His forgiveness and turn to Him. Some examples of these verses are:\n\n* \"And those who when they commit an [[indecency]] or do injustice to their [[souls]] remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their faults; and who forgives the faults but Allah. And (who) do not knowingly persist in what they have done. (As for) these their reward is [[forgiveness]] from their [[Lord]], and [[gardens]] beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and excellent is the reward of the labourers\".{{Quran-usc|3|135-136}}\n* O you who believe! Turn to Allah (a Tawba of [[Nas\u016bh]]) sincere turning; maybe your Lord will remove from you your evil and cause you to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow\".{{Quran-usc|66|8}}\n* \"And whoever does evil or acts unjustly to his [[soul]], then asks forgiveness of Allah, he shall find Allah Forgiving, [[Merciful]]\".{{Quran-usc|4|110}}\n* \"Will they not then turn to Allah and ask His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful\". \"Will they not then turn to Allah and ask His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful\".{{Quran-usc|5|74}}\n* \"And you that ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him; He will provide you with a goodly provision to an appointed term and bestow His grace on every one endowed with grace, and if you turn back, then surely I fear for you the [[chastisement]] of a great day\".{{Quran-usc|11|3}}\n* \"And return to your Lord time after time and submit to Him before there comes to you the [[punishment]], then you shall not be helped\".{{Quran-usc|39|54}}\n\n==In Sunnah==\n* In [[hadith]], it was reported that: \"The Prophet sought the forgiveness (Istighfar) from Allah, frequently and on daily basis\".\n* \"The Prophet is spoken of in a hadith as saying Istighfar a hundred times a day, despite his [[infallibility]]\".\n* The prophet used to seek forgiveness in the morning and night.\n* The prophet said: \"The more one [[prays]] for [[pardoning]] of his sins the more good deeds will be credited to his account and on [[the Day of Judgement]] his deeds will appear shining.\"\n* Among the [[sunnah]] of the Prophet was that: \"He never got up even from the smallest meeting without reciting Istighfar 25 times\".\n* Another Hadith also mentions that: \"The Holy Prophet recited \u2018Astaghfirullah W\u0101 t\u016bbo ilaih\u2019 seventy times every day.\"<ref>https://myislam.org/astaghfirullah-wa-atubu-ilaih/</ref>\n\n==Significance of Istighfar==\n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) safeguards the Supplicant against the evil consequences of his/her sins.\n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) increases the blessings of Allah (both material and spiritual).\n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) is one of the ways of finding inner peace and tranquillity.\n* Istighfar purifies ones from the physiological results of sins.\n* Istighfar turns evil deeds to good deeds.\n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) paves way for the acceptance of prayer.\n* Allah forgives those who sincerely seek forgiveness unconditionally.\n* The Prophet said: \"Whoever makes Istighfar frequently, Allah will provide a way for him out of every distress and provide for him from sources he could never expect\".\n\n==Conditions for Istighfar==\nIt is important to note the fact that seeking forgiveness (Istighfar) by reciting the phrase \"Astaghfirullah\" day and night without quitting or having the intention to quit the past sins or misdeeds is nothing but a mockery. This act according to Hazrat Ali was not only described as a mockery of our Lord but also a kind of sin itself. Meanwhile, Hazrat Ali presented six conditions for a valid Istighfar, according to him, it was after these conditions have been met that we can now recite the phrase \"Astaghfirullah\".\n\nThese six conditions are thus: \n# To repent over the past sins or misdeeds.\n# To make a firm determination never to repeat it (sins).\n# To observe and discharge people's rights.\n# To fulfil all obligatory acts which have been ignored (in the past) \n# To lose the body flesh grown as a result of unlawful earnings until new flesh grows on the bones of the body. \n# To make the body taste the pain of obedience as you previously made it taste the sweetness of disobedience.\"\n\nSome opinions do not recognise conditions 4 to 6 inclusive but rather concentrate on repentance and it\u2019s various manifestations as the main condition for Istighfar, [https://aboutislam.net/shariah/refine-your-heart/advice/repentance-and-its-conditions/ refer here,]\n\n==Etiquette of Istighfar==\nAmong the etiquette of seeking forgiveness (Istighfar) are: \n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) during the dawn (Sahar). \n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) on Thursday night. \n* Confession to one's mistakes.  \n* Testimony of faith and submission to God. \n* Stop the sin, regret the sin, intend to never do it again.\n\n==Istighfar of prophets==\nThe Istighfar of an ordinary man was not a special case since they are not infallible. But in the case of the prophets and angels, such an act may be interpreted otherwise, because naturally, it contradicts the attributes of infallibility in them (prophets). Though, there is some relevant evidence showing the fact that prophets and the angels were also engaged in asking for divine forgiveness.{{Quran-usc|3|118}},{{Quran-usc|42|5}}\n\n== Related invocations  ==\n{{quote|{{lang|ar|<big>\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0622\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0671\u063a\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0631\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0630\u064f\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0642\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0639\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0631\u0650 </big>}}\n<br/>\n'''Our Lord!

It is considered one of the essential parts of worship in [[Islam]].\n\n==Etymology==\nIstighfar is derived from the Arabic root {{rtl-lang|ar|\u063a-\u0641-\u0631}}, which related the covering of a thing with that which will keep it clean.\n\n==Meaning==\n\"Istighfar\" means to pray to [[Allah]] that He may protect the [[supplicant]] from the [[evil]] consequences and poisonous influences of their transgressions and misdeeds, both in this world and the hereafter. Astaghfirullah literally translates to \"I seek forgiveness in Allah\". In a religious way, people can recite it during [[meditation]] or say it to others to show [[humility]]. That is to say that Allah is the greater or that goodness comes from Allah. In popular culture, people can say this if they see something wrong or shameful.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n== Necessity of Istighfar==\nIslam posits that human beings were created by Allah, with the ability to choose their own actions; either to do good deeds and obey Allah or choose to do evil deeds and disobey (Him).{{Quran-usc|76|3}} However, Allah in His immense mercy and wisdom, knowing the fact that human beings were prone to errors, and in order to prevent man from carrying the burden of His sin(s) forever, opened the door of seeking Istighfar (forgiveness) for His servants who might have (mistakenly) committed [[sin]] or submitted to His desires and ignored the dictates of his conscience. Thus, Istighfar is the weapon of believers against [[shaytan]] who tries to lead them into hell by inviting them to sin.\n\n==In the Qur'an==\nIstighfar, and some other names from the same root such as [[Ghafir]], [[Al-Ghafoor]], [[Ghaffar]], occur in the Qur'an more than seventy times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.islamicity.org/11211/forgiveness-and-repentance-in-islam/|title=Forgiveness and Repentance in Islam - IslamiCity|website=www.islamicity.org|language=en|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Quranic verses regarding Istighfar==\nIn the [[Qur'an]],  there are numerous [[\u0100yah|verses]] on the issue of Istighfar, in which Allah commands the believers to always seek His forgiveness and turn to Him. Some examples of these verses are:\n\n* \"And those who when they commit an [[indecency]] or do injustice to their [[souls]] remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their faults; and who forgives the faults but Allah. And (who) do not knowingly persist in what they have done. (As for) these their reward is [[forgiveness]] from their [[Lord]], and [[gardens]] beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and excellent is the reward of the labourers\".{{Quran-usc|3|135-136}}\n* O you who believe! Turn to Allah (a Tawba of [[Nas\u016bh]]) sincere turning; maybe your Lord will remove from you your evil and cause you to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow\".{{Quran-usc|66|8}}\n* \"And whoever does evil or acts unjustly to his [[soul]], then asks forgiveness of Allah, he shall find Allah Forgiving, [[Merciful]]\".{{Quran-usc|4|110}}\n* \"Will they not then turn to Allah and ask His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful\". \"Will they not then turn to Allah and ask His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful\".{{Quran-usc|5|74}}\n* \"And you that ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him; He will provide you with a goodly provision to an appointed term and bestow His grace on every one endowed with grace, and if you turn back, then surely I fear for you the [[chastisement]] of a great day\".{{Quran-usc|11|3}}\n* \"And return to your Lord time after time and submit to Him before there comes to you the [[punishment]], then you shall not be helped\".{{Quran-usc|39|54}}\n\n==In Sunnah==\n* In [[hadith]], it was reported that: \"The Prophet sought the forgiveness (Istighfar) from Allah, frequently and on daily basis\".\n* \"The Prophet is spoken of in a hadith as saying Istighfar a hundred times a day, despite his [[infallibility]]\".\n* The prophet used to seek forgiveness in the morning and night.\n* The prophet said: \"The more one [[prays]] for [[pardoning]] of his sins the more good deeds will be credited to his account and on [[the Day of Judgement]] his deeds will appear shining.\"\n* Among the [[sunnah]] of the Prophet was that: \"He never got up even from the smallest meeting without reciting Istighfar 25 times\".\n* Another Hadith also mentions that: \"The Holy Prophet recited \u2018Astaghfirullah W\u0101 t\u016bbo ilaih\u2019 seventy times every day.\"<ref>https://myislam.org/astaghfirullah-wa-atubu-ilaih/</ref>\n\n==Significance of Istighfar==\n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) safeguards the Supplicant against the evil consequences of his/her sins.\n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) increases the blessings of Allah (both material and spiritual).\n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) is one of the ways of finding inner peace and tranquillity.\n* Istighfar purifies ones from the physiological results of sins.\n* Istighfar turns evil deeds to good deeds.\n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) paves way for the acceptance of prayer.\n* Allah forgives those who sincerely seek forgiveness unconditionally.\n* The Prophet said: \"Whoever makes Istighfar frequently, Allah will provide a way for him out of every distress and provide for him from sources he could never expect\".\n\n==Conditions for Istighfar==\nIt is important to note the fact that seeking forgiveness (Istighfar) by reciting the phrase \"Astaghfirullah\" day and night without quitting or having the intention to quit the past sins or misdeeds is nothing but a mockery. This act according to Hazrat Ali was not only described as a mockery of our Lord but also a kind of sin itself. Meanwhile, Hazrat Ali presented six conditions for a valid Istighfar, according to him, it was after these conditions have been met that we can now recite the phrase \"Astaghfirullah\".\n\nThese six conditions are thus: \n# To repent over the past sins or misdeeds.\n# To make a firm determination never to repeat it (sins).\n# To observe and discharge people's rights.\n# To fulfil all obligatory acts which have been ignored (in the past) \n# To lose the body flesh grown as a result of unlawful earnings until new flesh grows on the bones of the body. \n# To make the body taste the pain of obedience as you previously made it taste the sweetness of disobedience.\"\n\nSome opinions do not recognise conditions 4 to 6 inclusive but rather concentrate on repentance and it\u2019s various manifestations as the main condition for Istighfar, [https://aboutislam.net/shariah/refine-your-heart/advice/repentance-and-its-conditions/ refer here,]\n\n==Etiquette of Istighfar==\nAmong the etiquette of seeking forgiveness (Istighfar) are: \n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) during the dawn (Sahar). \n* Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) on Thursday night. \n* Confession to one's mistakes.  \n* Testimony of faith and submission to God. \n* Stop the sin, regret the sin, intend to never do it again.\n\n==Istighfar of prophets==\nThe Istighfar of an ordinary man was not a special case since they are not infallible. But in the case of the prophets and angels, such an act may be interpreted otherwise, because naturally, it contradicts the attributes of infallibility in them (prophets). Though, there is some relevant evidence showing the fact that prophets and the angels were also engaged in asking for divine forgiveness.{{Quran-usc|3|118}},{{Quran-usc|42|5}}\n\n== Related invocations  ==\n*{{quote|{{lang|ar|<big>\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0622\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0671\u063a\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0631\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0630\u064f\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0642\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0639\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0631\u0650 </big>}}\n'''Our Lord!
