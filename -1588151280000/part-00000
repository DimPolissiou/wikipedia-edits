It was released on June 29, 2010, by [[Radio Killa Records]], with distribution from [[Def Jam Recordings]].\n\nThe-Dream produced ''Love King'' with fellow songwriters/producers [[Tricky Stewart|Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart]] and [[Carlos McKinney|Los Da Mystro]]. It expands on the [[suite (music)|suite]]-like conceit and themes of the singer's previous albums, exploring traditional R&B themes of love, sex, money, and infidelity, with sensibilities of arrogance and [[wikt:swagger|swagger]]. The music has been noted for its layered sonic elements and detailed production.\n\n''Love King'' debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 58,000 copies in its first week. Two singles were released in support of the album \u2013 [[Love King (song)|the title track]] and \"[[Make Up Bag]]\" \u2013 and achieved moderate chart success. Critically, the album was well received for The-Dream's production and sexually boastful lyrics, and it was included in several publications' year-end lists of 2010's best records.\n\n== Recording ==\nRecording sessions for the album took place at Setal Studio in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]], [[Studio at the Palms]] in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]], The Nash Estate in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], and Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8209056|title=The-Dream \u2013 Love King CD Album|publisher=[[Muze]]|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref> After reports of the album being under production, The-Dream said that the album would be his final studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267952/the-dream-announces-love-king-will-be-last-album|title=The-Dream Announces \"Love King\" Will Be Last Album|last=Concepcion|first=Mariel|date=July 24, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=April 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211111158/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267952/the-dream-announces-love-king-will-be-last-album|archive-date=December 11, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633561/20100309/the_dream_rap.jhtml|title=The-Dream Says New Album May Be His Last|last=Rodriguez|first=Jayson|date=March 9, 2010|work=Billboard|accessdate=April 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402093223/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633561/20100309/the_dream_rap.jhtml|archive-date=April 2, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/03/29/behind-the-video-the-dream-love-king/|title=Behind the Video: The-Dream \u2013 'Love King'|date=March 29, 2010|website=[[Rap-Up]]|accessdate=April 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402095614/http://www.rap-up.com/2010/03/29/behind-the-video-the-dream-love-king/|archive-date=April 2, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> In January 2010, he said that he had finished recording ''Love King'' and called it his best album yet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/01/16/the-dream-calls-new-album-best-yet/|title=The-Dream Calls New Album 'Best' Yet|date=January 16, 2010|website=Rap-Up|accessdate=April 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402093145/http://www.rap-up.com/2010/01/16/the-dream-calls-new-album-best-yet/|archive-date=April 2, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n{{Listen\n | pos          = right\n | filename     = Make Up Bag.ogg\n | title        = 'Make Up Bag'\n | description  = The song features digital bass tones, [[A minor]] piano chords, and a [[double entendre]]; the make up bag as a designer handbag purchased to make amends.<ref name=\"Richards\">Richards, Chris.

The music has been noted for its layered sonic elements and detailed production.\n\n''Love King'' debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 58,000 copies in its first week. Two singles were released in support of the album \u2014 [[Love King (song)|the title track]] and \"[[Make Up Bag]]\" \u2014 and achieved moderate chart success. Critically, the album was well received for The-Dream's production and sexually boastful lyrics, and it was included in several publications' year-end lists of 2010's best records.\n\n== Recording ==\nRecording sessions for the album took place at Setal Studio in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]], [[Studio at the Palms]] in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]], The Nash Estate in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], and Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8209056|title=The-Dream - Love King CD Album|publisher=[[Muze]]|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref> After reports of the album being under production, The-Dream said that the album would be his final studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267952/the-dream-announces-love-king-will-be-last-album|title=The-Dream Announces \"Love King\" Will Be Last Album|last=Concepcion|first=Mariel|date=July 24, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=April 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211111158/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267952/the-dream-announces-love-king-will-be-last-album|archive-date=December 11, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633561/20100309/the_dream_rap.jhtml|title=The-Dream Says New Album May Be His Last|last=Rodriguez|first=Jayson|date=March 9, 2010|work=Billboard|accessdate=April 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402093223/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633561/20100309/the_dream_rap.jhtml|archive-date=April 2, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/03/29/behind-the-video-the-dream-love-king/|title=Behind the Video: The-Dream \u2013 'Love King'|date=March 29, 2010|website=[[Rap-Up]]|accessdate=April 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402095614/http://www.rap-up.com/2010/03/29/behind-the-video-the-dream-love-king/|archive-date=April 2, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> In January 2010, he said that he had finished recording ''Love King'' and called it his best album yet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/01/16/the-dream-calls-new-album-best-yet/|title=The-Dream Calls New Album 'Best' Yet|date=January 16, 2010|website=Rap-Up|accessdate=April 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402093145/http://www.rap-up.com/2010/01/16/the-dream-calls-new-album-best-yet/|archive-date=April 2, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n{{Listen\n | pos          = right\n | filename     = Make Up Bag.ogg\n | title        = 'Make Up Bag'\n | description  = The song features digital bass tones, [[A minor]] piano chords, and a [[double entendre]]; the make up bag as a designer handbag purchased to make amends.<ref name=\"Richards\">Richards, Chris.

An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on ''Encore'', he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount&nbsp;[...] I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30\". The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem's weight increased to {{convert|230|lb|kg}}, and he was regularly eating [[fast food]]: \"The kids behind the counter knew me \u2013 it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad\". Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain, and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \"Eminem ain't fat.\"<ref name=\"RS10\"/>\n\nIn December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a [[methadone]] overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of [[heroin]] and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children,<!-- What other children? So far, we've just read about Hailie. --> Eminem checked himself out of the facility weak and not fully [[Detoxification|detoxed]]. He tore the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a [[seizure]]. His drug use \"ramped right back to where it was before\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program which emphasized running.

Following a [[single-vehicle accident]] in which he was a passenger, Snyder was injured and fell into a [[coma]] as a result. He died six days later of [[septic shock]].\n\nAlthough he played in only forty-nine NHL games, the Thrashers named an annual award after him. The [[Dan Snyder Memorial Award]] is given each year to the player who \"best embodies perseverance, dedication, and hard work without reward or recognition, so that his team and teammates might succeed.\" After the Thrashers relocated to [[Winnipeg]] the [[Winnipeg Jets|Jets]] continued to present the award. The [[American Hockey League]]'s (AHL) [[Chicago Wolves]] also have a yearly award given in his honor, the [[Dan Snyder Man of the Year Award]], and have honored him by hanging a banner with other retired numbers and honored personnel. Likewise the [[Ontario Hockey League]] renamed their Humanitarian of the Year trophy in his honor as the [[Dan Snyder Memorial Trophy]].\n\n==Playing career==\n[[File:Snyder Banner.JPG|thumb|The Chicago Wolves banner honoring Snyder]]\n\n===Junior===\nIn 1994 Snyder was one of the last players selected for his hometown [[Junior hockey#Junior B.2C C.2C D|Junior B]] team, the [[Elmira Sugar Kings]].

{"title_page": "Importance sampling", "text_new": "{{short description|distribution estimation technique}}\nIn [[statistics]], '''importance sampling''' is a general technique for estimating properties of a particular [[probability distribution|distribution]], while only having samples generated from a different distribution than the distribution of interest.  It is related to [[umbrella sampling]] in [[computational physics]]. Depending on the application, the term may refer to the process of sampling from this alternative distribution, the process of inference, or both.\n\n== Basic theory ==\n<!-- '''E'''[''X;P''] / \\mathbf{E}[X;P] represents the expectation of ''X''. -->\n\nLet <math>X:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb{R}</math> be a [[random variable]] in some [[probability space]] <math>(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P)</math>. We wish to estimate the [[expected value]] of ''X'' under ''P'', denoted '''E'''[''X;P'']. If we have statistically independent random samples <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n</math>, generated according to ''P'', then an empirical estimate of '''E'''[''X;P''] is\n\n: <math>\n  \\widehat{\\mathbf{E}}_{n}[X;P] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n</math>\n\nand the precision of this estimate depends on the variance of ''X'':\n\n: <math>\n   \\operatorname{var}[\\widehat{\\mathbf{E}}_{n};P] = \\frac{\\operatorname{var}[X;P]} n.\n</math>\n\nThe basic idea of importance sampling is to sample the states from a different distribution to lower the variance of the estimation of '''E'''[''X;P''], or when sampling from P is difficult.\nThis is accomplished by first choosing a random variable <math>L\\geq 0</math> such that '''E'''[''L'';''P'']&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and that ''P''-[[almost everywhere]] <math>L(\\omega)\\neq 0</math>.\nWith the variate ''L'' we define a probability <math>P^{(L)}</math> that satisfies\n: <math>\n  \\mathbf{E}[X;P] = \\mathbf{E}\\left[\\frac{X}{L};P^{(L)}\\right].\n</math>\n\nThe variable ''X''/''L'' will thus be sampled under ''P''<sup>(''L'')</sup> to estimate '''E'''[''X;P''] as above and this estimation is improved when\n<math>\\operatorname{var}\\left[\\frac{X}{L};P^{(L)}\\right] < \\operatorname{var}[X;P]</math>.\n\nWhen ''X'' is of constant sign over \u03a9, the best variable ''L'' would clearly be <math>L^*=\\frac{X}{\\mathbf{E}[X;P]}\\geq 0</math>, so that ''X''/''L''* is the searched constant '''E'''[''X;P''] and a single sample under ''P''<sup>(''L''*)</sup> suffices to give its value. Unfortunately we cannot take that choice, because '''E'''[''X;P''] is precisely the value we are looking for! However this theoretical best case ''L*'' gives us an insight into what importance sampling does:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\\forall a\\in\\mathbb{R}, \\; P^{(L^*)}(X\\in[a;a+da]) &= \\int_{\\omega\\in\\{X\\in[a;a+da]\\}} \\frac{X(\\omega)}{E[X;P]} \\, dP(\\omega) \\\\[6pt] &= \\frac{1}{E[X;P]}\\; a\\,P(X\\in[a;a+da]) \n\\end{align}</math>\nto the right, <math>a\\,P(X\\in[a;a+da])</math> is one of the infinitesimal elements that sum up to '''E'''[''X'';''P'']:\n\n: <math>E[X;P] = \\int_{a=-\\infty}^{+\\infty} a\\,P(X\\in[a;a+da]) </math>\ntherefore, a good probability change ''P''<sup>(''L'')</sup> in importance sampling will redistribute the law of ''X'' so that its samples' frequencies are sorted directly according to their weights in '''E'''[''X'';''P'']. Hence the name \"importance sampling.\"\n\nImportance sampling is often used as a [[Monte Carlo integration|Monte Carlo integrator]].\nWhen <math>P</math> is the uniform distribution and <math>\\Omega =\\mathbb{R}</math>, '''E'''[''X;P''] corresponds to the integral of the real function <math>X:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\n== Application to probabilistic inference ==\n\nSuch methods are frequently used to estimate posterior densities or expectations in state and/or parameter estimation problems in probabilistic models that are too hard to treat analytically, for example in [[Bayesian network]]s.\n\n== Application to simulation ==\n'''Importance sampling''' is a [[variance reduction]] technique that can be used in the [[Monte Carlo method]]. The idea behind importance sampling is that certain values of the input [[random variables]] in a [[simulation]] have more impact on the parameter being estimated than others. If these \"important\" values are emphasized by sampling more frequently, then the [[estimator]] variance can be reduced. Hence, the basic methodology in importance sampling is to choose a distribution which \"encourages\" the important values. This use of \"biased\" distributions will result in a biased estimator if it is applied directly in the simulation. However, the simulation outputs are weighted to correct for the use of the biased distribution, and this ensures that the new importance sampling estimator is unbiased. The weight is given by the [[Likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio]], that is, the [[Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative]] of the true underlying distribution with respect to the biased simulation distribution.\n\nThe fundamental issue in implementing importance sampling simulation is the choice of the biased distribution which encourages the important regions of the input variables. Choosing or designing a good biased distribution is the \"art\" of importance sampling. The rewards for a good distribution can be huge run-time savings; the penalty for a bad distribution can be longer run times than for a general Monte Carlo simulation without importance sampling.\n\nConsider <math>X</math> to be the sample and <math>\\frac{f(X)}{g(X)}</math> to be the likelihood ratio, where <math>f</math> is the probability density (mass) function of the desired distribution and <math>g</math> is the probability density (mass) function of the biased/proposal/sample distribution. Then the problem can be characterized by choosing the sample distribution <math>g</math> that minimizes the variance of the scaled sample:\n\n:<math>g^* = \\min_g \\operatorname{var}_g \\left( X \\frac{f(X)}{g(X)} \\right).</math>\n\nIt can be shown that the following distribution minimizes the above variance:<ref>Rubinstein, R. Y., & [[Dirk Kroese|Kroese, D. P.]] (2011). Simulation and the Monte Carlo method (Vol. 707). John Wiley & Sons.</ref>\n\n:<math> \ng^*(X) = \\frac{|X| f(X)}{ \\int |x| f(x) \\, dx}.\n</math>\n\nIt is easy to see that when <math>X\\ge 0</math>, this variance becomes 0.\n\n=== Mathematical approach ===\n\nConsider estimating by simulation the probability <math>p_t\\,</math> of an event <math>X \\ge t</math>, where <math>X</math> is a random variable with [[probability distribution|distribution]] <math>F</math> and [[probability density function]] <math>f(x)= F'(x)\\,</math>, where prime denotes [[derivative]]. A <math>K</math>-length [[independent and identically distributed]] (i.i.d.) sequence <math>X_i\\,</math> is generated from the distribution <math>F</math>, and the number <math>k_t</math> of random variables that lie above the threshold <math>t</math> are counted. The random variable <math>k_t</math> is characterized by the [[Binomial distribution]]\n\n:<math>P(k_t = k)={K\\choose k}p_t^k(1-p_t)^{K-k},\\,\\quad \\quad k=0,1,\\dots,K.</math>\n\nOne can show that <math>\\operatorname{E} [k_t/K] = p_t</math>, and <math>\\operatorname{var} [k_t/K] = p_t(1-p_t)/K</math>, so in the limit <math>K \\to \\infty</math> we are able to obtain <math>p_t</math>.  Note that the variance is low if <math>p_t \\approx 1</math>.  Importance sampling is concerned with the determination and use of an alternate density function <math>f_*\\,</math>(for <math>X</math>), usually referred to as a biasing density, for the simulation experiment. This density allows the event <math>{ X \\ge t\\ }</math> to occur more frequently, so the sequence lengths <math>K</math> gets smaller for a given [[estimator]] variance. Alternatively, for a given <math>K</math>, use of the biasing density results in a variance smaller than that of the conventional Monte Carlo estimate. From the definition of <math>p_t\\,</math>, we can introduce <math>f_*\\,</math> as below.\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\np_t & = {E} [1(X \\ge t)] \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\int 1(x \\ge t) \\frac{f(x)}{f_*(x)} f_*(x) \\,dx \\\\[6pt]\n& = E_* [1(X \\ge t) W(X)]\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>W(\\cdot) \\equiv \\frac{f(\\cdot)}{f_*(\\cdot)} </math>\n\nis a likelihood ratio and is referred to as the weighting function. The last equality in the above equation motivates the estimator\n\n:<math> \\hat p_t = \\frac{1}{K}\\,\\sum_{i=1}^K 1(X_i \\ge t) W(X_i),\\,\\quad \\quad X_i \\sim  f_*</math>\n\nThis is the importance sampling estimator of <math>p_t\\,</math> and is unbiased. That is, the estimation procedure is to generate i.i.d. samples from <math>f_*\\,</math> and for each sample which exceeds <math>t\\,</math>, the estimate is incremented by the weight <math>W\\,</math> evaluated at the sample value. The results are averaged over <math>K\\,</math> trials. The variance of the importance sampling estimator is easily shown to be\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{var}_*\\widehat p_t & = \\frac{1}{K}\\operatorname{var}_* [1(X \\ge t)W(X)] \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac{1}{K}\\left\\{{E_*}[1(X \\ge t)^2 W^2(X)] - p_t^2\\right\\} \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac{1}{K}\\left\\{{E}[1(X \\ge t) W(X)] - p_t^2\\right\\}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNow, the importance sampling problem then focuses on finding a biasing density <math>f_*\\,</math> such that the variance of the importance sampling estimator is less than the variance of the general Monte Carlo estimate. For some biasing density function, which minimizes the variance, and under certain conditions reduces it to zero, it is called an optimal biasing density function.\n\n=== Conventional biasing methods ===\n\nAlthough there are many kinds of biasing methods, the following two methods are most widely used in the applications of importance sampling.\n\n==== Scaling ====\n\nShifting probability mass into the event region <math>{ X \\ge t\\ }</math> by positive scaling of the random variable <math>X\\,</math> with a number greater than unity has the effect of increasing the variance (mean also) of the density function. This results in a heavier tail of the density, leading to an increase in the event probability. Scaling is probably one of the earliest biasing methods known and has been extensively used in practice. It is simple to implement and usually provides conservative simulation gains as compared to other methods.\n\nIn importance sampling by scaling, the simulation density is chosen as the density function of the scaled random variable <math>aX\\,</math>, where usually <math>a>1</math> for tail probability estimation. By transformation,\n\n:<math> f_*(x)=\\frac{1}{a} f \\bigg( \\frac{x}{a} \\bigg)\\,</math>\n\nand the weighting function is\n\n:<math> W(x)= a \\frac{f(x)}{f(x/a)} \\,</math>\n\nWhile scaling shifts probability mass into the desired event region, it also pushes mass into the complementary region <math>X<t\\,</math> which is undesirable. If <math>X\\,</math> is a sum of <math>n\\,</math> random variables, the spreading of mass takes place in an <math>n\\,</math> dimensional space. The consequence of this is a decreasing importance sampling gain for increasing <math>n\\,</math>, and is called the dimensionality effect.\nA modern version of importance sampling by scaling is e.g. so-called sigma-scaled sampling (SSS) which is running multiple MC analysis with different scaling factors. In opposite to many other high yield estimation methods (like worst-case distances WCD) SSS does not suffer much from the dimensionality problem. Also addressing multiple MC outputs causes no degradation in efficiency. On the other hand, as WCD, SSS is only designed for Gaussian statistical variables, and in opposite to WCD, the SSS method is not designed to provide accurate statistical corners. Another SSS disadvantage is that the MC runs with large scale factors may become difficult, e. g. due to model and simulator convergence problems. In addition, in SSS we face a strong bias-variance trade-off: Using large scale factors, we obtain quite stable yield results, but the larger the scale factors, the larger the bias error. If the advantages of SSS does not matter much in the application of interest, then often other methods are more efficient.\n\n==== Translation ====\n\nAnother simple and effective biasing technique employs translation of the density function (and hence random variable) to place much of its probability mass in the rare event region. Translation does not suffer from a dimensionality effect and has been successfully used in several applications relating to simulation of [[digital communication]] systems. It often provides better simulation gains than scaling. In biasing by translation, the simulation density is given by\n\n:<math> f_*(x)= f(x-c), \\quad c>0 \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>c\\,</math> is the amount of shift and is to be chosen to minimize the variance of the importance sampling estimator.\n\n=== Effects of system complexity  ===\n\nThe fundamental problem with importance sampling is that designing good biased distributions becomes more complicated as the system complexity increases. Complex systems are the systems with long memory since complex processing of a few inputs is much easier to handle. This dimensionality or memory can cause problems in three ways:\n\n* long memory (severe [[intersymbol interference]] (ISI))\n* unknown memory ([[Viterbi decoder]]s)\n* possibly infinite memory (adaptive equalizers)\n\nIn principle, the importance sampling ideas remain the same in these situations, but the design becomes much harder. A successful approach to combat this problem is essentially breaking down a simulation into several smaller, more sharply defined subproblems. Then importance sampling strategies are used to target each of the simpler subproblems. Examples of techniques to break the simulation down are conditioning and error-event simulation (EES) and regenerative simulation.\n\n=== Evaluation of importance sampling ===\n\nIn order to identify successful importance sampling techniques, it is useful to be able to quantify the run-time savings due to the use of the importance sampling approach. The performance measure commonly used is <math>\\sigma^2_{MC} / \\sigma^2_{IS} \\,</math>, and this can be interpreted as the speed-up factor by which the importance sampling estimator achieves the same precision as the MC estimator. This has to be computed empirically since the estimator variances are not likely to be analytically possible when their mean is intractable. Other useful concepts in quantifying an importance sampling estimator are the variance bounds and the notion of asymptotic efficiency. One related measure is the so-called '''Effective Sample Size''' '''(ESS)'''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martino|first=Luca|last2=Elvira|first2=V\u00edctor|last3=Louzada|first3=Francisco|title=Effective sample size for importance sampling based on discrepancy measures|journal=Signal Processing|volume=131|pages=386\u2013401|doi=10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.08.025|arxiv=1602.03572|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Variance cost function ===\n\nVariance is not the only possible [[Loss function|cost function]] for a simulation, and other cost functions, such as the mean absolute deviation, are used in various statistical applications. Nevertheless, the variance is the primary cost function addressed in the literature, probably due to the use of variances in [[confidence interval]]s and in the performance measure <math>\\sigma^2_{MC} / \\sigma^2_{IS} \\,</math>.\n\nAn associated issue is the fact that the ratio <math>\\sigma^2_{MC} / \\sigma^2_{IS} \\,</math> overestimates the run-time savings due to importance sampling since it does not include the extra computing time required to compute the weight function. Hence, some people evaluate the net run-time improvement by various means. Perhaps a more serious overhead to importance sampling is the time taken to devise and program the technique and analytically derive the desired weight function.\n\n===Multiple and adaptive importance sampling ===\nWhen different proposal distributions, <math>g_n(x)</math> , <math>n=1,\\ldots,N,</math> are jointly used for drawing the samples <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_N, </math> different proper weighting functions can be employed (e.g., see <ref>{{Cite book|title = Optimally Combining Sampling Techniques for Monte Carlo Rendering|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 22Nd Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques|date = 1995-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-0-89791-701-8|pages = [https://archive.org/details/computergraphics00sigg/page/419 419\u2013428]|series = SIGGRAPH '95|doi = 10.1145/218380.218498|first = Eric|last = Veach|first2 = Leonidas J.|last2 = Guibas|citeseerx = 10.1.1.127.8105|url = https://archive.org/details/computergraphics00sigg/page/419}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Safe and Effective Importance Sampling|journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association|date = 2000-03-01|issn = 0162-1459|pages = 135\u2013143|volume = 95|issue = 449|doi = 10.1080/01621459.2000.10473909|first = Art|last = Owen|first2 = Yi Zhou|last2 = Associate|citeseerx = 10.1.1.36.4536}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Efficient Multiple Importance Sampling Estimators|journal = IEEE Signal Processing Letters|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 1070-9908|pages = 1757\u20131761|volume = 22|issue = 10|doi = 10.1109/LSP.2015.2432078|first = V.|last = Elvira|first2 = L.|last2 = Martino|first3 = D.|last3 = Luengo|first4 = M.F.|last4 = Bugallo|arxiv = 1505.05391|bibcode = 2015ISPL...22.1757E}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elvira|first=V\u00edctor|last2=Martino|first2=Luca|last3=Luengo|first3=David|last4=Bugallo|first4=M\u00f3nica F.|title=Improving population Monte Carlo: Alternative weighting and resampling schemes|journal=Signal Processing|volume=131|pages=77\u201391|doi=10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.07.012|arxiv=1607.02758|year=2017}}</ref>).

Depending on the application, the term may refer to the process of sampling from this alternative distribution, the process of inference, or both.\n\n== Basic theory ==\n<!-- '''E'''[''X;P''] / \\mathbf{E}[X;P] represents the expectation of ''X''. -->\n\nLet <math>X:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb{R}</math> be a [[random variable]] in some [[probability space]] <math>(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P)</math>. We wish to estimate the [[expected value]] of ''X'' under ''P'', denoted '''E'''[''X;P'']. If we have statistically independent random samples <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n</math>, generated according to ''P'', then an empirical estimate of '''E'''[''X;P''] is\n\n: <math>\n  \\widehat{\\mathbf{E}}_{n}[X;P] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n</math>\n\nand the precision of this estimate depends on the variance of ''X'':\n\n: <math>\n   \\operatorname{var}[\\widehat{\\mathbf{E}}_{n};P] = \\frac{\\operatorname{var}[X;P]} n.\n</math>\n\nThe basic idea of importance sampling is to sample the states from a different distribution to lower the variance of the estimation of '''E'''[''X;P''], or when sampling from P is difficult.\nThis is accomplished by first choosing a random variable <math>L\\geq 0</math> such that '''E'''[''L'';''P'']&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and that ''P''-[[almost everywhere]] <math>L(\\omega)\\neq 0</math>.\nWith the variate ''L'' we define a probability <math>P^{(L)}</math> that satisfies\n: <math>\n  \\mathbf{E}[X;P] = \\mathbf{E}\\left[\\frac{X}{L};P^{(L)}\\right].\n</math>\n\nThe variable ''X''/''L'' will thus be sampled under ''P''<sup>(''L'')</sup> to estimate '''E'''[''X;P''] as above and this estimation is improved when\n<math>\\operatorname{var}\\left[\\frac{X}{L};P^{(L)}\\right] < \\operatorname{var}[X;P]</math>.\n\nWhen ''X'' is of constant sign over \u03a9, the best variable ''L'' would clearly be <math>L^*=\\frac{X}{\\mathbf{E}[X;P]}\\geq 0</math>, so that ''X''/''L''* is the searched constant '''E'''[''X;P''] and a single sample under ''P''<sup>(''L''*)</sup> suffices to give its value. Unfortunately we cannot take that choice, because '''E'''[''X;P''] is precisely the value we are looking for! However this theoretical best case ''L*'' gives us an insight into what importance sampling does:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\\forall a\\in\\mathbb{R}, \\; P^{(L^*)}(X\\in[a;a+da]) &= \\int_{\\omega\\in\\{X\\in[a;a+da]\\}} \\frac{X(\\omega)}{E[X;P]} \\, dP(\\omega) \\\\[6pt] &= \\frac{1}{E[X;P]}\\; a\\,P(X\\in[a;a+da]) \n\\end{align}</math>\nto the right, <math>a\\,P(X\\in[a;a+da])</math> is one of the infinitesimal elements that sum up to '''E'''[''X'';''P'']:\n\n: <math>E[X;P] = \\int_{a=-\\infty}^{+\\infty} a\\,P(X\\in[a;a+da]) </math>\ntherefore, '''a good probability change ''P''<sup>(''L'')</sup> in importance sampling will redistribute the law of ''X'' so that its samples' frequencies are sorted directly according to their weights in''' '''E'''[''X'';''P'']. Hence the name \"importance sampling.\"\n\nImportance sampling is often used as a [[Monte Carlo integration|Monte Carlo integrator]].\nWhen <math>P</math> is the uniform distribution and <math>\\Omega =\\mathbb{R}</math>, '''E'''[''X;P''] corresponds to the integral of the real function <math>X:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\n== Application to probabilistic inference ==\n\nSuch methods are frequently used to estimate posterior densities or expectations in state and/or parameter estimation problems in probabilistic models that are too hard to treat analytically, for example in [[Bayesian network]]s.\n\n== Application to simulation ==\n'''Importance sampling''' is a [[variance reduction]] technique that can be used in the [[Monte Carlo method]]. The idea behind importance sampling is that certain values of the input [[random variables]] in a [[simulation]] have more impact on the parameter being estimated than others. If these \"important\" values are emphasized by sampling more frequently, then the [[estimator]] variance can be reduced. Hence, the basic methodology in importance sampling is to choose a distribution which \"encourages\" the important values. This use of \"biased\" distributions will result in a biased estimator if it is applied directly in the simulation. However, the simulation outputs are weighted to correct for the use of the biased distribution, and this ensures that the new importance sampling estimator is unbiased. The weight is given by the [[Likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio]], that is, the [[Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative]] of the true underlying distribution with respect to the biased simulation distribution.\n\nThe fundamental issue in implementing importance sampling simulation is the choice of the biased distribution which encourages the important regions of the input variables. Choosing or designing a good biased distribution is the \"art\" of importance sampling. The rewards for a good distribution can be huge run-time savings; the penalty for a bad distribution can be longer run times than for a general Monte Carlo simulation without importance sampling.\n\nConsider <math>X</math> to be the sample and <math>\\frac{f(X)}{g(X)}</math> to be the likelihood ratio, where <math>f</math> is the probability density (mass) function of the desired distribution and <math>g</math> is the probability density (mass) function of the biased/proposal/sample distribution. Then the problem can be characterized by choosing the sample distribution <math>g</math> that minimizes the variance of the scaled sample:\n\n:<math>g^* = \\min_g \\operatorname{var}_g \\left( X \\frac{f(X)}{g(X)} \\right).</math>\n\nIt can be shown that the following distribution minimizes the above variance:<ref>Rubinstein, R. Y., & [[Dirk Kroese|Kroese, D. P.]] (2011). Simulation and the Monte Carlo method (Vol. 707). John Wiley & Sons.</ref>\n\n:<math> \ng^*(X) = \\frac{|X| f(X)}{ \\int |x| f(x) \\, dx}.\n</math>\n\nIt is easy to see that when <math>X\\ge 0</math>, this variance becomes 0.\n\n=== Mathematical approach ===\n\nConsider estimating by simulation the probability <math>p_t\\,</math> of an event <math>X \\ge t</math>, where <math>X</math> is a random variable with [[probability distribution|distribution]] <math>F</math> and [[probability density function]] <math>f(x)= F'(x)\\,</math>, where prime denotes [[derivative]]. A <math>K</math>-length [[independent and identically distributed]] (i.i.d.) sequence <math>X_i\\,</math> is generated from the distribution <math>F</math>, and the number <math>k_t</math> of random variables that lie above the threshold <math>t</math> are counted. The random variable <math>k_t</math> is characterized by the [[Binomial distribution]]\n\n:<math>P(k_t = k)={K\\choose k}p_t^k(1-p_t)^{K-k},\\,\\quad \\quad k=0,1,\\dots,K.</math>\n\nOne can show that <math>\\operatorname{E} [k_t/K] = p_t</math>, and <math>\\operatorname{var} [k_t/K] = p_t(1-p_t)/K</math>, so in the limit <math>K \\to \\infty</math> we are able to obtain <math>p_t</math>.  Note that the variance is low if <math>p_t \\approx 1</math>.  Importance sampling is concerned with the determination and use of an alternate density function <math>f_*\\,</math>(for <math>X</math>), usually referred to as a biasing density, for the simulation experiment. This density allows the event <math>{ X \\ge t\\ }</math> to occur more frequently, so the sequence lengths <math>K</math> gets smaller for a given [[estimator]] variance. Alternatively, for a given <math>K</math>, use of the biasing density results in a variance smaller than that of the conventional Monte Carlo estimate. From the definition of <math>p_t\\,</math>, we can introduce <math>f_*\\,</math> as below.\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\np_t & = {E} [1(X \\ge t)] \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\int 1(x \\ge t) \\frac{f(x)}{f_*(x)} f_*(x) \\,dx \\\\[6pt]\n& = E_* [1(X \\ge t) W(X)]\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>W(\\cdot) \\equiv \\frac{f(\\cdot)}{f_*(\\cdot)} </math>\n\nis a likelihood ratio and is referred to as the weighting function. The last equality in the above equation motivates the estimator\n\n:<math> \\hat p_t = \\frac{1}{K}\\,\\sum_{i=1}^K 1(X_i \\ge t) W(X_i),\\,\\quad \\quad X_i \\sim  f_*</math>\n\nThis is the importance sampling estimator of <math>p_t\\,</math> and is unbiased. That is, the estimation procedure is to generate i.i.d. samples from <math>f_*\\,</math> and for each sample which exceeds <math>t\\,</math>, the estimate is incremented by the weight <math>W\\,</math> evaluated at the sample value. The results are averaged over <math>K\\,</math> trials. The variance of the importance sampling estimator is easily shown to be\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{var}_*\\widehat p_t & = \\frac{1}{K}\\operatorname{var}_* [1(X \\ge t)W(X)] \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac{1}{K}\\left\\{{E_*}[1(X \\ge t)^2 W^2(X)] - p_t^2\\right\\} \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac{1}{K}\\left\\{{E}[1(X \\ge t) W(X)] - p_t^2\\right\\}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNow, the importance sampling problem then focuses on finding a biasing density <math>f_*\\,</math> such that the variance of the importance sampling estimator is less than the variance of the general Monte Carlo estimate. For some biasing density function, which minimizes the variance, and under certain conditions reduces it to zero, it is called an optimal biasing density function.\n\n=== Conventional biasing methods ===\n\nAlthough there are many kinds of biasing methods, the following two methods are most widely used in the applications of importance sampling.\n\n==== Scaling ====\n\nShifting probability mass into the event region <math>{ X \\ge t\\ }</math> by positive scaling of the random variable <math>X\\,</math> with a number greater than unity has the effect of increasing the variance (mean also) of the density function. This results in a heavier tail of the density, leading to an increase in the event probability. Scaling is probably one of the earliest biasing methods known and has been extensively used in practice. It is simple to implement and usually provides conservative simulation gains as compared to other methods.\n\nIn importance sampling by scaling, the simulation density is chosen as the density function of the scaled random variable <math>aX\\,</math>, where usually <math>a>1</math> for tail probability estimation. By transformation,\n\n:<math> f_*(x)=\\frac{1}{a} f \\bigg( \\frac{x}{a} \\bigg)\\,</math>\n\nand the weighting function is\n\n:<math> W(x)= a \\frac{f(x)}{f(x/a)} \\,</math>\n\nWhile scaling shifts probability mass into the desired event region, it also pushes mass into the complementary region <math>X<t\\,</math> which is undesirable. If <math>X\\,</math> is a sum of <math>n\\,</math> random variables, the spreading of mass takes place in an <math>n\\,</math> dimensional space. The consequence of this is a decreasing importance sampling gain for increasing <math>n\\,</math>, and is called the dimensionality effect.\nA modern version of importance sampling by scaling is e.g. so-called sigma-scaled sampling (SSS) which is running multiple MC analysis with different scaling factors. In opposite to many other high yield estimation methods (like worst-case distances WCD) SSS does not suffer much from the dimensionality problem. Also addressing multiple MC outputs causes no degradation in efficiency. On the other hand, as WCD, SSS is only designed for Gaussian statistical variables, and in opposite to WCD, the SSS method is not designed to provide accurate statistical corners. Another SSS disadvantage is that the MC runs with large scale factors may become difficult, e. g. due to model and simulator convergence problems. In addition, in SSS we face a strong bias-variance trade-off: Using large scale factors, we obtain quite stable yield results, but the larger the scale factors, the larger the bias error. If the advantages of SSS does not matter much in the application of interest, then often other methods are more efficient.\n\n==== Translation ====\n\nAnother simple and effective biasing technique employs translation of the density function (and hence random variable) to place much of its probability mass in the rare event region. Translation does not suffer from a dimensionality effect and has been successfully used in several applications relating to simulation of [[digital communication]] systems. It often provides better simulation gains than scaling. In biasing by translation, the simulation density is given by\n\n:<math> f_*(x)= f(x-c), \\quad c>0 \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>c\\,</math> is the amount of shift and is to be chosen to minimize the variance of the importance sampling estimator.\n\n=== Effects of system complexity  ===\n\nThe fundamental problem with importance sampling is that designing good biased distributions becomes more complicated as the system complexity increases. Complex systems are the systems with long memory since complex processing of a few inputs is much easier to handle. This dimensionality or memory can cause problems in three ways:\n\n* long memory (severe [[intersymbol interference]] (ISI))\n* unknown memory ([[Viterbi decoder]]s)\n* possibly infinite memory (adaptive equalizers)\n\nIn principle, the importance sampling ideas remain the same in these situations, but the design becomes much harder. A successful approach to combat this problem is essentially breaking down a simulation into several smaller, more sharply defined subproblems. Then importance sampling strategies are used to target each of the simpler subproblems. Examples of techniques to break the simulation down are conditioning and error-event simulation (EES) and regenerative simulation.\n\n=== Evaluation of importance sampling ===\n\nIn order to identify successful importance sampling techniques, it is useful to be able to quantify the run-time savings due to the use of the importance sampling approach. The performance measure commonly used is <math>\\sigma^2_{MC} / \\sigma^2_{IS} \\,</math>, and this can be interpreted as the speed-up factor by which the importance sampling estimator achieves the same precision as the MC estimator. This has to be computed empirically since the estimator variances are not likely to be analytically possible when their mean is intractable. Other useful concepts in quantifying an importance sampling estimator are the variance bounds and the notion of asymptotic efficiency. One related measure is the so-called '''Effective Sample Size''' '''(ESS)'''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martino|first=Luca|last2=Elvira|first2=V\u00edctor|last3=Louzada|first3=Francisco|title=Effective sample size for importance sampling based on discrepancy measures|journal=Signal Processing|volume=131|pages=386\u2013401|doi=10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.08.025|arxiv=1602.03572|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Variance cost function ===\n\nVariance is not the only possible [[Loss function|cost function]] for a simulation, and other cost functions, such as the mean absolute deviation, are used in various statistical applications. Nevertheless, the variance is the primary cost function addressed in the literature, probably due to the use of variances in [[confidence interval]]s and in the performance measure <math>\\sigma^2_{MC} / \\sigma^2_{IS} \\,</math>.\n\nAn associated issue is the fact that the ratio <math>\\sigma^2_{MC} / \\sigma^2_{IS} \\,</math> overestimates the run-time savings due to importance sampling since it does not include the extra computing time required to compute the weight function. Hence, some people evaluate the net run-time improvement by various means. Perhaps a more serious overhead to importance sampling is the time taken to devise and program the technique and analytically derive the desired weight function.\n\n===Multiple and adaptive importance sampling ===\nWhen different proposal distributions, <math>g_n(x)</math> , <math>n=1,\\ldots,N,</math> are jointly used for drawing the samples <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_N, </math> different proper weighting functions can be employed (e.g., see <ref>{{Cite book|title = Optimally Combining Sampling Techniques for Monte Carlo Rendering|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 22Nd Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques|date = 1995-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-0-89791-701-8|pages = [https://archive.org/details/computergraphics00sigg/page/419 419\u2013428]|series = SIGGRAPH '95|doi = 10.1145/218380.218498|first = Eric|last = Veach|first2 = Leonidas J.|last2 = Guibas|citeseerx = 10.1.1.127.8105|url = https://archive.org/details/computergraphics00sigg/page/419}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Safe and Effective Importance Sampling|journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association|date = 2000-03-01|issn = 0162-1459|pages = 135\u2013143|volume = 95|issue = 449|doi = 10.1080/01621459.2000.10473909|first = Art|last = Owen|first2 = Yi Zhou|last2 = Associate|citeseerx = 10.1.1.36.4536}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Efficient Multiple Importance Sampling Estimators|journal = IEEE Signal Processing Letters|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 1070-9908|pages = 1757\u20131761|volume = 22|issue = 10|doi = 10.1109/LSP.2015.2432078|first = V.|last = Elvira|first2 = L.|last2 = Martino|first3 = D.|last3 = Luengo|first4 = M.F.|last4 = Bugallo|arxiv = 1505.05391|bibcode = 2015ISPL...22.1757E}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elvira|first=V\u00edctor|last2=Martino|first2=Luca|last3=Luengo|first3=David|last4=Bugallo|first4=M\u00f3nica F.|title=Improving population Monte Carlo: Alternative weighting and resampling schemes|journal=Signal Processing|volume=131|pages=77\u201391|doi=10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.07.012|arxiv=1607.02758|year=2017}}</ref>).

Religiously diverse, with an estimated population of 3.5 million in 1831 (making it the [[List of countries by population in 1800|19th most populous country at the time]]),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Amarinder Singh]]'s The Last Sunset: The Rise and Fall of the Lahore Durbar</ref> it was the last major region of the Indian subcontinent to be annexed by the British.\n\nThe foundations of the Sikh Empire can be traced to as early as 1707, the year of [[Aurangzeb]]'s death and the start of the downfall of the [[Mughal Empire]]. With the Mughals significantly weakened, the Sikh army, known as the [[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]], a rearrangement of the Khalsa inaugurated by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], led expeditions against them and the [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]] in the west. This led to a growth of the army which split into different confederacies or semi-independent ''[[misl]]s''. Each of these component armies controlled different areas and cities. However, in the period from 1762 to 1799, Sikh commanders of the misls appeared to be coming into their own as independent warlords.\n\nThe formation of the empire began with the capture of Lahore, by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, from its Afghan ruler, [[Zaman Shah Durrani]], and the subsequent and progressive expulsion of Afghans from the Punjab, by defeating them in the [[Afghan-Sikh Wars]], and the unification of the separate Sikh misls. Ranjit Singh was proclaimed as Maharaja of the Punjab on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with Vaisakhi), creating a unified political state. Sahib Singh Bedi, a descendant of [[Guru Nanak]], conducted the coronation.<ref>[http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/ The Encyclopaedia of Sikhism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508213214/http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/ |date=8 May 2014 }}, section ''S\u0101hib Si\u1e45gh Bed\u012b, B\u0101b\u0101 (1756\u20131834)''.</ref> Ranjit Singh rose to power in a very short period, from a leader of a single misl to finally becoming the Maharaja of Punjab. He began to modernise his army, using the latest training as well as weapons and [[artillery]]. After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire was weakened by internal divisions and political mismanagement. Finally, by 1849 the state was dissolved after the defeat in the [[Anglo-Sikh wars]]. The Sikh Empire was divided into four provinces: [[Lahore]], in Punjab, which became the Sikh capital, [[Multan]], also in Punjab, [[Peshawar]] and [[Kashmir]] from 1799 to 1849.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Mughal rule of Punjab===\n\nThe [[Sikhism|Sikh religion]] began around the time of the conquest of Northern India by [[Babur]], the founder of the [[Mughal Empire]]. His conquering grandson, [[Akbar the Great]], supported religious freedom and after visiting the [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]] of [[Guru Amar Das]] got a favourable impression of Sikhism. As a result of his visit he donated land to the langar and the Mughals did not have any conflict with [[Sikh gurus]] until his death in 1605.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalsi|2005|pages=106\u2013107}}</ref> His successor [[Jahangir]], however, saw the Sikhs as a political threat. He ordered [[Guru Arjun Dev]], who had been arrested for supporting the rebellious [[Khusrau Mirza]],<ref>{{harvnb|Markovits|2004|page=98}}</ref> to change the passage about Islam in the [[Adi Granth]].

The Sikh community did not have any further issues with the Mughal empire until the death of Jahangir in 1627. The succeeding son of Jahangir, [[Shah Jahan]], took offence at Guru Hargobind's \"sovereignty\" and after a series of assaults on Amritsar forced the Sikhs to retreat to the [[Sivalik Hills]].<ref name=\"Jestice 2004 pages=345-346\"/>\n\nThe next guru, [[Guru Har Rai]], maintained the guruship in these hills by defeating local attempts to seize Sikh land and playing a neutral role in the power struggle between two of the sons of Shah Jahan, [[Aurangzeb]] and [[Dara Shikoh]], for control of the Mughal Empire. The ninth Guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]], moved the Sikh community to [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]] and travelled extensively to visit and preach in defiance of Aurangzeb, who attempted to install [[Ramraiya|Ram Rai]] as new guru. Guru Tegh Bahadur aided [[Kashmiri Pandits]] in avoiding conversion to [[Islam]] and was arrested by Aurangzeb. When offered a choice between conversion to Islam and death, he chose to die rather than compromise his principles and was executed.<ref>{{harvnb|Johar|1975|pages=192\u2013210}}</ref>\n\n===Formation of the Khalsa===\n[[Guru Gobind Singh]] assumed the guruship in 1675 and to avoid battles with Sivalik Hill rajas moved the guruship to [[Paonta Sahib|Paunta]]. There he built a large fort to protect the city and garrisoned an army to protect it. The growing power of the Sikh community alarmed the Sivalik Hill rajas who attempted to attack the city but [[Guru Gobind Singh]]'s forces routed them at the [[Battle of Bhangani]]. He moved on to Anandpur and established the [[Khalsa]], a collective army of baptised Sikhs, on 30 March 1699.<ref name=Gobind/> The establishment of the Khalsa united the Sikh community against various Mughal-backed claimants to the guruship.<ref>{{harvnb|Jestice|2004|pages=312\u2013313}}</ref> In 1701, a combined army of the Sivalik Hill rajas and the Mughals under [[Wazir Khan (Sirhind)|Wazir Khan]] attacked Anandpur.

In this regard, Masson's explanation is perhaps the most pertinent: \"Though compared to the Afghans, the Sikhs were mild and exerted a protecting influence, yet no advantages could compensate to their Mohammedan subjects, the idea of subjection to infidels, and the prohibition to slay [[Cattle|kine]], and to repeat the ''azan'', or 'summons to prayer'.\"<ref>Masson, Charles. 1842.

This opportunity was used by the [[British East India Company]] to launch the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|Anglo-Sikh Wars]].\n\nThe [[Battle of Ferozeshah]] in 1845 marked many turning points, the British encountered the [[Punjab Army]], opening with a gun-duel in which the Sikhs \"had the better of the British artillery\".

Some believe that it was treachery of the non-Sikh high command of their own army which led to them marching away from a British force in a precarious and battered state. Others believe that a tactical withdrawal was the best policy.<ref>Frasier, G.M.

Religiously diverse, with an estimated population of 3.5 million in 1831 (making it the [[List of countries by population in 1800|19th most populous country at the time]]),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Amarinder Singh]]'s The Last Sunset: The Rise and Fall of the Lahore Durbar</ref> it was the last major region of the Indian subcontinent to be annexed by the British.\n\nThe foundations of the Sikh Empire can be traced to as early as 1707, the year of [[Aurangzeb]]'s death and the start of the downfall of the [[Mughal Empire]]. With the Mughals significantly weakened, the Sikh army, known as the [[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]], a rearrangement of the Khalsa inaugurated by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], led expeditions against them and the [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]] in the west. This led to a growth of the army which split into different confederacies or semi-independent ''[[misl]]s''. Each of these component armies controlled different areas and cities. However, in the period from 1762 to 1799, Sikh commanders of the misls appeared to be coming into their own as independent warlords.\n\nThe formation of the empire began with the capture of Lahore, by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, from its Afghan ruler, [[Zaman Shah Durrani]], and the subsequent and progressive expulsion of Afghans from the Punjab, by defeating them in the [[Afghan-Sikh Wars]], and the unification of the separate Sikh misls. Ranjit Singh was proclaimed as Maharaja of the Punjab on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with Vaisakhi), creating a unified political state. Sahib Singh Bedi, a descendant of [[Guru Nanak]], conducted the coronation.<ref>[http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/ The Encyclopaedia of Sikhism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508213214/http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/ |date=8 May 2014 }}, section ''S\u0101hib Si\u1e45gh Bed\u012b, B\u0101b\u0101 (1756\u20131834)''.</ref> Ranjit Singh rose to power in a very short period, from a leader of a single misl to finally becoming the Maharaja of Punjab. He began to modernise his army, using the latest training as well as weapons and [[artillery]]. After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire was weakened by internal divisions and political mismanagement. Finally, by 1849 the state was dissolved after the defeat in the [[Anglo-Sikh wars]]. The Sikh Empire was divided into four provinces: [[Lahore]], in Punjab, which became the Sikh capital, [[Multan]], also in Punjab, [[Peshawar]] and [[Kashmir]] from 1799 to 1849.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Mughal rule of Punjab===\n\nThe [[Sikhism|Sikh religion]] began around the time of the conquest of Northern India by [[Babur]], the founder of the [[Mughal Empire]]. His conquering grandson, [[Akbar the Great]], supported religious freedom and after visiting the [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]] of [[Guru Amar Das]] got a favourable impression of Sikhism. As a result of his visit he donated land to the langar and the Mughals did not have any conflict with [[Sikh gurus]] until his death in 1605.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalsi|2005|pages=106\u2013107}}</ref> His successor [[Jahangir]], however, saw the Sikhs as a political threat.

The office of Kotwal, or prefect of police, was conferred upon a Muslim, Imam Bakhsh.{{sfn|Waheeduddin|1981|p=20}}\n\n[[File:Sikh_helmet.jpg|thumb|left|x400px|Sikh warrior helmet with butted mail neckguard, 1820\u20131840, iron overlaid with gold with mail neckguard of iron and brass]]\nGenerals were also drawn from a variety of communities, along with prominent Sikh generals like [[Hari Singh Nalwa]], Fateh Singh Dullewalia, Nihal Singh Atariwala, [[Chattar Singh Attariwalla]], and Fateh Singh Kalianwala; Hindu generals included [[Dewan Mokham Chand|Dewan Mokham Chand Nayyar]], his son, and his grandson, and [[Misr Diwan Chand|Misr Diwan Chand Nayyar]]; and Muslim generals included [[Ilahi Bakhsh]] and Mian Ghaus Khan; one general, [[Balbhadra Kunwar]], was a Nepalese Gurkha, and European generals included [[Jean-Francois Allard]], [[Jean-Baptiste Ventura]], and [[Paolo Avitabile]].{{sfn|Waheeduddin|1981|p=23}} other notable generals of the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]] were [[Veer Singh Dillon|Veer Singh Dhillon]], [[Sham Singh Attariwala]], [[Mahan Singh Mirpuri]], and [[Zorawar Singh Kahluria]], among others.\n\nThe appointment of key posts in public offices was based on merit and loyalty, regardless of the social group or religion of the appointees, both in and around the court, and in higher as well as lower posts. Key posts in the civil and military administration were held by members of communities from all over the empire and beyond, including Sikhs, Muslims, Khatris, Brahmins, Dogras, Rajputs, Pashtuns, Europeans, and Americans, among others,{{sfn|Waheeduddin|1981|p=22}} and worked their way up the hierarchy to attain merit. [[Dhian Singh Dogra|Dhian Singh]], the prime minister, was a Dogra, whose brothers [[Gulab Singh]] and Suchet Singh served in the high-ranking administrative and military posts, respectively.{{sfn|Waheeduddin|1981|p=22}} Brahmins like finance minister [[Raja Dina Nath]], Sahib Dyal, and others also served in financial capacities.{{sfn|Waheeduddin|1981|p=23}} Muslims in prominent positions included the Fakir brothers, Kazi Nizamuddin, and Mufti Muhammad Shah, among others.  Among the top-ranking Muslim officers there were two ministers, one governor and several district officers; there were 41 high-ranking Muslim officers in the army, including two generals and several colonels,{{sfn|Waheeduddin|1981|p=23}} and 92 Muslims were senior officers in the police, judiciary, legal department and supply and store departments.{{sfn|Waheeduddin|1981|p=23}} Thus, the government was run by an elite corps drawn from many communities, giving the empire the character of a secular system of government, even when built on theocratic foundations.{{sfn|Waheeduddin|1981|p=24}}\n\nA ban on cow slaughter, which can be related to Hindu sentiments, was universally imposed in the Sarkar Khalsaji.<ref>Lodrick, D.

In this regard, Masson's explanation is perhaps the most pertinent: \"Though compared to the Afghans, the Sikhs were mild and exerted a protecting influence, yet no advantages could compensate to their Mohammedan subjects, the idea of subjection to infidels, and the prohibition to slay [[Cattle|kine]], and to repeat the ''azan'', or 'summons to prayer'.\"<ref>Masson, Charles. 1842.

This opportunity was used by the [[British East India Company]] to launch the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|Anglo-Sikh Wars]].\n\nThe [[Battle of Ferozeshah]] in 1845 marked many turning points, the British encountered the [[Punjab Army]], opening with a gun-duel in which the Sikhs \"had the better of the British artillery\". As the British made advances, Europeans in their army were specially targeted, as the Sikhs believed if the army \"became demoralised, the backbone of the enemy's position would be broken\".<ref>Ranjit Singh: administration and British policy, (Prakash, p.31-33)</ref> The fighting continued throughout the night. The British position \"grew graver as the night wore on\", and \"suffered terrible casualties with every single member of the Governor General's staff either killed or wounded\".<ref name=\"Maharaja Ranjit Singh p.136-137\">Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the last to lay arms, (Duggal, p.136-137)</ref> Nevertheless, the British army took and held Ferozeshah. British General Sir [[James Hope Grant]] recorded: \"Truly the night was one of gloom and forbidding and perhaps never in the annals of warfare has a British Army on such a large scale been nearer to a defeat which would have involved annihilation.\"<ref name=\"Maharaja Ranjit Singh p.136-137\"/>\n\nThe reasons for the withdrawal of the Sikhs from Ferozeshah are contentious. Some believe that it was treachery of the non-Sikh high command of their own army which led to them marching away from a British force in a precarious and battered state. Others believe that a tactical withdrawal was the best policy.<ref>Frasier, G.M. (1990) Flashman and the Mountain of Light, Harper-Collins, London</ref>\n\nThe Sikh empire was finally dissolved at the end of the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849 into separate [[princely states]] and the British [[Punjab (British India)|province of Punjab]]. Eventually, a Lieutenant Governorship was formed in Lahore as a direct representative of the [[British Crown]].\n\n== Timeline ==\n* 1699: Formation of the [[Khalsa]] by Guru Gobind Singh.\n* 1710\u20131716: Banda Singh defeats the [[Mughals]] and declares [[Khalsa]] rule.\n* 1716\u20131738: Turbulence, no real ruler; Mughals take back the control for two decades but Sikhs engage in [[guerrilla]] warfare\n* 1733\u20131735: The Khalsa accepts, only to reject, the confederal status given by the Mughals.\n* 1748\u20131757: Afghan invasion of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]]\n* 1761\u20131767: Recapture of Punjab region by Afghan in [[Third Battle of Panipat]]\n* 1763\u20131774: Charat Singh Sukerchakia, Misldar of [[Sukerchakia]] [[misl]], establishes himself in Gujranwala.\n* 1764\u20131783: Baba [[Baghel Singh]], Misldar of [[Singh Krora Misl]], imposes taxes on the Mughals.\n* 1783: [[Capture of Delhi and Red Fort (1783)|Sikh capture of Delhi the Red Fort]] from the Mughals\n* 1773: Ahmad Shah Durrani dies and his son [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]] launches several invasions into Punjab.\n* 1774\u20131790: [[Maha Singh]] becomes Misldar of the Sukerchakia [[misl]].
