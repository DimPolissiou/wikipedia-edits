France was the first ally of the new United States. [[France in the American Revolutionary War|The 1778 treaty and military support]] proved decisive in the American victory over Britain in the [[American Revolutionary War]].  France fared poorly, with few gains and heavy debts, which were contributing causes of [[French Revolution|France's own revolution]] and eventual transition to a Republic.\n\nThe American relationship with France has been peaceful except for the [[Quasi War]] in 1798-99, and fighting against [[Vichy France]] (while supporting [[Free France]]) during [[World War II]].  The relationship had always been important for both nations.\n\nIn the 21st Century, differences over the [[Iraq War]] led each country to have lowered favorability ratings of the other.  However, since then, relations have improved, with American favorable ratings of France reaching a historic high of 87% in 2016.<ref name=\"Opinion of the United States\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/country/74/ |title=Opinion of the United States |publisher=Pewglobal.org |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref><ref name=\"France's Favorite Rating Zooms\">{{cite web|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/189602/france-favorable-rating-zooms-new-high.aspx |title=France's Favorable Rating in U.S. Zooms to 87%, a New High |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=2018-04-12|date=February 25, 2016 }}</ref> [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] concluded, \"After diplomatic differences in 2003 soured relations between the two countries, France and the U.S. have found a common interest in combating international terrorism, and the mission has become personal for both countries.\"<ref name=\"France's Favorite Rating Zooms\"/>\n[[File:Trump talks with Macron at G7 Biarritz summit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|French President [[Emmanuel Macron]] with U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] at the [[45th G7 summit|45th G7 in Biarritz]], August 2019.]]\n\n==Country comparison==\nLeaders of the France and United States since 1950:\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:1600 height:auto barincrement:70\nPlotArea   = left:100 right:100 bottom:80 top:0\nDateFormat  = dd/mm/yyyy\nDefine $now = 31/12/2019\nPeriod      = from:01/01/1940 till:$now\nTimeAxis    = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor  = unit:year increment:5 start:01/01/1945\nScaleMinor  = unit:year increment:1 start:01/01/1958\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\n\nColors =\n  id:sfio value:red    legend: French_Section_of_the_Workers'_International\n  id:cnip value:purple   legend: National_Centre_of_Independents_and_Peasants\n  id:fnri value:orange   legend: Union_for_French_Democracy\n  id:ump  value:blue     legend:Union_For_a_Popular_Movement\n  id:ps   value:red      legend:Socialist_Party_(France)\n  id:lrm  value:yellow   legend:La_R\u00e9publique_En_Marche!\n  id:dem  value:skyblue  legend:Democratic_Party_(US)\n  id:gop  value:pink     legend:Republican_Party_(US)\n\nBarData =\n bar:fr text:[[France]]\n bar:us text:[[United States]]\n\nPlotData=\n  align:center mark:(line,black)\n  bar:fr\n  from: 14/05/2017  till: $now color:yellow  text:\"[[Emmanuel Macron|Macron]]\"\n  from: 15/05/2012  till: 14/05/2017  color:red     text:\"[[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]]\"\n  from: 16/05/2007  till: 15/05/2012  color:blue    text:\"[[Nicolas Sarkozy]]\"\n  from: 17/05/1995  till: 16/05/2007  color:blue    text:\"[[Jacques Chirac]]\"\n  from: 21/05/1981  till: 17/05/1995  color:red     text:\"[[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]\"\n  from: 02/04/1974  till: 21/05/1981  color:orange  text:\"[[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing|d'Estaing]]\"\n  from: 28/04/1969  till: 02/04/1974  color:pink    text:\"[[Georges Pompidou|Pompidou]]\"\n  from: 08/01/1959  till: 28/04/1969  color:pink    text:\"[[Charles de Gaulle]]\"\n  from: 03/12/1954  till: 08/01/1959  color:purple  text:\"[[Ren\u00e9 Coty]]\"\n  from: 16/01/1947  till: 03/12/1954  color:red   text:\"[[Vincent Auriol]]\n\n  bar:us\n  from: 20/01/2017 till: $now color:gop text:\"[[Donald Trump|Trump]]\"\n  from: 20/01/2009 till: 20/01/2017  color:dem  text:\"[[Barack Obama|Obama]]\"\n  from: 20/01/2001 till: 20/01/2009  color:gop  text:\"[[George W.

However, beginning in earnest following the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England (1688), the simmering dynastic, religious, and factional rivalries between the Protestant British and Catholic French in both Europe and the Americas triggered four \"[[French and Indian Wars]]\" fought largely on American soil ([[King William's War]], 1689\u201397; [[Queen Anne's War]], 1702\u201313; [[King George's War]], 1744\u201348; and, finally the [[Seven Years' War]], 1756\u201363). Great Britain finally removed the French from continental North America in 1763 following French defeat in the Seven Years' War. Within a decade, the British colonies were in open revolt, and France retaliated by secretly supplying the independence movement with troops and war materials.\n\n[[File:First meeting of Washington and Lafayette, Currier and Ives 1876.jpg|thumb|The [[Marquis de Lafayette]] visiting [[George Washington]] in 1777 during the American Revolutionary War.]]\nAfter [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] declared independence in July 1776, its agents in Paris recruited officers for the [[Continental Army]], notably the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], who served with distinction as a major general. Despite a lingering distrust of France, the agents also requested a formal alliance. After readying their fleet and being impressed by the U.S. victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777, the French on February 6, 1778, concluded treaties of [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States \u2013 France)|commerce]] and [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|alliance]] that bound them to fight Britain until independence of the United States was assured.<ref>C. H. Van Tyne, \"Influences which Determined the French Government to Make the Treaty with America, 1778,\"\n''American Historical Review'' (1916) 21#3 pp. 528\u2013541 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1835010 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Jonathan R. Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of American Revolution'' (1985)</ref>\n\nThe military alliance began poorly. French Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] sailed to North America with a fleet in 1778, and began a joint effort with American General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] to capture a British outpost at [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. D'Estaing broke off the operation to confront a British fleet, and then, despite pleas from Sullivan and Lafayette, sailed away to Boston for repairs. Without naval support, the plan collapsed, and American forces under Sullivan had to conduct a fighting retreat alone. American outrage was widespread, and several French sailors were killed in anti-French riots. D'Estaing's actions in a [[Siege of Savannah|disastrous siege]] at [[Savannah, Georgia]] further undermined Franco-American relations.<ref>Jonathan R. Dull, '' The French Navy and American Independence: A Study of Arms and Diplomacy, 1774\u20131787'' (1975)</ref>\n\n[[File:BattleOfVirginiaCapes.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] where the French Navy defeated the Royal Navy in 1781]]\n[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Yorktown|Surrender of Lord Cornwallis]] depicting the English surrendering to French (left) and American (right) troops.]]\nThe alliance improved with the arrival in the United States in 1780 of the [[Comte de Rochambeau]], who maintained a good working relationship with General Washington. French naval actions at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] made possible the decisive Franco\u2013American victory at the [[siege of Yorktown]] in October 1781, effectively ending the war as far as the Americans were concerned.  The French went on fighting, losing a naval battle to Britain in 1782.\n\nThe Patriot reliance on Catholic France for military, financial and diplomatic aid led to a sharp drop in anti-Catholic rhetoric.  Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon patriots had to fight against.  Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war while most remained in the new nation.  By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. \"In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.\"<ref>Francis Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (1995) pp 154-55, quote p 155..

Indeed, the French Foreign Minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] had maneuvered so that the American Congress ordered its delegation to follow the advice of the French. However, the American commissioners, [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Adams]], and particularly [[John Jay]], correctly realized that France did not want a strong United States. They realized that they would get better terms directly from Britain itself. The key episodes came in September, 1782, when Vergennes proposed a solution that was strongly opposed by the United States. France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it captured Gibraltar from the British. Vergennes came up with the deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take [[Northwest Territory|the area north of the Ohio River]]. In the area south of that there would be set up an independent Indian state under Spanish control. It would be an [[Indian barrier state]] and keep the Americans from the Mississippi River or New Orleans, which were under Spanish control. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain. The British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] agreed. He was in full charge of the British negotiations and he now saw a chance to split the United States away from France and make the new country a valuable economic partner.<ref>Charles R. Ritcheson, \"The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782\u20131783: Vision and Reality.\" ''International History Review'' 5#3 (1983): 322-345.</ref> The western terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada.

It was a highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view. Prime Minister Shelburne foresaw highly profitable two-way trade between Britain and the rapidly growing United States, as it indeed came to pass.  Trade with France was always on a much smaller scale.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan R.

At first, the United States was quite sympathetic to the new situation in France, where the [[hereditary monarchy]] was replaced by a [[French First Republic|constitutional republic]]. However, in the matter of a few years, the situation in France turned sour, as foreign powers tried to invade France and King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was accused of high treason. The French revolutionary government then became increasingly authoritarian and brutal, which dissipated some of the United States' warmth for France.\n\nA crisis emerged in 1793 when France found itself at war again with Great Britain and its allies, this time after the French revolutionary government had executed the king. The new federal government in the United States was uncertain how to respond. Should the United States recognize the radical government of France by accepting a diplomatic representative from it? Was the United States obliged by the alliance of 1778 to go to war on the side of France? The treaty had been called \"military and economic\", and as the United States had not finished paying off the French loan, would the military alliance be ignored as well?  President [[George Washington]] (responding to advice from both [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]) recognized the French government, but did not support France in the war with Britain, as expressed in his 1793 [[Proclamation of Neutrality]]. The proclamation was issued and declared without Congressional approval. Congress instead acquiesced, and a year later passed a neutrality act forbidding U.S. citizens to participate in the war and prohibiting the use of U.S. soil as a base of operation for either side. Thus, the revolutionary government viewed Washington's policy as partial to the enemy.<ref>John C. Miller, ''The Federalist Era 1789-1801'' (1960)  [https://archive.org/details/federalistera197000675mbp online] pp 126-39.</ref>\n\nThe first challenge to U.S. neutrality came from France, when its first diplomatic representative, the brash [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]], toured the United States to organize U.S. expeditions against Spain and Britain. Exasperated, Washington demanded Gen\u00eat's recall, but by then the French Revolution had taken yet another turn and the new French ministers arrived to arrest Gen\u00eat. Washington refused to extradite Gen\u00eat (knowing he would otherwise be guillotined). Gen\u00eat became a U.S. citizen.<ref>Sioli, Marco. \"Citizen Gen\u00eat and Political Struggle in the Early American Republic.\" ''Revue fran\u00e7aise d'\u00e9tudes am\u00e9ricaines'' (1995): 259-267. [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rfea_0397-7870_1995_num_64_1_1582 Online free in English]</ref>\n\nFrance regarded [[Jay's Treaty]] (November 1794) between Britain and the United States as hostile.  It opened a decade of trade when France was at war with Britain.\n\n[[Timothy Pickering]] (1745-1829) was the third [[United States Secretary of State]], serving in that office from 1795 to 1800 under Washington and [[John Adams]].  Biographer Gerald Clarfield says he was a \"quick-tempered, self-righteous, frank, and aggressive Anglophile,\" who handled the French poorly. In response the French envoy Pierre Adet repeatedly provoked Pickering into embarrassing situations, then ridiculed his blunderings and blusterings to appeal to Republican Party opponents of the Administration.<ref>Gerard H. Clarfield, ''Timothy Pickering and American Diplomacy, 1795-1800'' (1969).</ref>\n\n===Quasi War 1798\u20131800===\nTo overcome this resentment John Adams sent a special mission to Paris in 1797 to meet the French foreign minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]]. The American delegation was shocked, however, when it was demanded that they pay monetary bribes in order to meet and secure a deal with the French government. Adams exposed the episode, known as the \"[[XYZ Affair]]\", which greatly offended Americans even though such bribery was not uncommon among the courts of Europe.<ref>{{Cite book |title=American Foreign Relations: A History, to 1920 |last=Paterson |first=Thomas G. |author2=Clifford, J.

The unexpected fighting ability of the U.S. Navy, which destroyed the French West Indian trade, together with the growing weaknesses and final overthrow of the ruling Directory in France, led Talleyrand to reopen negotiations. At the same time, President Adams feuded with Hamilton over control of the Adams' administration.  Adams took sudden and unexpected action, rejecting the anti-French hawks in his own party and offering peace to France. In 1800 he sent [[William Vans Murray]] to France to negotiate peace; Federalists cried betrayal. The subsequent negotiations, embodied in the [[Convention of 1800]] (also called the \"Treaty of Mortefontaine\") of September 30, 1800, affirmed the rights of Americans as neutrals upon the sea and abrogated the alliance with France of 1778. The treaty failed to provide compensation for the $20,000,000 \"French Spoliation Claims\" of the United States; the U.S. government eventually paid these claims. The Convention of 1800 ensured that the United States would remain neutral toward France in the wars of Napoleon and ended the \"entangling\" French alliance with the United States.<ref>E.

He envisioned it as the base (along with Haiti) of a New World empire. Louisiana would be a granary providing food to the enslaved labor force in the West Indies. President Jefferson could tolerate weak Spain but not powerful France in the west. He considered war to prevent French control of the Mississippi River. Jefferson sent his close friend, James Monroe, to France to buy as much of the land around New Orleans as he could. Surprisingly, Napoleon agreed to sell the entire territory. Because of an insuppressible slave rebellion in [[St. Domingue]], modern-day Haiti, among other reasons, Bonaparte's North American plans collapsed. To keep Louisiana out of British hands in an approaching war he sold it in April 1803 to the United States for $15 million.  British bankers financed the deal, taking American government bonds and shipping gold to Paris. The size of the United States was doubled without going to war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dlK8PIAJ5oC&pg=PA55|year=2009|pages=55\u201362|isbn=9780742565340}}</ref>\n\nBritain and France resumed their war in 1803, just after the Purchase. Both challenged American neutrality and tried to disrupt trade with its enemy. The presupposition was that small neutral nations could benefit from the wars of the great powers. Jefferson distrusted both Napoleon and Great Britain, but saw Britain (with its monarchism, aristocracy and great navy and position in Canada) as the more immediate threat to American interests. Therefore, he and Madison took a generally pro-French position and used the embargo to hurt British trade. Both Britain and France infringed on U.S. maritime rights. The British infringed more and also impressed thousands of American sailors into the Royal Navy; France never did anything like impressment.<ref>J. C. A. Stagg, ''The War of 1812'' (2012) pp 17-47</ref>  Jefferson signed the [[Embargo Act]] in 1807, which forbade all exports and imports. Designed to hurt the British, it hurt American commerce far more. The destructive Embargo Act, which had brought U.S. trade to a standstill, was rescinded in 1809, as Jefferson left office. Both Britain and France remained hostile to the United States. The [[War of 1812]] was the logical extension of the embargo program as the United States declared war on Britain. However, there was never any sense of being an ally of France and no effort was made to coordinate military activity.<ref>Lawrence S.

The U.S. inherited the [[French colonization of Texas|French claims]] to Texas, then in the 1819 [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] traded these (and a little of the Mississippi drainage itself) in return for American possession of Florida, where American settlers and the U.S. Army were already encroaching, and acquisition of Spain's weak claims to the Pacific Northwest.

The United States, in cooperation with Great Britain, issued the \"[[Monroe Doctrine]]\" in 1823 to keep European powers, especially Spain but also France, from seizing lands in the New World.  The French had a strong interest in expanding commercial opportunity in Latin America, especially as the Spanish role was faltering.  There was a desire among top French officials that some of the newly independent countries in Latin America might select a Bourbon king, but no actual operations ever took place.  French officials ignored the American position. France and Austria, two reactionary monarchies, strenuously opposed American republicanism and wanted the United States to have no voice whatsoever in European affairs.<ref>Dexter Perkins,  \"Europe, Spanish America, and the Monroe Doctrine.\" ''American Historical Review'' 27#2 (1922): 207-218.

France did pay European claims, but refused to pay the United States.  President Andrew Jackson was livid, In 1834 ordered the U.S. Navy to stand by and asked Congress for legislation.  Jackson's political opponents blocked any legislation.  France was annoyed but finally voted the money if the United States apologized.  Jackson refused to apologize, and diplomatic relations were broken off until in December 1835 Jackson did offer some friendlier words.  The British mediated, France paid the money, and cordial relations were resumed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Greg H.

During the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u20131871)|Siege of Paris]], the small American population, led by the U.S. Minister to France [[Elihu B.

From 1870 until 1918, France was the only major republic in Europe, which endeared it to the United States. Many French people held the United States in high esteem, as a land of opportunity and as a source of modern ideas. Few French people emigrated to the United States. Intellectuals, however, saw the United States as a land built on crass materialism, lacking in a significant culture, and boasting of its distrust of intellectuals. Very few self-styled French intellectuals were admirers.<ref>Barry Rubin and Judith Colp Rubin, ''Hating America: A History'' (2005) p 133.</ref>\n\nIn 1906, when Germany challenged French influence in [[Morocco]] (''see'' [[Tangier Crisis]] and [[Agadir Crisis]]), President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sided with the French.  However, as the Americans grew mightily in economic power, and forged closer ties with Britain, the French increasingly talked about an Anglo-Saxon threat to their culture.<ref>Philippe Roger, ''The American Enemy: The History of French Anti-Americanism'' (2005) pp 172-76.</ref>\n\nStudent exchange became an important factor, especially Americans going to France to study. The French were annoyed that so many Americans were going to Germany for post-graduate education, and discussed how to attract more Americans. After 1870, hundreds of American women traveled to France and Switzerland to obtain their medical degrees. The best American schools were closed to them and chose an expensive option superior to what they were allowed in the U.S.<ref>Thomas N.

The American troops were sent over without their heavy equipment (so that the ships could carry more soldiers). They used French artillery, airplanes and tanks, such as the [[SPAD XIII]] fighter biplane and [[Renault FT]] light tank serving in the aviation and armored formations of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] on the Western Front in 1918. In 1918 the United States sent over a million combat troops who were stationed to the south of the main French lines. They gave the Allies a decisive edge, as the Germans were unable to replace their heavy losses and lost their self-confidence by September 1918.<ref>Martin Marix-Evans, ''Retreat, Hell!

However, the two countries clashed over France's policy to weaken Germany and make it pay for the entire French war. The burning ambition of French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] was to ensure the security of France in the future; his formula was not friendship with Germany restitution, reparations, and guarantees. Clemenceau had little confidence in what he considered to be the unrealistic and utopian principles of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]: \"Even God was satisfied with [[Ten Commandments]], but Wilson insists on fourteen\" (a reference to Wilson's \"[[Fourteen Points]]\"). The two nations disagreed on debts, reparations, and restraints on Germany.\n\nClemenceau was also determined that a buffer state consisting of the German territory [[Rhineland|west of the Rhine River]] should be established under the aegis of France. In the eyes of the U.S. and British representatives, such a crass violation of the principle of self-determination would only breed future wars, and a compromise was therefore offered Clemenceau, which he accepted. The territory in question was to be occupied by Allied troops for a period of five to fifteen years, and a zone extending fifty kilometers east of the Rhine was to be demilitarized. Wilson and British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] agreed that the United States and Great Britain, by treaty, would guarantee France against German aggression.  Republican leaders in Washington were willing to support a security treaty with France. It failed because Wilson insisted on linking it to the Versailles Treaty, which the Republicans would not accept without certain amendments Wilson refused to allow.<ref>Lloyd E. Ambrosius, \"Wilson, The Republicans, and French Security after World War I,\" ''Journal of American History'' (1972) 59#2 pp 341\u2013352 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1890194 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nWhile French historian Duruoselle portrays Clemenceau as wiser than Wilson, and equally compassionate and committed to justice but one who understood that world peace and order depended on the permanent suppression of the German threat.<ref>Jean-Baptiste Duroselle, ''France and the United States'' (1978)</ref> Blumenthal (1986), by contrast, says Wilson's policies were far sounder than the harsh terms demanded by Clemenceau. Blumenthal agrees with Wilson that peace and prosperity required Germany's full integration into the world economic and political community as an equal partner.  One result was that in the 1920s the French deeply distrusted the Americans, who were loaning money to Germany (which Germany used to pay its reparations to France and other Allies), while demanding that France repay its war loans from Washington.<ref>Zahniser, 1987</ref><ref>Melvyn Leffler, ''The Elusive Quest: America's Pursuit of European Stability and French Security, 1919-1933'' (1979) [https://www.amazon.com/Elusive-Quest-Americas-Stability-1919-1933/dp/0807813338/ excerpt and text search]</ref><ref>Stephen Schuker, ''The End of French Predominance in Europe: The Financial Crisis of 1924 and the Adoption of the Dawes Plan'' (1976) [https://www.amazon.com/End-French-Predominance-Europe-Financial/dp/1597403989/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n== Interwar years (1919\u201338) ==\n[[File:French ambassador's residence.JPG|thumb|The French ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C.

Beginning in the 1920s, U.S. intellectuals, painters, writers, and tourists were drawn to French art, literature, philosophy, theatre, cinema, fashion, wines, and cuisine.\n\nA number of American artists, such as [[Josephine Baker]], experienced popular success in France. Paris was also quite welcoming to American [[jazz]] music and black artists in particular, as France, unlike a significant part of the United States at the time, had no racial discrimination laws. Numerous writers such as [[William Faulkner]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and others were deeply influenced by their experiences of French life.  Known as the [[Lost Generation]], their time in Paris was documented by Hemingway in his memoir ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''.\n\nHowever, [[anti-Americanism]] came of age in the 1920s, as many French traditionalists were alarmed at the power of Hollywood and warned that America represented modernity, which in turn threatened traditional [[Culture of France|French values]], customs, and popular literature.<ref>David Strauss, \"The Rise of Anti-Americanism In France: French Intellectuals and the American Film Industry, 1927\u20131932,\" ''Journal of Popular Culture'' (177) 10#4 pp 752\u2013759\n</ref> The alarm of American influence escalated half a century later when Americans opened a $4 billion [[Disneyland Paris]] theme park in 1992.

The causes included cultural clashes between the French and Americans and subtle anti-Americanism among potential clients.

The successful performance of German warplanes during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339) suddenly forced France to realize its military inferiority.  Germany had better warplanes,  more of them, pilots with wartime experience in Spain, and much more efficient factories. President Roosevelt had long been interested in France, and was a personal friend of French Senator, Baron Amaury de La Grange. In late 1937 he told Roosevelt about the French weaknesses, and asked for military help. Roosevelt was forthcoming, and forced the War Department to secretly sell the most modern American airplanes to France.<ref>John McVickar Haight, \"Roosevelt as Friend of France.\" ''Foreign Affairs'' 44.3 (1966): 518-526.

France and Britain declared war on Germany when it invaded Poland in September 1939, but there was little action until the following spring.

France was forced to accept German terms and a pro-fascist dictatorship took over in [[Vichy France]].<ref>J.

This led the Roosevelt administration to maintain diplomatic relations. FDR appointed his close associate Admiral [[William D. Leahy]] as ambassador. The Vichy regime was officially neutral but it was helping Germany. The United States severed diplomatic relations in late 1942 when Germany took direct control of areas that Vichy had ruled, and Vichy France became a Nazi [[puppet state]].<ref>William L. Langer, ''Our Vichy Gamble'' (1947)</ref> More recently, Hurstfield (1986) concluded that Roosevelt, not the State Department, had made the decision, thereby deflecting criticism from leftwing elements of his coalition onto the hapless State Department. When the experiment ended FDR brought Leahy back to Washington as his top military advisor and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.<ref>Phillips Payson O'Brien, ''The Second Most Powerful Man in the World: The Life of Admiral William D.

After Normandy the Americans and the Allies knew it was only a matter of time before the Nazis lost. Eisenhower did give De Gaulle his word that Paris would be liberated by the French as the Americans had no interest in Paris, a city they considered lacking tactical value. It was therefore easy for Eisenhower to let De Gaulle's FFI take the charge. There was one important aspect of Paris that did seem to matter to everyone: it was its historical and cultural significance. Hitler had given the order to bomb and burn Paris to the ground; he wanted to make it a second [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]. The Americans and the Allies could not let this happen.<ref name=\"historynet.com\">[http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-the-liberation-of-paris.htm].

While in Lorraine, he annexed the Maj. Gen. Phillipe Leclerc's battalion into his army.<ref name=\"historynet.com\"/> Leclerc did not respect his American counterparts because like the British he thought that they were new to the war. Therefore, he thought the Americans did not know what they were doing on the field. After being more trouble than help Patton let Leclerc go for Paris. The French then went on to liberate Paris from the east while the 4th U.S. Infantry (originally part of Patton's Army) came from the west.

He wanted to put it under an international trusteeship. He wanted the United States to work closely with China to become the policeman for the region and stabilize it; the U.S. would provide suitable financing. The scheme was directly contrary to the plans of the Free French; de Gaulle had a grand vision of the French overseas empire as the base for his return to defeat Vichy France. Roosevelt could not abide de Gaulle, but Winston Churchill realized that Britain needed French help to reestablish its position in Europe after the war. He and the British foreign office decided to work closely with de Gaulle to achieve that goal, and therefore they had to abandon Roosevelt's decolonization scheme. In doing so, they had considerable support from like-minded American officials. The basic weakness of Roosevelt's scheme was its dependence on [[Chiang Kai-shek]] the ruler of China. Chiang's regime virtually collapsed under Japanese pressure in 1944, and Japan overran the American airbases that were built to attack Japan. The Pentagon's plans to use China as a base to destroy Japan collapsed, so the U.S. Air Force turned its attention to attacking Japan with very long-range B-29 bombers based in the Pacific. The American military no longer needed China or Southeast Asia, and China was too weak to be a policeman. With the defeat of Japan, Britain took over Southeast Asia and returned Indochina to France. Roosevelt realized his trusteeship plan was dead and accepted the British-French actions as necessary to stabilize Southeast Asia.<ref>Walter LaFeber, \"Roosevelt, Churchill, and Indochina: 1942-45\" ''American Historical Review'' (1975) 80#5 pp 1277-1295. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1852060 online]</ref>\n\n== Postwar years ==\nIn the postwar years, both cooperation and discord persisted. After de Gaulle left office in January 1946, the logjam was broken in terms of financial aid.  Lend Lease had barely restarted when it was unexpectedly ended in August 1945. The U.S.  Army shipped in food, 1944-46. U.S. Treasury loans and cash grants were given in 1945-47, and especially the Marshall Plan gave large sums (1948\u201351). There was post-Marshall aid (1951\u201355) designed to help France rearm and provide massive support for its war in Indochina. Apart from low-interest loans, the other funds were grants that did not involve repayment.  The debts left over from World War I, whose payment had been suspended since 1931, was renegotiated in the [[Blum-Byrnes agreement]] of 1946. The United States forgave all $2.8 billion in debt from the First World War, and gave France a new loan of $650 million. In return French negotiator [[Jean Monnet]] set out the French five-year plan for recovery and development.<ref>{{cite book|author=Irwin M.

Johnson]], 1967]]\n\nWhile occasional tensions surfaced between the governments, the French public, except for the Communists, generally had a good opinion of the United States throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. Despite some cultural friction, the United States was seen as a benevolent giant, the land of modernity, and French youth took a taste to American culture such as [[chewing gum]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[rock and roll]].\n\n===De Gaulle===\nIn the 1950s France sought American help in developing nuclear weapons; Eisenhower rejected the overtures for four reasons. Before 1958, he was troubled by the political instability of the [[French Fourth Republic]] and worried that it might use nuclear weapons in its colonial wars in Vietnam and Algeria. [[Charles de Gaulle]] brought stability to the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] starting in 1958, but Eisenhower was still hesitant to assist in the nuclearization of France. De Gaulle wanted to challenge the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on Western weapons by having his own ''[[Force de frappe]].'' Eisenhower feared his grandiose plans to use the bombs to restore French grandeur would weaken NATO.  Furthermore, Eisenhower wanted to discourage the proliferation of nuclear arms anywhere.<ref>Keith W. Baum,  \"Two's Company, Three's a Crowd: The Eisenhower Administration, France, and Nuclear Weapons.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 20#2 (1990): 315-328. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27550617 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nCharles de Gaulle also quarreled with Washington over the admission of Britain into the [[European Economic Community]]. These and other tensions led to de Gaulle's decision in 1966 to withdraw French forces from the integrated military structure of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] and forced it to move its headquarters to Belgium.  De Gaulle's foreign policy was centered on an attempt to limit the power and influence of both superpowers, which would increase France's international prestige in relative terms. De Gaulle hoped to move France from being a follower of the United States to a leading first-world power with a large following among certain [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] [[Third World]] countries. The nations de Gaulle considered potential participants in this grouping were those in France's traditional spheres of influence, Africa and the Middle East.<ref>Robert O. Paxton and Nicholas Wahl, eds. ''De Gaulle and the United States: a centennial reappraisal'' (Berg Publishers, 1994).</ref>\n\nThe two nations differed over the waging of the [[Vietnam War]], in part because French leaders were convinced that the United States could not win. The recent French experience with the [[Algerian War of Independence]] was that it was impossible, in the long run, for a democracy to impose by force a government over a foreign population without considerable manpower and probably the use of unacceptable methods such as torture. The French popular view of the United States worsened at the same period, as it came to be seen as an imperialist power.<ref>Yuko Torikata,  \"Reexamining de Gaulle's peace initiative on the Vietnam War.\" ''Diplomatic History'' 31.5 (2007): 909-938.</ref><ref>Marianna P.

Small tensions reappeared intermittently. France, more strongly than any other nation, has seen the [[European Union]] as a method of counterbalancing American power, and thus works towards such ends as having the Euro challenge the preeminent position of the United States dollar in global trade and developing a European defense initiative as an alternative to [[NATO]]. Overall, the United States had much closer relations with the other large European powers, Great Britain, Germany and Italy. In the 1980s the two nations cooperated on some international matters but disagreed sharply on others, such as [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]] and the desirability of a [[German reunification|reunified Germany]]. The Reagan administration did its best efforts to prevent France and other European countries from buying natural gas from Russia, through the construction of the [[Urengoy\u2013Pomary\u2013Uzhgorod pipeline|Siberia-Europe pipeline]]. The European governments, including the French, were undeterred and the pipeline was finally built.<ref>Philip Zelikow and Condoleezza Rice, eds., ''Germany unified and Europe transformed: a study in statecraft'' (Harvard UP, 1995).</ref>\n\n==Anti-Americanism==\n{{Main|Anti-Americanism#France}}\nRichard Kuisel, an American scholar, has explored how France partly embraced American consumerism while rejecting much of American values and power.  He writes in 2013:\n\n{{quote|America functioned as the \"other\" in configuring French identity. To be French was not to be American. Americans were conformists, materialists, racists, violent, and vulgar. The French were individualists, idealists, tolerant, and civilized. Americans adored wealth; the French worshiped ''la douceur de vivre.'' This caricature of America, which was already broadly endorsed at the beginning of the century, served to essentialize French national identity. At the end of the twentieth century, the French strategy [was to use] America as a foil, as a way of defining themselves as well as everything from their social policies to their notion of what constituted culture.<ref>Richard Kuisel, \"The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power,\" ''H-France Forum'' (Spring 2013) 8#4 pp 41-45 [http://www.h-france.net/forum/forumvol8/Kuisel5.pdf online], referencing his major book, ''The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power'' (2012) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sm7n online]</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Kuisel identifies several strong pull effects:\n\n{{quote|American products often carried a representational or symbolic quality. They encoded messages like modernity, youthfulness, rebellion, transgression, status, and freedom ... There was the linkage with political and economic power: historically culture has followed power. Thus Europeans learned English because it is a necessary skill in a globalized environment featuring American technology, education, and business. Similarly the size and power of U.S. multinationals, like that of the global giant Coca-Cola, helped American products win market shares. Finally, it must be acknowledged, that there has been something inherently appealing about what we make and sell. Europeans liked Broadway musicals, TV shows, and fashions. We know how to make and market what others want.<ref>Kuisel, pp 43-44.</ref>}}\n\n== Middle East conflict ==\nFrance under President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] supported the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]] in Iraq as a major participant under [[Operation Daguet]]. The French [[Assemblee Nationale]] even took the \"unprecedented decision\" to place all French forces in the Gulf under United States command for the duration of the war.<ref>Reynolds, David One World Divisible: A Global History Since 1945. 2000. New York: W.W.Norton and Co. p. 588</ref>\n\n===9-11===\n{{Further|September 11 attacks|War on terror}}\nAll the left and right wing political elements in France strongly denounced the barbaric acts of the [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists in the 9/11 attack in 2001.  President [[Jacques Chirac]] \u2014later known for his frosty relationship with President [[George W. Bush]]\u2014ordered the [[French secret services]] to collaborate closely with U.S. intelligence, and created [[Alliance Base]] in Paris, a joint-intelligence service center charged with enacting the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s [[War on Terror]].  However, all the political elements rejected the idea of a full-scale war against Islamic radical terrorism. Memories of the Algerian war, and its disastrous impact on French internal affairs, as well as more distant memories of its own failed Indochina/Vietnam war, played a major role. Furthermore, France had to deal with a large Islamic population of its own, which Chirac could not afford to alienate.  As a consequence, France refused to support any American military efforts in the Middle East. Numerous works by French novelists and film makers criticized the American efforts to transform the 9/11 terrorist attacks into a justification for war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bill Marshall, ed.|title=France and the Americas, vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfq5Tp0nq98C&pg=PA881|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=878\u201383|isbn=9781851094110}}</ref><ref>Carl Cavanagh Hodge, \"Old wine and old bottles: anti-Americanism in Britain, France and Germany.\" ''Journal of Transatlantic Studies'' 7.2 (2009): 148-162.</ref>\n\n===Iraq War===\n\nIn March 2003 France, along with Germany, China, and Russia, opposed the proposed UN resolution that would have authorized a U.S. [[Invasion of Iraq (2003)|invasion of Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/11/sprj.irq.main/ |title=CNN.com \u2013 White House all but concedes U.N. defeat \u2013 Mar. 12, 2003 |accessdate=2008-12-17 | date=2003-03-11}}</ref> During the run-up to the war, French foreign minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] emerged as a prominent critic of the American Iraq policies.

This contributed to the perception of the French as uncooperative and unsympathetic in American popular opinion at the time. This perception was quite strong and persisted despite the fact that France was and had been for some time a major ally in the campaign in Afghanistan (see for example the [[French forces in Afghanistan]]) where both nations (among others in the US-led coalition) were dedicated to the removal of the rogue Taliban, and the subsequent stabilization of Afghanistan, a recognized training ground and safe haven for terrorists intent on carrying out attacks in the Western world.\n\nAs the Iraq War progressed, relations between the two nations began to improve. In June 2006 the [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] Global Attitudes Project revealed that 52% of Americans had a positive view of France, up from 46% in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/252.pdf |title=Microsoft Word \u2013 Pew Global Attitudes 2006 Report _without embargo label_ for release 6.13 with correction 6\u201321.doc |accessdate=2013-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201022704/http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/252.pdf |archive-date=December 1, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other reports indicate Americans are moving not so much toward favorable views of France as toward ambivalence,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/2006/National%20Polls/Allies%20and%20Enemies.htm |title=Rasmussen Reports: The most comprehensive public opinion coverage ever provided for a presidential election. |accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref> and that views toward France have stabilized roughly on par with views toward Russia and China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pollingreport.com/nations.htm |title=Nations |accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref>\n\nFollowing issues like Hezbollah's rise in Lebanon, Iran's nuclear program and the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process, George Bush urged Jacques Chirac and other world leaders to \"stand up for peace\" in the face of extremism during a meeting in New York on September 19, 2006.\n\nStrong French and American diplomatic cooperation at the United Nations played an important role in the [[Cedar Revolution]], which saw the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.

France was the first ally of the new United States. [[France in the American Revolutionary War|The 1778 treaty and military support]] proved decisive in the American victory over Britain in the [[American Revolutionary War]].  France fared poorly, with few gains and heavy debts, which were contributing causes of [[French Revolution|France's own revolution]] and eventual transition to a Republic.\n\nThe American relationship with France has been peaceful except for the [[Quasi War]] in 1798-99, and fighting against [[Vichy France]] (while supporting [[Free France]]) during [[World War II]].  The relationship had always been important for both nations.\n\nIn the 21st Century, differences over the [[Iraq War]] led each country to have lowered favorability ratings of the other.

However, beginning in earnest following the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England (1688), the simmering dynastic, religious, and factional rivalries between the Protestant British and Catholic French in both Europe and the Americas triggered four \"[[French and Indian Wars]]\" fought largely on American soil ([[King William's War]], 1689\u201397; [[Queen Anne's War]], 1702\u201313; [[King George's War]], 1744\u201348; and, finally the [[Seven Years' War]], 1756\u201363). Great Britain finally removed the French from continental North America in 1763 following French defeat in the Seven Years' War. Within a decade, the British colonies were in open revolt, and France retaliated by secretly supplying the independence movement with troops and war materials.\n\n[[File:First meeting of Washington and Lafayette, Currier and Ives 1876.jpg|thumb|The [[Marquis de Lafayette]] visiting [[George Washington]] in 1777 during the American Revolutionary War.]]\nAfter [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] declared independence in July 1776, its agents in Paris recruited officers for the [[Continental Army]], notably the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], who served with distinction as a major general. Despite a lingering distrust of France, the agents also requested a formal alliance. After readying their fleet and being impressed by the U.S. victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777, the French on February 6, 1778, concluded treaties of [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States \u2013 France)|commerce]] and [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|alliance]] that bound them to fight Britain until independence of the United States was assured.<ref>C. H.

Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of American Revolution'' (1985)</ref>\n\nThe military alliance began poorly. French Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] sailed to North America with a fleet in 1778, and began a joint effort with American General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] to capture a British outpost at [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. D'Estaing broke off the operation to confront a British fleet, and then, despite pleas from Sullivan and Lafayette, sailed away to Boston for repairs. Without naval support, the plan collapsed, and American forces under Sullivan had to conduct a fighting retreat alone. American outrage was widespread, and several French sailors were killed in anti-French riots. D'Estaing's actions in a [[Siege of Savannah|disastrous siege]] at [[Savannah, Georgia]] further undermined Franco-American relations.<ref>Jonathan R.

French naval actions at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] made possible the decisive Franco\u2013American victory at the [[siege of Yorktown]] in October 1781, effectively ending the war as far as the Americans were concerned.  The French went on fighting, losing a naval battle to Britain in 1782.\n\nThe Patriot reliance on Catholic France for military, financial and diplomatic aid led to a sharp drop in anti-Catholic rhetoric.  Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon patriots had to fight against.  Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war while most remained in the new nation.  By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. \"In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.\"<ref>Francis Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (1995) pp 154-55, quote p 155..

Indeed, the French Foreign Minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] had maneuvered so that the American Congress ordered its delegation to follow the advice of the French. However, the American commissioners, [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Adams]], and particularly [[John Jay]], correctly realized that France did not want a strong United States. They realized that they would get better terms directly from Britain itself. The key episodes came in September, 1782, when Vergennes proposed a solution that was strongly opposed by the United States. France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it captured Gibraltar from the British. Vergennes came up with the deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take [[Northwest Territory|the area north of the Ohio River]]. In the area south of that there would be set up an independent Indian state under Spanish control. It would be an [[Indian barrier state]] and keep the Americans from the Mississippi River or New Orleans, which were under Spanish control. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain. The British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] agreed. He was in full charge of the British negotiations and he now saw a chance to split the United States away from France and make the new country a valuable economic partner.<ref>Charles R. Ritcheson, \"The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782\u20131783: Vision and Reality.\" ''International History Review'' 5#3 (1983): 322-345.</ref> The western terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada.

It was a highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view.

Trade with France was always on a much smaller scale.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan R.

At first, the United States was quite sympathetic to the new situation in France, where the [[hereditary monarchy]] was replaced by a [[French First Republic|constitutional republic]]. However, in the matter of a few years, the situation in France turned sour, as foreign powers tried to invade France and King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was accused of high treason. The French revolutionary government then became increasingly authoritarian and brutal, which dissipated some of the United States' warmth for France.\n\nA crisis emerged in 1793 when France found itself at war again with Great Britain and its allies, this time after the French revolutionary government had executed the king. The new federal government in the United States was uncertain how to respond. Should the United States recognize the radical government of France by accepting a diplomatic representative from it? Was the United States obliged by the alliance of 1778 to go to war on the side of France? The treaty had been called \"military and economic\", and as the United States had not finished paying off the French loan, would the military alliance be ignored as well?  President [[George Washington]] (responding to advice from both [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]) recognized the French government, but did not support France in the war with Britain, as expressed in his 1793 [[Proclamation of Neutrality]]. The proclamation was issued and declared without Congressional approval. Congress instead acquiesced, and a year later passed a neutrality act forbidding U.S. citizens to participate in the war and prohibiting the use of U.S. soil as a base of operation for either side. Thus, the revolutionary government viewed Washington's policy as partial to the enemy.<ref>John C. Miller, ''The Federalist Era 1789-1801'' (1960)  [https://archive.org/details/federalistera197000675mbp online] pp 126-39.</ref>\n\nThe first challenge to U.S. neutrality came from France, when its first diplomatic representative, the brash [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]], toured the United States to organize U.S. expeditions against Spain and Britain. Exasperated, Washington demanded Gen\u00eat's recall, but by then the French Revolution had taken yet another turn and the new French ministers arrived to arrest Gen\u00eat. Washington refused to extradite Gen\u00eat (knowing he would otherwise be guillotined). Gen\u00eat became a U.S. citizen.<ref>Sioli, Marco. \"Citizen Gen\u00eat and Political Struggle in the Early American Republic.\" ''Revue fran\u00e7aise d'\u00e9tudes am\u00e9ricaines'' (1995): 259-267.

It opened a decade of trade when France was at war with Britain.\n\n[[Timothy Pickering]] (1745-1829) was the third [[United States Secretary of State]], serving in that office from 1795 to 1800 under Washington and [[John Adams]].  Biographer Gerald Clarfield says he was a \"quick-tempered, self-righteous, frank, and aggressive Anglophile,\" who handled the French poorly. In response the French envoy Pierre Adet repeatedly provoked Pickering into embarrassing situations, then ridiculed his blunderings and blusterings to appeal to Republican Party opponents of the Administration.<ref>Gerard H. Clarfield, ''Timothy Pickering and American Diplomacy, 1795-1800'' (1969).</ref>\n\n===Quasi War 1798\u20131800===\nTo overcome this resentment John Adams sent a special mission to Paris in 1797 to meet the French foreign minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]]. The American delegation was shocked, however, when it was demanded that they pay monetary bribes in order to meet and secure a deal with the French government. Adams exposed the episode, known as the \"[[XYZ Affair]]\", which greatly offended Americans even though such bribery was not uncommon among the courts of Europe.<ref>{{Cite book |title=American Foreign Relations: A History, to 1920 |last=Paterson |first=Thomas G. |author2=Clifford, J.

The unexpected fighting ability of the U.S. Navy, which destroyed the French West Indian trade, together with the growing weaknesses and final overthrow of the ruling Directory in France, led Talleyrand to reopen negotiations. At the same time, President Adams feuded with Hamilton over control of the Adams' administration.  Adams took sudden and unexpected action, rejecting the anti-French hawks in his own party and offering peace to France. In 1800 he sent [[William Vans Murray]] to France to negotiate peace; Federalists cried betrayal. The subsequent negotiations, embodied in the [[Convention of 1800]] (also called the \"Treaty of Mortefontaine\") of September 30, 1800, affirmed the rights of Americans as neutrals upon the sea and abrogated the alliance with France of 1778. The treaty failed to provide compensation for the $20,000,000 \"French Spoliation Claims\" of the United States; the U.S. government eventually paid these claims. The Convention of 1800 ensured that the United States would remain neutral toward France in the wars of Napoleon and ended the \"entangling\" French alliance with the United States.<ref>E.

He envisioned it as the base (along with Haiti) of a New World empire. Louisiana would be a granary providing food to the enslaved labor force in the West Indies. President Jefferson could tolerate weak Spain but not powerful France in the west. He considered war to prevent French control of the Mississippi River. Jefferson sent his close friend, James Monroe, to France to buy as much of the land around New Orleans as he could. Surprisingly, Napoleon agreed to sell the entire territory. Because of an insuppressible slave rebellion in [[St. Domingue]], modern-day Haiti, among other reasons, Bonaparte's North American plans collapsed. To keep Louisiana out of British hands in an approaching war he sold it in April 1803 to the United States for $15 million.  British bankers financed the deal, taking American government bonds and shipping gold to Paris. The size of the United States was doubled without going to war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dlK8PIAJ5oC&pg=PA55|year=2009|pages=55\u201362|isbn=9780742565340}}</ref>\n\nBritain and France resumed their war in 1803, just after the Purchase. Both challenged American neutrality and tried to disrupt trade with its enemy. The presupposition was that small neutral nations could benefit from the wars of the great powers. Jefferson distrusted both Napoleon and Great Britain, but saw Britain (with its monarchism, aristocracy and great navy and position in Canada) as the more immediate threat to American interests. Therefore, he and Madison took a generally pro-French position and used the embargo to hurt British trade. Both Britain and France infringed on U.S. maritime rights. The British infringed more and also impressed thousands of American sailors into the Royal Navy; France never did anything like impressment.<ref>J. C. A. Stagg, ''The War of 1812'' (2012) pp 17-47</ref>  Jefferson signed the [[Embargo Act]] in 1807, which forbade all exports and imports. Designed to hurt the British, it hurt American commerce far more. The destructive Embargo Act, which had brought U.S. trade to a standstill, was rescinded in 1809, as Jefferson left office. Both Britain and France remained hostile to the United States. The [[War of 1812]] was the logical extension of the embargo program as the United States declared war on Britain. However, there was never any sense of being an ally of France and no effort was made to coordinate military activity.<ref>Lawrence S.

The U.S. inherited the [[French colonization of Texas|French claims]] to Texas, then in the 1819 [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] traded these (and a little of the Mississippi drainage itself) in return for American possession of Florida, where American settlers and the U.S. Army were already encroaching, and acquisition of Spain's weak claims to the Pacific Northwest.

The United States, in cooperation with Great Britain, issued the \"[[Monroe Doctrine]]\" in 1823 to keep European powers, especially Spain but also France, from seizing lands in the New World.  The French had a strong interest in expanding commercial opportunity in Latin America, especially as the Spanish role was faltering.  There was a desire among top French officials that some of the newly independent countries in Latin America might select a Bourbon king, but no actual operations ever took place.  French officials ignored the American position. France and Austria, two reactionary monarchies, strenuously opposed American republicanism and wanted the United States to have no voice whatsoever in European affairs.<ref>Dexter Perkins,  \"Europe, Spanish America, and the Monroe Doctrine.\" ''American Historical Review'' 27#2 (1922): 207-218.

France did pay European claims, but refused to pay the United States.  President Andrew Jackson was livid, In 1834 ordered the U.S. Navy to stand by and asked Congress for legislation.  Jackson's political opponents blocked any legislation.  France was annoyed but finally voted the money if the United States apologized.  Jackson refused to apologize, and diplomatic relations were broken off until in December 1835 Jackson did offer some friendlier words.  The British mediated, France paid the money, and cordial relations were resumed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Greg H.

During the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u20131871)|Siege of Paris]], the small American population, led by the U.S. Minister to France [[Elihu B.

From 1870 until 1918, France was the only major republic in Europe, which endeared it to the United States. Many French people held the United States in high esteem, as a land of opportunity and as a source of modern ideas. Few French people emigrated to the United States. Intellectuals, however, saw the United States as a land built on crass materialism, lacking in a significant culture, and boasting of its distrust of intellectuals. Very few self-styled French intellectuals were admirers.<ref>Barry Rubin and Judith Colp Rubin, ''Hating America: A History'' (2005) p 133.</ref>\n\nIn 1906, when Germany challenged French influence in [[Morocco]] (''see'' [[Tangier Crisis]] and [[Agadir Crisis]]), President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sided with the French.  However, as the Americans grew mightily in economic power, and forged closer ties with Britain, the French increasingly talked about an Anglo-Saxon threat to their culture.<ref>Philippe Roger, ''The American Enemy: The History of French Anti-Americanism'' (2005) pp 172-76.</ref>\n\nStudent exchange became an important factor, especially Americans going to France to study. The French were annoyed that so many Americans were going to Germany for post-graduate education, and discussed how to attract more Americans. After 1870, hundreds of American women traveled to France and Switzerland to obtain their medical degrees. The best American schools were closed to them and chose an expensive option superior to what they were allowed in the U.S.<ref>Thomas N.

The American troops were sent over without their heavy equipment (so that the ships could carry more soldiers). They used French artillery, airplanes and tanks, such as the [[SPAD XIII]] fighter biplane and [[Renault FT]] light tank serving in the aviation and armored formations of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] on the Western Front in 1918. In 1918 the United States sent over a million combat troops who were stationed to the south of the main French lines. They gave the Allies a decisive edge, as the Germans were unable to replace their heavy losses and lost their self-confidence by September 1918.<ref>Martin Marix-Evans, ''Retreat, Hell!

However, the two countries clashed over France's policy to weaken Germany and make it pay for the entire French war. The burning ambition of French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] was to ensure the security of France in the future; his formula was not friendship with Germany restitution, reparations, and guarantees. Clemenceau had little confidence in what he considered to be the unrealistic and utopian principles of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]: \"Even God was satisfied with [[Ten Commandments]], but Wilson insists on fourteen\" (a reference to Wilson's \"[[Fourteen Points]]\"). The two nations disagreed on debts, reparations, and restraints on Germany.\n\nClemenceau was also determined that a buffer state consisting of the German territory [[Rhineland|west of the Rhine River]] should be established under the aegis of France. In the eyes of the U.S. and British representatives, such a crass violation of the principle of self-determination would only breed future wars, and a compromise was therefore offered Clemenceau, which he accepted. The territory in question was to be occupied by Allied troops for a period of five to fifteen years, and a zone extending fifty kilometers east of the Rhine was to be demilitarized. Wilson and British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] agreed that the United States and Great Britain, by treaty, would guarantee France against German aggression.  Republican leaders in Washington were willing to support a security treaty with France. It failed because Wilson insisted on linking it to the Versailles Treaty, which the Republicans would not accept without certain amendments Wilson refused to allow.<ref>Lloyd E. Ambrosius, \"Wilson, The Republicans, and French Security after World War I,\" ''Journal of American History'' (1972) 59#2 pp 341\u2013352 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1890194 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nWhile French historian Duruoselle portrays Clemenceau as wiser than Wilson, and equally compassionate and committed to justice but one who understood that world peace and order depended on the permanent suppression of the German threat.<ref>Jean-Baptiste Duroselle, ''France and the United States'' (1978)</ref> Blumenthal (1986), by contrast, says Wilson's policies were far sounder than the harsh terms demanded by Clemenceau. Blumenthal agrees with Wilson that peace and prosperity required Germany's full integration into the world economic and political community as an equal partner.  One result was that in the 1920s the French deeply distrusted the Americans, who were loaning money to Germany (which Germany used to pay its reparations to France and other Allies), while demanding that France repay its war loans from Washington.<ref>Zahniser, 1987</ref><ref>Melvyn Leffler, ''The Elusive Quest: America's Pursuit of European Stability and French Security, 1919-1933'' (1979) [https://www.amazon.com/Elusive-Quest-Americas-Stability-1919-1933/dp/0807813338/ excerpt and text search]</ref><ref>Stephen Schuker, ''The End of French Predominance in Europe: The Financial Crisis of 1924 and the Adoption of the Dawes Plan'' (1976) [https://www.amazon.com/End-French-Predominance-Europe-Financial/dp/1597403989/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n== Interwar years (1919\u201338) ==\n[[File:French ambassador's residence.JPG|thumb|The French ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C.

Beginning in the 1920s, U.S. intellectuals, painters, writers, and tourists were drawn to French art, literature, philosophy, theatre, cinema, fashion, wines, and cuisine.\n\nA number of American artists, such as [[Josephine Baker]], experienced popular success in France. Paris was also quite welcoming to American [[jazz]] music and black artists in particular, as France, unlike a significant part of the United States at the time, had no racial discrimination laws. Numerous writers such as [[William Faulkner]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and others were deeply influenced by their experiences of French life.  Known as the [[Lost Generation]], their time in Paris was documented by Hemingway in his memoir ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''.\n\nHowever, [[anti-Americanism]] came of age in the 1920s, as many French traditionalists were alarmed at the power of Hollywood and warned that America represented modernity, which in turn threatened traditional [[Culture of France|French values]], customs, and popular literature.<ref>David Strauss, \"The Rise of Anti-Americanism In France: French Intellectuals and the American Film Industry, 1927\u20131932,\" ''Journal of Popular Culture'' (177) 10#4 pp 752\u2013759\n</ref> The alarm of American influence escalated half a century later when Americans opened a $4 billion [[Disneyland Paris]] theme park in 1992.

Most of these branches were soon the leading local agencies, as in Britain and Germany, JWT-Paris did poorly from the late 1920s through the early 1960s. The causes included cultural clashes between the French and Americans and subtle anti-Americanism among potential clients.

Its provisions were incorporated into the [[United Nations Charter]] and other treaties and it became a stepping stone to a more activist American policy.<ref>Harold Josephson, \"Outlawing War: Internationalism and the Pact Of Paris,\" ''Diplomatic History'' (1979) 3#4 pp. 377\u2013390.</ref>  Diplomatic intercourse was minimal under Franklin D.

The successful performance of German warplanes during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339) suddenly forced France to realize its military inferiority.  Germany had better warplanes,  more of them, pilots with wartime experience in Spain, and much more efficient factories. President Roosevelt had long been interested in France, and was a personal friend of French Senator, Baron Amaury de La Grange. In late 1937 he told Roosevelt about the French weaknesses, and asked for military help. Roosevelt was forthcoming, and forced the War Department to secretly sell the most modern American airplanes to France.<ref>John McVickar Haight, \"Roosevelt as Friend of France.\" ''Foreign Affairs'' 44.3 (1966): 518-526.

France and Britain declared war on Germany when it invaded Poland in September 1939, but there was little action until the following spring.

France was forced to accept German terms and a pro-fascist dictatorship took over in [[Vichy France]].<ref>J.

This led the Roosevelt administration to maintain diplomatic relations. FDR appointed his close associate Admiral [[William D. Leahy]] as ambassador. The Vichy regime was officially neutral but it was helping Germany. The United States severed diplomatic relations in late 1942 when Germany took direct control of areas that Vichy had ruled, and Vichy France became a Nazi [[puppet state]].<ref>William L. Langer, ''Our Vichy Gamble'' (1947)</ref> More recently, Hurstfield (1986) concluded that Roosevelt, not the State Department, had made the decision, thereby deflecting criticism from leftwing elements of his coalition onto the hapless State Department. When the experiment ended FDR brought Leahy back to Washington as his top military advisor and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.<ref>Phillips Payson O'Brien, ''The Second Most Powerful Man in the World: The Life of Admiral William D.

After Normandy the Americans and the Allies knew it was only a matter of time before the Nazis lost. Eisenhower did give De Gaulle his word that Paris would be liberated by the French as the Americans had no interest in Paris, a city they considered lacking tactical value. It was therefore easy for Eisenhower to let De Gaulle's FFI take the charge. There was one important aspect of Paris that did seem to matter to everyone: it was its historical and cultural significance. Hitler had given the order to bomb and burn Paris to the ground; he wanted to make it a second [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]. The Americans and the Allies could not let this happen.<ref name=\"historynet.com\">[http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-the-liberation-of-paris.htm].

Patton]] was at the command of the U.S. Third Army that swept across northern France. It campaigned in Lorraine for some time, but it was one of the least successful of Patton's career. While in Lorraine, he annexed the Maj. Gen. Phillipe Leclerc's battalion into his army.<ref name=\"historynet.com\"/> Leclerc did not respect his American counterparts because like the British he thought that they were new to the war. Therefore, he thought the Americans did not know what they were doing on the field. After being more trouble than help Patton let Leclerc go for Paris. The French then went on to liberate Paris from the east while the 4th U.S. Infantry (originally part of Patton's Army) came from the west. Because of Eisenhower's deal with De Gaulle, the Liberation was left to the French's 2nd armored division.<ref name=\"historynet.com\" /><ref name=\"rfi.fr\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapage.noos.fr/liberation_de_paris2/maincourante252.htm |title=19-25 ao\u00fbt 1944...

'' (1965)</ref>\n\n===Roosevelt opposes French colonies in Asia===\nRoosevelt was strongly committed to terminating European colonialism in Asia, especially French Indochina. He wanted to put it under an international trusteeship. He wanted the United States to work closely with China to become the policeman for the region and stabilize it; the U.S. would provide suitable financing. The scheme was directly contrary to the plans of the Free French; de Gaulle had a grand vision of the French overseas empire as the base for his return to defeat Vichy France. Roosevelt could not abide de Gaulle, but Winston Churchill realized that Britain needed French help to reestablish its position in Europe after the war. He and the British foreign office decided to work closely with de Gaulle to achieve that goal, and therefore they had to abandon Roosevelt's decolonization scheme. In doing so, they had considerable support from like-minded American officials. The basic weakness of Roosevelt's scheme was its dependence on [[Chiang Kai-shek]] the ruler of China. Chiang's regime virtually collapsed under Japanese pressure in 1944, and Japan overran the American airbases that were built to attack Japan. The Pentagon's plans to use China as a base to destroy Japan collapsed, so the U.S. Air Force turned its attention to attacking Japan with very long-range B-29 bombers based in the Pacific. The American military no longer needed China or Southeast Asia, and China was too weak to be a policeman. With the defeat of Japan, Britain took over Southeast Asia and returned Indochina to France. Roosevelt realized his trusteeship plan was dead and accepted the British-French actions as necessary to stabilize Southeast Asia.<ref>Walter LaFeber, \"Roosevelt, Churchill, and Indochina: 1942-45\" ''American Historical Review'' (1975) 80#5 pp 1277-1295. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1852060 online]</ref>\n\n== Postwar years ==\nIn the postwar years, both cooperation and discord persisted. After de Gaulle left office in January 1946, the logjam was broken in terms of financial aid.  Lend Lease had barely restarted when it was unexpectedly ended in August 1945. The U.S.  Army shipped in food, 1944-46. U.S. Treasury loans and cash grants were given in 1945-47, and especially the Marshall Plan gave large sums (1948\u201351). There was post-Marshall aid (1951\u201355) designed to help France rearm and provide massive support for its war in Indochina. Apart from low-interest loans, the other funds were grants that did not involve repayment.  The debts left over from World War I, whose payment had been suspended since 1931, was renegotiated in the [[Blum-Byrnes agreement]] of 1946. The United States forgave all $2.8 billion in debt from the First World War, and gave France a new loan of $650 million. In return French negotiator [[Jean Monnet]] set out the French five-year plan for recovery and development.<ref>{{cite book|author=Irwin M.

The Marshall Plan set up intensive tours of American industry.  France sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories, farms, stores and offices.

[[Charles de Gaulle]] brought stability to the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] starting in 1958, but Eisenhower was still hesitant to assist in the nuclearization of France. De Gaulle wanted to challenge the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on Western weapons by having his own ''[[Force de frappe]].'' Eisenhower feared his grandiose plans to use the bombs to restore French grandeur would weaken NATO.  Furthermore, Eisenhower wanted to discourage the proliferation of nuclear arms anywhere.<ref>Keith W. Baum,  \"Two's Company, Three's a Crowd: The Eisenhower Administration, France, and Nuclear Weapons.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 20#2 (1990): 315-328. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27550617 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nCharles de Gaulle also quarreled with Washington over the admission of Britain into the [[European Economic Community]]. These and other tensions led to de Gaulle's decision in 1966 to withdraw French forces from the integrated military structure of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] and forced it to move its headquarters to Belgium.  De Gaulle's foreign policy was centered on an attempt to limit the power and influence of both superpowers, which would increase France's international prestige in relative terms. De Gaulle hoped to move France from being a follower of the United States to a leading first-world power with a large following among certain [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] [[Third World]] countries. The nations de Gaulle considered potential participants in this grouping were those in France's traditional spheres of influence, Africa and the Middle East.<ref>Robert O. Paxton and Nicholas Wahl, eds. ''De Gaulle and the United States: a centennial reappraisal'' (Berg Publishers, 1994).</ref>\n\nThe two nations differed over the waging of the [[Vietnam War]], in part because French leaders were convinced that the United States could not win. The recent French experience with the [[Algerian War of Independence]] was that it was impossible, in the long run, for a democracy to impose by force a government over a foreign population without considerable manpower and probably the use of unacceptable methods such as torture. The French popular view of the United States worsened at the same period, as it came to be seen as an imperialist power.<ref>Yuko Torikata,  \"Reexamining de Gaulle's peace initiative on the Vietnam War.\" ''Diplomatic History'' 31.5 (2007): 909-938.</ref><ref>Marianna P.

Small tensions reappeared intermittently. France, more strongly than any other nation, has seen the [[European Union]] as a method of counterbalancing American power, and thus works towards such ends as having the Euro challenge the preeminent position of the United States dollar in global trade and developing a European defense initiative as an alternative to [[NATO]]. Overall, the United States had much closer relations with the other large European powers, Great Britain, Germany and Italy. In the 1980s the two nations cooperated on some international matters but disagreed sharply on others, such as [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]] and the desirability of a [[German reunification|reunified Germany]]. The Reagan administration did its best efforts to prevent France and other European countries from buying natural gas from Russia, through the construction of the [[Urengoy\u2013Pomary\u2013Uzhgorod pipeline|Siberia-Europe pipeline]]. The European governments, including the French, were undeterred and the pipeline was finally built.<ref>Philip Zelikow and Condoleezza Rice, eds., ''Germany unified and Europe transformed: a study in statecraft'' (Harvard UP, 1995).</ref>\n\n==Anti-Americanism==\n{{Main|Anti-Americanism#France}}\nRichard Kuisel, an American scholar, has explored how France partly embraced American consumerism while rejecting much of American values and power.  He writes in 2013:\n\n{{quote|America functioned as the \"other\" in configuring French identity. To be French was not to be American. Americans were conformists, materialists, racists, violent, and vulgar. The French were individualists, idealists, tolerant, and civilized. Americans adored wealth; the French worshiped ''la douceur de vivre.'' This caricature of America, which was already broadly endorsed at the beginning of the century, served to essentialize French national identity. At the end of the twentieth century, the French strategy [was to use] America as a foil, as a way of defining themselves as well as everything from their social policies to their notion of what constituted culture.<ref>Richard Kuisel, \"The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power,\" ''H-France Forum'' (Spring 2013) 8#4 pp 41-45 [http://www.h-france.net/forum/forumvol8/Kuisel5.pdf online], referencing his major book, ''The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power'' (2012) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sm7n online]</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Kuisel identifies several strong pull effects:\n\n{{quote|American products often carried a representational or symbolic quality. They encoded messages like modernity, youthfulness, rebellion, transgression, status, and freedom ... There was the linkage with political and economic power: historically culture has followed power. Thus Europeans learned English because it is a necessary skill in a globalized environment featuring American technology, education, and business. Similarly the size and power of U.S. multinationals, like that of the global giant Coca-Cola, helped American products win market shares. Finally, it must be acknowledged, that there has been something inherently appealing about what we make and sell. Europeans liked Broadway musicals, TV shows, and fashions. We know how to make and market what others want.<ref>Kuisel, pp 43-44.</ref>}}\n\n== Middle East conflict ==\nFrance under President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] supported the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]] in Iraq as a major participant under [[Operation Daguet]]. The French [[Assemblee Nationale]] even took the \"unprecedented decision\" to place all French forces in the Gulf under United States command for the duration of the war.<ref>Reynolds, David One World Divisible: A Global History Since 1945. 2000. New York: W.W.Norton and Co. p. 588</ref>\n\n===9-11===\n{{Further|September 11 attacks|War on terror}}\nAll the left and right wing political elements in France strongly denounced the barbaric acts of the [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists in the 9/11 attack in 2001.  President [[Jacques Chirac]] \u2014later known for his frosty relationship with President [[George W. Bush]]\u2014ordered the [[French secret services]] to collaborate closely with U.S. intelligence, and created [[Alliance Base]] in Paris, a joint-intelligence service center charged with enacting the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s [[War on Terror]].  However, all the political elements rejected the idea of a full-scale war against Islamic radical terrorism. Memories of the Algerian war, and its disastrous impact on French internal affairs, as well as more distant memories of its own failed Indochina/Vietnam war, played a major role. Furthermore, France had to deal with a large Islamic population of its own, which Chirac could not afford to alienate.  As a consequence, France refused to support any American military efforts in the Middle East. Numerous works by French novelists and film makers criticized the American efforts to transform the 9/11 terrorist attacks into a justification for war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bill Marshall, ed.|title=France and the Americas, vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfq5Tp0nq98C&pg=PA881|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=878\u201383|isbn=9781851094110}}</ref><ref>Carl Cavanagh Hodge, \"Old wine and old bottles: anti-Americanism in Britain, France and Germany.\" ''Journal of Transatlantic Studies'' 7.2 (2009): 148-162.</ref>\n\n===Iraq War===\n\nIn March 2003 France, along with Germany, China, and Russia, opposed the proposed UN resolution that would have authorized a U.S. [[Invasion of Iraq (2003)|invasion of Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/11/sprj.irq.main/ |title=CNN.com \u2013 White House all but concedes U.N. defeat \u2013 Mar. 12, 2003 |accessdate=2008-12-17 | date=2003-03-11}}</ref> During the run-up to the war, French foreign minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] emerged as a prominent critic of the American Iraq policies.

This contributed to the perception of the French as uncooperative and unsympathetic in American popular opinion at the time. This perception was quite strong and persisted despite the fact that France was and had been for some time a major ally in the campaign in Afghanistan (see for example the [[French forces in Afghanistan]]) where both nations (among others in the US-led coalition) were dedicated to the removal of the rogue Taliban, and the subsequent stabilization of Afghanistan, a recognized training ground and safe haven for terrorists intent on carrying out attacks in the Western world.\n\nAs the Iraq War progressed, relations between the two nations began to improve.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on'' ''the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had grown weary of his character Sherlock Holmes.

However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Three Act Tragedy|last=Christie, Agatha|date=2018|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nAnticipating the publication of ''Curtain'', Poirot became the first fictional character to be covered on the front page of ''The New York Times'' when his obituary was printed there on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|last=Hobbs|first=JD|date=6 August 1975|website=|publisher=Poirot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=11 April 2020|place=USA}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new\".<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\").

While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a solid background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up-to-date at Torquay Hospital.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|235,470}}\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons \u2026 These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories\".<ref name=\":11\" /> There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists and scientists, na\u00efve or suspicious, in Christie's future: ''Murder in Mesopotamia'', ''Cards on the Table'', ''The Pale Horse'', and ''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', among numerous others.\n\nGillian Gill also notes that the murder method in Christie's very first detective novel, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|34}} In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths \u2026 I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Agatha Christie: \u2018Queen of Crime\u2019 Is a Gentlewoman|date=8 March 1970|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url-status=live|page=60, quoted in Gerald (1993), p. 4.}}</ref> With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under [[Ronald Knox]]'s \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".<ref name=\":12\" />{{Rp|58}} Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, thallium, and many other standard pharmaceuticals were utilised to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades. \n\n===Archaeology===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 30%|\n| source = \n| quote = The lure of the past came up to grab me.

She met her second husband, Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dever|first=Norma|date=2004|title=They Also Dug!

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals==\nChristie has been portrayed in film and television. Biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie.

Among her earliest memories were those of reading the children's books written by [[Mary Louisa Molesworth|Mrs Molesworth]], including ''The Adventures of Herr Baby'' (1881), ''Christmas Tree Land'' (1897), and ''The Magic Nuts'' (1898). She also read the work of [[Edith Nesbit]], including ''[[The Story of the Treasure Seekers]]'' (1899), ''[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]'' (1903), and ''[[The Railway Children]]'' (1906). When a little older, she moved on to reading the surreal verse of [[Edward Lear]] and [[Lewis Carroll]].<ref name=\"Morgan1984\"/>{{rp|18\u201319}} In April 1901, at age 10, she wrote her first poem, \"The cowslip\".<ref name=\"film\">{{cite av media|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 A Trip With David Suchet (Directed by Claire Lewins)|publisher=Testimony films (for ITV)}}</ref>\n\nAlthough she devoted much time to her pets, Christie spent much of her childhood apart from other children.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Three Act Tragedy|last=Christie, Agatha|date=2018|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nAnticipating the publication of ''Curtain'', Poirot became the first fictional character to be covered on the front page of ''The New York Times'' when his obituary was printed there on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|last=Hobbs|first=JD|date=6 August 1975|website=|publisher=Poirot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=11 April 2020|place=USA}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new\".<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\").

She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed in film and television. Biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).

{"title_page": "Original antigenic sin", "text_new": "[[File:Original Antigenic Sin.jpg|thumb|400px|'''The original antigenic sin:''' When the body first encounters an infection it produces effective antibodies against its '''dominant [[antigen]]s''' and thus eliminates the infection. But when it encounters the same infection, at a later evolved stage, with a '''new dominant antigen''', with the original antigen now being recessive, the immune system will still produce the former antibodies against this old \"now recessive antigen\" and not develop new antibodies against the new dominant one, this results in the production of ineffective antibodies and thus a weak immunity.]]\n\n'''Original antigenic sin''', also known as the '''Hoskins effect''',<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/01/transcripts/3769t1.rtf FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Vaccines and Related Biological Products: Advisory Committee]([[Rich Text Format|RTF]])</ref> refers to the propensity of the body's [[immune system]] to preferentially utilize [[immunity (medical)|immunological memory]] based on a previous [[infection]] when a second slightly different version of that foreign entity (e.g. a [[virus]] or [[bacterium]]) is encountered.  This leaves the immune system \"trapped\" by the first response it has made to each [[antigen]], and unable to mount potentially more effective responses during subsequent infections. The phenomenon of original antigenic sin has been described in relation to [[influenza virus]], [[dengue fever]], [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), and to several other viruses.<ref>Deem, Michael W.[http://www.mwdeem.rice.edu/mwdeem/ ''The Adaptive Immune Response''] Rice University</ref>\n\nThis phenomenon was first described in 1960 by Thomas Francis, Jr. in the article \"On the Doctrine of Original Antigenic Sin\".<ref name=Francis>{{cite journal | author = Thomas Francis Jr | year = 1960 | title = On the doctrine of original antigenic sin | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 104 | issue = 6| pages = 572\u2013578 | jstor=985534}}</ref><ref name=Krause>{{cite journal | author = Krause R | year = 2006 | title = The swine flu episode and the fog of epidemics | url = | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 40\u201343 | doi = 10.3201/eid1201.051132 | pmid = 16494715 | pmc=3291407}}</ref>  It is named by analogy to the [[theological]] concept of [[original sin]]. According to Thomas Francis, who originally described the idea,<ref name=Francis /> and cited by Richard Krause:<ref name=Krause />\n\n<blockquote>\"The antibody of childhood is largely a response to dominant antigen of the virus causing the first type A influenza infection of the lifetime. [...] The imprint established by the original virus infection governs the antibody response thereafter. This we have called the Doctrine of the Original Antigenic Sin.\"</blockquote>\n\n==In B cells==\n[[Image:Original antigenic sin.svg|thumb|200px|right|A high affinity memory B cell, specific for Virus A, is preferentially activated by a new strain, Virus A<sup>1</sup>, to produce antibodies that ineffectively bind to the A<sup>1</sup> strain. The presence of these antibodies inhibits activation of a naive B cell that produces more effective antibodies against Virus A<sup>1</sup>. This effect leads to a diminished immune response against Virus A<sup>1</sup>, and heightens the potential for serious infection.]]\n\nDuring a primary [[infection]], long-lived [[memory B cell]]s are generated, which remain in the body, and provide protection from subsequent infections.  These memory B cells respond to specific [[epitopes]] on the surface of viral proteins in order to produce antigen-specific [[antibodies]], and are able to respond to infection much faster than B cells are able to respond to novel antigens. This effect shortens the amount of time required to clear subsequent infections.\n\nBetween primary and secondary infections, or following [[vaccination]], a virus may undergo [[antigenic drift]], in which the viral surface proteins (the epitopes) are altered through natural mutation, allowing the virus to escape the immune system. When this happens, the altered virus preferentially reactivates previously activated high-affinity memory B cells and spur antibody production.  However, the antibodies produced by these B cells generally ineffectively bind to the altered [[epitopes]]. In addition, these antibodies inhibit the activation of higher-affinity naive [[B cells]] that ''would'' be able to make more effective antibodies to the second virus.  This leads to a less effective immune response and recurrent infections may take longer to clear.<ref name=Lambert>{{cite journal | author = Lambert PH, Liu M, Siegrist CA | year = 2005 | title = Can successful vaccines teach us how to induce efficient protective immune responses? | url = | journal = Nat Med | volume = 11| issue = 4 Suppl| pages = S54\u201362| doi = 10.1038/nm1216 | pmid = 15812491 }}</ref>\n\nOriginal antigenic sin is of particular importance in the application of [[vaccines]].<ref name=Choi>{{cite journal|first1=Yoon Seok |last1=Choi |first2=Yun Hee |last2=Baek |first3=Wonseok |last3=Kang |first4=Seung Joo |last4=Nam |first5=Jino |last5=Lee |first6=Sooseong |last6=You |first7=Dong-Yeop |last7=Chang |first8=Jong-Chan |last8=Youn |first9=Young Ki |last9=Choi |first10=Eui-Cheol |last10=Shin |displayauthors=3 |title=Reduced Antibody Responses to the Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Vaccine after Recent Seasonal Influenza Vaccination|journal=Clinical and Vaccine Immunology|date=September 2011|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1519\u20131523|doi=10.1128/CVI.05053-11|pmc=3165229 |pmid=21813667}}</ref> In [[dengue fever]], the effect of original antigenic sin has important implications for vaccine development.

This leaves the immune system \"trapped\" by the first response it has made to each [[antigen]], and unable to mount potentially more effective responses during subsequent infections. The phenomenon of original antigenic sin has been described in relation to [[influenza virus]], [[dengue fever]], [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), and to several other viruses.<ref>Deem, Michael W.[http://www.mwdeem.rice.edu/mwdeem/ ''The Adaptive Immune Response''] Rice University</ref>\n\nThis phenomenon was first described in 1960 by Thomas Francis, Jr. in the article \"On the Doctrine of Original Antigenic Sin\".<ref name=Francis>{{cite journal | author = Thomas Francis Jr | year = 1960 | title = On the doctrine of original antigenic sin | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 104 | issue = 6| pages = 572\u2013578 | jstor=985534}}</ref><ref name=Krause>{{cite journal | author = Krause R | year = 2006 | title = The swine flu episode and the fog of epidemics | url = | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 40\u201343 | doi = 10.3201/eid1201.051132 | pmid = 16494715 | pmc=3291407}}</ref>  It is named by analogy to the [[theological]] concept of [[original sin]]. According to Thomas Francis, who originally described the idea,<ref name=Francis /> and cited by Richard Krause:<ref name=Krause />\n\n<blockquote>\"The antibody of childhood is largely a response to dominant antigen of the virus causing the first type A influenza infection of the lifetime. [...] The imprint established by the original virus infection governs the antibody response thereafter. This we have called the Doctrine of the Original Antigenic Sin.\"</blockquote>\n\n==In B cells==\n[[Image:Original antigenic sin.svg|thumb|200px|right|A high affinity memory B cell, specific for Virus A, is preferentially activated by a new strain, Virus A<sup>1</sup>, to produce antibodies that ineffectively bind to the A<sup>1</sup> strain. The presence of these antibodies inhibits activation of a naive B cell that produces more effective antibodies against Virus A<sup>1</sup>. This effect leads to a diminished immune response against Virus A<sup>1</sup>, and heightens the potential for serious infection.]]\n\nDuring a primary [[infection]], long-lived [[memory B cell]]s are generated, which remain in the body, and provide protection from subsequent infections.  These memory B cells respond to specific [[epitopes]] on the surface of viral proteins in order to produce antigen-specific [[antibodies]], and are able to respond to infection much faster than B cells are able to respond to novel antigens. This effect shortens the amount of time required to clear subsequent infections.\n\nBetween primary and secondary infections, or following [[vaccination]], a virus may undergo [[antigenic drift]], in which the viral surface proteins (the epitopes) are altered through natural mutation, allowing the virus to escape the immune system. When this happens, the altered virus preferentially reactivates previously activated high-affinity memory B cells and spur antibody production.  However, the antibodies produced by these B cells generally ineffectively bind to the altered [[epitopes]]. In addition, these antibodies inhibit the activation of higher-affinity naive [[B cells]] that ''would'' be able to make more effective antibodies to the second virus.  This leads to a less effective immune response and recurrent infections may take longer to clear.<ref name=Lambert>Lambert PH, Liu M, Siegrist CA (2005). \"Can successful vaccines teach us how to induce efficient protective immune responses?\".

Due to the anatomy of the human [[pharynx]], [[larynx]], and [[esophagus]] and the circumstances for which ventilation is needed, additional measures are often required to secure the [[Artificial airway|airway]] during positive-pressure ventilation in order to allow unimpeded passage of air into the trachea and avoid air passing into the esophagus and stomach. The common method is by [[Artificial airway|insertion of a tube into the trachea]]: intubation, which provides a clear route for the air. This can be either an [[tracheal tube|endotracheal tube]], inserted through the natural openings of mouth or nose, or a [[tracheostomy]] inserted through an artificial opening in the neck. In other circumstances simple [[Airway management#Airway maneuvers|airway maneuvres]], an [[oropharyngeal airway]] or [[laryngeal mask airway]] may be employed.

This style of ventilator often provides greater control of a wide variety of ventilation parameters (such as inspiratory rise time).  Many ICU ventilators also incorporate graphics to provide visual feedback of each breath.\n#Neonatal ventilators ([[Bubble CPAP]]{{what|date=April 2020}})\u2014Designed with the preterm neonate in mind, these are a specialized subset of ICU ventilators that are designed to deliver the smaller, more precise volumes and pressures required to ventilate these patients.\n#[[Positive airway pressure]] ventilators (PAP) \u2014 These ventilators are specifically designed for [[non-invasive ventilation]].

Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and was the beginning of [[modern ventilation therapy]]. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a [[tracheostomy]] tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nPositive-pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the [[tidal volume]] \u2014 the breath-out through passive exhalation.\n\n====Negative pressure machines====\n[[Image:Poumon artificiel.jpg|thumb|An iron lung]]\n{{main|Negative pressure ventilator}}\nNegative pressure mechanical ventilators are produced in small, field-type and larger formats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The prominent design of the smaller devices is known as the [[cuirass]], a shell-like unit used to create negative pressure only to the chest using a combination of a fitting shell and a soft bladder.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{efn|1=The early types of these were prone to falling off and caused severe chafing, and so were not used as a long-term devices.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}}} In recent years this device has been manufactured using various-sized [[polycarbonate]] shells with multiple seals, and a high-pressure [[oscillation pump]] in order to carry out [[biphasic cuirass ventilation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Its main use has been in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The latter, larger formats are in use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in [[England]] such as [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital|John Radcliffe]] in [[Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} \n\nThe larger units have their origin in the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], also known as the Drinker and Shaw tank, which was developed in 1929 and was one of the first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the [[polio]] [[epidemic]] that struck the world in the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The machine is, in effect, a large elongated [[tank]], which encases the patient up to the neck.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The neck is sealed with a rubber [[gasket]] so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} While the exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by [[diffusion]] and requires no external work, air must be moved into and out of the [[human lung|lungs]] to make it available to the [[gas exchange]] process.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In spontaneous breathing, a negative pressure is created in the [[pleural cavity]] by the muscles of respiration, and the resulting gradient between the [[atmospheric pressure]] and the pressure inside the [[human thorax|thorax]] generates a flow of air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the iron lung by means of a pump, the air is withdrawn mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure, and the elastic coil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities. There are large portholes for nurse or home assistant access.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The patients can talk and eat normally, and can see the world through a well-placed series of mirrors. Some could remain in these iron lungs for years at a time quite successfully.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==== Intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator ====\nAnother type is the ''intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator'' that applies pressure externally via an inflated bladder, forcing exhalation, sometimes termed [[exsufflation]].

Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or by the ventilator based on the set breath rate and mode of ventilation.\n\n==== Cycle ====\nThe cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase.  Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached, which is a primary strategy in [[pressure regulated volume control]].\n\n==== Limit ====\nLimit is how the breath is controlled. Breaths may be limited to a set maximum circuit\npressure or a set maximum flow.\n\n=== Breath exhalation ===\nExhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive. The ventilator's expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure ([[PEEP]]) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.\n\n== Weaning from mechanical ventilation ==\nTiming of withdrawal from mechanical ventilation\u2014also known as weaning\u2014should be carefully considered. Patients should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal if they are able to support their own ventilation and oxygenation, and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.\n\nThe [[Rapid Shallow Breathing Index]] (RSBI, the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously referred to as the \"Tobin Index\" after Dr. Martin Tobin of [[Loyola University Medical Center]]) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 97%, 64%, 78%, 95% respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang KL, Tobin MJ |title=A prospective study of indexes predicting the outcome of trials of weaning from mechanical ventilation |journal=N.

There are also monitors that work independently of the ventilator which allow for measuring patients after the ventilator has been removed, such as a [[tracheal tube |T tube test]].\n\n==Artificial airways as a connection to the ventilator==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Artificial airway}}\nThere are various procedures and mechanical devices that provide protection against airway collapse, air leakage, and [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]:\n* [[Respirator|Face mask]] \u2014 In resuscitation and for minor procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient to achieve a seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or by the use of ''nasopharyngeal'' or ''[[oropharyngeal airway]]''. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the [[pharynx]] through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for [[non-invasive ventilation]] in conscious patients. A full-face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration. [[Non-invasive ventilation]] can be considered for epidemics of [[COVID-19]] where sufficient invasive ventilation capacity is not available (or in some milder cases) but pressurized protection suits for caregivers are recommended due to the risks of poorly fitting masks emitting contaminating aerosols.<ref> {{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy S, Gomersall CD, Fowler RA |title=Care for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 |journal=JAMA |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=2020-03-11 |doi=10.1001/jama.2020.3633 |pmid=32159735 |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.3633}}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheal intubation]]'' is often performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the [[nasopharynx]] or [[oropharynx]] and [[subglottic stenosis]].\n* ''[[Supraglottic airway]]'' \u2014 a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any airway device that is seated above and outside the trachea, as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the [[laryngeal mask airway]] (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook T, Howes B |title=Supraglottic airway devices: recent advances |journal=Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=56\u201361 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkq058 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/56.full}}</ref> There are many types of SGAs available including the [[Combitube|Esophageal-tracheal Combitube]] (ETC), [[Laryngeal tube]] (LT), and the obsolete [[Esophageal obturator airway]] (EOA).\n*''[[Cricothyrotomy]]'' \u2014 Patients requiring emergency airway management, in whom tracheal intubation has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical opening in the [[cricothyroid membrane]].

A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Tracheostomy tubes are well tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs.

Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and was the beginning of [[modern ventilation therapy]]. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a [[tracheostomy]] tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nPositive-pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the [[tidal volume]] \u2014 the breath-out through passive exhalation.\n\n====Negative pressure machines====\n[[Image:Poumon artificiel.jpg|thumb|An iron lung]]\n{{main|Negative pressure ventilator}}\nNegative pressure mechanical ventilators are produced in small, field-type and larger formats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The prominent design of the smaller devices is known as the [[cuirass]], a shell-like unit used to create negative pressure only to the chest using a combination of a fitting shell and a soft bladder.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{efn|1=The early types of these were prone to falling off and caused severe chafing, and so were not used as a long-term devices.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}}} In recent years this device has been manufactured using various-sized [[polycarbonate]] shells with multiple seals, and a high-pressure [[oscillation pump]] in order to carry out [[biphasic cuirass ventilation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Its main use has been in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The latter, larger formats are in use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in [[England]] such as [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital|John Radcliffe]] in [[Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} \n\nThe larger units have their origin in the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], also known as the Drinker and Shaw tank, which was developed in 1929 and was one of the first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the [[polio]] [[epidemic]] that struck the world in the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The machine is, in effect, a large elongated [[tank]], which encases the patient up to the neck.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The neck is sealed with a rubber [[gasket]] so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} While the exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by [[diffusion]] and requires no external work, air must be moved into and out of the [[human lung|lungs]] to make it available to the [[gas exchange]] process.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In spontaneous breathing, a negative pressure is created in the [[pleural cavity]] by the muscles of respiration, and the resulting gradient between the [[atmospheric pressure]] and the pressure inside the [[human thorax|thorax]] generates a flow of air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the iron lung by means of a pump, the air is withdrawn mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure, and the elastic coil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities.

Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or by the ventilator based on the set breath rate and mode of ventilation.\n\n==== Cycle ====\nThe cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase.  Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached, which is a primary strategy in [[pressure regulated volume control]].\n\n==== Limit ====\nLimit is how the breath is controlled. Breaths may be limited to a set maximum circuit\npressure or a set maximum flow.\n\n=== Breath exhalation ===\nExhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive. The ventilator's expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure ([[PEEP]]) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.\n\n== Weaning from mechanical ventilation ==\nTiming of withdrawal from mechanical ventilation\u2014also known as weaning\u2014should be carefully considered. Patients should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal if they are able to support their own ventilation and oxygenation, and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.\n\nThe [[Rapid Shallow Breathing Index]] (RSBI, the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously referred to as the \"Tobin Index\" after Dr. Martin Tobin of [[Loyola University Medical Center]]) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 97%, 64%, 78%, 95% respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang KL, Tobin MJ |title=A prospective study of indexes predicting the outcome of trials of weaning from mechanical ventilation |journal=N.

In patients who have diffused loss of aeration, PEEP can be used provided it does not cause the plateau pressure to rise above the upper inflection point.\n\nMost modern ventilators have basic monitoring tools. There are also monitors that work independently of the ventilator which allow for measuring patients after the ventilator has been removed, such as a [[tracheal tube |T tube test]].\n\n==Artificial airways as a connection to the ventilator==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Artificial airway}}\nThere are various procedures and mechanical devices that provide protection against airway collapse, air leakage, and [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]:\n* [[Respirator|Face mask]] \u2014 In resuscitation and for minor procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient to achieve a seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or by the use of ''nasopharyngeal'' or ''[[oropharyngeal airway]]''. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the [[pharynx]] through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for [[non-invasive ventilation]] in conscious patients. A full-face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration. [[Non-invasive ventilation]] can be considered for epidemics of [[COVID-19]] where sufficient invasive ventilation capacity is not available (or in some milder cases) but pressurized protection suits for caregivers are recommended due to the risks of poorly fitting masks emitting contaminating aerosols.<ref> {{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy S, Gomersall CD, Fowler RA |title=Care for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 |journal=JAMA |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=2020-03-11 |doi=10.1001/jama.2020.3633 |pmid=32159735 |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.3633}}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheal intubation]]'' is often performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the [[nasopharynx]] or [[oropharynx]] and [[subglottic stenosis]].\n* ''[[Supraglottic airway]]'' \u2014 a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any airway device that is seated above and outside the trachea, as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the [[laryngeal mask airway]] (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook T, Howes B |title=Supraglottic airway devices: recent advances |journal=Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=56\u201361 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkq058 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/56.full}}</ref> There are many types of SGAs available including the [[Combitube|Esophageal-tracheal Combitube]] (ETC), [[Laryngeal tube]] (LT), and the obsolete [[Esophageal obturator airway]] (EOA).\n*''[[Cricothyrotomy]]'' \u2014 Patients requiring emergency airway management, in whom tracheal intubation has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical opening in the [[cricothyroid membrane]]. This is similar to a [[tracheostomy]] but a [[cricothyrotomy]] is reserved for emergency access.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carley SD, Gwinnutt C, Butler J, Sammy I, Driscoll P |title=Rapid sequence induction in the emergency department: a strategy for failure |journal=Emerg Med J |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=109\u201313 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11904254 |pmc=1725832 |doi=10.1136/emj.19.2.109 |url=http://emj.bmj.com/content/19/2/109.full}}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheostomy]]'' \u2014 When patients require mechanical ventilation for several weeks, a tracheostomy may provide the most suitable access to the trachea. A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Tracheostomy tubes are well tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs. Tracheostomy tubes may be inserted early during treatment in patients with pre-existing severe respiratory disease, or in any patient expected to be difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation, i.e., patients with little muscular reserve.\n* ''Mouthpiece'' \u2014 Less common interface, does not provide protection against aspiration. There are lipseal mouthpieces with flanges to help hold them in place if patient is unable.\n\n==History==\nThe Greek physician [[Galen]] may have been the first to describe mechanical ventilation: \"If you take a dead animal and blow air through its larynx [through a reed], you will fill its bronchi and watch its lungs attain the greatest distention.\"<ref name=tobin06>{{cite book|last=Colice|first=Gene L|title=Principles & Practice of Mechanical Ventilation|editor=Martin J Tobin|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=2006|edition=2|chapter=Historical Perspective on the Development of Mechanical Ventilation|isbn=978-0-07-144767-6}}</ref> [[Vesalius]] too describes ventilation by inserting a reed or cane into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] of animals.<ref name=\"RCP\">{{cite journal |author=Chamberlain D |title=Never quite there: a tale of resuscitation medicine |journal=Clin Med |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=573\u20137 |year=2003 |pmid=14703040 |pmc=4952587 |doi=10.7861/clinmedicine.3-6-573 }}</ref> In 1908 [[George Poe]] demonstrated his mechanical respirator by asphyxiating dogs and seemingly bringing them back to life.<ref name=smother>{{cite news|title=Smother Small Dog To See it Revived|quote=Successful Demonstration of an Artificial Respiration Machine Cheered in Brooklyn.
