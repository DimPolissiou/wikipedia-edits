Conforte claimed in 1971, the age range of the working girls was 18 to 35. Conforte could provide women of any age, race or size on request of the high rollers. The shifts lasted 12 hours per day. Clothing and salon services were provided by vendors who traveled from as far away as San Francisco and by non-courtesan employees who lived in [[Sparks, Nevada]]. [[Physician|Doctors]] came to the ranch to do pelvic exams and check for [[sexually transmitted diseases]].<ref name=\"www.elgrafico.com.ar\" /> Although many of the women working were from Reno or Sparks, many commuted from [[Sacramento]] and [[San Francisco]]. Others came from all parts of the country. Women not working on the ranch were not allowed in. Owner [[Joe Conforte]] allowed \"out parties\" for high rollers to take the women to hotels in Reno.\n\n[[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] reporter Colin McKinlay visited the Mustang Ranch to do one of the first reports ever allowed by Mustang management. He wrote, \"The women were the most beautiful of any fantasy of man.<ref name=\"www.elgrafico.com.ar\">{{cite web |title=1976.

Once in, they chose a woman from a lineup in a lobby, and negotiated prices and services. She checked the penis for any open sores or signs of venereal disease and tested the pre-ejaculatory fluid. A short negotiation was made as to the type of \"party\" the customer wanted. The house received half of anything the women made. After the negotiations were over, the courtesan collected the money and deposited it with a cashier. \n\nJoe Conforte in 1986 wrote his autobiography and history of the Mustang Ranch, with Nevada writer, David W. Toll.<ref>David W. Toll: '' Breaks, Brains and Balls, The Story of Joe Conforte and Nevada's Fabulous Mustang Ranch,'' Gold Hill Publishing Company, 2011. Toll is a prize-winning Nevada journalist, author and publisher.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe brothel started out as a set of four double-wide trailers, run by Richard Bennett and initially called ''Mustang Bridge Ranch.'' [[Joe Conforte]] (1925-2019), (''[[Look (American mymagazine)|Look]]'' gave his age as 48 in 1971) who had owned several brothels in Nevada together with his wife, Sally Burgess Conforte aka Jesse E. Conforte (1917\u20131992) since October 1955, took over the Mustang Bridge Ranch in 1967. At this time, brothels were not explicitly illegal in Nevada, but some had been closed as public nuisances.\n\nConforte gained political influence in Storey County (by renting out cheap trailers and telling the renters how to vote) and persuaded county officials to pass a brothel-licensing ordinance, which came into effect in 1971. Joe Conforte was featured in ''Look'', June 29, 1971, the article titled \"Legal Prostitution Spreads in Nevada'\" by Gerald Astor, ''Look'' Senior Editor. Joe was on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine November 23, 1972.\n\nThe [[Nevada Supreme Court]] upheld the right of a county to legalize prostitution, and several counties followed suit. Conforte converted the trailers into a permanent structure with 54 bedrooms. Mustang I had a spa room with [[jacuzzi]]. The swimming pool was for adult play.\n\nIn 1976, the world class boxer [[Oscar Bonavena]] (1942\u20131976), who was a former friend of Conforte's and probably had an affair with his wife Sally, was shot dead at the ranch by Conforte's bodyguard.<ref name=\"Farrell\">{{ cite news \n|first=Barry\n|last=Farrell\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-MCAAAAMBAJ\n|title=The Killing At the Notorious Mustang Ranch\n|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] \n|date=July 26, 1976\n|pages=41\u201349\n|quote=\n|accessdate= 2009-06-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Mustang II with 48 bedrooms was built a hundred meters away from Mustang I. A bit smaller and not as luxurious as Mustang I, mostly new women and women demoted from Mustang I for some infraction worked there. Mustang 1 was subsequently rebranded as the \"World Famous Mustang Ranch\".<ref name=\"nvreno\">{{cite web|title=Reno Brothels|url=http://www.nvbrothels.net:80/reno.htm|website=NV Brothels|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030207171156/http://www.nvbrothels.net/reno.htm|archive-date=7 February 2003|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Forfeiture and sale following tax fraud ===\nAfter losing a tax fraud case in 1990, the brothel was closed for three months and auctioned off. Conforte fled the [[United States]] and now lives in [[Brazil]]. The brothel was bought by a holding company and stayed open. After that company and the brothel's manager (a former county commissioner) lost a federal [[fraud]], [[racketeering]] and conspiracy case in 1999, the Mustang Ranch was closed and forfeited to the federal government. That same year, the [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Brazil Supreme Court]] ruled Conforte could not be extradited.\n\nIn 2002, the brothel's furniture, paintings and accessories were auctioned off. The [[United States Bureau of Land Management|Bureau of Land Management]] sold the Ranch's pink [[stucco]] structures on [[eBay]] in 2003.

Once in, they chose a woman from a lineup in a lobby, and negotiated prices and services. She checked the penis for any open sores or signs of venereal disease and tested the pre-ejaculatory fluid. A short negotiation was made as to the type of \"party\" the customer wanted. The house received half of anything the women made. After the negotiations were over, the courtesan collected the money and deposited it with a cashier. \n\nJoe Conforte in 1986 wrote his autobiography and history of the Mustang Ranch, with Nevada writer, David W. Toll.<ref>David W. Toll: '' Breaks, Brains and Balls, The Story of Joe Conforte and Nevada's Fabulous Mustang Ranch,'' Gold Hill Publishing Company, 2011. Toll is a prize-winning Nevada journalist, author and publisher.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe brothel started out as a set of four double-wide trailers, run by Richard Bennett and initially called ''Mustang Bridge Ranch.'' [[Joe Conforte]] (1925-2019), (''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' gave his age as 48 in 1971) who had owned several brothels in Nevada together with his wife, Sally Burgess Conforte aka Jesse E. Conforte (1917\u20131992) since October 1955, took over the Mustang Bridge Ranch in 1967. At this time, brothels were not explicitly illegal in Nevada, but some had been closed as public nuisances.\n\nConforte gained political influence in Storey County (by renting out cheap trailers and telling the renters how to vote) and persuaded county officials to pass a brothel-licensing ordinance, which came into effect in 1971. Joe Conforte was featured in ''Look'', June 29, 1971, the article titled \"Legal Prostitution Spreads in Nevada'\" by Gerald Astor, ''Look'' Senior Editor. Joe was on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine November 23, 1972.\n\nThe [[Nevada Supreme Court]] upheld the right of a county to legalize prostitution, and several counties followed suit. Conforte converted the trailers into a permanent structure with 54 bedrooms. Mustang I had a spa room with [[jacuzzi]]. The swimming pool was for adult play.\n\nIn 1976, the world class boxer [[Oscar Bonavena]] (1942\u20131976), who was a former friend of Conforte's and probably had an affair with his wife Sally, was shot dead at the ranch by Conforte's bodyguard.<ref name=\"Farrell\">{{ cite news \n|first=Barry\n|last=Farrell\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-MCAAAAMBAJ\n|title=The Killing At the Notorious Mustang Ranch\n|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] \n|date=July 26, 1976\n|pages=41\u201349\n|quote=\n|accessdate= 2009-06-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Mustang II with 48 bedrooms was built a hundred meters away from Mustang I.

Conforte fled the [[United States]] and now lives in [[Brazil]]. The brothel was bought by a holding company and stayed open. After that company and the brothel's manager (a former county commissioner) lost a federal [[fraud]], [[racketeering]] and conspiracy case in 1999, the Mustang Ranch was closed and forfeited to the federal government. That same year, the [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Brazil Supreme Court]] ruled Conforte could not be extradited.\n\nIn 2002, the brothel's furniture, paintings and accessories were auctioned off. The [[United States Bureau of Land Management|Bureau of Land Management]] sold the Ranch's pink [[stucco]] structures on [[eBay]] in 2003. Bordello owner [[Lance Gilman]] purchased the buildings for $145,100 and moved them to his [[Wild Horse Adult Resort & Spa]] five miles to the east, where the relocated and extensively renovated buildings eventually became the second brothel located at that complex.
