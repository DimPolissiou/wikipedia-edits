It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest form of Pitmiddle's name was ''Petmeodhel'' (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=off|0}} north of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]] in the centre of the parish, Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/>\n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving it of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the northeast and Bank (now Guardswell) to the southeast.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the [[19th century]], the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what it was six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref> On an [[Ordnance Survey]] map of c. 1860, a \"mill dam\" is shown southeast of the settlement, towards today's Guardswell Farm.<ref>[https://i0.wp.com/holeousia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pitmiddle-village-1861.jpg?ssl=1 Ordnance Survey map, circa 1860]</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield.
