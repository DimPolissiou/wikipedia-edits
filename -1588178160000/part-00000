{"title_page": "Diplexer", "text_new": "A '''diplexer''' is a passive [[electronic component|device]] that implements [[Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-domain multiplexing]]. Two [[Port (circuit theory)|ports]] (e.g., L and H) are multiplexed onto a third port (e.g., S). The signals on ports L and H occupy disjoint frequency bands. Consequently, the signals on L and H can coexist on port S without interfering with each other.\n\nTypically, the signal on port L will occupy a single low frequency band and the signal on port H will occupy a higher frequency band.  In that situation, the diplexer consists of a lowpass filter connecting ports L and S and high pass filter connecting ports H and S. Ideally, all the lowband signal power on port L is transferred to the S port and vice versa. All the highband signal power on port H is transferred to port S and vice versa. Ideally, the separation of the signals is complete. None of the low band signal is transferred from the L port to the H port. In the real world, some power will be lost, and some signal power will leak to the wrong port.\n\n[[Image:hilofilter.agr.jpg|thumb|200px|Television diplexer consisting of a high-pass filter (left) and a low-pass filter (right). The antenna cable is connected on the back to the screw terminals to the left of center.]]\n\nThe diplexer, being a passive device, is normally reciprocal: the device itself doesn't have a notion of input or output. However poorly designed diplexers may have differing impedance on various ports, so it should not simply be assumed that any such device is fully reciprocal unless it is stated or the return loss measured.\n\nThe diplexer is a different device than a passive [[Power dividers and directional couplers|combiner or splitter]]. The ports of a diplexer are frequency selective; the ports of a combiner are not. There is also a power \"loss\" difference - a combiner takes all the power delivered to the S port and equally divides it between the A and B ports. A diplexer does not.\n\nA diplexer frequency multiplexes two ports onto one port, but more than two ports may be multiplexed. A three-port to one-port multiplexer is known as a '''triplexer''', and a four-port to one-port multiplexer is a '''quadplexer''' or '''quadruplexer'''.\n\nA typical diplexer may have around 30&nbsp;dB isolation between its L and H ports. That isolation is sufficient for many applications, but it is insufficient to allow simultaneous reception and transmission on one antenna. If the transmitter emits 1&nbsp;kW, then 1&nbsp;W of that signal would appear at the receiver; that 1&nbsp;W may be enough power to overload the receiver. Diplexers designed for simultaneous reception and transmission have more stringent isolation requirements and are known as [[duplexer]]s.\n\n==Common uses==\nA diplexer allows two different devices to share a common communications channel. Typically, the channel is a long coaxial cable, and a diplexer is often used at both ends of the coaxial cable. The plan is feasible if the two devices operate on different frequencies.  The plan is economical if the diplexers cost less than running a second cable.\n\nDiplexers are typically used with radio receivers or transmitters on different, widely separated, frequency bands.  A single city radio tower might have a police department antenna on 460 MHz and a fire department antenna on 156 MHz.  A diplexer at the top combines the two antenna signals to the single coaxial feedline, and a second identical diplexer inside the building separates the feedline signals to the two dispatch radios. Some diplexers support as many as four antennas or radios that work on different radio bands.\n\nDiplexers are also commonly used where a multi-band antenna is used on a tower, with a common feedline. The diplexer will split the two bands inside the building (such as VHF and UHF systems combined with a diplexer onto a common antenna).\n\n==Industrial applications==\nDiplexing is used to prevent [[intermodulation]] and keep reflected power ([[VSWR]]) to a minimum for each input transmitter and [[frequency]]. While diplexers can combine a relatively wide [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], the major limitation comes with the antenna itself, which must be sufficiently [[wideband]] to accept all of the [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]]s being passed through it, and transfer them to the [[air]] [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiently]].\n\nTypically with a multi-band antenna the frequencies in use will bear an odd harmonic relationship to each other to take advantage of natural harmonic resonances (such as 145/435&nbsp;MHz), making a highly efficient multi-band antenna. Other times tuned traps will be used, which is less efficient and generally not a technique used at VHF/UHF.\n\nMany other large UHF-/VHF-transmitters use diplexers. The number of transmitters which can share an antenna is restricted by the spacing of their frequency bands. Transmitters whose frequencies are too close together cannot be combined successfully by a diplexer.\n\nDiplexers are also used at medium wave broadcasting stations. However their use is not that common in this frequency range because the corresponding wavelength varies much more across the medium wave band than across the FM band and so it is more practicable to use a separate antenna for each frequency: medium wave transmission sites usually broadcast only on one to four frequencies, while FM-broadcasting sites often uses four and more frequencies.\n\nDiplexers may be used as a back-up device. An example is maintenance work at one antenna of a medium wave transmission site that has two antennas transmitting on two frequencies. Then the other antenna can be used for broadcasting both channels. If it is not possible to build a second antenna for the second transmitter due to space constraints, then the diplexer is used permanently.\n\nAt long wave broadcasting sites diplexers are normally not used since these stations usually broadcast on only one frequency. A realization of diplexers for long wave broadcasting stations may be difficult, as the ratio of bandwidth (9&nbsp;kHz) to transmission frequency is high.\n\nDiplexers are not used at VLF transmitters. In this frequency range their realization is very difficult because of the very high voltages that occur in the huge tuned loading coils that are used in the antenna feed.\n\nDiplexers are also used for non-[[broadcasting|broadcast]] applications such as [[amateur radio]].\n\n==Residential==\nDiplexers are also used in the home to allow a [[direct broadcast satellite|direct broadcast]] [[Satellite television|satellite TV]]  [[satellite dish|dish antenna]] and a [[terrestrial TV]] antenna (local broadcast channels) to share one [[coaxial cable]].  The dish antenna occupies the high frequencies (typically 950 to 1450&nbsp;MHz), and the TV antenna uses lower [[television channel frequencies]] (typically 50 to 870&nbsp;MHz).  In addition, the satellite also gets a DC to low frequency band to power the dish's [[block converter]] and select the dish antenna polarization (e.g., voltage signaling or [[DiSEqC]]).  The diplexer is useful in homes that are already wired with one cable, because it eliminates the need to install a second cable.  For the diplexer to work, the existing cable must be able to pass the satellite frequencies with little loss.  Older TV installations may use a solid dielectric [[RG-59]] cable, and that cable may be inadequate.<ref>Legacy satellite receivers instructed the LNB to send only one polarization (half the possible channels). Modern receivers have dual channels, so they may need both polarizations at the same time. A DishPro LNB \"stacks\" the two polarizations (sends both polarizations down the same cable; one polarization is sent in a higher (stacked) band). Consequently, the LNB signal occupies a wider bandwidth, 950 to 2150&nbsp;MHz. RG-59 has significant loss at the higher frequencies.</ref> [[RG-6]] cable is typically used for satellite feed lines.\n\nIn this application, there would be a diplexer on the roof that joins the satellite dish feed and the TV antenna together into a single coaxial cable.  That cable would then run from the roof into the house. At a convenient point, a second diplexer would split the two signals apart; one signal would go to the TV set and the other to the [[Integrated receiver/decoder|IRD]] of the DBS [[set-top box]]. These usually have an antenna input and a diplexer, so that the antenna signal is also distributed along with the satellite.\n\nMore modern installations confront several issues. There are often multiple satellite dishes that need to feed several receivers or even multichannel receivers. See, for example, [[single cable distribution]].\n\nDiplexers were also used to combine UHF TV and VHF TV and FM signals onto one downlead, which can then be split back into its component parts as required.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Power dividers and directional couplers]]\n*[[Bias tee]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.aerialsandtv.com/knowledge/splitters-amps-and-diplexers/diplexers-taps-and-filters#dipexers-basics Use of diplexers in domestic TV distribution.]\n{{Analogue TV transmitter topics}} \n[[Category:Broadcast engineering]]\n[[Category:Radio electronics]]\n", "text_old": "A '''diplexer''' is a passive [[electronic component|device]] that implements [[Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-domain multiplexing]].

In this frequency range their realization is very difficult because of the very high voltages that occur in the huge tuned loading coils that are used in the antenna feed.\n\nDiplexers are also used for non-[[broadcasting|broadcast]] applications such as [[amateur radio]].\n\n==Residential==\nDiplexers are also used in the home to allow a [[direct broadcast satellite|direct broadcast]] [[Satellite television|satellite TV]]  [[satellite dish|dish antenna]] and a [[terrestrial TV]] antenna (local broadcast channels) to share one [[coaxial cable]].  The dish antenna occupies the high frequencies (typically 950 to 1450&nbsp;MHz), and the TV antenna uses lower [[television channel frequencies]] (typically 50 to 870&nbsp;MHz).  In addition, the satellite also gets a DC to low frequency band to power the dish's [[block converter]] and select the dish antenna polarization (e.g., voltage signaling or [[DiSEqC]]).  The diplexer is useful in homes that are already wired with one cable, because it eliminates the need to install a second cable.  For the diplexer to work, the existing cable must be able to pass the satellite frequencies with little loss.  Older TV installations may use a solid dielectric [[RG-59]] cable, and that cable may be inadequate.<ref>Legacy satellite receivers instructed the LNB to send only one polarization (half the possible channels). Modern receivers have dual channels, so they may need both polarizations at the same time. A DishPro LNB \"stacks\" the two polarizations (sends both polarizations down the same cable; one polarization is sent in a higher (stacked) band). Consequently, the LNB signal occupies a wider bandwidth, 950 to 2150&nbsp;MHz. RG-59 has significant loss at the higher frequencies.</ref> [[RG-6]] cable is typically used for satellite feed lines.\n\nIn this application, there would be a diplexer on the roof that joins the satellite dish feed and the TV antenna together into a single coaxial cable.  That cable would then run from the roof into the house. At a convenient point, a second diplexer would split the two signals apart; one signal would go to the TV set and the other to the [[Integrated receiver/decoder|IRD]] of the DBS [[set-top box]]. These usually have an antenna input and a diplexer, so that the antenna signal is also distributed along with the satellite.\n\nMore modern installations confront several issues. There are often multiple satellite dishes that need to feed several receivers or even multichannel receivers. See, for example, [[single cable distribution]].\n\nDiplexers were also used to combine UHF TV and VHF TV and FM signals onto one downlead, which can then be split back into its component parts as required.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Power dividers and directional couplers]]\n*[[Bias tee]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.aerialsandtv.com/knowledge/splitters-amps-and-diplexers/diplexers-taps-and-filters#dipexers-basics Use of diplexers in domestic TV distribution.]\n{{Analogue TV transmitter topics}} \n[[Category:Broadcast engineering]]\n[[Category:Radio electronics]]\n", "name_user": "RNLion", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix unnecessary line-wrapping in References section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplexer"}

One of the most notable examples is the 16th century confederation formed by twelve zamindars in the [[Bhati (region)|Bhati]] region ([[Baro-Bhuyan]]s), which, according to the [[Jesuit]]s and [[Ralph Fitch]], earned a reputation for successively repelling Mughal invasions through naval battles. The confederation was led by a zamindar-king, [[Isa Khan]], and included both Muslims and Hindus, such as [[Pratapaditya]]. The zamindars were also patrons of the arts. The [[Tagore family]] produced India's first Nobel laureate in literature in 1913, [[Rabindranath Tagore]], who was often based at his estate. The zamindars also promoted [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] and [[Indo-Saracenic]] architecture.\n\n==Mughal era==\n[[File:Mehtab Chand of Burdwan.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Mehtab Chand (1820-79) (zamindar of the [[Burdwan (Zamindari)|Burdwan Raj]]) as a young man, ''c.'' 1840-45 A.D.]]\n\nWhen Babur conquered Hindustan, there were many autonomous and semiautonomous rulers who were known locally as Rai, Raja, Rana, Rao, Rawat, etc. while in the various Persian chronicles they were referred as zamindars and marzabans.

After the conquest of Hindustan, Babur informs us that one-sixth of its total revenues came from the territories of the chiefs. He writes: \"The revenue of the countries now held by me (1528 A.D.) from Bhira to Bihar, is fifty-two crores as will be known in detail.

Each of these rajas and zamindars commanded an army of their own generally consisting of their clansmen and the total numbers of their troops as Abul Fazl tells us, stood at forty four lakhs comprising 384,558 cavalry, 4,277,057 infantry; 1863 elephants, 4260 guns and 4500 boats.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fazl |first1=Abul |title=Ain-i-Akbari |page=120 |edition=1.

Even the ruling autonomous chiefs of princely states were called zamindars.\nMoreland was one of the first historian who draw our attention to the importance of zamindars in medieval India. He defines zamindars as \"vassal chiefs\". He points out that there were areas under direct control of Mughals where there were no zamindars and then there were territories of the vassal chiefs who had autonomy over their state, but were subjugated by the Mughals and paid a tribute/ nazarana to the Mughal Emperor. However Irfan Habib in his book Agrarian system of Mughal India, divided the zamindars into two categories : the autonomous chiefs who enjoyed \"sovereign power\" in their territories and the ordinary zamindars who exercised superior rights in land and collected land revenue and were mostly appointed by the Mughals.<ref name=\"Ansari\">{{cite book |last1=Ansari |first1=Tahir Hussain |title=Mughal Administration and the Zamindars of Bihar |pages=3\u20135 |url=http://ir.amu.ac.in/3707/1/T%207407.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Voyages in World History, Volume 2: Since 1500 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klcYZE-jE74C&pg=PA461 |page=461 |chapter=The Politics of Empire in Southern and Eastern Asia |first1=Valerie |last1=Hansen |first2=Kenneth R. |last2=Curtis}}</ref> These people were known as the zamindars (intermediaries)<ref name=\"Jaffrelot2000\">{{cite journal |last=Jaffrelot |first=Christophe |authorlink=Christophe Jaffrelot |date=September\u2013October 2000 |title=Sanskritization vs. Ethnicization in India: Changing Indentities and Caste Politics before Mandal |journal=Asian Survey |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=756\u2013766 |doi=10.1525/as.2000.40.5.01p0100d |jstor=3021175}}</ref> and they collected revenue primarily from the [[Ryot]]s ([[peasant]]s)<ref>{{cite book |first=Irfan |last=Habib |origyear=1963 |title=The Agrarian System of Mughal India, 1526-1707 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=2nd revised |year=2000 |isbn=0-19-562329-0}} For the meanings of ''zamindar'' see pp. 140ff.</ref> The zamindari system was more prevalent in the north of India because Mughal influence in the south was less apparent.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot2000\" />\n\nHistorian [[S.

Later they acquired the 24-Parganas and in 1765 got control of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nasserwanji Driver |first1=Peshotan |title=Problems of Zamindari and Land Reconstruction in India |date=1949 |publisher=Bombay New Book Company LTD. |location=Bombay |pages=10}}</ref> Later in 1857 the British Crown was established as the sovereign. \n\nDuring Mughal Era the Zamindars were not proprietors. They used to engage in wars and used to plunder neighbouring kings. So they never looked after the improvements in their land. The East India Company under Lord Cornwallis, realising this, made Permanent Settlement in 1793 with the Zamindars and made them proprietors of their land in return for a fixed annual rent. This Permanent Settlement created the new Zamindari System as we know it today. After 1857 the army of the majority of Zamindars were abolished with exception of a small number of force for policing/digwari/kotwali in their respective estates. If the Zamindars were not able to pay the rent until sunset, parts of their estates were acquired and auctioned. This created a new class of Zamindars in the society. As the rest of India came later under the control of the EIC, different ways were implemented in different provinces to subjugate the ruling chiefs.     \n     \nThe British colonists of India generally adopted the extant zamindari system of revenue collection in the north of the country. They recognised the zamindars as landowners and proprietors as opposed to Mughal government and in return required them to collect taxes. Although some zamindars were present in the south, they were not so in large numbers and the British administrators used the [[ryotwari]] (cultivator) method of collection, which involved selecting certain farmers as being land owners and requiring them to remit their taxes directly.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot2000\" />\n\nThe [[Zamindars of Bengal]] were influential in the development of Bengal. They played pivotal part during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pd.cpim.org/2007/0318/03182007_1857.htm|title=Patriotic And Comprador Zamindars In The Great Rebellion Of 1857|website=pd.cpim.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505171622/http://pd.cpim.org/2007/0318/03182007_1857.htm|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe British continued the tradition of bestowing both royal and noble titles to zamindars who were loyal to the paramount. The title of Raja, Maharaja, Rai Saheb, Rai Bahadur, Rao, Nawab, Khan Bahadur were bestowed to princely state rulers and to many zamindars from time to time. According to an estimate in the Imperial Gazetteer of India, there were around 2000 ruling chiefs holding the royal title of Raja and Maharaja which included the rulers of princely states and several large chiefdoms. This numbers increases tenfold if zamindar/ jagirdar chiefs with other non royal but noble title are taken into count.\n\n===Accession===\nUnlike the autonomous or frontier chiefs, the hereditary status of the zamindar class was circumscribed by the Mughals, and the heir depended to a certain extent on the pleasure of the sovereign.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Islam |first1=Sirajul |last2=Akhter |first2=Shirin |year=2012 |chapter=Zamindar |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Zamindar |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703120049/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Zamindar |archivedate=3 July 2015 }}</ref> Heirs were set by descent or a times even adoption by religious laws.<ref>{{cite book |date=1888 |title=The Indian Law Reports: Madras series |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l9KyAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA385 |publisher=Controller of Stationery and Print |page=385}}</ref> Under the British Empire, the zamindars were to be subordinate to the crown and not act as hereditary lords, but at times family politics was at the heart of naming an heir.<ref>{{cite book |last=McLane |first=John R. |date=2002 |title=Land and Local Kingship in Eighteenth-Century Bengal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YH6ijJnUPmcC&pg=PA223 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=223 |isbn=978-0-521-52654-8}}</ref> At times, a cousin could be named an heir with closer family relatives present;<ref>{{cite book |date=1872 |title=Madras High Court Reports: 1870 and 1871 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zc8DAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA209 |publisher=J.

However Irfan Habib in his book Agrarian system of Mughal India, divided the zamindars into two categories : the autonomous chiefs who enjoyed \"sovereign power\" in their territories and the ordinary zamindars who exercised superior rights in land and collected land revenue and were mostly appointed by the Mughals.<ref name=\"Ansari\">{{cite book |last1=Ansari |first1=Tahir Hussain |title=Mughal Administration and the Zamindars of Bihar |pages=3\u20135 |url=http://ir.amu.ac.in/3707/1/T%207407.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Voyages in World History, Volume 2: Since 1500 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klcYZE-jE74C&pg=PA461 |page=461 |chapter=The Politics of Empire in Southern and Eastern Asia |first1=Valerie |last1=Hansen |first2=Kenneth R. |last2=Curtis}}</ref> These people were known as the zamindars (intermediaries)<ref name=\"Jaffrelot2000\">{{cite journal |last=Jaffrelot |first=Christophe |authorlink=Christophe Jaffrelot |date=September\u2013October 2000 |title=Sanskritization vs. Ethnicization in India: Changing Indentities and Caste Politics before Mandal |journal=Asian Survey |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=756\u2013766 |doi=10.1525/as.2000.40.5.01p0100d |jstor=3021175}}</ref> and they collected revenue primarily from the [[Ryot]]s ([[peasant]]s)<ref>{{cite book |first=Irfan |last=Habib |origyear=1963 |title=The Agrarian System of Mughal India, 1526-1707 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=2nd revised |year=2000 |isbn=0-19-562329-0}} For the meanings of ''zamindar'' see pp. 140ff.</ref> The zamindari system was more prevalent in the north of India because Mughal influence in the south was less apparent.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot2000\" />\n\nHistorian [[S.

Later they acquired the 24-Parganas and in 1765 got control of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nasserwanji Driver |first1=Peshotan |title=Problems of Zamindari and Land Reconstruction in India |date=1949 |publisher=Bombay New Book Company LTD. |location=Bombay |pages=10}}</ref> Later in 1857 the British Crown was established as the sovereign. \n\nDuring Mughal Era the Zamindars were not proprietors. They used to engage in wars and used to plunder neighbouring kings. So they never looked after the improvements in their land. The East India Company under Lord Cornwallis, realising this, made Permanent Settlement in 1793 with the Zamindars and made them proprietors of their land in return for a fixed annual rent. This Permanent Settlement created the new Zamindari System as we know it today. After 1857 the army of the majority of Zamindars were abolished with exception of a small number of force for policing/digwari/kotwali in their respective estates. If the Zamindars were not able to pay the rent until sunset, parts of their estates were acquired and auctioned. This created a new class of Zamindars in the society. As the rest of India came later under the control of the EIC, different ways were implemented in different provinces to subjugate the ruling chiefs.     \n     \nThe British colonists of India generally adopted the extant zamindari system of revenue collection in the north of the country. They recognised the zamindars as landowners and proprietors as opposed to Mughal government and in return required them to collect taxes. Although some zamindars were present in the south, they were not so in large numbers and the British administrators used the [[ryotwari]] (cultivator) method of collection, which involved selecting certain farmers as being land owners and requiring them to remit their taxes directly.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot2000\" />\n\nThe [[Zamindars of Bengal]] were influential in the development of Bengal.

The title of Raja, Maharaja, Rai Saheb, Rai Bahadur, Rao, Nawab, Khan Bahadur were bestowed to princely state rulers and to many zamindars from time to time. According to an estimate in the Imperial Gazetteer of India, there were around 2000 ruling chiefs holding the royal title of Raja and Maharaja which included the rulers of princely states and several large chiefdoms. This numbers increases tenfold if zamindar/ jagirdar chiefs with other non royal but noble title are taken into count.\n\n===Accession===\nUnlike the autonomous or frontier chiefs, the hereditary status of the zamindar class was circumscribed by the Mughals, and the heir depended to a certain extent on the pleasure of the sovereign.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Islam |first1=Sirajul |last2=Akhter |first2=Shirin |year=2012 |chapter=Zamindar |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Zamindar |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703120049/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Zamindar |archivedate=3 July 2015 }}</ref> Heirs were set by descent or a times even adoption by religious laws.<ref>{{cite book |date=1888 |title=The Indian Law Reports: Madras series |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l9KyAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA385 |publisher=Controller of Stationery and Print |page=385}}</ref> Under the British Empire, the zamindars were to be subordinate to the crown and not act as hereditary lords, but at times family politics was at the heart of naming an heir.<ref>{{cite book |last=McLane |first=John R. |date=2002 |title=Land and Local Kingship in Eighteenth-Century Bengal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YH6ijJnUPmcC&pg=PA223 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=223 |isbn=978-0-521-52654-8}}</ref> At times, a cousin could be named an heir with closer family relatives present;<ref>{{cite book |date=1872 |title=Madras High Court Reports: 1870 and 1871 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zc8DAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA209 |publisher=J.

In modern [[zoology]], they are particularly renowned for their curious [[mating]] behaviour and for [[viviparity|bearing live young]].\n\n==Anatomy==\nVelvet worms are [[segmentation (biology)|segmented]] animals with a flattened [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] body cross-section and rows of unstructured body [[appendage]]s known as oncopods or lobopods (informally: stub feet). The animals grow to between 0.5 and 20&nbsp;cm (.2 to 8&nbsp;in), with the average being about 5&nbsp;cm (2 &nbsp;in), and have between 13 and 43 pairs of legs. Their [[skin]] consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin [[wiktionary:pore|pore]]s, [[excretion]] organs and concentrations of [[nerve cell]]s. The individual body sections are largely [[specialization (biology)|unspecialised]]; even the head develops only a little differently from the [[abdomen|abdominal]] segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same [[gene]] as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during [[embryo|embryonic development]], at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the [[protostome]] group, their early development has a [[deuterostome]] trajectory, (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.2628| title = Fate and nature of the onychophoran mouth-anus furrow and its contribution to the blastopore| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 282| issue = 1805| page = 20142628| date = 18 March 2015| last1 = Janssen | first1 = R.| last2 = Jorgensen | first2 = M.| last3 = Lagebro | first3 = L.| last4 = Budd | first4 = G.

Although the number of feet can vary considerably between species, their structure is basically very similar. Rigidity is provided by the [[hydrostatic]] pressure of their [[fluid]] contents, and movement is usually obtained passively by stretching and contraction of the animal's entire body. However, each leg can also be shortened and bent by internal [[muscle]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Due to the lack of joints, this bending can take place at any point along the sides of the leg. In some species, two different organs are found within the feet:\n\n*Crural glands are situated at the shoulder of the legs, extending into the body cavity. They open outwards at the crural papillae\u2014small wart-like bumps on the belly side of the leg\u2014and secrete chemical messenger materials called [[pheromone]]s. Their name comes from the [[Latin]] ''cruralis'' meaning \"of the legs\".\n*Coxal vesicles are pouches located on the belly side of the leg, which can be everted and probably serve in water absorption. They belong to the family Peripatidae and are named from ''coxa'', the Latin word for \"hip\".\n\n[[File:Euperipatoides claw pair.tif|thumb|right|A pair of claws from ''[[Euperipatoides kanangrensis]]'']]\nOn each foot is a pair of retractable, hardened (sclerotised) [[chitin]] claws, which give the taxon its scientific name: Onychophora is derived from the Greek ''onyches'', \"claws\"; and ''pherein'', \"to carry\". At the base of the claws are three to six spiny \"cushions\" on which the leg sits in its resting position and on which the animal walks over smooth substrates. The claws are used mainly to gain a firm foothold on uneven terrain. Each claw is composed of three stacked elements, like Russian nesting dolls. The outermost is shed during ecdysis, which exposes the next element in \u2014 which is fully formed, so does not need time to harden before it is used.<ref name=\"doi10.1038/nature13576\">{{cite journal |first1=Martin R. |last1=Smith |first2=Javier |last2=Ortega-Hern\u00e1ndez |date=October 2014 |title=''Hallucigenia''<nowiki/>'s onychophoran-like claws and the case for Tactopoda |journal=Nature |volume=514 |issue=7522 |pages=363\u20136 |pmid=25132546 |doi=10.1038/nature13576|bibcode=2014Natur.514..363S |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/19108/1/19108.pdf }}</ref> (This distinctive construction identifies many early Cambrian fossils as early offshoots of the onychophoran lineage.<ref name=\"doi10.1038/nature13576\" />) Apart from the pairs of legs, there are three further body appendages, which are at the head and comprise three segments:\n\n* On the first head segment is a pair of slender [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], which serve in [[sensory perception]].

Instead, their fluid-filled body cavity acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, similarly to many unrelated soft-bodied animals that are cylindrically shaped, for example [[sea anemones]] and various [[worm]]s. Pressure of their [[incompressible]] internal bodily fluid on the body wall provides rigidity, and muscles are able to act against it. The body wall consists of a non-cellular outer skin, the [[cuticula]]; a single layer of [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] cells forming an internal skin; and beneath this, usually three layers of muscle, which are embedded in connective tissues. The cuticula is about a [[micrometre|micrometer]] thick and covered with fine [[wiktionary:Villi|villi]]. In composition and structure, it resembles the cuticula of the arthropods, consisting of \u03b1<!--not 'a'-->-chitin and various [[protein]]s,<ref name=Mayer2015/> although not containing [[collagen]]. It can be divided into an external epicuticula and an internal procuticula, which themselves consist of exo- and endo-cuticula. This multi-level structure is responsible for the high flexibility of the outer skin, which enables the velvet worm to squeeze itself into the narrowest crevices. Although outwardly [[water-repellent]], the cuticula is not able to prevent water loss by [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and, as a result, velvet worms can live only in [[microclimate]]s with high [[humidity]] to avoid [[desiccation]]. The surface of the cuticula is scattered with numerous fine papillae, the larger of which carry visible villi-like sensitive bristles. The papillae themselves are covered with tiny [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s, lending the skin a [[velvet]]y appearance (from which the common name is likely derived).

Beneath this lies a thick layer of connective tissue, which is composed primarily of collagen fibres aligned either [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or [[perpendicular]] to the body's longitudinal axis. The colouration of Onychophora is generated by a range of pigments.{{Clarify|date=May 2009}} The solubility of these pigments is a useful diagnostic character: in all arthropods and tardigrades, the body pigment is soluble in ethanol. This is also true for the Peripatidae, but in the case of the Peripatopsidae, the body pigment is insoluble in ethanol.<ref name=Monge1995>{{cite journal |first1=Julian |last1=Monge-Najera |date=May 1995 |title=Phylogeny, biogeography and reproductive trends in the Onychophora |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=21\u201360 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1995.tb00111.x}}</ref>\n\nWithin the connective tissue lie three continuous layers of unspecialised [[smooth muscle|smooth muscular]] tissue. The relatively thick outer layer is composed of annular muscles, and the similarly voluminous inner layer of longitudinal muscles. Between them lie thin diagonal muscles that wind backward and forward along the body axis in a [[spiral]]. Between the annular and diagonal muscles exist fine [[blood vessel]]s, which lie below the superficially recognisable transverse rings of the skin and are responsible for the pseudo-segmented markings.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Beneath the internal muscle layer lies the body cavity. In cross-section, this is divided into three regions by so-called dorso-ventral muscles, which run from the middle of the underbelly through to the edges of the upper side: a central midsection and on the left and right, two side regions that also include the legs.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Circulation===\nThe body cavity is known as a \"pseudocoel\", or [[haemocoel]]. Unlike a true [[coelom]], a pseudocoel is not fully enclosed by a cell layer derived from the embryonic [[mesoderm]]. A coelom is, however, formed around the [[gonad]]s and the waste-eliminating [[nephridia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} As the name ''haemocoel'' suggests, the body cavity is filled with a [[blood]]-like liquid in which all the organs are embedded; in this way, they can be easily supplied with [[nutrient]]s circulating in the blood. This liquid is colourless as it does not contain [[pigment]]s; for this reason, it serves only a limited role in [[oxygen]] transport. Two different types of blood cells (or haemocytes) circulate in the fluid: [[amoebocyte]]s and nephrocytes. The amoebocytes probably function in protection from [[bacteria]] and other foreign bodies; in some species, they also play a role in [[reproduction]]. Nephrocytes absorb [[toxin]]s or convert them into a form suitable for [[clearance (medicine)|elimination]] by the nephridia.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The haemocoel is divided by a horizontal partition, the diaphragm,<!--Do '''''not''''' link this to any article referring to any kind of Chordate diaphragm, in particular not the thoracic diaphragm. They have nothing to do with each other.--> into two parts: the [[pericardial sinus]] along the back and the perivisceral sinus along the belly. The former encloses the tube-like heart, and the latter, the other organs. The diaphragm is perforated in many places, enabling the exchange of fluids between the two cavities.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The heart itself is a tube of annular muscles consisting of [[epithelium|epithelial]] tissues, with two lateral openings ([[wikt:ostium|ostia]]) per segment. While it is not known whether the rear end is open or closed, from the front, it opens directly into the body cavity. Since there are no blood vessels, apart from the fine vessels running between the muscle layers of the body wall and a pair of arteries that supply the antennae, this is referred to as an [[open circulation]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The timing of the pumping procedure can be divided into two parts: [[diastole]] and [[systole (medicine)|systole]]. During diastole, blood flows through the ostia from the pericardial sinus (the cavity containing the heart) into the heart. When the systole begins, the ostia close and the heart muscles contract inwards, reducing the volume of the heart. This pumps the blood from the front end of the heart into the perivisceral sinus containing the organs. In this way, the various organs are supplied with nutrients before the blood finally returns to the pericardial sinus via the perforations in the diaphragm. In addition to the pumping action of the heart, body movements also have an influence on circulation.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Respiration===\nOxygen uptake occurs to an extent via simple [[diffusion]] through the entire body surface, with the coxal vesicles on the legs possibly being involved in some species. However, of most importance is gas exchange via fine unbranched tubes, the [[invertebrate trachea|trachea]]e, which draw oxygen from the surface deep into the various organs, particularly the heart. The walls of these structures, which are less than three micrometers thick in their entirety, consist only of an extremely thin [[biological membrane|membrane]] through which oxygen can easily diffuse. The tracheae originate at tiny openings, the [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s, which themselves are clustered together in dent-like recesses of the outer skin, the [[wikt:atrium|atria]]. The number of \"tracheae bundles\" thus formed is on average around 75 per body segment; they accumulate most densely on the back of the organism.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Unlike the arthropods, the velvet worms are unable to control the openings of their tracheae; the tracheae are always open, entailing considerable water loss in [[arid]] conditions. Water is lost twice as fast as in earthworms and forty times faster than in caterpillars.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=S. M. |last1=Manton |date=June 20, 1949 |title=Studies on the Onychophora. VII.

Here, prey can be mechanically dismembered by the mandibles with their covering of fine toothlets. Two [[saliva]]ry glands discharge via a common conductor into the subsequent \"throat\", which makes up the first part of the front [[intestine]]. The saliva that they produce contains mucus and [[hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s, which initiate [[digestion]] in and outside the mouth. Historically, the salivary glands probably evolved from the waste-elimination organs known as nephridia, which are found homologously in the other body segments.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The throat itself is very muscular, serving to absorb the partially liquified food and to pump it, via the [[oesophagus]], which forms the rear part of the front intestine, into the central intestine. Unlike the front intestine, this is not lined with a cuticula but instead consists only of a single layer of epithelial tissue, which does not exhibit conspicuous indentation as is found in other animals. On entering the central intestine, food particles are coated with a mucus-based [[peritrophic membrane]], which serves to protect the lining of the intestine from damage by sharp-edged particles. The intestinal epithelium secretes further digestive enzymes and absorbs the released nutrients, although the majority of digestion has already taken place externally or in the mouth. Indigestible remnants arrive in the rear intestine, or [[rectum]], which is once again lined with a cuticula and which opens at the [[anus]], located on the underside near to the rear end.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn almost every segment is a pair of excretory organs called nephridia, which are derived from coelom tissue. Each consists of a small pouch that is connected, via a [[flagellum|flagellated]] conductor called a nephridioduct, to an opening at the base of the nearest leg known as a nephridiopore. The pouch is occupied by special cells called [[podocyte]]s, which facilitate [[ultrafiltration]] of the blood through the partition between haemocoelom and nephridium. The composition of the [[urine|urinary]] solution is modified in the nephridioduct by selective recovery of nutrients and water and by isolation of poison and waste materials, before it is excreted to the outside world via the nephridiopore. The most important nitrogenous excretion product is the water-insoluble [[uric acid]]; this can be excreted in solid state, with very little water. This so-called [[uricotelic]] excretory mode represents an adjustment to life on land and the associated necessity of dealing economically with water.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} A pair of former nephridia in the head were converted secondarily into the salivary glands, while another pair in the final segment of male specimens now serve as glands that apparently play a role in reproduction.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Sensation===\nThe entire body, including the stub feet, is littered with numerous papillae: warty protrusions responsive to touch that carry a [[mechanoreceptor|mechanoreceptive]] bristle at the tip, each of which is also connected to further [[sensory nerve cell]]s lying beneath. The mouth papillae, the exits of the slime glands, probably also have some function in [[sensory perception]]. Sensory cells known as \"sensills\" on the \"lips\" or labrum respond to chemical stimuli and are known as [[chemoreceptor]]s. These are also found on the two antennae, which seem to be the velvet worm's most important sensory organs.\n\nExcept in a few (typically [[subterranea (geography)|subterranea]]n) species, one [[simple eye in invertebrates|simply constructed eye]] (ocellus) lies behind each antenna, laterally, just underneath the head.<ref name=Mayer2006/> This consists of a chitinous ball [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], a [[cornea]] and a [[retina]] and is connected to the centre of the [[brain]] via an [[optic nerve]].<ref name=Mayer2006/> The retina comprises numerous pigment cells and photoreceptors; the latter are easily modified flagellated cells, whose [[flagellum]] membranes carry a photosensitive pigment on their surface.

Both the gonads and the gonoduct are derived from true coelom tissue.\n\n[[File:Dissected Euperipatoides.jpg|thumb|right|A dissected ''Euperipatoides kanangrensis''. The two ovaries, full of stage&nbsp;II embryos, are floating to the bottom of the image.]]\nIn females, the two [[ovary|ovaries]] are joined in the middle and to the horizontal diaphragm. The gonoduct appears differently depending on whether the species is live-bearing or [[ovipary|egg-laying]]. In live-bearing species, each exit channel divides into a slender oviduct and a roomy \"womb\", the [[uterus]], in which the embryos develop. The single [[vagina]], to which both uteri are connected, runs outward to the gonopore. In egg-laying species, whose gonoduct is uniformly constructed, the genital opening lies at the tip of a long egg-laying apparatus, the [[ovipositor]]. The females of many species also possess a sperm repository called the ''receptacle seminis'', in which sperm cells from males can be stored temporarily or for longer periods.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nMales possess two separate [[testes]], along with the corresponding sperm vesicle (the [[vesicula seminalis]]) and exit channel (the [[vasa efferentia]]). The two vasa efferentia unite to a common sperm duct, the [[vas deferens]], which in turn widens through the ejaculatory channel to open at the gonopore. Directly beside or behind this lie two pairs of special glands, which probably serve some auxiliary reproductive function; the rearmost glands are also known as anal glands.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} A [[penis]]-like structure has so far been found only in males of the genus ''Paraperipatus'' but has not yet been observed in action.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThere are different mating procedures: In some species males deposit their [[spermatophore]] directly into the female's genitals opening, while others deposit it on the female's body, where the cuticle will collapse and allowing the sperm cells to migrate into the female. There are also Australian species where the male place their spermatophore on top of their head, which is then pressed against the female's genitals. In these species the head have elaborate structures like spikes, spines, hollow stylets, pits, and depressions, whose purpose is to either hold the sperm and / or assist in the sperm transfer to the female. The males of most species also secrete a pheromone from glands on the underside of the legs to attract females.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/animals/worms/velvet-worm/ |title=Velvet worm |website=The Australian Museum}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n===Distribution===\nVelvet worms live in all [[tropical]] habitats and in the [[temperate zone]] of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], showing a [[circumtropical]] and circumaustral distribution.

The claws of the feet are used only on hard, rough terrain where a firm grip is needed; on soft substrates, such as moss, the velvet worm walks on the foot cushions at the base of the claws.\n\nActual locomotion is achieved less by the exertion of the leg muscles than by local changes of body length. This can be controlled using the annular and longitudinal muscles. If the annular muscles are contracted, the body cross-section is reduced, and the corresponding segment lengthens; this is the usual mode of operation of the hydrostatic skeleton as also employed by other worms. Due to the stretching, the legs of the segment concerned are lifted and swung forward. Local contraction of the longitudinal muscles then shortens the appropriate segment, and the legs, which are now in contact with the ground, are moved to the rear. This part of the locomotive cycle is the actual leg stroke that is responsible for forward movement.

The females of many species are fertilized only once during their lives, which leads to [[animal sexual behavior|copulation]] sometimes taking place before the [[reproductive organ]]s of the females are fully developed. In such cases, for example at the age of three months in ''[[Macroperipatus torquatus]]'', the transferred sperm cells are kept in a special [[reservoir]], where they can remain [[:wikt:viable|viable]] for longer periods. Fertilization takes place [[internal fertilisation|internally]], although the mode of [[sperm]] transmission varies widely. In most species, for example in the [[genus]] ''[[Peripatus]]'', a package of sperm cells called the [[spermatophore]] is placed into the genital opening of the female. The detailed process by which this is achieved is in most cases still unknown, a true [[penis]] having been observed only in species of the genus ''Paraperipatus''. In many Australian species, there exist [[dimple]]s or special [[dagger]]- or [[axe]]-shaped structures on the head; the male of ''[[Florelliceps stutchburyae]]'' presses a long [[spine (zoology)|spine]] against the female's genital opening and probably positions its spermatophore there in this way. During the process, the female supports the male by keeping him clasped with the claws of her last pair of legs. The mating behavior of two species of the genus ''[[Peripatopsis]]'' is particularly curious. Here, the male places two-millimetre spermatophores on the back or sides of the female. [[Amoebocyte]]s from the female's [[blood]] collect on the inside of the [[wikt:deposition|deposition]] site, and both the spermatophore's casing and the body wall on which it rests are decomposed via the [[secretion]] of [[enzyme]]s. This releases the sperm cells, which then move freely through the [[haemocoel]], penetrate the external wall of the ovaries and finally fertilize the [[ovum|ova]]. Why this self-inflicted skin injury does not lead to bacterial infections is not yet understood (though likely related to the enzymes used to deteriorate the skin or facilitate the transfer of viable genetic material from male to female). Velvet worms are found in egg-laying ([[ovipary|oviparous]]), egg-live-bearing ([[ovovivipary|ovoviviparous]]) and live-bearing ([[viviparity|viviparous]]) forms.\n\n*Ovipary occurs solely in the Peripatopsidae, often in regions with erratic food supply or unsettled climate. In these cases, the [[yolk]]-rich [[egg (biology)|egg]]s measure 1.3 to 2.0&nbsp;mm and are coated in a protective chitinous shell. [[Maternal]] care is unknown.\n*The majority of species are ovoviviparous: the medium-sized eggs, encased only by a double membrane, remain in the [[uterus]]. The [[embryo]]s do not receive food directly from the mother, but are supplied instead by the moderate quantity of yolk contained in the eggs\u2014they are therefore described as [[lecithotrophic]]. The young emerge from the eggs only a short time before birth. This probably represents the velvet worm's original mode of reproduction, i.e., both oviparous and viviparous species developed from ovoviviparous species.\n*True live-bearing species are found in both families, particularly in tropical regions with a stable climate and regular food supply throughout the year. The embryos develop from eggs only micrometres in size and are nourished in the uterus by their mother, hence the description \"[[matrotrophic]]\". The supply of food takes place either via a secretion from the mother directly into the uterus or via a genuine tissue connection between the epithelium of the uterus and the developing embryo, known as a [[placenta]]. The former is found only outside the American continents, while the latter occurs primarily in America and the Caribbean and more rarely in the [[Old World]]. The [[gestation]] period can amount to up to 15&nbsp;months, at the end of which the [[offspring]] emerge in an advanced stage of development. The embryos found in the uterus of a single female do not necessarily have to be of the same age; it is quite possible for there to be offspring at different stages of development and descended from different males. In some species, young tend to be released only at certain points in the year.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Muriel H. |last1=Walker |first2=Noel N. |last2=Tait |date=December 2004 |title=Studies of embryonic development and the reproductive cycle in ovoviviparous Australian Onychophora (Peripatopsidae) |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=264 |issue=4 |pages=333\u201354 |doi=10.1017/S0952836904005837}}</ref>\n\nA female can have between 1 and 23 offspring per year; development from fertilized ovum to adult takes between 6 and 17&nbsp;months and does not have a [[larva]]l stage. This is probably also the original mode of development. Velvet worms have been known to live for up to six years.\n\n==Ecology==\nThe velvet worm's important predators are primarily various spiders and centipedes, along with [[rodent]]s and [[bird]]s, such as, in Central America, the clay-coloured thrush (''[[Turdus grayi]]''). In South America, Hemprichi's coral snake (''[[Micrurus hemprichii]]'') feeds almost exclusively on velvet worms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mongenajera|first1=J.|last2=Barrientos|first2=Z.|last3=Aguilar|first3=F.|title=Behaviour of ''Epiperipatus-biolleyi'' (Onychophora, Peripatidae) laboratory conditions|journal=Revista de Biologica Tropical|date=1993|volume=41|issue=3A|pages=689\u2013696}}</ref> For defence, some species roll themselves reflexively into a spiral, while they can also fight off smaller opponents by ejecting slime. Various [[mite]]s ([[Acari]]) are known to be [[ectoparasite]]s infesting the skin of the velvet worm. Skin injuries are usually accompanied by bacterial infections, which are almost always fatal.\n\n==Conservation==\nThe global [[conservation biology|conservation]] status of velvet worm species is difficult to estimate; many species are only known to exist at their type locality (the location at which they were first observed and described). The collection of reliable data is also hindered by low population densities, their typically [[nocturnal]] behaviour and possibly also as-yet undocumented seasonal influences and sexual dimorphism. To date, the only onychophorans evaluated by the [[IUCN]] are: ''[[Mesoperipatus tholloni]]'' (Data Deficient), ''[[Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis]]'' (Near Threatened), ''[[Peripatoides indigo]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Peripatoides suteri]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Peripatopsis alba]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Peripatopsis clavigera]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Macroperipatus insularis]]'' (Endangered), ''[[Tasmanipatus anophthalmus]]'' (Endangered), ''[[Opisthopatus roseus]]'' (Critically Endangered), ''[[Peripatopsis leonina]]'' (Critically Endangered), and ''[[Speleoperipatus spelaeus]]'' (Critically Endangered).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/en|title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species}}</ref> The primary threat comes from destruction and fragmentation of velvet worm habitat due to [[industrialisation]], draining of [[wetland]]s, and [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture. Many species also have naturally low population densities and closely restricted geographic ranges; as a result, relatively small localised disturbances of important [[ecosystem]]s can lead to the extinction of entire populations or species. Collection of specimens for universities or research institutes also plays a role on a local scale.<ref name=\"trnew\">{{cite journal|last1=New|first1=Tim R|title=Onychophora in invertebrate conservation: priorities, practice and prospects|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|date=1995|volume=114|issue=1|pages=77\u201389|doi=10.1006/zjls.1995.0017}}</ref> There is a very pronounced difference in the protection afforded to velvet worms between regions: in some countries, such as South Africa, there are restrictions on both collecting and [[export]]ing, while in others, such as Australia, only export restrictions exist. Many countries offer no specific safeguards at all. Tasmania has a protection programme that is unique worldwide: one region of forest has its own velvet worm conservation plan, which is tailored to a particular velvet worm species.<ref name=\"trnew\" />\n\n==Phylogeny==\n[[File:Eoperipatus totoro.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Eoperipatus totoro]]'']]\nIn their present forms, the velvet worms are probably very closely related to the arthropods, a very extensive taxon that incorporates, for instance, the crustaceans, insects, and arachnids. They share, among other things, an exoskeleton consisting of  \u03b1-chitin and non-collagenous proteins; gonads and waste-elimination organs enclosed in true coelom tissue; an open blood system with a tubular heart situated at the rear; an abdominal cavity divided into pericardial and perivisceral cavities; respiration via tracheae; and similar embryonic development. Segmentation, with two body appendages per segment, is also shared. However, antennae, mandibles, and oral papillae are probably not homologous to the corresponding features in arthropods, i.e., they probably developed independently. Another closely related group are the comparatively obscure water bears ([[Tardigrada]]); however, due to their very small size, these lack some characteristics of the velvet worms and arthropods, such as blood circulation and separate respiratory structures. Together, the velvet worms, arthropods, and water bears form a [[monophyletic]] taxon, the [[Panarthropoda]], i.e., the three groups collectively cover all descendants of their last common ancestor. Due to certain similarities of form, the velvet worms were usually grouped with the water bears to form the taxon Protoarthropoda. This designation would imply that both velvet worms and water bears are not yet as highly developed as the arthropods. Modern systematic theories reject such conceptions of \"primitive\" and \"highly developed\" organisms and instead consider exclusively the historical relationships among the taxa. These relationships are not as yet fully understood, but it is considered probable that the velvet worms' sister groups form a taxon designated [[Tactopoda]], thus:{{clade|{{clade|1=\n{{nowrap|Velvet worms (Onychophora)}}|label2=[[Tactopoda]]|2={{clade|1=\nWater bears ([[Tardigrada]])|2=\nArthropods ([[Arthropoda]])}}}}|label1=[[Panarthropoda]]}}For a long time, velvet worms were also considered related to the [[annelid]]s. They share, among other things, a worm-like body; a thin and flexible outer skin; a layered musculature; paired waste-elimination organs; as well as a simply constructed brain and simple eyes. Decisive, however, was the existence of segmentation in both groups, with the segments showing only minor specialisation. The parapodia appendages found in annelids therefore correspond to the stump feet of the velvet worms. Within the [[Articulata hypothesis]] developed by [[Georges Cuvier]], the velvet worms therefore formed an evolutionary link between the annelids and the arthropods: worm-like precursors first developed parapodia, which then developed further into stub feet as an intermediate link in the ultimate development of the arthropods' appendages. Due to their structural conservatism, the velvet worms were thus considered \"living fossils\". This perspective was expressed paradigmatically in the statement by the French zoologist A. Vandel:\n\n:''Onychophorans can be considered highly evolved annelids, adapted to terrestrial life, which announced prophetically the Arthropoda. They are a lateral branch which has endured from ancient times until today, without important modifications.''\n\nModern taxonomy does not study criteria such as \"higher\" and \"lower\" states of development or distinctions between \"main\" and \"side\" branches\u2014only family relationships indicated by [[cladistic]] methods are considered relevant. From this point of view, several common characteristics still support the Articulata hypothesis \u2014 segmented body; paired appendages on each segment; pairwise arrangement of waste-elimination organs in each segment; and above all, a rope-ladder-like nervous system based on a double nerve strand lying along the belly. An alternative concept, most widely accepted today, is the so-called [[Ecdysozoa]] [[hypothesis]]. This places the annelids and Panarthropoda in two very different groups: the former in the [[Lophotrochozoa]] and the latter in the Ecdysozoa. Mitochondrial gene sequences also provide support for this hypothesis.<ref>{{ cite journal |title= The Complete Mitochondrial Genome of the Onychophoran ''Epiperipatus biolleyi'' Reveals a Unique Transfer RNA Set and Provides Further Support for the Ecdysozoa Hypothesis |author1=Podsiadlowski, L. |author2=Braband.

For example, in the first case, the rope-ladder nervous system would have developed in the two groups independently, while in the second case, it is a very old characteristic, which does not imply a particularly close relationship between the annelids and Panarthropoda. The Ecdysozoa concept divides the taxon into two, the Panarthropoda into which the velvet worms are placed, and the sister group [[Cycloneuralia]], containing the threadworms ([[Nematoda]]), horsehair worms ([[Nematomorpha]]) and three rather obscure groups: the mud dragons ([[Kinorhyncha]]); penis worms ([[Priapulida]]); and brush-heads ([[Loricifera]]).\n\n{{clade|label1=Protostomia|1={{clade|label1=Ecdysozoa|1={{clade|1=\n{{nowrap|Panarthropoda (arthropods, velvet worms, water bears)}}|2=\nCycloneuralia (threadworms, horsehair worms, and others)}}\n|2=Lophotrochozoa (annelids, molluscs, and others)|3=Others}}}}\n\nParticularly characteristic of the Cycloneuralia is a ring of \"circumoral\" nerves around the mouth opening, which the proponents of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis also recognise in modified form in the details of the nerve patterns of the Panarthropoda. Both groups also share a common skin-shedding mechanism ([[ecdysis]]) and molecular biological similarities. One problem of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is the velvet worms' subterminal mouth position: unlike in the Cycloneuralia, the mouth is not at the front end of the body, but lies further back under the belly. However, investigations into their developmental biology, particularly regarding the development of the head nerves, suggest that this was not always the case and that the mouth was originally terminal (situated at the tip of the body). This is supported by the [[fossil record]]. The \"stem-group arthropod\" hypothesis is very widely accepted, but some trees suggest that the onychophorans may occupy a different position; their brain anatomy is more closely related to that of the [[chelicerate]]s than to any other arthropod.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Nicholas J. |last1=Strausfeld |first2=Camilla Mok |last2=Strausfeld |first3=Rudi |last3=Loesel |first4=David |last4=Rowell |first5=Sally |last5=Stowe |title=Arthropod phylogeny: onychophoran brain organization suggests an archaic relationship with a chelicerate stem lineage |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences |volume=273 |issue=1596 |pages=1857\u201366 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16822744 |pmc=1634797 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3536}}</ref> The modern velvet worms form a monophyletic group, incorporating all the descendants of their common ancestor.

In modern [[zoology]], they are particularly renowned for their curious [[mating]] behaviour and for [[viviparity|bearing live young]].\n\n==Anatomy==\nVelvet worms are [[segmentation (biology)|segmented]] animals with a flattened [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] body cross-section and rows of unstructured body [[appendage]]s known as oncopods or lobopods (informally: stub feet). The animals grow to between 0.5 and 20&nbsp;cm (.2 to 8&nbsp;in), with the average being about 5&nbsp;cm (2 &nbsp;in), and have between 13 and 43 pairs of legs. Their [[skin]] consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin [[wiktionary:pore|pore]]s, [[excretion]] organs and concentrations of [[nerve cell]]s. The individual body sections are largely [[specialization (biology)|unspecialised]]; even the head develops only a little differently from the [[abdomen|abdominal]] segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same [[gene]] as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during [[embryo|embryonic development]], at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the [[protostome]] group, their early development has a [[deuterostome]] trajectory, (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.2628| title = Fate and nature of the onychophoran mouth-anus furrow and its contribution to the blastopore| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 282| issue = 1805| page = 20142628| date = 18 March 2015| last1 = Janssen | first1 = R.| last2 = Jorgensen | first2 = M.| last3 = Lagebro | first3 = L.| last4 = Budd | first4 = G.

Although the number of feet can vary considerably between species, their structure is basically very similar. Rigidity is provided by the [[hydrostatic]] pressure of their [[fluid]] contents, and movement is usually obtained passively by stretching and contraction of the animal's entire body. However, each leg can also be shortened and bent by internal [[muscle]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Due to the lack of joints, this bending can take place at any point along the sides of the leg. In some species, two different organs are found within the feet:\n\n*Crural glands are situated at the shoulder of the legs, extending into the body cavity. They open outwards at the crural papillae\u2014small wart-like bumps on the belly side of the leg\u2014and secrete chemical messenger materials called [[pheromone]]s. Their name comes from the [[Latin]] ''cruralis'' meaning \"of the legs\".\n*Coxal vesicles are pouches located on the belly side of the leg, which can be everted and probably serve in water absorption. They belong to the family Peripatidae and are named from ''coxa'', the Latin word for \"hip\".\n\n[[File:Euperipatoides claw pair.tif|thumb|right|A pair of claws from ''[[Euperipatoides kanangrensis]]'']]\nOn each foot is a pair of retractable, hardened (sclerotised) [[chitin]] claws, which give the taxon its scientific name: Onychophora is derived from the Greek ''onyches'', \"claws\"; and ''pherein'', \"to carry\". At the base of the claws are three to six spiny \"cushions\" on which the leg sits in its resting position and on which the animal walks over smooth substrates. The claws are used mainly to gain a firm foothold on uneven terrain. Each claw is composed of three stacked elements, like Russian nesting dolls. The outermost is shed during ecdysis, which exposes the next element in \u2014 which is fully formed, so does not need time to harden before it is used.<ref name=\"doi10.1038/nature13576\">{{cite journal |first1=Martin R. |last1=Smith |first2=Javier |last2=Ortega-Hern\u00e1ndez |date=October 2014 |title=''Hallucigenia''<nowiki/>'s onychophoran-like claws and the case for Tactopoda |journal=Nature |volume=514 |issue=7522 |pages=363\u20136 |pmid=25132546 |doi=10.1038/nature13576|bibcode=2014Natur.514..363S |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/19108/1/19108.pdf }}</ref> (This distinctive construction identifies many early Cambrian fossils as early offshoots of the onychophoran lineage.<ref name=\"doi10.1038/nature13576\" />) Apart from the pairs of legs, there are three further body appendages, which are at the head and comprise three segments:\n\n* On the first head segment is a pair of slender [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], which serve in [[sensory perception]].

Instead, their fluid-filled body cavity acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, similarly to many unrelated soft-bodied animals that are cylindrically shaped, for example [[sea anemones]] and various [[worm]]s. Pressure of their [[incompressible]] internal bodily fluid on the body wall provides rigidity, and muscles are able to act against it. The body wall consists of a non-cellular outer skin, the [[cuticula]]; a single layer of [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] cells forming an internal skin; and beneath this, usually three layers of muscle, which are embedded in connective tissues. The cuticula is about a [[micrometre|micrometer]] thick and covered with fine [[wiktionary:Villi|villi]]. In composition and structure, it resembles the cuticula of the arthropods, consisting of \u03b1<!--not 'a'-->-chitin and various [[protein]]s,<ref name=Mayer2015/> although not containing [[collagen]]. It can be divided into an external epicuticula and an internal procuticula, which themselves consist of exo- and endo-cuticula. This multi-level structure is responsible for the high flexibility of the outer skin, which enables the velvet worm to squeeze itself into the narrowest crevices. Although outwardly [[water-repellent]], the cuticula is not able to prevent water loss by [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and, as a result, velvet worms can live only in [[microclimate]]s with high [[humidity]] to avoid [[desiccation]]. The surface of the cuticula is scattered with numerous fine papillae, the larger of which carry visible villi-like sensitive bristles. The papillae themselves are covered with tiny [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s, lending the skin a [[velvet]]y appearance (from which the common name is likely derived).

Beneath this lies a thick layer of connective tissue, which is composed primarily of collagen fibres aligned either [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or [[perpendicular]] to the body's longitudinal axis. The colouration of Onychophora is generated by a range of pigments.{{Clarify|date=May 2009}} The solubility of these pigments is a useful diagnostic character: in all arthropods and tardigrades, the body pigment is soluble in ethanol. This is also true for the Peripatidae, but in the case of the Peripatopsidae, the body pigment is insoluble in ethanol.<ref name=Monge1995>{{cite journal |first1=Julian |last1=Monge-Najera |date=May 1995 |title=Phylogeny, biogeography and reproductive trends in the Onychophora |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=21\u201360 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1995.tb00111.x}}</ref>\n\nWithin the connective tissue lie three continuous layers of unspecialised [[smooth muscle|smooth muscular]] tissue. The relatively thick outer layer is composed of annular muscles, and the similarly voluminous inner layer of longitudinal muscles. Between them lie thin diagonal muscles that wind backward and forward along the body axis in a [[spiral]]. Between the annular and diagonal muscles exist fine [[blood vessel]]s, which lie below the superficially recognisable transverse rings of the skin and are responsible for the pseudo-segmented markings.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Beneath the internal muscle layer lies the body cavity. In cross-section, this is divided into three regions by so-called dorso-ventral muscles, which run from the middle of the underbelly through to the edges of the upper side: a central midsection and on the left and right, two side regions that also include the legs.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Circulation===\nThe body cavity is known as a \"pseudocoel\", or [[haemocoel]]. Unlike a true [[coelom]], a pseudocoel is not fully enclosed by a cell layer derived from the embryonic [[mesoderm]]. A coelom is, however, formed around the [[gonad]]s and the waste-eliminating [[nephridia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} As the name ''haemocoel'' suggests, the body cavity is filled with a [[blood]]-like liquid in which all the organs are embedded; in this way, they can be easily supplied with [[nutrient]]s circulating in the blood. This liquid is colourless as it does not contain [[pigment]]s; for this reason, it serves only a limited role in [[oxygen]] transport. Two different types of blood cells (or haemocytes) circulate in the fluid: [[amoebocyte]]s and nephrocytes. The amoebocytes probably function in protection from [[bacteria]] and other foreign bodies; in some species, they also play a role in [[reproduction]]. Nephrocytes absorb [[toxin]]s or convert them into a form suitable for [[clearance (medicine)|elimination]] by the nephridia.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The haemocoel is divided by a horizontal partition, the diaphragm,<!--Do '''''not''''' link this to any article referring to any kind of Chordate diaphragm, in particular not the thoracic diaphragm. They have nothing to do with each other.--> into two parts: the [[pericardial sinus]] along the back and the perivisceral sinus along the belly. The former encloses the tube-like heart, and the latter, the other organs. The diaphragm is perforated in many places, enabling the exchange of fluids between the two cavities.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The heart itself is a tube of annular muscles consisting of [[epithelium|epithelial]] tissues, with two lateral openings ([[wikt:ostium|ostia]]) per segment. While it is not known whether the rear end is open or closed, from the front, it opens directly into the body cavity. Since there are no blood vessels, apart from the fine vessels running between the muscle layers of the body wall and a pair of arteries that supply the antennae, this is referred to as an [[open circulation]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The timing of the pumping procedure can be divided into two parts: [[diastole]] and [[systole (medicine)|systole]]. During diastole, blood flows through the ostia from the pericardial sinus (the cavity containing the heart) into the heart. When the systole begins, the ostia close and the heart muscles contract inwards, reducing the volume of the heart. This pumps the blood from the front end of the heart into the perivisceral sinus containing the organs. In this way, the various organs are supplied with nutrients before the blood finally returns to the pericardial sinus via the perforations in the diaphragm. In addition to the pumping action of the heart, body movements also have an influence on circulation.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Respiration===\nOxygen uptake occurs to an extent via simple [[diffusion]] through the entire body surface, with the coxal vesicles on the legs possibly being involved in some species. However, of most importance is gas exchange via fine unbranched tubes, the [[invertebrate trachea|trachea]]e, which draw oxygen from the surface deep into the various organs, particularly the heart. The walls of these structures, which are less than three micrometers thick in their entirety, consist only of an extremely thin [[biological membrane|membrane]] through which oxygen can easily diffuse. The tracheae originate at tiny openings, the [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s, which themselves are clustered together in dent-like recesses of the outer skin, the [[wikt:atrium|atria]]. The number of \"tracheae bundles\" thus formed is on average around 75 per body segment; they accumulate most densely on the back of the organism.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Unlike the arthropods, the velvet worms are unable to control the openings of their tracheae; the tracheae are always open, entailing considerable water loss in [[arid]] conditions. Water is lost twice as fast as in earthworms and forty times faster than in caterpillars.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=S. M. |last1=Manton |date=June 20, 1949 |title=Studies on the Onychophora. VII.

Here, prey can be mechanically dismembered by the mandibles with their covering of fine toothlets. Two [[saliva]]ry glands discharge via a common conductor into the subsequent \"throat\", which makes up the first part of the front [[intestine]]. The saliva that they produce contains mucus and [[hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s, which initiate [[digestion]] in and outside the mouth. Historically, the salivary glands probably evolved from the waste-elimination organs known as nephridia, which are found homologously in the other body segments.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The throat itself is very muscular, serving to absorb the partially liquified food and to pump it, via the [[oesophagus]], which forms the rear part of the front intestine, into the central intestine. Unlike the front intestine, this is not lined with a cuticula but instead consists only of a single layer of epithelial tissue, which does not exhibit conspicuous indentation as is found in other animals. On entering the central intestine, food particles are coated with a mucus-based [[peritrophic membrane]], which serves to protect the lining of the intestine from damage by sharp-edged particles. The intestinal epithelium secretes further digestive enzymes and absorbs the released nutrients, although the majority of digestion has already taken place externally or in the mouth. Indigestible remnants arrive in the rear intestine, or [[rectum]], which is once again lined with a cuticula and which opens at the [[anus]], located on the underside near to the rear end.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn almost every segment is a pair of excretory organs called nephridia, which are derived from coelom tissue. Each consists of a small pouch that is connected, via a [[flagellum|flagellated]] conductor called a nephridioduct, to an opening at the base of the nearest leg known as a nephridiopore. The pouch is occupied by special cells called [[podocyte]]s, which facilitate [[ultrafiltration]] of the blood through the partition between haemocoelom and nephridium. The composition of the [[urine|urinary]] solution is modified in the nephridioduct by selective recovery of nutrients and water and by isolation of poison and waste materials, before it is excreted to the outside world via the nephridiopore. The most important nitrogenous excretion product is the water-insoluble [[uric acid]]; this can be excreted in solid state, with very little water. This so-called [[uricotelic]] excretory mode represents an adjustment to life on land and the associated necessity of dealing economically with water.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} A pair of former nephridia in the head were converted secondarily into the salivary glands, while another pair in the final segment of male specimens now serve as glands that apparently play a role in reproduction.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Sensation===\nThe entire body, including the stub feet, is littered with numerous papillae: warty protrusions responsive to touch that carry a [[mechanoreceptor|mechanoreceptive]] bristle at the tip, each of which is also connected to further [[sensory nerve cell]]s lying beneath. The mouth papillae, the exits of the slime glands, probably also have some function in [[sensory perception]]. Sensory cells known as \"sensills\" on the \"lips\" or labrum respond to chemical stimuli and are known as [[chemoreceptor]]s. These are also found on the two antennae, which seem to be the velvet worm's most important sensory organs.\n\nExcept in a few (typically [[subterranea (geography)|subterranea]]n) species, one [[simple eye in invertebrates|simply constructed eye]] (ocellus) lies behind each antenna, laterally, just underneath the head.<ref name=Mayer2006/> This consists of a chitinous ball [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], a [[cornea]] and a [[retina]] and is connected to the centre of the [[brain]] via an [[optic nerve]].<ref name=Mayer2006/> The retina comprises numerous pigment cells and photoreceptors; the latter are easily modified flagellated cells, whose [[flagellum]] membranes carry a photosensitive pigment on their surface.

Both the gonads and the gonoduct are derived from true coelom tissue.\n\n[[File:Dissected Euperipatoides.jpg|thumb|right|A dissected ''Euperipatoides kanangrensis''. The two ovaries, full of stage&nbsp;II embryos, are floating to the bottom of the image.]]\nIn females, the two [[ovary|ovaries]] are joined in the middle and to the horizontal diaphragm. The gonoduct appears differently depending on whether the species is live-bearing or [[ovipary|egg-laying]]. In live-bearing species, each exit channel divides into a slender oviduct and a roomy \"womb\", the [[uterus]], in which the embryos develop. The single [[vagina]], to which both uteri are connected, runs outward to the gonopore. In egg-laying species, whose gonoduct is uniformly constructed, the genital opening lies at the tip of a long egg-laying apparatus, the [[ovipositor]]. The females of many species also possess a sperm repository called the ''receptacle seminis'', in which sperm cells from males can be stored temporarily or for longer periods.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nMales possess two separate [[testes]], along with the corresponding sperm vesicle (the [[vesicula seminalis]]) and exit channel (the [[vasa efferentia]]). The two vasa efferentia unite to a common sperm duct, the [[vas deferens]], which in turn widens through the ejaculatory channel to open at the gonopore. Directly beside or behind this lie two pairs of special glands, which probably serve some auxiliary reproductive function; the rearmost glands are also known as anal glands.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} A [[penis]]-like structure has so far been found only in males of the genus ''Paraperipatus'' but has not yet been observed in action.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThere are different mating procedures: In some species males deposit their [[spermatophore]] directly into the female's genitals opening, while others deposit it on the female's body, where the cuticle will collapse and allowing the sperm cells to migrate into the female. There are also Australian species where the male place their spermatophore on top of their head, which is then pressed against the female's genitals. In these species the head have elaborate structures like spikes, spines, hollow stylets, pits, and depressions, whose purpose is to either hold the sperm and / or assist in the sperm transfer to the female. The males of most species also secrete a pheromone from glands on the underside of the legs to attract females.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/animals/worms/velvet-worm/ |title=Velvet worm |website=The Australian Museum}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n===Distribution===\nVelvet worms live in all [[tropical]] habitats and in the [[temperate zone]] of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], showing a [[circumtropical]] and circumaustral distribution.

The claws of the feet are used only on hard, rough terrain where a firm grip is needed; on soft substrates, such as moss, the velvet worm walks on the foot cushions at the base of the claws.\n\nActual locomotion is achieved less by the exertion of the leg muscles than by local changes of body length. This can be controlled using the annular and longitudinal muscles. If the annular muscles are contracted, the body cross-section is reduced, and the corresponding segment lengthens; this is the usual mode of operation of the hydrostatic skeleton as also employed by other worms. Due to the stretching, the legs of the segment concerned are lifted and swung forward. Local contraction of the longitudinal muscles then shortens the appropriate segment, and the legs, which are now in contact with the ground, are moved to the rear. This part of the locomotive cycle is the actual leg stroke that is responsible for forward movement.

The females of many species are fertilized only once during their lives, which leads to [[animal sexual behavior|copulation]] sometimes taking place before the [[reproductive organ]]s of the females are fully developed. In such cases, for example at the age of three months in ''[[Macroperipatus torquatus]]'', the transferred sperm cells are kept in a special [[reservoir]], where they can remain [[:wikt:viable|viable]] for longer periods. Fertilization takes place [[internal fertilisation|internally]], although the mode of [[sperm]] transmission varies widely. In most species, for example in the [[genus]] ''[[Peripatus]]'', a package of sperm cells called the [[spermatophore]] is placed into the genital opening of the female. The detailed process by which this is achieved is in most cases still unknown, a true [[penis]] having been observed only in species of the genus ''Paraperipatus''. In many Australian species, there exist [[dimple]]s or special [[dagger]]- or [[axe]]-shaped structures on the head; the male of ''[[Florelliceps stutchburyae]]'' presses a long [[spine (zoology)|spine]] against the female's genital opening and probably positions its spermatophore there in this way. During the process, the female supports the male by keeping him clasped with the claws of her last pair of legs. The mating behavior of two species of the genus ''[[Peripatopsis]]'' is particularly curious. Here, the male places two-millimetre spermatophores on the back or sides of the female. [[Amoebocyte]]s from the female's [[blood]] collect on the inside of the [[wikt:deposition|deposition]] site, and both the spermatophore's casing and the body wall on which it rests are decomposed via the [[secretion]] of [[enzyme]]s. This releases the sperm cells, which then move freely through the [[haemocoel]], penetrate the external wall of the ovaries and finally fertilize the [[ovum|ova]]. Why this self-inflicted skin injury does not lead to bacterial infections is not yet understood (though likely related to the enzymes used to deteriorate the skin or facilitate the transfer of viable genetic material from male to female). Velvet worms are found in egg-laying ([[ovipary|oviparous]]), egg-live-bearing ([[ovovivipary|ovoviviparous]]) and live-bearing ([[viviparity|viviparous]]) forms.\n\n*Ovipary occurs solely in the Peripatopsidae, often in regions with erratic food supply or unsettled climate. In these cases, the [[yolk]]-rich [[egg (biology)|egg]]s measure 1.3 to 2.0&nbsp;mm and are coated in a protective chitinous shell. [[Maternal]] care is unknown.\n*The majority of species are ovoviviparous: the medium-sized eggs, encased only by a double membrane, remain in the [[uterus]]. The [[embryo]]s do not receive food directly from the mother, but are supplied instead by the moderate quantity of yolk contained in the eggs\u2014they are therefore described as [[lecithotrophic]]. The young emerge from the eggs only a short time before birth. This probably represents the velvet worm's original mode of reproduction, i.e., both oviparous and viviparous species developed from ovoviviparous species.\n*True live-bearing species are found in both families, particularly in tropical regions with a stable climate and regular food supply throughout the year. The embryos develop from eggs only micrometres in size and are nourished in the uterus by their mother, hence the description \"[[matrotrophic]]\". The supply of food takes place either via a secretion from the mother directly into the uterus or via a genuine tissue connection between the epithelium of the uterus and the developing embryo, known as a [[placenta]]. The former is found only outside the American continents, while the latter occurs primarily in America and the Caribbean and more rarely in the [[Old World]]. The [[gestation]] period can amount to up to 15&nbsp;months, at the end of which the [[offspring]] emerge in an advanced stage of development. The embryos found in the uterus of a single female do not necessarily have to be of the same age; it is quite possible for there to be offspring at different stages of development and descended from different males. In some species, young tend to be released only at certain points in the year.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Muriel H. |last1=Walker |first2=Noel N. |last2=Tait |date=December 2004 |title=Studies of embryonic development and the reproductive cycle in ovoviviparous Australian Onychophora (Peripatopsidae) |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=264 |issue=4 |pages=333\u201354 |doi=10.1017/S0952836904005837}}</ref>\n\nA female can have between 1 and 23 offspring per year; development from fertilized ovum to adult takes between 6 and 17&nbsp;months and does not have a [[larva]]l stage. This is probably also the original mode of development. Velvet worms have been known to live for up to six years.\n\n==Ecology==\nThe velvet worm's important predators are primarily various spiders and centipedes, along with [[rodent]]s and [[bird]]s, such as, in Central America, the clay-coloured thrush (''[[Turdus grayi]]''). In South America, Hemprichi's coral snake (''[[Micrurus hemprichii]]'') feeds almost exclusively on velvet worms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mongenajera|first1=J.|last2=Barrientos|first2=Z.|last3=Aguilar|first3=F.|title=Behaviour of ''Epiperipatus-biolleyi'' (Onychophora, Peripatidae) laboratory conditions|journal=Revista de Biologica Tropical|date=1993|volume=41|issue=3A|pages=689\u2013696}}</ref> For defence, some species roll themselves reflexively into a spiral, while they can also fight off smaller opponents by ejecting slime. Various [[mite]]s ([[Acari]]) are known to be [[ectoparasite]]s infesting the skin of the velvet worm. Skin injuries are usually accompanied by bacterial infections, which are almost always fatal.\n\n==Conservation==\nThe global [[conservation biology|conservation]] status of velvet worm species is difficult to estimate; many species are only known to exist at their type locality (the location at which they were first observed and described). The collection of reliable data is also hindered by low population densities, their typically [[nocturnal]] behaviour and possibly also as-yet undocumented seasonal influences and sexual dimorphism. To date, the only onychophorans evaluated by the [[IUCN]] are: ''[[Mesoperipatus tholloni]]'' (Data Deficient), ''[[Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis]]'' (Near Threatened), ''[[Peripatoides indigo]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Peripatoides suteri]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Peripatopsis alba]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Peripatopsis clavigera]]'' (Vulnerable), ''[[Macroperipatus insularis]]'' (Endangered), ''[[Tasmanipatus anophthalmus]]'' (Endangered), ''[[Opisthopatus roseus]]'' (Critically Endangered), ''[[Peripatopsis leonina]]'' (Critically Endangered), and ''[[Speleoperipatus spelaeus]]'' (Critically Endangered).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/en|title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species}}</ref> The primary threat comes from destruction and fragmentation of velvet worm habitat due to [[industrialisation]], draining of [[wetland]]s, and [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture. Many species also have naturally low population densities and closely restricted geographic ranges; as a result, relatively small localised disturbances of important [[ecosystem]]s can lead to the extinction of entire populations or species. Collection of specimens for universities or research institutes also plays a role on a local scale.<ref name=\"trnew\">{{cite journal|last1=New|first1=Tim R|title=Onychophora in invertebrate conservation: priorities, practice and prospects|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|date=1995|volume=114|issue=1|pages=77\u201389|doi=10.1006/zjls.1995.0017}}</ref> There is a very pronounced difference in the protection afforded to velvet worms between regions: in some countries, such as South Africa, there are restrictions on both collecting and [[export]]ing, while in others, such as Australia, only export restrictions exist. Many countries offer no specific safeguards at all. Tasmania has a protection programme that is unique worldwide: one region of forest has its own velvet worm conservation plan, which is tailored to a particular velvet worm species.<ref name=\"trnew\" />\n\n==Phylogeny==\n[[File:Eoperipatus totoro.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Eoperipatus totoro]]'']]\nIn their present forms, the velvet worms are probably very closely related to the arthropods, a very extensive taxon that incorporates, for instance, the crustaceans, insects, and arachnids. They share, among other things, an exoskeleton consisting of  \u03b1-chitin and non-collagenous proteins; gonads and waste-elimination organs enclosed in true coelom tissue; an open blood system with a tubular heart situated at the rear; an abdominal cavity divided into pericardial and perivisceral cavities; respiration via tracheae; and similar embryonic development. Segmentation, with two body appendages per segment, is also shared. However, antennae, mandibles, and oral papillae are probably not homologous to the corresponding features in arthropods, i.e., they probably developed independently. Another closely related group are the comparatively obscure water bears ([[Tardigrada]]); however, due to their very small size, these lack some characteristics of the velvet worms and arthropods, such as blood circulation and separate respiratory structures. Together, the velvet worms, arthropods, and water bears form a [[monophyletic]] taxon, the [[Panarthropoda]], i.e., the three groups collectively cover all descendants of their last common ancestor. Due to certain similarities of form, the velvet worms were usually grouped with the water bears to form the taxon Protoarthropoda. This designation would imply that both velvet worms and water bears are not yet as highly developed as the arthropods. Modern systematic theories reject such conceptions of \"primitive\" and \"highly developed\" organisms and instead consider exclusively the historical relationships among the taxa. These relationships are not as yet fully understood, but it is considered probable that the velvet worms' sister groups form a taxon designated [[Tactopoda]], thus:{{clade|{{clade|1=\n{{nowrap|Velvet worms (Onychophora)}}|label2=[[Tactopoda]]|2={{clade|1=\nWater bears ([[Tardigrada]])|2=\nArthropods ([[Arthropoda]])}}}}|label1=[[Panarthropoda]]}}For a long time, velvet worms were also considered related to the [[annelid]]s. They share, among other things, a worm-like body; a thin and flexible outer skin; a layered musculature; paired waste-elimination organs; as well as a simply constructed brain and simple eyes. Decisive, however, was the existence of segmentation in both groups, with the segments showing only minor specialisation. The parapodia appendages found in annelids therefore correspond to the stump feet of the velvet worms. Within the [[Articulata hypothesis]] developed by [[Georges Cuvier]], the velvet worms therefore formed an evolutionary link between the annelids and the arthropods: worm-like precursors first developed parapodia, which then developed further into stub feet as an intermediate link in the ultimate development of the arthropods' appendages. Due to their structural conservatism, the velvet worms were thus considered \"living fossils\". This perspective was expressed paradigmatically in the statement by the French zoologist A. Vandel:\n\n:''Onychophorans can be considered highly evolved annelids, adapted to terrestrial life, which announced prophetically the Arthropoda. They are a lateral branch which has endured from ancient times until today, without important modifications.''\n\nModern taxonomy does not study criteria such as \"higher\" and \"lower\" states of development or distinctions between \"main\" and \"side\" branches\u2014only family relationships indicated by [[cladistic]] methods are considered relevant. From this point of view, several common characteristics still support the Articulata hypothesis \u2014 segmented body; paired appendages on each segment; pairwise arrangement of waste-elimination organs in each segment; and above all, a rope-ladder-like nervous system based on a double nerve strand lying along the belly. An alternative concept, most widely accepted today, is the so-called [[Ecdysozoa]] [[hypothesis]]. This places the annelids and Panarthropoda in two very different groups: the former in the [[Lophotrochozoa]] and the latter in the Ecdysozoa. Mitochondrial gene sequences also provide support for this hypothesis.<ref>{{ cite journal |title= The Complete Mitochondrial Genome of the Onychophoran ''Epiperipatus biolleyi'' Reveals a Unique Transfer RNA Set and Provides Further Support for the Ecdysozoa Hypothesis |author1=Podsiadlowski, L. |author2=Braband.

For example, in the first case, the rope-ladder nervous system would have developed in the two groups independently, while in the second case, it is a very old characteristic, which does not imply a particularly close relationship between the annelids and Panarthropoda. The Ecdysozoa concept divides the taxon into two, the Panarthropoda into which the velvet worms are placed, and the sister group [[Cycloneuralia]], containing the threadworms ([[Nematoda]]), horsehair worms ([[Nematomorpha]]) and three rather obscure groups: the mud dragons ([[Kinorhyncha]]); penis worms ([[Priapulida]]); and brush-heads ([[Loricifera]]).\n\n{{clade|label1=Protostomia|1={{clade|label1=Ecdysozoa|1={{clade|1=\n{{nowrap|Panarthropoda (arthropods, velvet worms, water bears)}}|2=\nCycloneuralia (threadworms, horsehair worms, and others)}}\n|2=Lophotrochozoa (annelids, molluscs, and others)|3=Others}}}}\n\nParticularly characteristic of the Cycloneuralia is a ring of \"circumoral\" nerves around the mouth opening, which the proponents of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis also recognise in modified form in the details of the nerve patterns of the Panarthropoda. Both groups also share a common skin-shedding mechanism ([[ecdysis]]) and molecular biological similarities. One problem of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is the velvet worms' subterminal mouth position: unlike in the Cycloneuralia, the mouth is not at the front end of the body, but lies further back under the belly. However, investigations into their developmental biology, particularly regarding the development of the head nerves, suggest that this was not always the case and that the mouth was originally terminal (situated at the tip of the body). This is supported by the [[fossil record]]. The \"stem-group arthropod\" hypothesis is very widely accepted, but some trees suggest that the onychophorans may occupy a different position; their brain anatomy is more closely related to that of the [[chelicerate]]s than to any other arthropod.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Nicholas J. |last1=Strausfeld |first2=Camilla Mok |last2=Strausfeld |first3=Rudi |last3=Loesel |first4=David |last4=Rowell |first5=Sally |last5=Stowe |title=Arthropod phylogeny: onychophoran brain organization suggests an archaic relationship with a chelicerate stem lineage |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences |volume=273 |issue=1596 |pages=1857\u201366 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16822744 |pmc=1634797 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3536}}</ref> The modern velvet worms form a monophyletic group, incorporating all the descendants of their common ancestor.

It was first performed by the [[Provincetown Players]] at the Wharf Theatre in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], on August 8, 1916.  In the original performance, Glaspell played the role of Mrs. Hale. The play is frequently anthologized in American literature textbooks. Written at the same time as the first wave of feminism, the play contrasts how women act in public and in private as well as how they perform in front of other women versus how they perform in front of men. \n\n\n\n{{Infobox play\n| name       = Trifles \n| image      = Susan Glaspell.jpg\n| caption    = Susan Glaspell graduation portrait, 1894.\n| writer     = [[Susan Glaspell]]\n| characters = {{plainlist |\n*George Henderson \n*Henry Peters \n*Lewis Hale \n*Mrs. Peters \n*Mrs. Hale \n*John Wright \n*Mrs. Minnie Wright \n}}\n| setting    = The Wright's farmhouse \n| genre      = Tragedy \n}}\n\n\n== Plot ==\n===Characters===\n\n* '''George Henderson''' \u2013 The county attorney (originally played by [[Michael Hulgan]])\n* '''Henry Peters''' \u2013 Local sheriff and husband of Mrs. Peters (originally played by [[Robert Conville]])\n* '''Lewis Hale''' \u2013 Neighbor of the Wrights and husband to Mrs. Hale (originally played by [[George Cram Cook]])\n* '''Mrs. Peters''' \u2013 Wife of the sheriff (originally played by [[Alice Hall (actor)|Alice Hall]])\n* '''Mrs. Hale''' \u2013 Neighbor of the Wrights and wife of Lewis Hale (originally played by [[Susan Glaspell]], and later by Kim Base)\n* '''John Wright''' \u2013 The murder victim and owner of the house\n* '''Mrs. Minnie Wright''' \u2013 John Wright's wife and his suspected murderer\n\n===Summary===\nThe play begins as the men, followed by the women, enter the Wrights\u2019 empty farmhouse. On command from the county attorney, Mr. Hale recounts his visit to the house the previous day, when he found Mrs. Wright behaving strangely and her husband upstairs dead, with a rope around his neck. Later showing us how Mr.Wright died then pays tribute to Mrs.Wright bird that was killed by her husband. Mr. Hale notes that when he questioned her, Mrs. Wright claimed that she was asleep when someone strangled her husband. While the three men are searching the house for evidence, the women find clues to the murder in the kitchen and hallway, such as a dead canary. Outside of how women during this time were being undermined, we see that women look deeper into what men tend to overlook. The wives realize Mr. Wright killed the bird, and that led to Mrs. Wright killing her husband. Although the men find no evidence upstairs in the Wright house that would prove Mrs. Wright guilty, the wives piece together that Minnie was being abused by her husband, and they understand how it feels to be oppressed by men. After the women discover the truth, they hide the evidence against Mrs. Wright so that she is spared the punishment for killing her husband.\n\n=== Background ===\nThe play is loosely based on the murder of John Hossack, which Glaspell reported on while working as a journalist for the ''[[Des Moines Daily News]]''.{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=143}} On December 2, 1900, Hossack's wife, Margaret, reported to the police that an unknown person broke into their house and murdered John with an axe while she slept next to him. Margaret was arrested for the murder a few days later at John's funeral.{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=144}} Glaspell followed the story closely and reported on its development, filing a total of twenty-six stories on the case over the course of Hossack's arrest and trial. Initially, Glaspell's reporting painted a rich portrait of Hossack as a formidable, cold-blooded woman, thoroughly capable of \"having beaten [her husband's] brains out with an axe.\"{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=145}} However, after Glaspell visited the Hossack family farm house to gather materials for her next column, her tone shifted considerably. Subsequent reports from Glaspell showed Hossack under a much more sympathetic light as a meek woman who missed her children.{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=147}} In her article on the inspiration for ''Trifles'', Linda Ben-Zvi writes, \"It is likely that what caused Glaspell to alter her description was her own visit to the Hossack farm, the event she uses as the basis for ''Trifles''.\"{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=146}} After concluding Hossack's trial, in which she was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison, Glaspell resigned her position as a journalist to write fiction.{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=151}} She published ''Trifles'' in 1916, sixteen years after the original trial. A year after that, she reworked the material into a short story titled \"A Jury of Her Peers.\"  In April of 1903, Hossack's case was retried. After the jury failed to return a unanimous decision, she was released and able to return home.{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=152}}\n\n== Analysis ==\n=== Themes ===\nThere is a theme of justice within the play, while the wives of other men recognize Minnie had been abused by her husband, Mrs. Peter and Mrs. Hale seek to  hide the evidence against Minnie so that she will not be found guilty. Mrs.Peter and Mrs. Hale side with Minnie despite her decision to kill her husband. Meanwhile, the male condescension within this play do not see years of abuse Mrs. Wright has gone through. The male condescension, Mr.s Henderson, Peters, and Hale just want to gather the evidence they found against Minnie and have her incarcerated for the murder of her husband. With more that meets the eye, This is where the different types of gender roles play, in how something may look from \"the man's\" perceptive as compared to \"the women's\" perspective. \n\nThe power of silence tells more of a story than actions do. As readers we see this theme play well when gender roles come in to play. Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters, find the dead canary and decide to conceal this information from the men. The women are silent in the beginning of the play as the men believe that their comments and findings are \"trifles\", but become powerful in their silence by the ending. Mrs. Hale's and Mrs. Peters's silence in their knowledge of the canary symbolizes their unity as women, as they can relate to the oppression that Minnie Foster was feeling.{{sfn|Holstein|2003|pp=282\u2013290}}\n\n=== Symbols ===\nMinnie is embodied in her kitchen and sewing things.  The cold weather freezes and breaks her preserve jars, symbolizing the cold environment of her home breaking her spirit, as well as the coldness which causes the characters to fail in human empathy towards each other. The cold weather can also symbolize how Mr. Wright treated Minnie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/trifles/shattered-preserves-symbol.html|title=Shattered Preserves in Trifles|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> The bare kitchen can be seen as a symbol of the lives of the former inhabitants.\n\nThe quilt symbolizes the story that the two women are able to piece together. The quilt Minnie was making included a [[hearth]] in the middle of it. Typically, a hearth is the symbol of a woman\u2019s dominant place in the house. In regards to Minnie, her hearth is broken and the stove is cold. The women conclude that Minnie intended to knot the quilt together, symbolizing the knotted rope that was used to kill John Wright.\n\nThe canary is a significant symbol. It symbolizes Minnie, who Mrs. Hale recalls used to sing herself. Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters find the dead canary hidden in Mrs. Wright's things and realize that Mr. Wright strangled the canary. Mrs. Wright was similarly silenced by John\u2019s abuse. The killing of the canary also symbolizes the loss of Minnie\u2019s voice and her freedom.\n\nAnother symbol is the rocking chair. At the beginning of the play, Mr. Hale states that he opened the door and there sat Mrs. Wright in the rocking chair. The chair can be seen as a form of anxiety for Mrs. Wright. As she sits in the rocking chair she tells Hale that her husband is dead. Also, the rocking chair is described as an old wooden chair within the play. The condition of the chair could depict the downfall and uneasiness of Mrs. Wright\u2019s life over the years. Additionally, the rocking chair serves as a presence for Mrs. Wright since she is never actually present throughout the play. Mr. Wright is also never seen on stage. Their lives and personalities are fleshed out in the dialogue of other characters. The small cast and understated scenery both serve to turn the audience to the inward lives of the characters.  \n\n=== Feminism ===\n\n''Trifles'' is seen as an example of early [[feminist]] drama.  The two female characters, Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale are able to sympathize with Minnie, the victim's wife, and understand her possible motive, which leads them to hide the evidence against her. The men, meanwhile, are blinded by their cold, emotionless investigation of material facts.\n\nThe male characters are prejudiced in believing that nothing important can be discovered in areas of the house where Minnie spent most of her time. They search the barn and the bedroom, places where men have dominance, rather than the kitchen, the only place where a woman would be in charge. One important line, spoken by the sheriff, says of the kitchen \"Nothing here but kitchen things.\"  This dismissal of the importance of a woman's life and the male reluctance to enter the \"women's sphere\" is key in the men's failure to discover the crucial evidence for the case. The most important evidence, the dead canary that the two women find, was hidden in Minnie's sewing basket. The men scorn the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], even kicking some of the items in contempt.\n\nThe two women, having pieced together the murder, face the moral dilemma of telling the men about the motive or protecting Minnie, whom they see as a victim.  Their choice raises questions about solidarity among women, the meaning of justice, and the role of women in society as a source of justice.\n\nIn <i>Trifles</i>, women and men view the nature of Minnie Wright\u2019s crime very differently. The men in this play are blind to the emotional abuse that Minnie went through from her husband. When the play was first published, women were not allowed to vote, serve as legislators, judges, or be on a jury.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Angel|first=Marina|date=|title=Teaching Susan Glaspell's A Jury of Her Peers and Trifles|url=|journal=Journal of Legal Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In America, the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|sixth amendment]] states that the accused are allowed to have a jury of their peers, in 1917 America, if a woman committed a crime and had to go to trial; she would not be surrounded with her peers. However in this instance, the women act as Minnie\u2019s unofficial jury in the kitchen. The women find evidence of abuse and realize that is why Minnie killed her husband for. They end up throwing away and hiding evidence to keep Minnie from being convicted.\n\nPhyllis Mael analyzes \"Trifles\" in regards to developmental psychology. The moral development of women differs from those of men. A woman's moral judgement is \"tied to feelings of empathy and compassion\", whereas a mans moral judgement is \"impersonal\" and \"independent of its emotional origins\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://search-ebscohost-com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=6897362&site=ehost-live&scope=site|title=The Path to Sisterhood|last1=Mael|first1=Phyllis|website=Literature Film Quarterly|accessdate=2019-04-16}}</ref> \n\n=== Title ===\nThe title ''Trifles'' is appropriate for the play because it \"is an obvious nod to the role that details play within the performance\".{{sfn|Bourne|2020|loc=\u00b63}} Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peter both notice specific information within the play that seems irrelevant. However, by the end of the play, it is noted that the \u201csmall details\u201d helped them solve the mystery. Therefore, the role of details in the play is significant. For example, the play obtains many props like the rocking chair, the quilt, and many other items. With this being said, \"props as details not only act as technical elements of the play, but they also reinforce the ultimate theme of ''Trifles'': the importance of details and the ones who truly observe them\".{{sfn|Bourne|2020|loc=\u00b65}}\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe play was adapted by James P. Cavanagh for an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which first aired on December 26, 1961, with the alternate title \u201cA Jury of Her Peers.\u201d  It was directed by Robert Florey, and its cast included Ann Harding, Philip Bourneuf, Frances Reid, Robert Bray, June Walker, and Ray Teal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0508107/|title=A Jury of Her Peers|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0508107/|archive-date=2017|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}</ref> Hitchcock added his usual disclaimer at the end, stating that the killer and her \u201caccomplices\u201d were caught and convicted.\n\n''Trifles'', a [[chamber opera]] in one act, premiered in [[Berkeley, California]], at the Live Oak Theatre on June 17 and 19, 2010.  It was composed by John G. Bilotta, and it is [[libretto]] was written by John F. McGrew.  The chamber opera is scored for five singers and [[Sextet|six instruments]], including a piano, and it requires some basic stage props.  As in the play, the central figures (Mr. and Mrs. Wright) are absent from the cast of characters.  Instead, through the libretto, Lewis Hale reenacts the events surrounding the discovery of Mr. Wright's murder, where he was present.\n\nIn 2016 Centennial Essays, Interviews, and Adaptations celebrated the remembrance and anniversary of Susan Glaspell\u2019s Trifles.

On command from the county attorney, Mr. Hale recounts his visit to the house the previous day, when he found Mrs. Wright behaving strangely and her husband upstairs dead, with a rope around his neck. Later showing us how Mr.Wright died then pays tribute to Mrs.Wright bird that was killed by her husband. Mr. Hale notes that when he questioned her, Mrs. Wright claimed that she was asleep when someone strangled her husband. While the three men are searching the house for evidence, the women find clues to the murder in the kitchen and hallway, such as a dead canary. Outside of how women during this time were being undermined, we see that women look deeper into what men tend to overlook. The wives realize Mr. Wright killed the bird, and that led to Mrs. Wright killing her husband. Although the men find no evidence upstairs in the Wright house that would prove Mrs. Wright guilty, the wives piece together that Minnie was being abused by her husband, and they understand how it feels to be oppressed by men. After the women discover the truth, they hide the evidence against Mrs. Wright so that she is spared the punishment for killing her husband.\n\n=== Background ===\nThe play is loosely based on the murder of John Hossack, which Glaspell reported on while working as a journalist for the ''[[Des Moines Daily News]]''.{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=143}} On December 2, 1900, Hossack's wife, Margaret, reported to the police that an unknown person broke into their house and murdered John with an axe while she slept next to him. Margaret was arrested for the murder a few days later at John's funeral.{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=144}} Glaspell followed the story closely and reported on its development, filing a total of twenty-six stories on the case over the course of Hossack's arrest and trial. Initially, Glaspell's reporting painted a rich portrait of Hossack as a formidable, cold-blooded woman, thoroughly capable of \"having beaten [her husband's] brains out with an axe.\"{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=145}} However, after Glaspell visited the Hossack family farm house to gather materials for her next column, her tone shifted considerably. Subsequent reports from Glaspell showed Hossack under a much more sympathetic light as a meek woman who missed her children.{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=147}} In her article on the inspiration for ''Trifles'', Linda Ben-Zvi writes, \"It is likely that what caused Glaspell to alter her description was her own visit to the Hossack farm, the event she uses as the basis for ''Trifles''.\"{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=146}} After concluding Hossack's trial, in which she was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison, Glaspell resigned her position as a journalist to write fiction.{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=151}} She published ''Trifles'' in 1916, sixteen years after the original trial. A year after that, she reworked the material into a short story titled \"A Jury of Her Peers.\"  In April of 1903, Hossack's case was retried. After the jury failed to return a unanimous decision, she was released and able to return home.{{sfn|Ben-Zvi|1992|pp=152}}\n\n== Analysis ==\n=== Themes ===\nThere is a theme of justice within the play, while the wives of other men recognize Minnie had been abused by her husband, Mrs. Peter and Mrs. Hale seek to  hide the evidence against Minnie so that she will not be found guilty. Mrs.Peter and Mrs. Hale side with Minnie despite her decision to kill her husband. Meanwhile, the male condescension within this play do not see years of abuse Mrs. Wright has gone through. The male condescension, Mr.s Henderson, Peters, and Hale just want to gather the evidence they found against Minnie and have her incarcerated for the murder of her husband. With more that meets the eye, This is where the different types of gender roles play, in how something may look from \"the man's\" perceptive as compared to \"the women's\" perspective. \n\nThe power of silence tells more of a story than actions do. As readers we see this theme play well when gender roles come in to play. Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters, find the dead canary and decide to conceal this information from the men. The women are silent in the beginning of the play as the men believe that their comments and findings are \"trifles\", but become powerful in their silence by the ending. Mrs. Hale's and Mrs. Peters's silence in their knowledge of the canary symbolizes their unity as women, as they can relate to the oppression that Minnie Foster was feeling.{{sfn|Holstein|2003|pp=282\u2013290}}\n\n=== Symbols ===\nMinnie is embodied in her kitchen and sewing things.  The cold weather freezes and breaks her preserve jars, symbolizing the cold environment of her home breaking her spirit, as well as the coldness which causes the characters to fail in human empathy towards each other. The cold weather can also symbolize how Mr. Wright treated Minnie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/trifles/shattered-preserves-symbol.html|title=Shattered Preserves in Trifles|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> The bare kitchen can be seen as a symbol of the lives of the former inhabitants.\n\nThe quilt symbolizes the story that the two women are able to piece together. The quilt Minnie was making included a [[hearth]] in the middle of it. Typically, a hearth is the symbol of a woman\u2019s dominant place in the house. In regards to Minnie, her hearth is broken and the stove is cold.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=|title=feminism as theme in twentieth-century american women's drama|last=Friedman|first=Sharon|date=19 April 2020|website=JSTOR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The women conclude that Minnie intended to knot the quilt together, symbolizing the knotted rope that was used to kill John Wright.\n\nThe canary is a significant symbol. It symbolizes Minnie, who Mrs. Hale recalls used to sing herself. Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters find the dead canary hidden in Mrs. Wright's things and realize that Mr. Wright strangled the canary. Mrs. Wright was similarly silenced by John\u2019s abuse.<ref name=\":1\" /> The killing of the canary also symbolizes the loss of Minnie\u2019s voice and her freedom.\n\nAnother symbol is the rocking chair. At the beginning of the play, Mr. Hale states that he opened the door and there sat Mrs. Wright in the rocking chair. The chair can be seen as a form of anxiety for Mrs. Wright. As she sits in the rocking chair she tells Hale that her husband is dead. Also, the rocking chair is described as an old wooden chair within the play. The condition of the chair could depict the downfall and uneasiness of Mrs. Wright\u2019s life over the years. Additionally, the rocking chair serves as a presence for Mrs. Wright since she is never actually present throughout the play. Mr. Wright is also never seen on stage. Their lives and personalities are fleshed out in the dialogue of other characters. The small cast and understated scenery both serve to turn the audience to the inward lives of the characters.  \n\n=== Feminism ===\n\n''Trifles'' is seen as an example of early [[feminist]] drama.  The two female characters, Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale are able to sympathize with Minnie, the victim's wife, and understand her possible motive, which leads them to hide the evidence against her. The men, meanwhile, are blinded by their cold, emotionless investigation of material facts.\n\nThe male characters are prejudiced in believing that nothing important can be discovered in areas of the house where Minnie spent most of her time. They search the barn and the bedroom, places where men have dominance, rather than the kitchen, the only place where a woman would be in charge. One important line, spoken by the sheriff, says of the kitchen \"Nothing here but kitchen things.\"  This dismissal of the importance of a woman's life and the male reluctance to enter the \"women's sphere\" is key in the men's failure to discover the crucial evidence for the case. The most important evidence, the dead canary that the two women find, was hidden in Minnie's sewing basket. The men scorn the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], even kicking some of the items in contempt.\n\nThe two women, having pieced together the murder, face the moral dilemma of telling the men about the motive or protecting Minnie, whom they see as a victim.  Their choice raises questions about solidarity among women, the meaning of justice, and the role of women in society as a source of justice.\n\nIn <i>Trifles</i>, women and men view the nature of Minnie Wright\u2019s crime very differently. The men in this play are blind to the emotional abuse that Minnie went through from her husband. When the play was first published, women were not allowed to vote, serve as legislators, judges, or be on a jury.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Angel|first=Marina|date=|title=Teaching Susan Glaspell's A Jury of Her Peers and Trifles|url=|journal=Journal of Legal Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In America, the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|sixth amendment]] states that the accused are allowed to have a jury of their peers, in 1917 America, if a woman committed a crime and had to go to trial; she would not be surrounded with her peers. However in this instance, the women act as Minnie\u2019s unofficial jury in the kitchen. The women find evidence of abuse and realize that is why Minnie killed her husband for. They end up throwing away and hiding evidence to keep Minnie from being convicted.\n\nPhyllis Mael analyzes \"Trifles\" in regards to developmental psychology. The moral development of women differs from those of men. A woman's moral judgement is \"tied to feelings of empathy and compassion\", whereas a mans moral judgement is \"impersonal\" and \"independent of its emotional origins\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://search-ebscohost-com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=6897362&site=ehost-live&scope=site|title=The Path to Sisterhood|last1=Mael|first1=Phyllis|website=Literature Film Quarterly|accessdate=2019-04-16}}</ref> \n\n=== Title ===\nThe title ''Trifles'' is appropriate for the play because it \"is an obvious nod to the role that details play within the performance\".{{sfn|Bourne|2020|loc=\u00b63}} Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peter both notice specific information within the play that seems irrelevant. However, by the end of the play, it is noted that the \u201csmall details\u201d helped them solve the mystery. Therefore, the role of details in the play is significant. For example, the play obtains many props like the rocking chair, the quilt, and many other items. With this being said, \"props as details not only act as technical elements of the play, but they also reinforce the ultimate theme of ''Trifles'': the importance of details and the ones who truly observe them\".{{sfn|Bourne|2020|loc=\u00b65}}\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe play was adapted by James P. Cavanagh for an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which first aired on December 26, 1961, with the alternate title \u201cA Jury of Her Peers.\u201d  It was directed by Robert Florey, and its cast included Ann Harding, Philip Bourneuf, Frances Reid, Robert Bray, June Walker, and Ray Teal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0508107/|title=A Jury of Her Peers|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0508107/|archive-date=2017|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}</ref> Hitchcock added his usual disclaimer at the end, stating that the killer and her \u201caccomplices\u201d were caught and convicted.\n\n''Trifles'', a [[chamber opera]] in one act, premiered in [[Berkeley, California]], at the Live Oak Theatre on June 17 and 19, 2010.  It was composed by John G. Bilotta, and it is [[libretto]] was written by John F. McGrew.  The chamber opera is scored for five singers and [[Sextet|six instruments]], including a piano, and it requires some basic stage props.  As in the play, the central figures (Mr. and Mrs. Wright) are absent from the cast of characters.  Instead, through the libretto, Lewis Hale reenacts the events surrounding the discovery of Mr. Wright's murder, where he was present.\n\nIn 2016 Centennial Essays, Interviews, and Adaptations celebrated the remembrance and anniversary of Susan Glaspell\u2019s Trifles.
