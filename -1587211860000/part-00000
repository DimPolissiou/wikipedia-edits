It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation, while the gameplay systems remained largely similar to previous entries, with the addition of new elements such as Materia, [[Limit Breaks]] and new [[minigames]]. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{US$|80 million|long=no}}.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success. It remains widely regarded as a landmark title, and as one of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards, and was acknowledged for boosting sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[console role-playing games]] worldwide.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between [[Miyamoto Musashi]] and [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]], with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a fixed-width font and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old [[wiktionary:grawlix|comic book '@#$%!']]-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans.

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation, while the gameplay systems remained largely similar to previous entries, with the addition of new elements such as Materia, [[Limit Breaks]] and new [[minigames]]. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{US$|80 million|long=no}}.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success. It remains widely regarded as a landmark title, and as one of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards, and was acknowledged for boosting sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[console role-playing games]] worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English [[Language localisation|localization]]. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', and an ongoing [[Final Fantasy VII Remake|high-definition episodic remake]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Gameplay}}\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy VII'' is mostly comparable to earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing games]].<ref name=\"gamespotps1\">{{cite web|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |title=Final Fantasy VII Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |language=en |date=September 29, 1997 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090337/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref> The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.<ref name=\"All Game\"/><ref name=ps1manual>{{Cite book| year=1997 | author=Square Co.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between [[Miyamoto Musashi]] and [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]], with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair. However, Nomura feared that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, so he redesigned Cloud to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project.<ref name=\"FFVIIhistory\"/> The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 1994 |title=You Should Know This Game: Final Fantasy VII |magazine=Computer and Video Games |issue=185 |page=88 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB#page/n87/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317043635/https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB |archivedate=March 17, 2016 }}</ref> The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending.

Uematsu then decided that the higher quality audio was not worth the trade-off with performance, and opted instead to use [[MIDI]]-like sounds produced by the console's internal [[sound chip|sound sequencer]], similar to how his soundtracks for the previous games in the series on the [[Super NES]] were implemented.<ref name=\"Hist of FF7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/01/ign-presents-the-history-of-final-fantasy-vii |title=IGN Presents: The History of Final Fantasy VII |page=1 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=News Corporation |first=Rus |last=McLaughlin |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=January 11, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128130134/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/01/ign-presents-the-history-of-final-fantasy-vii |archivedate=January 28, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"RPGFOST\">{{cite web |author1=Schweitzer, Ben |author2=Gann, Patrick | title=Final Fantasy VII OST| date=June 17, 2006 | publisher=RPGFan | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ost/index.html | accessdate=July 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214810/http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ost/index.html |archivedate=January 16, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> While the Super NES only had eight sound channels to work with, the PlayStation had twenty-four.

To help with promoting the title overseas, Square dissolved their original Washington offices and hired new staff for fresh offices in Costa Mesa.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> It was first exhibited to the Western public at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|Electronic Entertainment Expo 1996]] (E3).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|title=PlayStation at E3: 1996|work=[[PlayStation Blog]]|publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928230514/http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|archivedate=September 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo promote the game overseas, Square and Sony launched a widespread three-month advertising campaign in August 1997. Beginning with a television commercial by [[TBWA\\Chiat\\Day]] that ran alongside popular shows including ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', and ''[[Prime Time Sports]]'', the campaign included numerous articles in both gaming and general interest magazines, advertisements in comics from publishers such as [[DC Comics]] and Marvel, a special collaboration with [[Pepsi]], media events, sample discs, and merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|date=August 27, 1997 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PlayStation%27s+Final+Fantasy+VII+Marketing+Blitz+Continues%3b+Consumers...-a019701566 |title=PlayStation's Final Fantasy VII Marketing Blitz Continues |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com|The Free Library]] |work=[[Business Wire]] |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20141126191653/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PlayStation's+Final+Fantasy+VII+Marketing+Blitz+Continues;+Consumers...-a019701566 |archivedate=November 26, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> According to estimations by Takechi, the total worldwide marketing budget came to {{US$|40 million|long=no}};

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a fixed-width font and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old [[wiktionary:grawlix|comic book '@#$%!']]-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans.

The difference in size and proportion between some breeds are as great as those between any wild genera, but all dogs are clearly members of the same species.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2408805|jstor=2408805|title=Cranial Morphology of Domestic and Wild Canids: The Influence of Development on Morphological Change|journal=Evolution|volume=40|issue=2|pages=243|year=1986|last1=Wayne|first1=Robert K.|pmid=28556057}}</ref> In 2010, a study of dog skull shape compared to extant [[carnivorans]] proposed that \"The greatest shape distances between dog breeds clearly surpass the maximum divergence between species in the Carnivora.

Wolves are [[dolichocephaly|dolichocephalic]] (long skulled) but not as extreme as some breeds of dogs such as greyhounds and Russian wolfhounds (McGreevy 2004). Canine [[brachycephaly]] (short-skulledness) is found only in domestic dogs and is related to [[paedomorphosis]] (Goodwin 1997).

Their legs can propel them forward rapidly, leaping as necessary to chase and overcome prey. They have small, tight feet, walking on their toes (thus having a [[digitigrade]] stance and locomotion). Their rear legs are fairly rigid and sturdy. The front legs are loose and flexible with only muscle attaching them to the torso.\n\nThe dog's muzzle size will vary with the breed. Dogs with medium muzzles, such as the German Shepherd Dog, are called [[mesocephalic]] and dogs with a pushed in muzzle, such as the Pug, are called brachycephalic. Today's [[toy dog|toy]] breeds have skeletons that mature in only a few months, while giant breeds, such as the [[English Mastiff|Mastiff]]s, take 16 to 18&nbsp; months for the skeleton to mature. [[Dwarfism]] has affected the proportions of some breeds' skeletons, as in the [[Basset Hound]].\n\nAll dogs (and all living [[Canidae]]) have a ligament connecting the spinous process of their first thoracic (or chest) vertebra to the back of the axis bone (second cervical or neck bone), which supports the weight of the head without active muscle exertion, thus saving energy.<ref name=\" Wang 2008. pp.97-8\">Wang, Xiaoming and Tedford, Richard H. Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. pp.97-8</ref> This ligament is analogous in function (but different in exact structural detail) to the [[nuchal ligament]] found in [[ungulate]]s.<ref name=\" Wang 2008. pp.97-8\"/> This ligament allows dogs to carry their heads while running long distances, such as while following scent trails with their nose to the ground, without expending much energy.<ref name=\" Wang 2008. pp.97-8\"/>\n\nDogs have disconnected shoulder bones (lacking the collar bone of the human skeleton) that allow a greater stride length for running and leaping. They walk on four toes, front and back, and have vestigial [[dewclaw]]s on their front legs and on their rear legs. When a dog has extra dewclaws in addition to the usual one in the rear, the dog is said to be \"double dewclawed.\"\n\n===Size===\n[[File:Dog size variation.png|thumb|The difference in overall body size between a [[Cane Corso]] (Italian mastiff) and a [[Yorkshire terrier]] is over 30-fold, yet both are members of the same species.]]Dogs are highly variable in height and weight.

The study found a [[regulatory sequence]] next to the gene [[Insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF1) and together with the gene and regulatory sequence \"is a major contributor to body size in all small dogs.\" Two variants of this gene were found in large dogs, making a more complex reason for large breed size.

When a dog's footpad is exposed to the cold, heat loss is prevented by an adaptation of the blood system that recirculates heat back into the body. It brings blood from the skin surface and retains warm blood in the pad surface.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3164.2011.00976.x|pmid=21438930|title=Functional anatomy of the footpad vasculature of dogs: Scanning electron microscopy of vascular corrosion casts|journal=Veterinary Dermatology|volume=22|issue=6|pages=475\u201381|year=2011|last1=Ninomiya|first1=Hiroyoshi |last2=Akiyama|first2=Emi|last3=Simazaki|first3=Kanae|last4=Oguri|first4=Atsuko|last5=Jitsumoto|first5=Momoko|last6=Fukuyama|first6=Takaaki}}</ref>\n\n===Dewclaw===\nThere is some debate about whether a dewclaw helps dogs to gain traction when they run because, in some dogs, the dewclaw makes contact when they are running and the nail on the dewclaw often wears down in the same way that the nails on their other toes do from contact with the ground. However, in many dogs, the dewclaws never make contact with the ground. In this case, the dewclaw's nail never wears away and it is then often trimmed to keep it to a safe length.\n\nThe dewclaws are not dead appendages. They can be used to lightly grip bones and other items that dogs hold with their paws. However, in some dogs, these claws may not appear to be connected to the leg at all except by a flap of skin. In such dogs, the claws do not have a use for gripping as the claw can easily fold or turn.\n\nThere is also some debate as to whether dewclaws should be surgically removed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}The argument for removal states that dewclaws are a weak digit, barely attached to the leg, so they can rip partially off or easily catch on something and break which can be extremely painful and prone to infection. Others say the pain of removing a dewclaw is far greater than any other risk. For this reason, removal of dewclaws is illegal in many countries. There is, perhaps, an exception for hunting dogs who can sometimes tear the dewclaw while running in overgrown vegetation. [3] If a dewclaw is to be removed, this should be done when the dog is a puppy, sometimes as young as 3&nbsp; days old; although, it can also be performed on older dogs if necessary (the surgery may be more difficult then). The surgery is fairly straightforward and may even be done with only local anesthetics if the digit is not well connected to the leg. Unfortunately, many dogs can't resist licking at their sore paws following the surgery, so owners need to remain vigilant in their aftercare.\n\nIn addition, for those dogs whose dewclaws make contact with the ground when they run, it is possible that removing them could be a disadvantage for a dog's speed in running and changing direction, particularly in performance dog sports such as dog agility.\n\n==Senses==\n<!--Note: Other articles will be linked to this section shortly, including the domestic Dog, Dog Intelligence, and Dog Behavior.-->\n\n===Vision{{anchor|Sight}}===\n[[File:Auge Hund Diagramm engl.jpg|thumb|300px|Frequency sensitivity compared with humans.]]\nLike most mammals, dogs have only two types of cone photoreceptor, making them [[dichromacy|dichromats]].<ref name=\"coren\"/><ref name=\"note1\">{{Cite book|author = A&E Television Networks|title = Big Dogs, Little Dogs: The companion volume to the A&E special presentation|publisher = GT Publishing|series = A Lookout Book|year = 1998|isbn = 1-57719-353-9|url = https://archive.org/details/bigdogslittledog00arts}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"note2\">{{Cite book|title = The Dog|author = Alderton, David|year = 1984|publisher = Chartwell Books|isbn = 0-89009-786-0|url = https://archive.org/details/dogmostcompletei00alde}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Davis\">{{cite web|author = Jennifer Davis|title = Dr. P's Dog Training: Vision in Dogs & People|year = 1998|url = http://www.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/LA/davis2.htm|accessdate = 20 February 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209224340/http://www4.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/LA/davis2.htm|archive-date = 9 February 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> These [[cone cells]] are maximally sensitive between 429&nbsp;nm and 555&nbsp;nm.

Unlike humans, the dog does not need to fill up his lungs as he continuously brings the odor into his nose in bursts of 3-7 sniffs. The dog's nose has a bony structure inside that humans don't have, which allows the air that has been sniffed to pass over a bony shelf and many odor molecules stick to it. The air above this shelf is not washed out when the dog breathes normally, so the scent molecules accumulate in the nasal chambers and the scent builds with intensity, allowing the dog to detect the faintest of odors.<ref name=coren2000/>{{rp|247}}\n\nOne study into the learning ability of dogs compared to wolves indicated that dogs have a better sense of smell than wolves when locating hidden food, but there has yet been no experimental data to support this view.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00868| title = Social learning from humans or conspecifics: Differences and similarities between wolves and dogs| journal = Frontiers in Psychology| volume = 4| year = 2013| last1 = Vir\u00e1nyi | first1 = Z.

The sweet taste buds in dogs respond to a chemical called furaneol which is found in many fruits and in tomatoes. It appears that dogs do like this flavor and it probably evolved because in a natural environment dogs frequently supplement their diet of small animals with whatever fruits happen to be available. Because of dogs' dislike of bitter tastes, various sprays, and gels have been designed to keep dogs from chewing on furniture or other objects. Dogs also have taste buds that are tuned for water, which is something they share with other carnivores but is not found in humans. This taste sense is found at the tip of the dog's tongue, which is the part of the tongue that he curls to lap water. This area responds to water at all times, but when the dog has eaten salty or sugary foods the sensitivity to the taste of water increases. It is proposed that this ability to taste water evolved as a way for the body to keep internal fluids in balance after the animal has eaten things that will either result in more urine being passed or will require more water to adequately process. It certainly appears that when these special water taste buds are active, dogs seem to get an extra pleasure out of drinking water, and will drink copious amounts of it.<ref>[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201104/how-good-is-your-dogs-sense-taste Coren, Stanley]</ref>\n\n===Touch===\n[[File: Close up of dog's whiskers.jpg|thumb|200px|A dog's whiskers act as sensing organs.]]\nThe main difference between human and dog touch is the presence of specialized [[whiskers]] known as vibrissae. Vibrissae are present above the dog's eyes, below their jaw, and on their muzzle. They are sophisticated sensing organs. Vibrissae are more rigid and embedded much more deeply in the skin than other hairs and have a greater number of receptor cells at their base. They can detect air currents, subtle vibrations, and objects in the dark. They provide an early warning system for objects that might strike the face or eyes, and probably help direct food and objects towards the mouth.<ref>, Santos, A \"Puppy and Dog Care: An Essential Puppy Training Guide\", 2015 Amazon Digital Services, Inc.

These turbinates allow for heat exchange between small arteries and veins on their [[wiktionary:maxilloturbinal|maxilloturbinate]] surfaces (the surfaces of turbinates positioned on [[maxilla]] bone) in a counter-current heat-exchange system. Dogs are capable of prolonged chases, in contrast to the ambush predation of cats, and these complex turbinates play an important role in enabling this (cats only possess a much smaller and less-developed set of nasal turbinates).<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|88}} This same complex turbinate structure helps conserve water in arid environments. The water conservation and thermoregulatory capabilities of these well-developed turbinates in dogs may have been crucial adaptations that allowed dogs (including both domestic dogs and their wild prehistoric ancestors) to survive in the harsh [[Arctic]] environment and other cold areas of northern Eurasia and North America, which are both very dry and very cold.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|87}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|32em|refs=\n<ref name=miklosi2009>{{cite book|author=Mikl\u00f3si, Ad\u00e1m |title=Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929585-2|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199295852.001.0001}}</ref>\n<ref name=wang2008>[[Xiaoming Wang (paleontologist)|Wang, Xiaoming]] (2008) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=LnWdpK7ctI0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Dogs:+Their+Fossil+Relatives+and+Evolutionary+History%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=48TFVOqcDMvr8AXDpoDYCw&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Dogs%3A%20Their%20Fossil%20Relatives%20and%20Evolutionary%20History%22&f=false ''Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History''] Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|9780231509435}}</ref>\n<ref name=coren2000>Coren, Stanley ''How To Speak Dog: Mastering the Art of Dog-Human Communication'' 2000 Simon & Schuster, New York.</ref>}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|author=Klaus-Dieter Budras|title=Anatomy of the Dog: With Aaron Horowitz and Rolf Berg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kEuBQAAQBAJ|date=7 December 2010|publisher=Schl\u00fctersche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH & Company KG|isbn=978-3-89993-099-3}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Alexandra |year=2009 |title=[[Inside of a Dog|Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know]] |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |isbn=9781416583400 |oclc=973655798}} {{Google books|pqJRCIXAFSgC|Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know}}.\n* {{cite book|author1=Howard E.

Canine [[brachycephaly]] (short-skulledness) is found only in domestic dogs and is related to [[paedomorphosis]] (Goodwin 1997). Puppies are born with short snouts, with the longer skull of dolichocephalic dogs emerging in later development (Coppinger 1995). Other differences in head shape between brachycephalic and dolichocephalic dogs include changes in the craniofacial angle (angle between the [[Basilar plexus|basilar axis]] and [[hard palate]]) (Regod\u00f3n 1993), morphology of the [[temporomandibular joint]] (Dickie 2001), and radiographic anatomy of the [[cribriform plate]] (Schwarz 2000).<ref name=roberts2010>{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0011946|pmid=20668685|title=Human Induced Rotation and Reorganization of the Brain of Domestic Dogs|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=5|issue=7|pages=e11946|year=2010|last1=Roberts|first1=Taryn|last2=McGreevy|first2=Paul|last3=Valenzuela|first3=Michael|pmc=2909913}} All cited in Roberts.</ref>\n\nOne study found that the relative reduction in dog skull length compared to its width (the [[Cephalic Index]]) was significantly correlated to both the position and the angle of the brain within the skull.

They have a spongy appearance due to the presence of a system of delicate branches of the [[bronchioles]] in each lung, ending in closed, thin-walled chambers (the points of gas exchange) called [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]].\n\nThe presence of a muscular structure, the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], exclusive to mammals, divides the [[peritoneal cavity]] from the [[pleural cavity]], besides assisting the lungs during inhalation.\n\n===Digestive system===\nThe organs that make up the canine [[digestive system]] are:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/outreach/Pet-Health-Topics/categories/cat-and-dog-anatomy/digestive-system-of-the-dog |title=Digestive System of the Dog |author=Washington State University |access-date=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n* [[Mouth]]\n* [[Tongue]]\n* [[Esophagus]]\n* [[Stomach]]\n* [[Liver]]\n* [[Pancreas]]\n* [[Large intestine]]\n* [[Small intestine]]\n* [[Rectum]]\n* [[Anus]]\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Dog cecum.jpg|Dog [[cecum]].\nFile:Dog digestive tract.jpg|Dog [[digestive tract]].\nFile:Dog stomach.jpg|Dog [[stomach]].\nFile:Dog stomach (open, inner view).jpg|Dog stomach (open, inner view).\nFile:Technique of formalin fixation applied to dog tongue.jpg|Technique of formalin fixation applied to dog [[tongue]].\nFile:Dog ilium.jpg|Dog [[ileum]].\nFile:Dog liver.jpg|Vascular structure of the dog [[liver]].\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==={{visible anchor|Reproductive system|Genitalia|Reproductive anatomy}}===\n{{further|Canine reproduction#Canine sexual anatomy and development}}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Knie hund beschriftet.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Dog knee]]\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2015}}\n\nLike most predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, a [[cardiovascular]] system that supports both sprinting and endurance and teeth for catching, holding, and tearing.\n\nThe dog's muscles provides the ability to jump and leap. Their legs can propel them forward rapidly, leaping as necessary to chase and overcome prey. They have small, tight feet, walking on their toes (thus having a [[digitigrade]] stance and locomotion). Their rear legs are fairly rigid and sturdy. The front legs are loose and flexible with only muscle attaching them to the torso.\n\nThe dog's muzzle size will vary with the breed. Dogs with medium muzzles, such as the German Shepherd Dog, are called [[mesocephalic]] and dogs with a pushed in muzzle, such as the Pug, are called brachycephalic. Today's [[toy dog|toy]] breeds have skeletons that mature in only a few months, while giant breeds, such as the [[English Mastiff|Mastiff]]s, take 16 to 18&nbsp; months for the skeleton to mature. [[Dwarfism]] has affected the proportions of some breeds' skeletons, as in the [[Basset Hound]].\n\nAll dogs (and all living [[Canidae]]) have a ligament connecting the spinous process of their first thoracic (or chest) vertebra to the back of the axis bone (second cervical or neck bone), which supports the weight of the head without active muscle exertion, thus saving energy.<ref name=\" Wang 2008. pp.97-8\">Wang, Xiaoming and Tedford, Richard H. Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. pp.97-8</ref> This ligament is analogous in function (but different in exact structural detail) to the [[nuchal ligament]] found in [[ungulate]]s.<ref name=\" Wang 2008. pp.97-8\"/> This ligament allows dogs to carry their heads while running long distances, such as while following scent trails with their nose to the ground, without expending much energy.<ref name=\" Wang 2008. pp.97-8\"/>\n\nDogs have disconnected shoulder bones (lacking the collar bone of the human skeleton) that allow a greater stride length for running and leaping. They walk on four toes, front and back, and have vestigial [[dewclaw]]s on their front legs and on their rear legs. When a dog has extra dewclaws in addition to the usual one in the rear, the dog is said to be \"double dewclawed.\"\n\n===Size===\n[[File:Dog size variation.png|thumb|The difference in overall body size between a [[Cane Corso]] (Italian mastiff) and a [[Yorkshire terrier]] is over 30-fold, yet both are members of the same species.]]Dogs are highly variable in height and weight.

The study found a [[regulatory sequence]] next to the gene [[Insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF1) and together with the gene and regulatory sequence \"is a major contributor to body size in all small dogs.\" Two variants of this gene were found in large dogs, making a more complex reason for large breed size. The researchers concluded this gene's instructions to make dogs small must be at least 12,000&nbsp; years old and it is not found in wolves.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sutter NB, Bustamante CD, Chase K |title=A single IGF1 allele is a major determinant of small size in dogs |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5821 |pages=112\u20135 |date=Apr 2007 |pmid=17412960 |doi=10.1126/science.1137045 |pmc=2789551 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>  Another study has proposed that [[lap dog]]s (small dogs) are among the oldest existing [[dog type]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ostrander EA |title=Genetics and the Shape of Dogs; Studying the new sequence of the canine genome shows how tiny genetic changes can create enormous variation within a single species |journal=Am.

When a dog's footpad is exposed to the cold, heat loss is prevented by an adaptation of the blood system that recirculates heat back into the body. It brings blood from the skin surface and retains warm blood in the pad surface.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3164.2011.00976.x|pmid=21438930|title=Functional anatomy of the footpad vasculature of dogs: Scanning electron microscopy of vascular corrosion casts|journal=Veterinary Dermatology|volume=22|issue=6|pages=475\u201381|year=2011|last1=Ninomiya|first1=Hiroyoshi |last2=Akiyama|first2=Emi|last3=Simazaki|first3=Kanae|last4=Oguri|first4=Atsuko|last5=Jitsumoto|first5=Momoko|last6=Fukuyama|first6=Takaaki}}</ref>\n\n===Dewclaw===\nThere is some debate about whether a dewclaw helps dogs to gain traction when they run because, in some dogs, the dewclaw makes contact when they are running and the nail on the dewclaw often wears down in the same way that the nails on their other toes do from contact with the ground. However, in many dogs, the dewclaws never make contact with the ground. In this case, the dewclaw's nail never wears away and it is then often trimmed to keep it to a safe length.\n\nThe dewclaws are not dead appendages. They can be used to lightly grip bones and other items that dogs hold with their paws. However, in some dogs, these claws may not appear to be connected to the leg at all except by a flap of skin. In such dogs, the claws do not have a use for gripping as the claw can easily fold or turn.\n\nThere is also some debate as to whether dewclaws should be surgically removed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}The argument for removal states that dewclaws are a weak digit, barely attached to the leg, so they can rip partially off or easily catch on something and break which can be extremely painful and prone to infection. Others say the pain of removing a dewclaw is far greater than any other risk. For this reason, removal of dewclaws is illegal in many countries. There is, perhaps, an exception for hunting dogs who can sometimes tear the dewclaw while running in overgrown vegetation. [3] If a dewclaw is to be removed, this should be done when the dog is a puppy, sometimes as young as 3&nbsp; days old; although, it can also be performed on older dogs if necessary (the surgery may be more difficult then). The surgery is fairly straightforward and may even be done with only local anesthetics if the digit is not well connected to the leg. Unfortunately, many dogs can't resist licking at their sore paws following the surgery, so owners need to remain vigilant in their aftercare.\n\nIn addition, for those dogs whose dewclaws make contact with the ground when they run, it is possible that removing them could be a disadvantage for a dog's speed in running and changing direction, particularly in performance dog sports such as dog agility.\n\n==Senses==\n<!--Note: Other articles will be linked to this section shortly, including the domestic Dog, Dog Intelligence, and Dog Behavior.-->\n\n===Vision{{anchor|Sight}}===\n[[File:Auge Hund Diagramm engl.jpg|thumb|300px|Frequency sensitivity compared with humans.]]\nLike most mammals, dogs have only two types of cone photoreceptor, making them [[dichromacy|dichromats]].<ref name=\"coren\"/><ref name=\"note1\">{{Cite book|author = A&E Television Networks|title = Big Dogs, Little Dogs: The companion volume to the A&E special presentation|publisher = GT Publishing|series = A Lookout Book|year = 1998|isbn = 1-57719-353-9|url = https://archive.org/details/bigdogslittledog00arts}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"note2\">{{Cite book|title = The Dog|author = Alderton, David|year = 1984|publisher = Chartwell Books|isbn = 0-89009-786-0|url = https://archive.org/details/dogmostcompletei00alde}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Davis\">{{cite web|author = Jennifer Davis|title = Dr. P's Dog Training: Vision in Dogs & People|year = 1998|url = http://www.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/LA/davis2.htm|accessdate = 20 February 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209224340/http://www4.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/LA/davis2.htm|archive-date = 9 February 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> These [[cone cells]] are maximally sensitive between 429&nbsp;nm and 555&nbsp;nm.

Unlike humans, the dog does not need to fill up his lungs as he continuously brings the odor into his nose in bursts of 3-7 sniffs. The dog's nose has a bony structure inside that humans don't have, which allows the air that has been sniffed to pass over a bony shelf and many odor molecules stick to it. The air above this shelf is not washed out when the dog breathes normally, so the scent molecules accumulate in the nasal chambers and the scent builds with intensity, allowing the dog to detect the faintest of odors.<ref name=coren2000/>{{rp|247}}\n\nOne study into the learning ability of dogs compared to wolves indicated that dogs have a better sense of smell than wolves when locating hidden food, but there has yet been no experimental data to support this view.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00868| title = Social learning from humans or conspecifics: Differences and similarities between wolves and dogs| journal = Frontiers in Psychology| volume = 4| year = 2013| last1 = Vir\u00e1nyi | first1 = Z.

The sweet taste buds in dogs respond to a chemical called furaneol which is found in many fruits and in tomatoes. It appears that dogs do like this flavor and it probably evolved because in a natural environment dogs frequently supplement their diet of small animals with whatever fruits happen to be available. Because of dogs' dislike of bitter tastes, various sprays, and gels have been designed to keep dogs from chewing on furniture or other objects. Dogs also have taste buds that are tuned for water, which is something they share with other carnivores but is not found in humans. This taste sense is found at the tip of the dog's tongue, which is the part of the tongue that he curls to lap water. This area responds to water at all times, but when the dog has eaten salty or sugary foods the sensitivity to the taste of water increases. It is proposed that this ability to taste water evolved as a way for the body to keep internal fluids in balance after the animal has eaten things that will either result in more urine being passed or will require more water to adequately process. It certainly appears that when these special water taste buds are active, dogs seem to get an extra pleasure out of drinking water, and will drink copious amounts of it.<ref>[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201104/how-good-is-your-dogs-sense-taste Coren, Stanley]</ref>\n\n===Touch===\n[[File: Close up of dog's whiskers.jpg|thumb|200px|A dog's whiskers act as sensing organs.]]\nThe main difference between human and dog touch is the presence of specialized [[whiskers]] known as vibrissae. Vibrissae are present above the dog's eyes, below their jaw, and on their muzzle. They are sophisticated sensing organs. Vibrissae are more rigid and embedded much more deeply in the skin than other hairs and have a greater number of receptor cells at their base. They can detect air currents, subtle vibrations, and objects in the dark. They provide an early warning system for objects that might strike the face or eyes, and probably help direct food and objects towards the mouth.<ref>, Santos, A \"Puppy and Dog Care: An Essential Puppy Training Guide\", 2015 Amazon Digital Services, Inc.

These turbinates allow for heat exchange between small arteries and veins on their [[wiktionary:maxilloturbinal|maxilloturbinate]] surfaces (the surfaces of turbinates positioned on [[maxilla]] bone) in a counter-current heat-exchange system. Dogs are capable of prolonged chases, in contrast to the ambush predation of cats, and these complex turbinates play an important role in enabling this (cats only possess a much smaller and less-developed set of nasal turbinates).<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|88}} This same complex turbinate structure helps conserve water in arid environments. The water conservation and thermoregulatory capabilities of these well-developed turbinates in dogs may have been crucial adaptations that allowed dogs (including both domestic dogs and their wild prehistoric ancestors) to survive in the harsh [[Arctic]] environment and other cold areas of northern Eurasia and North America, which are both very dry and very cold.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|87}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|32em|refs=\n<ref name=miklosi2009>{{cite book|author=Mikl\u00f3si, Ad\u00e1m |title=Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929585-2|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199295852.001.0001}}</ref>\n<ref name=wang2008>[[Xiaoming Wang (paleontologist)|Wang, Xiaoming]] (2008) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=LnWdpK7ctI0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Dogs:+Their+Fossil+Relatives+and+Evolutionary+History%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=48TFVOqcDMvr8AXDpoDYCw&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Dogs%3A%20Their%20Fossil%20Relatives%20and%20Evolutionary%20History%22&f=false ''Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History''] Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|9780231509435}}</ref>\n<ref name=coren2000>Coren, Stanley ''How To Speak Dog: Mastering the Art of Dog-Human Communication'' 2000 Simon & Schuster, New York.</ref>}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|author=Klaus-Dieter Budras|title=Anatomy of the Dog: With Aaron Horowitz and Rolf Berg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kEuBQAAQBAJ|date=7 December 2010|publisher=Schl\u00fctersche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH & Company KG|isbn=978-3-89993-099-3}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Alexandra |year=2009 |title=[[Inside of a Dog|Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know]] |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |isbn=9781416583400 |oclc=973655798}} {{Google books|pqJRCIXAFSgC|Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know}}.\n* {{cite book|author1=Howard E.

It is said that in ancient times the lama (Bhudhist spiritual leader), who ruled the area name was Lama Kastiyang. and the name kusting was derived from the lama's name.\nThe language spoken is [[Balti language|Balti]]. The entire population is Muslim of the [[Noorbakshia Islam|Sofia Noorbakhshia]] \nIn the past it was the trade route to [[Ladakh]] and [[Kargil town|Kargil]].\n\n== Geography ==\nHassanabad has an average elevation of about {{convert|2670|m}}, and is situated along the banks of the [[Shyok River]], a tributary of the [[Indus River|Indus]]. Villages near Hassanabad includes Marcha, Dawoo, Piun, Partuk, Siksa and Franu.\n\nThe mountains and surrounding have generally no forests however there are some shrubs and herbs available which are generally used by the local communities as medicinal herbs and for their cattle,\nThe Shyok River passing nearby the village is one of the important resources for irrigating the whole lands. However the same river sometime creates havoc during summer through its unpredictable floods.\n\n==Administrartion==\nHassanabad consists of 7 block. Painkhor, Gabkhor, Thangkhor, Hajipakhor, Goostrang, Komick and Oraitan\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Hassanabad during the summer is moderated by its mountain setting and the intense heat of lowland [[Pakistan]] does not reach here. The mountains also block out the summer monsoon and summer rainfall is thus quite low. However, these mountains result in very severe winter weather. During the April to October temperatures vary between a maximum of 27&nbsp;\u00b0C and a minimum (in October) 8&nbsp;\u00b0C.
