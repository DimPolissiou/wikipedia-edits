She is a [[Grandmaster (martial arts)|martial arts grandmaster]] and one of the most skilled combatants in the [[DC Universe]].

Orphan.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Becoming Lady Shiva===\n\n====Pre-Crisis====\n[[File:Shivadragon.png|thumb|Cover to ''Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter'' #5, Shiva's first appearance. Art by [[Dick Giordano]].]]\n\nShiva's first introduced as an antagonist to martial artist [[Richard Dragon]], believing him to be a spy responsible for the murder of her sister, Carolyn. In reality, Carolyn's murder was orchestrated by Guano Cravat, a corrupt businessman whose criminal ambitions had been foiled by Dragon. Cravat convinced Woosan that Dragon killed Carolyn, deliberately pitting her against Dragon in an act of revenge.\n\nIn order to avenge her sister, Woosan becomes a master combatant. During the course of her training, she discovers that she is a [[wikt:prodigy|prodigy]], rapidly mastering several martial arts and eventually dubbing herself \"Lady\" Shiva.\n\nWhen Shiva tracks Dragon down and lures him to Cravat's hideout, Dragon reveals Cravat's deception. The Swiss, Carolyn's real murderer and Cravat's underling, had already died in battle with Dragon, rendering Shiva's vendetta moot.\n\nAfterward, she briefly takes up crimefighting with Dragon and fellow martial artist [[Bronze Tiger|Ben Turner]], to allay her feelings of purposelessness, saying \"I tolerate Dragon because danger seems to cling to him like flies to honey... and without danger my life is empty!\" <ref>''Richard Dragon'' #7 (January 2005)</ref> Dragon, in hopes that she might follow his example and use her skills for good, coaxes her to explore the spiritual side of martial arts, to no apparent success. When the three eventually part ways, Shiva begins a wandering existence, training herself further, and eventually parlaying her skills into a career as a master assassin.\n\n====Post-Crisis====\nShiva was born in a [[shanty town]], in an unknown country, and raised to be a warrior and protector of the village. Eventually, Shiva fled the village with her sister. Years later, when the heroine [[Black Canary]] visits the village to experience Shiva's training, a village child named [[Sin (DC Comics)|Sin]] is held hostage by the villagers, with the promise that if Canary fails to become the warrior-protector of the village, Sin is to take her place, suggesting that Shiva's sister was once used in a similar manner.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 1) #92-95 (May\u2013August 2006)</ref> Speaking about her childhood, Sin says that [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s League of Assassins ran the village where she and Shiva were born and raised.<ref>''Black Canary'' #1 (September 2007)</ref>\n\nThe sisters moved to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], using the names Sandra and Carolyn Wu-San. There, they devoted their time to practicing the martial arts. Because of the girls' young ages, talent, and unique bond as sisters, their practice evolved into a secret, perfected language that only they could share. Out of love for her sister, Sandra held back in her spars with Carolyn. The assassin [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]] saw this restraint in Sandra one day when he visited Detroit to see the siblings perform. Considering Sandra a kindred spirit, Cain murdered Carolyn, in order to remove the obstruction that blunted Sandra's true potential.\n\nDiscovering that David Cain had murdered her sister, Sandra hunted him down, only to be lured into an ambush by Ra's al Ghul's League of Assassins, of which Cain was a member. In the heat of a losing battle, Sandra realized how Carolyn had held her back, and how much undeveloped potential she had. Cain spared her life, and in exchange, Sandra agreed to bear Cain a child, and leave it for him to raise. The child, [[Cassandra Cain]], was to be Ra's al Ghul's \"One Who Is All,\" a perfected bodyguard, whose only form of communication was literacy in body language, and whose sole instinct was for hand-to-hand combat. With Carolyn gone, Cassandra and Sandra were the only two humans known to share this gift. The day of Cassandra's birth, Sandra set out to become reborn as the Lady Shiva: creator and destroyer.\n\n===Professional assassin===\n\n====Meeting the Question====\nDuring her time with Richard Dragon, Shiva becomes addicted to combat and life-or-death situations. Already a very accomplished martial artist, Shiva hires herself out as a [[mercenary]] both to recapture the thrill and to finance further training. Her considerable skills allow her to ask a high price for her services, and she soon becomes highly sought after.\n\nShiva is eventually hired by Reverend Hatch, the corrupt adjunct to the mayor of [[Hub City (comics)|Hub City]], to fight troublesome masked crimefighter the [[Question (comics)|Question]]. She defeats him with ease, but rather than have Shiva kill him, Hatch instead has his men beat the Question further, shoot him in the head with an air gun, and dump him into the river. Seeing \"a passion for combat\" in the hero, Shiva rescues a near-death Question, and brings him to Richard Dragon's mountain hideaway, to give him a chance to fulfill his potential. In his civilian identity as Victor Sage, the Question enters Dragon's tutelage, training in combat and undergoing a spiritual awakening.\n\nOn leaving Dragon, Sage meets Shiva, who orders him to fight her. She ends the fight after only a few moves, and confirms her own suspicions of a \"warrior's passion\" in him, because he was willing to fight her even after his previous, crushing defeat. However, influenced by Dragon's philosophy, Sage proposes that he was simply \"curious\" what would happen if they fought again. Shiva leaves without telling Sage why she saved him, and Sage readopts the identity of the Question, returning to Hub City.\n\n====Shiva and the O-Sensei====\nShiva eventually travels to [[Manchuria]] to visit with her godfather, the [[O-Sensei (comics)|O-Sensei]], former instructor of [[Richard Dragon]] and [[Bronze Tiger]]. After living over 150 years, he has finally decided to die. He intends to keep a promise to his wife, and be buried alongside her, but his wife's family had hidden her remains to punish him for abandoning her. The O-Sensei has Shiva select three warriors to aid him in the search for her remains: the Question, [[Green Arrow]], and [[Batman]]. Reluctant to acknowledge the O-Sensei's death wish, Shiva expresses her ambivalence both verbally and physically, unnecessarily applying deadly force in battles with O-Sensei's assailants.\n\nShiva and the O-Sensei then travel to Hub City, meeting with the Question, who, in turn, brokered Shiva's first meeting with Batman. Compelled to test his skill, Shiva immediately fights the [[vigilante]] only to be stopped by the O-Sensei. They do, however, convince Batman to aid them.<ref>''Detective Comics Annual'' (vol. 1) #1 (1989)</ref>\n\nIn their search for [[Green Arrow]], Shiva encounters [[sexual slavery|slave traders]], killing all except one, who successfully cuts her; she rewards him with a kiss on the forehead. After locating Green Arrow, she meets [[Black Canary]] for the first time, and spars with the hero. Although Canary does not know it at the time, the two had both studied under Sensei Otomo, though non-concurrently.\n\nAfter recruiting Green Arrow, Shiva returns to Hub City, and saves the Question from an attack by former employees of the now-dead Reverend Hatch. Shiva kills the men, who had been after a fortune in [[embezzlement|embezzled]] funds stored in Hatch's abandoned home, and sets fire to the money. Later, she nurses the Question's elderly friend Tot back to health. While the Question puzzles over her inscrutable and violent nature, she confesses that the O-Sensei was \"the one man I am certain I would not harm if he kissed me.\"\n\nWhen Batman discovers that the remains of the O-Sensei's wife had been moved to a small island, Shiva, the O-Sensei, Green Arrow, and the Question set out for the island, only to be caught in a storm. The O-Sensei is lost overboard, but the group discovers that his wife's remains had likewise been mislaid, years earlier, while in transport, leaving O-Sensei's promise fulfilled.\n\n====Toward Sodom and Gomorrah====\nWhen Hub City falls victim to rapid, systemic [[urban decay]], Shiva returns to offer her services to one of the ruling gangs, but instead kills the members for sending \"unskilled\" men to kill her. On meeting the Question, she is dismayed to find that staying in Hub City has atrophied his fighting skills. Nevertheless, she repeatedly saves both him and his lover, Mayor Myra Fermin, from assassins.\n\nShe vanishes some time later, only to reappear stepping out of a helicopter meant to rescue the Question and his companions, who have decided to flee the city. Shiva explains that though the Question and his friends wished to leave, it is now a fit place for her to go toward. The Question and Shiva have a final exchange before he leaves.\n\n{{quote|I never know what to say to you, Shiva. I'm afraid that if it's the wrong thing, you'll destroy me.\"<br>\"Ah. Then you have not yet understood the grand secret.\"<br>\"Which is?\"<br>\"I cannot destroy you unless you permit me to.|from ''The Question #36'', by [[Denny O'Neil]]}}\n\n====After Hub City====\nShiva continues to work as a mercenary for money, challenge, and perfection of her skills. Eventually, she crosses paths with the [[League of Assassins]], and its leader, [[Ra's al Ghul]], and begins an on-and-off association with them. Though she has kept close ties with the League, she sometimes works against their interests, as seen during ''[[Batman: Legacy]]''.\n\nWhile training prospective assassins, mercenaries, and [[terrorist]]s in [[Lebanese Civil War|war-torn Lebanon]], she is approached by [[Jason Todd]], the second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and his guardian Batman, acting on an evidence that she had associated with Todd's father, and speculating that she might be his mother.\n\nEager to finally face Batman uninterrupted, Shiva knocks Robin unconscious and challenges the Dark Knight. Initially underestimating Shiva, Batman soon learns that her skills are such that she could kill him, and begins to fight in earnest. It takes intervention from Robin to knock Shiva unconscious and subdue her for interrogation. When asked if she was Jason's mother, Shiva laughs, sarcastically claiming to have littered dozens of babies across the globe. When Batman doses her with [[sodium thiopental|sodium pentothal]], Shiva claims to have no children, confirming that Jason is not her son. Batman leaves her in the desert, reasoning that she would soon free herself from her bonds. Shiva warns him that they would meet again, to which Batman simply replies, \"Too bad.\"\n\nLater, Shiva begins to track down those who referred to themselves as [[Shihan]], \"Master,\" or any other title proclaiming mastery of a martial arts form. She would learn what she could from them and, depending on their skill and personal whim, kill them when they were of no further use to her.\n\n===Teaching a Little Bird===\nIn further pursuit of her art, Shiva tracks the defeats of martial arts masters, in order to discover new techniques. In this way, she develops an interest in the defeat of Koroshi, master of the art of [[karate|empty-handed fighting]]. Gaining no information from Koroshi himself, she begins to search for [[King Snake]], the man rumored to have defeated him. During her search, she meets [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]], who is fighting King Snake's criminal organization, the Ghost Dragons, as part of his training to become the third [[Robin (character)|Robin]].\n\nShiva sees potential in Drake, and takes him on as a student. As a bonus, she offers to train him in one weapon, and he chooses the [[B\u014d|bo staff]]. Shiva derisively mentions that it is not a lethal weapon, and Drake explains that was the reason he had chosen it. At the end of his training, he defeats Shiva in a sparring match with the bo, and she gives him a collapsible bo staff.\n\nEventually, they discover that the Ghost Dragons are creating a [[virus|virulent]] [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Robin, Shiva, and ally Clyde Rawlins attempt to stop them from releasing it, but the Dragons escape with a few canisters. After tracking them to [[Hong Kong]], they eventually defeat King Snake, though Rawlins dies in the attempt and Shiva mostly witnesses the proceedings. While King Snake hangs precariously on the ledge of a building, Shiva orders Robin to kill him to signify his \"graduation\" and become her \"weapon.\" Robin refuses and leaves. Shiva then throws King Snake off the ledge herself, though he survives the fall.\n\n===Getting involved with Gotham===\nAfter [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] breaks Batman's back, Batman seeks training from Shiva to help him regain his skills and fighting spirit (see ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Batman: Knightfall: KnightsEnd]]''). Though she deems him unworthy of her efforts, she devises a training regimen, out of respect for what he had been before his injuries. As part of this training, Shiva kills the [[Armless Master]], a sensei notable for training [[Catwoman]], while wearing a [[tengu]] mask, making sure that his death was both witnessed and relayed to his best students. Shiva then makes Batman wear the mask while performing training missions. He is then ambushed by the master's students, who mistake him for the \"Tengu Mask warrior.\" He defeats all of them in turn, but Shiva attempts to complete Batman's training by manipulating him into killing an opponent using her fatal [[Leopard Blow]]. Batman simply feigns using the maneuver on an assailant to trick her into believing he used lethal force. Shiva later discovers the truth, but does not seek vengeance.\n\nLater, she helps Batman fight [[Ra's al Ghul]] and his [[League of Assassins]], including [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], when Ghul attempts to release a deadly virus called Ebola Gulf A that would have killed half the world's population (see ''[[Batman: Legacy]]''). The trail leads Batman to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[India]]. Since their knowledge of the city is limited, [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] contacts Shiva, who agrees to help Batman. Together they defeat Ghul's men and prevent the virus from being released.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 1) #534 (September 1996)</ref>\n\nShiva later travels to an army base in Transbelvia to fight a young political rebel and martial artist named [[Dava (comics)|Dava Sb\u00f6rsc]], who specializes in undefeatable \"single-blow techniques\" and wishes to learn Shiva's Leopard Blow. Instead, Dava's friend, her former pupil [[Tim Drake]], in his identity as Robin, jumps into the fray in her place. Granted superspeed by a drug Dava gave him, and unused to its effects, Robin unwittingly uses lethal force, killing Shiva in battle. He quickly administers [[CPR]], both reviving Shiva and dosing her with the drug. Thus enhanced, she kills attacking soldiers while Robin and Dava make their escape, vanishing immediately after.\n\nDuring the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' story arc, Shiva fights in the Brotherhood of the Monkey Fist's martial arts tournament under the alias \"Paper Monkey\".<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 2) #23 (August 1998)</ref><ref name=ga135>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 2) #135 (August 1998)</ref> In a final, close battle, she fights and defeats [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]], the Green Arrow. As repayment for saving her life, Robin asks her to spare Connor. She relents, warning Robin that this use of her favor means she would challenge and kill him when he grew older.<ref name=ga135 />\n\nOver the years, Shiva amasses groups of followers who worship her as an incarnation of [[Shiva]], the [[Hindu]] representation of the lord of destruction. She pays them little attention, occasionally using them as lackeys or killing them when it suits her whims. Some of her followers have even created temples to honor her victories, one of which is in Gotham, which she later destroys.\n\n===Shiva and Batgirl===\nAt age 8, Shiva's daughter Cassandra flees from David Cain, horrified after killing a man with her bare hands on her first assassination. She then wanders the world as a [[Muteness|mute]], and, seeking redemption, finds herself in Gotham City during the events of [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]. Seeing promise in Cassandra, Batman and former Batgirl, [[Barbara Gordon]], give Cassandra their blessings to take up the mantle of Batgirl.\n\nEventually, Batgirl's skills attract Shiva's attention. Without telling her of their relationship, Shiva challenges Batgirl to a battle to the death. To Shiva's disappointment, she defeats Batgirl soundly. Batgirl's body language fluency is newly impaired by a [[telepath]]'s forcible inculcation of the ability to speak. Wanting to fight Batgirl at her peak, Shiva spares her life, and promises to retrain her on the condition that they have a rematch in one year. The secret to being undefeatable, Shiva explains, is to not fear death, even to seek it. Under Shiva's care, Batgirl soon regains her abilities.\n\nShiva reappears to fight Batgirl at the Forum of The Twelve Caesars, and kills her in combat. Realizing that Batgirl had not given her all, Shiva revives her. Batgirl admits to harboring a death wish ever since Cain first forced her to kill; her ability to perfectly read the agony of her victim had deeply [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] her. Having overcome her death wish, Batgirl fights Shiva again, shattering her sword. In the midst of battle, Batgirl accuses Shiva of having a death wish herself, really only traveling and fighting in search of her own death. Batgirl thus defeats Shiva.\n\n===A new Sensei===\nIn [[Gail Simone]]'s ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|''Birds of Prey'']]'' series, during a joint hunt with Black Canary for the murderer of a shared, beloved [[sensei]], a sensei Shiva so respected that she has vowed to never use anything he taught her in a fight where her goal was the death of her opponent, Shiva is beaten and kidnapped by supervillain [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]]. Cheshire ties up, gags and locks Shiva in the trunk of a car wired with explosives, so as to use a charred corpse in a plan to fake her death and flee the country after murdering a senator. Shiva is saved when Catwoman discovers her. After Cheshire confesses to murdering their sensei, Black Canary punches her out of a helicopter (using [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Ted Grant's]] Haymaker) to prevent Shiva from killing her in a vengeful rage. Shiva subsequently offers to share her knowledge with Black Canary, who takes her offer under consideration.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 1) #62-67 (February\u2013July 2004)</ref>\n\nCassandra begins to suspect that Shiva is her mother, but cannot provoke Cain into an admission. She embarks on a search for Shiva, eventually finding her as the new sensei of the [[League of Assassins]] under the leadership of [[Nyssa Raatko]], Ra's al Ghul's eldest daughter. In battle, Cassandra sacrifices her life to save former League member Tigris from an attack by her own unsuccessful experimental predecessor, Mad Dog. Shiva decides to resurrect Cassandra in a [[Lazarus Pit]] to reveal the truth of her heritage, and fight her once more.\n\nOn reviving her, Shiva admits that the reason she agreed to give birth was that she hoped her child would be the one to kill her. In an evenly matched battle, Cassandra breaks Shiva's neck, [[paralysis|paralyzing]] her. She appears ready to place Shiva in the Lazarus Pit, but Shiva pleads with her not to do so. In response, Cassandra impales Shiva on a hook hanging over the pit, apparently killing her. Although Cassandra's intent regarding this action is left ambiguous, whether to kill her or let her fall into the pit and be revived, it has been confirmed that Shiva is alive in ''[[One Year Later]]''. Cassandra then abandons the identity of Batgirl and returns to her life as a wanderer.\n\nDuring the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, Shiva later appears as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].\n\n===\"One Year Later\"===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal \n | header    = \n | width     = 161\n | image1    = Shivaoyl.PNG\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Shiva as the Jade Canary, from ''Birds of Prey'' #92 (May 2006). Art by Paulo Siqueira.\n }}\nIn the 2006 \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline, having switched places with Black Canary in order to allow them both to experience each other's life experiences, Shiva joins [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]'s covert team of female operatives known as the [[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]] (with Canary hoping that spending time with them would soften Shiva), using the name \"Jade Canary\".<ref name=bop92 /> Shiva remains unchanged, however. Oracle semiseriously refers to Shiva as a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]], and refuses to call Shiva by the Jade Canary title, even though Shiva (as part of the deal with Canary) has taken to wearing Black Canary's boots and trademark fishnet stockings (though she hates wearing them).<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 1) #94 (July 2006)</ref>\n\nShiva continues to perform solo work, and visits Robin to assist him (much to Robin's chagrin) in discovering the truth behind Batgirl's recent disappearance and recent upheaval within the League of Assassins. She refuses to allow herself or Oracle's team to be involved, and instead trusts her former pupil to handle the situation. It appears that she holds no ill-will towards Cassandra as she informs Tim that she hopes that her daughter is well.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\nDuring a recent mission, Oracle's team confronts the villain [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]], whose helmet allows him to copy the skills of 30 of the world's greatest martial artists, including Shiva herself. This had allowed him a victory against Batman in the past. Shiva believes that his files on her would be out of date, and that she would be able to defeat her \"old self\". She seems unconcerned about the skills of the other 29 fighters, and apparently decides to attack Prometheus head-on. Prometheus, however, has more up-to-date files than Shiva suspected, and in three seconds knocks her to the ground. After this defeat, Shiva vanishes, leaving a message for Black Canary: \"Tell the Canary, I release her.\"<ref name=\"Prey 2006\">''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 1) #95 (August 2006)</ref>\n\nStripped of her chance to mold Black Canary in her own image, and stripped of Sin, the young girl who was next in line as her successor, Shiva is last seen talking to Bethany Thorne, daughter of the late [[Crime Doctor (DC Comics)|Crime Doctor]]. It appears that she is yet again hoping to train a new heir in the art of her lethal form of martial arts.<ref name=\"Prey 2006\"/>\n\nStill, although Shiva is no longer an active member of the Birds of Prey, she continues to be protective of her former teammates. Such is the case when the Birds of Prey are being threatened by [[Spy Smasher#Katarina Armstrong|Spy Smasher]], who attempts to steal control away from Oracle. After a mission in [[Russia]], Oracle and Spy Smasher fight against one another for control of the team. Although Oracle is unable to use her legs, she is victorious, although Spy Smasher attempts to go back on their deal. Unfortunately, she is confronted outside by every single living Birds of Prey Agent Oracle has ever recruited, who warn her against ever going after Oracle again; Lady Shiva is among them. When Barbara later asks the others who called Shiva, no one responds.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 1) #108 (September 2007)</ref>\n\n===\"Blackest Night\"===\nDuring the events of the \"[[Blackest Night]]\", Shiva tracks down [[Renee Montoya]], the new Question, and tells her she intends to test her in battle. The two women begin their duel, only to be interrupted when Victor Sage, now a reanimated [[Black Lantern]], arrives on the scene and attacks them. Using his new [[supernatural]] abilities, Sage effortlessly defeats Shiva and tries to kill her by tearing out her heart. However, Shiva realizes that the Black Lanterns feed on human emotion, and cuts herself off from all feeling through the use of [[meditation]], rendering her invisible to Sage. After the others on the scene do the same, Victor angrily departs.<ref>''The Question'' (vol. 1) #37 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n===\"Brightest Day\"===\nDuring the events of the \"[[Brightest Day]]\" crossover, a new martial artist known as the [[Twelve Brothers In Silk|White Canary]] comes to Gotham and sets a plan into motion to ruin Black Canary's life by framing her for the murder of a European terrorist. When Black Canary first encounters the White Canary, she muses that the villain may be Shiva in disguise.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 2) #1-2 (July\u2013August 2010)</ref> but later White Canary pits Black Canary against Lady Shiva in an honor bound match to the death after breaking Black Canary's wrist, thereby making sure she would be killed. Both parties accept because White Canary dangles the life of Sin, Black Canary's adopted daughter, as her bait. However, [[Helena Bertinelli|the Huntress]] challenges Shiva instead and even manages to knock her down, to everyone's surprise, even after receiving many blows. The death match is stopped when Black Canary rescues Sin herself and points out a technicality, they need not continue the battle to the death immediately and can pick it up at any time in the future.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\n===The New 52===\nIn [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Lady Shiva appears in ''Nightwing'' #0. After she defeats Batman, Dick Grayson fights her in his debut as Robin with a costume composed of spare Bat costume parts. Lady Shiva easily defeats him and encourages him to stop living in Batman's shadow. In issue #13, she returns to Gotham City several years later to kill another target and Dick Grayson as Nightwing sets out to stop her.<ref>''Nightwing'' #0</ref>\n\nShe is later revealed to be a League of Assassins member who taught Red Hood along with Bronze Tiger. She fights alongside Bronze Tiger, Cheshire, December Graystone, Rictus, and Red Hood as the Untitled infiltrated the League of Assassin's secret city.<ref>''Red Hoot and the Outlaws'' #21</ref>\n\nInstead of her traditional black coat, the New 52 version of Shiva has appeared in a teal kabuki-like garb and mask, and is shown to be a master of weapons and martial arts, going to battle with throwing knives, swords, and usually a pair of [[kusarigama]]. In full gear she appears to have an extremely long, auburn braid with blades embedded in the hair that can be used offensively. However this is merely a wig connected to her mask. With the hooded mask off, her hair is shown to be black, and while it appears cropped in one issue, it is medium length in following issues. The character December Greystone is extremely similar in appearance to Lady Shiva's pre-New 52 look, but is a male and spell caster. \nIn all of her appearances so far, she has soundly defeated nearly every opponent, including Batman, Nightwing, and Arsenal. However, when she engages Red Hood, her own arrogance gets the better of her, as he is able to defeat her with a simple chop to the neck that she taught him long ago, as a way of balancing their sparring lessons because she believed he could never actually beat her without using \"shortcuts\".\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{Update|date=August 2017}}\nShe appears in the flesh at the end of ''Detective Comics'' #950, observing Cassandra Cain from a rooftop.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Detective Comics #950|publisher=DC Comics|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=23|quote=|via=}}</ref> Batman later finds out from both Shiva herself and Ra's that she has separated from him & the League of Assassins, believing him to be too complacent with the wealthy and aiming for peace rather than destruction.<ref>Detective Comics #954 & #956</ref> She had taken Ra's' secret League of Shadows with her, and was responsible for multiple attacks across the city and attacks on the anti-League military squad, the Colony.<ref>Detective Comics #951-953</ref> After a duel with her daughter Cassandra, Ra's Al Ghul appears and shoots Shiva with a rifle. Ra's takes her body with the intent of resurrecting her for questioning.<ref>Detective Comics #956</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLady Shiva has no superpowers, but she is regarded as one of the best assassins and martial artists on the planet. She is known to have mastered numerous martial arts, including [[Kung Fu]], [[Judo]], [[Jujutsu]], [[Wing Chun]], [[Capoeira]], [[Savate]], [[Karate]], [[Aikido]], [[Kobud\u014d]], and [[Eskrima]]. She is able to read people's movements through their body language, predicting their movements beforehand. She taught this trick to her daughter [[Cassandra Cain]]. She is able to hold her own against multiple opponents. She is commonly seen as the world's foremost martial artist, as powerful as [[Richard Dragon]] and [[Batman]]. Batman, who is also considered to be one of the greatest martial artists, stated that \"she may well be the best fighter alive.\" However, numerous martial artists have held their own against her or even defeated her. Cassandra Cain and Batman have both defeated Shiva in single combat (she claims she let Batman win), but others like [[Connor Hawke]], [[King Snake]], [[Nightwing]] and [[Black Canary]] have survived duels with Shiva.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\nAlthough she is willing to kill, and on one occasion attempted to manipulate Batman into a position where he would have to kill in order to make a worthy opponent in the future, Shiva has shown a certain sense of honor, helping to train the third Robin in combat while working with him during an investigation, and assisting Batman in regaining his skills after he was injured by [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]] and lost his fighting instinct even after his back was healed. She has also been noted as having some respect for her old teachers; when she and Black Canary learned that they had each studied under Sensei Otomo, Shiva noted that, out of respect for Otomo's preference not to kill his opponents, she never uses the skills he taught her in fights where her goal is the death of her enemies.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n[[File: Lady Shiva in Birds of Prey.jpg|[[Sung-Hi Lee]] as Lady Shiva in ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey.]]''|thumb|upright]]\n* Lady Shiva appears in the ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' TV series in the episode \"Lady Shiva\", portrayed by [[Sung-Hi Lee]].

She appears as an elite member of the League of Assassins. In \"Safe\", Lady Shiva sends Silver Monkey to capture [[Kobra (DC comics)|Dr. Jason Burr]] so that they can get the Ion Cortex. After the mission fails, Lady Shiva learns from Silver Monkey that [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] faked her death, had the Soultaker Sword in her possession all this time, and was helping to defend Burr. Lady Shiva states that they will obtain the Ion Cortex another way and that Katana is now the bigger prize for the League of Assassins. In \"Family\", Lady Shiva shows up in person at the Argos Club where she foils Silver Monkey's scheme to usurp her position within the League. Lady Shiva commented that the League of Assassins' ninjas are more afraid of her than Silver Monkey. After Silver Monkey was incapacitated by the ninjas, Lady Shiva uses the reclaimed Soultaker Sword to steal the soul of Bethanie Ravencroft (who claimed that she wasn't working against her) and Lady Shiva announces that she has other plans to deal with Silver Monkey. Lady Shiva then fights Batman and Katana to a draw, but escapes and leaves her ninjas to deal with them. In \"Sacrifice\", Lady Shiva learns that a package bound to the League of Assassins was stolen by [[Anarky]]. Anarky makes a deal with Lady Shiva where she will get back her package in exchange for a small favor. Lady Shiva leads the League of Assassin ninjas to the supposed location of the package at the Gotham Contagion Research Center. Batman and Katana arrive where Lady Shiva unleashes her League of Assassin ninjas and then she fights Batman and Katana as they try to prevent her from unknowingly releasing a virus. When a League of Assassins ninja unknowingly releases a vial of Calibosix (a cell mutation virus), Lady Shiva leaves as two of her ninjas get infected. Batman, Katana, and Lady Shiva had to work together to evade the infected ninjas while Anarky taunts them from his lair. As Batman tries to get them out, Lady Shiva states that Batman is more of a hero and that Katana is just a killer like her. Batman, Katana, and Lady Shiva then climb to Level 1 while evading the infected ninjas. While Katana buys Batman and Katana some time to get away, Lady Shiva ends up attacking Batman as the building's Breach Protocol is activated. Batman defeats Lady Shiva and handcuffs her to pipe. By the time Katana is cured with the serum, Lady Shiva has already gotten away. When Lady Shiva returns to her lair, she finds the package with a note from Anarky as it is shown that the package contains the body of Ra's al Ghul. In \"Instinct\", Jason Burr (who still has some of [[Cypher (DC Comics)|Cypher's]] control in him from a previous episode) tells Lady Shiva that the Ion Cortex will soon belong to the League of Assassins. Lady Shiva then ends up \"welcoming\" Jason to the League of Assassins. In \"Fall\", Lady Shiva revives Ra's al Ghul from suspended animation so that the League of Assassins can put their plans to control the Ion Cortex in order to plunge Gotham City into darkness. When Jason Burr fights off Cypher's control and tries to regain control of the Ion Cortex, Lady Shiva uses the Soultaker Sword to steal Jason Burr's soul. In \"Darkness\", Lady Shiva continues to help her master. When Silver Monkey stalls the ninjas to allow Batman to escape, she takes on Silver Monkey by herself. After a close battle, it is implied that she used the Soultaker Sword's abilities on Silver Monkey as she is later seen holding Silver Monkey's mask. In \"Reckoning\", Lady Shiva is seen by Ra's al Ghul side before she is defeated by Katana.\n* Lady Shiva appears in ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'', voiced by [[Gwendoline Yeo]]. She is the current enforcer of the Light as well as a member of the League of Shadows. She offered a place in the League of Shadows to [[Ocean Master]], but he refused. In response, she beheaded him and foiled his plan to kill the Justice League's families to prevent him from interfering in the Light's plans. In \"Elder Wisdom\", she was one of several who attempted to assassinate [[Aqualad|Prince Garth]] of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]], ambassador to the surface world, and ensure to discredit the Outsiders- Beast Boy, El Dorado, Wonder Girl, Static, Halo, and Terra- in the eyes of the world. She and the immortal [[Vandal Savage]]'s daughter, Cassandra, warned Deathstoke of their failure.\n\n===Films===\n====''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]''====\nVoiced by [[Rachael MacFarlane]], she is among the villains that try to claim the bounty on Superman and Batman. She has no dialogue (she is subjected to [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s mental control) and only makes vocal noises, and her role is entirely unchanged from the comic in which she fights Batman briefly before he knocks her out.\n\n====''[[Batman: Hush (film)|Batman: Hush]]''====\nVoiced by Sachie Alessio, she has a minor role. She came to warn Batman that a [[Riddler|person unknown]] has come seeking the rejuvenating/life-returning abilities of the ancient [[Lazarus Pit]].\n*Lady Shiva will also be appearing in the film ''[[Justice League Dark: Apokolips War]]'' with Sachie Alessio reprising her role\n\n===Video games===\n* Lady Shiva appears in the ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' video game.\n* Lady Shiva appears in the portable version of ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'' as a playable character.\n* Lady Shiva appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', voiced by [[Kelly Hu]]. She is among the eight assassins hired by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] to kill Batman. In order to \"test\" Batman, she kidnaps two corrupt police officers, killing one and leaving the other to be rescued. After Batman rescues the surviving officer and locates the one who was murdered, Lady Shiva confronts him, offering him a chance to fight her at Sheldon Park. Batman duels her with several of her subordinates, emerging as the victor. Declaring that he is worthy of living, Shiva lets him continue his efforts to protect Gotham, but insists he will soon learn it is beyond saving and deserves destruction (heavily implying that she is currently affiliated with the League of Assassins), so that it can rise from the ashes (similar to the message delivered to Batman by [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] in Arkham City). Before vanishing, Lady Shiva states that Batman's skills would impress her \"[[Ra's al Ghul|master]]\" when he hears of it. It is revealed in the extortion files collected by Edward Nigma that she, just like her master, is aware of Bane's addiction to Venom and his desire to break it. She also approaches Quincy Sharp with an offer for assistance in his political ambitions if he reopens the derelict Arkham Asylum, setting in motion events that would lead to the construction of Arkham City. Lady Shiva is also featured in the \"Initiation\" downloadable content as the final opponent that Kirigi unleashes upon Bruce Wayne.\n* Lady Shiva appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.\n\n===Web series===\n* A heroic version of Lady Shiva appears in the web series ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced by [[Tania Gunadi]].\n* Lady Shiva appears in ''[[Deathstroke: Knights and Dragons]]'' voiced by Panta Mosleh.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Lady Shiva was voiced by [[Lorelei King]] in the 1994 ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'' audio book.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn 2011, [[UGO Networks]] featured Lady Shiva on their list of 25 Hot Ninja Girls: \"She's the type of woman who makes it obvious why Bruce Wayne never really found love - his type is all too capable of kicking his ass.\"<ref>[http://www.ugo.com/girls/hot-ninja-girls?page=2 Ninja Chicks are So Freakin' Hot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111180030/http://www.ugo.com/girls/hot-ninja-girls?page=2 |date=January 11, 2011}}, [[UGO.com]], January 5, 2011</ref> She was ranked #8 on the list of Top 10 Fictional Ninjas by Fandomania for being \"one of the deadliest martial artists in the DC Comics universe\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Dorough |first=Jason |url=http://fandomania.com/top-10-fictional-ninjas/ |title=Top 10 Fictional Ninjas |publisher=Fandomania |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Batman (comics)#Lady Shiva|Lady Shiva}}\n* [http://webspace.webring.com/people/na/apothenea/Shiva.htm Women of Gotham Biography: Lady Shiva]\n* [http://www.canarynoir.com/ CanaryNoir]\n\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{Batgirl}}\n{{Birds of Prey}}\n{{Black Canary}}\n{{The Outsiders}}\n{{Robin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shiva, Lady}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Dennis O'Neil]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1975]]\n[[Category:DC Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:DC Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:DC Comics female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Black Canary characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Asian descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional female assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Detroit]]\n[[Category:Fictional female ninja]]\n[[Category:Fictional martial arts trainers]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ric Estrada]]\n[[Category:Chinese superheroes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image= Lady Shiva (Birds of Prey 6 2010).png\n|converted = y\n|caption= Lady Shiva, as she appears on the cover of ''Birds of Prey'' vol. 2 #6 (Nov. 2010).

Orphan.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Becoming Lady Shiva===\n\n====Pre-Crisis====\n[[File:Shivadragon.png|thumb|Cover to ''Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter'' #5, Shiva's first appearance. Art by [[Dick Giordano]].]]\n\nShiva's first introduced as an antagonist to martial artist [[Richard Dragon]], believing him to be a spy responsible for the murder of her sister, Carolyn. In reality, Carolyn's murder was orchestrated by Guano Cravat, a corrupt businessman whose criminal ambitions had been foiled by Dragon. Cravat convinced Woosan that Dragon killed Carolyn, deliberately pitting her against Dragon in an act of revenge.\n\nIn order to avenge her sister, Woosan becomes a master combatant. During the course of her training, she discovers that she is a [[wikt:prodigy|prodigy]], rapidly mastering several martial arts and eventually dubbing herself \"Lady\" Shiva.\n\nWhen Shiva tracks Dragon down and lures him to Cravat's hideout, Dragon reveals Cravat's deception. The Swiss, Carolyn's real murderer and Cravat's underling, had already died in battle with Dragon, rendering Shiva's vendetta moot.\n\nAfterward, she briefly takes up crimefighting with Dragon and fellow martial artist [[Bronze Tiger|Ben Turner]], to allay her feelings of purposelessness, saying \"I tolerate Dragon because danger seems to cling to him like flies to honey... and without danger my life is empty!\" <ref>''Richard Dragon'' #7 (January 2005)</ref> Dragon, in hopes that she might follow his example and use her skills for good, coaxes her to explore the spiritual side of martial arts, to no apparent success. When the three eventually part ways, Shiva begins a wandering existence, training herself further, and eventually parlaying her skills into a career as a master assassin.\n\n====Post-Crisis====\nShiva was born in a [[shanty town]], in an unknown country, and raised to be a warrior and protector of the village. Eventually, Shiva fled the village with her sister. Years later, when the heroine [[Black Canary]] visits the village to experience Shiva's training, a village child named [[Sin (DC Comics)|Sin]] is held hostage by the villagers, with the promise that if Canary fails to become the warrior-protector of the village, Sin is to take her place, suggesting that Shiva's sister was once used in a similar manner.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 1) #92-95 (May\u2013August 2006)</ref> Speaking about her childhood, Sin says that [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s League of Assassins ran the village where she and Shiva were born and raised.<ref>''Black Canary'' #1 (September 2007)</ref>\n\nThe sisters moved to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], using the names Sandra and Carolyn Wu-San. There, they devoted their time to practicing the martial arts. Because of the girls' young ages, talent, and unique bond as sisters, their practice evolved into a secret, perfected language that only they could share. Out of love for her sister, Sandra held back in her spars with Carolyn. The assassin [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]] saw this restraint in Sandra one day when he visited Detroit to see the siblings perform. Considering Sandra a kindred spirit, Cain murdered Carolyn, in order to remove the obstruction that blunted Sandra's true potential.\n\nDiscovering that David Cain had murdered her sister, Sandra hunted him down, only to be lured into an ambush by Ra's al Ghul's League of Assassins, of which Cain was a member. In the heat of a losing battle, Sandra realized how Carolyn had held her back, and how much undeveloped potential she had. Cain spared her life, and in exchange, Sandra agreed to bear Cain a child, and leave it for him to raise. The child, [[Cassandra Cain]], was to be Ra's al Ghul's \"One Who Is All,\" a perfected bodyguard, whose only form of communication was literacy in body language, and whose sole instinct was for hand-to-hand combat. With Carolyn gone, Cassandra and Sandra were the only two humans known to share this gift. The day of Cassandra's birth, Sandra set out to become reborn as the Lady Shiva: creator and destroyer.\n\n===Professional assassin===\n\n====Meeting the Question====\nDuring her time with Richard Dragon, Shiva becomes addicted to combat and life-or-death situations. Already a very accomplished martial artist, Shiva hires herself out as a [[mercenary]] both to recapture the thrill and to finance further training. Her considerable skills allow her to ask a high price for her services, and she soon becomes highly sought after.\n\nShiva is eventually hired by Reverend Hatch, the corrupt adjunct to the mayor of [[Hub City (comics)|Hub City]], to fight troublesome masked crimefighter the [[Question (comics)|Question]]. She defeats him with ease, but rather than have Shiva kill him, Hatch instead has his men beat the Question further, shoot him in the head with an air gun, and dump him into the river. Seeing \"a passion for combat\" in the hero, Shiva rescues a near-death Question, and brings him to Richard Dragon's mountain hideaway, to give him a chance to fulfill his potential. In his civilian identity as Victor Sage, the Question enters Dragon's tutelage, training in combat and undergoing a spiritual awakening.\n\nOn leaving Dragon, Sage meets Shiva, who orders him to fight her. She ends the fight after only a few moves, and confirms her own suspicions of a \"warrior's passion\" in him, because he was willing to fight her even after his previous, crushing defeat. However, influenced by Dragon's philosophy, Sage proposes that he was simply \"curious\" what would happen if they fought again. Shiva leaves without telling Sage why she saved him, and Sage readopts the identity of the Question, returning to Hub City.\n\n====Shiva and the O-Sensei====\nShiva eventually travels to [[Manchuria]] to visit with her godfather, the [[O-Sensei (comics)|O-Sensei]], former instructor of [[Richard Dragon]] and [[Bronze Tiger]]. After living over 150 years, he has finally decided to die. He intends to keep a promise to his wife, and be buried alongside her, but his wife's family had hidden her remains to punish him for abandoning her. The O-Sensei has Shiva select three warriors to aid him in the search for her remains: the Question, [[Green Arrow]], and [[Batman]]. Reluctant to acknowledge the O-Sensei's death wish, Shiva expresses her ambivalence both verbally and physically, unnecessarily applying deadly force in battles with O-Sensei's assailants.\n\nShiva and the O-Sensei then travel to Hub City, meeting with the Question, who, in turn, brokered Shiva's first meeting with Batman. Compelled to test his skill, Shiva immediately fights the [[vigilante]] only to be stopped by the O-Sensei. They do, however, convince Batman to aid them.<ref>''Detective Comics Annual'' (vol. 1) #1 (1989)</ref>\n\nIn their search for [[Green Arrow]], Shiva encounters [[sexual slavery|slave traders]], killing all except one, who successfully cuts her; she rewards him with a kiss on the forehead. After locating Green Arrow, she meets [[Black Canary]] for the first time, and spars with the hero. Although Canary does not know it at the time, the two had both studied under Sensei Otomo, though non-concurrently.\n\nAfter recruiting Green Arrow, Shiva returns to Hub City, and saves the Question from an attack by former employees of the now-dead Reverend Hatch. Shiva kills the men, who had been after a fortune in [[embezzlement|embezzled]] funds stored in Hatch's abandoned home, and sets fire to the money. Later, she nurses the Question's elderly friend Tot back to health. While the Question puzzles over her inscrutable and violent nature, she confesses that the O-Sensei was \"the one man I am certain I would not harm if he kissed me.\"\n\nWhen Batman discovers that the remains of the O-Sensei's wife had been moved to a small island, Shiva, the O-Sensei, Green Arrow, and the Question set out for the island, only to be caught in a storm. The O-Sensei is lost overboard, but the group discovers that his wife's remains had likewise been mislaid, years earlier, while in transport, leaving O-Sensei's promise fulfilled.\n\n====Toward Sodom and Gomorrah====\nWhen Hub City falls victim to rapid, systemic [[urban decay]], Shiva returns to offer her services to one of the ruling gangs, but instead kills the members for sending \"unskilled\" men to kill her. On meeting the Question, she is dismayed to find that staying in Hub City has atrophied his fighting skills. Nevertheless, she repeatedly saves both him and his lover, Mayor Myra Fermin, from assassins.\n\nShe vanishes some time later, only to reappear stepping out of a helicopter meant to rescue the Question and his companions, who have decided to flee the city. Shiva explains that though the Question and his friends wished to leave, it is now a fit place for her to go toward. The Question and Shiva have a final exchange before he leaves.\n\n{{quote|I never know what to say to you, Shiva. I'm afraid that if it's the wrong thing, you'll destroy me.\"<br>\"Ah. Then you have not yet understood the grand secret.\"<br>\"Which is?\"<br>\"I cannot destroy you unless you permit me to.|from ''The Question #36'', by [[Denny O'Neil]]}}\n\n====After Hub City====\nShiva continues to work as a mercenary for money, challenge, and perfection of her skills. Eventually, she crosses paths with the [[League of Assassins]], and its leader, [[Ra's al Ghul]], and begins an on-and-off association with them. Though she has kept close ties with the League, she sometimes works against their interests, as seen during ''[[Batman: Legacy]]''.\n\nWhile training prospective assassins, mercenaries, and [[terrorist]]s in [[Lebanese Civil War|war-torn Lebanon]], she is approached by [[Jason Todd]], the second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and his guardian Batman, acting on an evidence that she had associated with Todd's father, and speculating that she might be his mother.\n\nEager to finally face Batman uninterrupted, Shiva knocks Robin unconscious and challenges the Dark Knight. Initially underestimating Shiva, Batman soon learns that her skills are such that she could kill him, and begins to fight in earnest. It takes intervention from Robin to knock Shiva unconscious and subdue her for interrogation. When asked if she was Jason's mother, Shiva laughs, sarcastically claiming to have littered dozens of babies across the globe. When Batman doses her with [[sodium thiopental|sodium pentothal]], Shiva claims to have no children, confirming that Jason is not her son. Batman leaves her in the desert, reasoning that she would soon free herself from her bonds. Shiva warns him that they would meet again, to which Batman simply replies, \"Too bad.\"\n\nLater, Shiva begins to track down those who referred to themselves as [[Shihan]], \"Master,\" or any other title proclaiming mastery of a martial arts form. She would learn what she could from them and, depending on their skill and personal whim, kill them when they were of no further use to her.\n\n===Teaching a Little Bird===\nIn further pursuit of her art, Shiva tracks the defeats of martial arts masters, in order to discover new techniques. In this way, she develops an interest in the defeat of Koroshi, master of the art of [[karate|empty-handed fighting]]. Gaining no information from Koroshi himself, she begins to search for [[King Snake]], the man rumored to have defeated him. During her search, she meets [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]], who is fighting King Snake's criminal organization, the Ghost Dragons, as part of his training to become the third [[Robin (character)|Robin]].\n\nShiva sees potential in Drake, and takes him on as a student. As a bonus, she offers to train him in one weapon, and he chooses the [[B\u014d|bo staff]]. Shiva derisively mentions that it is not a lethal weapon, and Drake explains that was the reason he had chosen it. At the end of his training, he defeats Shiva in a sparring match with the bo, and she gives him a collapsible bo staff.\n\nEventually, they discover that the Ghost Dragons are creating a [[virus|virulent]] [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Robin, Shiva, and ally Clyde Rawlins attempt to stop them from releasing it, but the Dragons escape with a few canisters. After tracking them to [[Hong Kong]], they eventually defeat King Snake, though Rawlins dies in the attempt and Shiva mostly witnesses the proceedings. While King Snake hangs precariously on the ledge of a building, Shiva orders Robin to kill him to signify his \"graduation\" and become her \"weapon.\" Robin refuses and leaves. Shiva then throws King Snake off the ledge herself, though he survives the fall.\n\n===Getting involved with Gotham===\nAfter [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] breaks Batman's back, Batman seeks training from Shiva to help him regain his skills and fighting spirit (see ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Batman: Knightfall: KnightsEnd]]''). Though she deems him unworthy of her efforts, she devises a training regimen, out of respect for what he had been before his injuries. As part of this training, Shiva kills the [[Armless Master]], a sensei notable for training [[Catwoman]], while wearing a [[tengu]] mask, making sure that his death was both witnessed and relayed to his best students. Shiva then makes Batman wear the mask while performing training missions. He is then ambushed by the master's students, who mistake him for the \"Tengu Mask warrior.\" He defeats all of them in turn, but Shiva attempts to complete Batman's training by manipulating him into killing an opponent using her fatal [[Leopard Blow]]. Batman simply feigns using the maneuver on an assailant to trick her into believing he used lethal force. Shiva later discovers the truth, but does not seek vengeance.\n\nLater, she helps Batman fight [[Ra's al Ghul]] and his [[League of Assassins]], including [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], when Ghul attempts to release a deadly virus called Ebola Gulf A that would have killed half the world's population (see ''[[Batman: Legacy]]''). The trail leads Batman to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[India]]. Since their knowledge of the city is limited, [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] contacts Shiva, who agrees to help Batman. Together they defeat Ghul's men and prevent the virus from being released.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 1) #534 (September 1996)</ref>\n\nShiva later travels to an army base in Transbelvia to fight a young political rebel and martial artist named [[Dava (comics)|Dava Sb\u00f6rsc]], who specializes in undefeatable \"single-blow techniques\" and wishes to learn Shiva's Leopard Blow. Instead, Dava's friend, her former pupil [[Tim Drake]], in his identity as Robin, jumps into the fray in her place. Granted superspeed by a drug Dava gave him, and unused to its effects, Robin unwittingly uses lethal force, killing Shiva in battle. He quickly administers [[CPR]], both reviving Shiva and dosing her with the drug. Thus enhanced, she kills attacking soldiers while Robin and Dava make their escape, vanishing immediately after.\n\nDuring the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' story arc, Shiva fights in the Brotherhood of the Monkey Fist's martial arts tournament under the alias \"Paper Monkey\".<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 2) #23 (August 1998)</ref><ref name=ga135>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 2) #135 (August 1998)</ref> In a final, close battle, she fights and defeats [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]], the Green Arrow. As repayment for saving her life, Robin asks her to spare Connor. She relents, warning Robin that this use of her favor means she would challenge and kill him when he grew older.<ref name=ga135 />\n\nOver the years, Shiva amasses groups of followers who worship her as an incarnation of [[Shiva]], the [[Hindu]] representation of the lord of destruction. She pays them little attention, occasionally using them as lackeys or killing them when it suits her whims. Some of her followers have even created temples to honor her victories, one of which is in Gotham, which she later destroys.\n\n===Shiva and Batgirl===\nAt age 8, Shiva's daughter Cassandra flees from David Cain, horrified after killing a man with her bare hands on her first assassination. She then wanders the world as a [[Muteness|mute]], and, seeking redemption, finds herself in Gotham City during the events of [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]. Seeing promise in Cassandra, Batman and former Batgirl, [[Barbara Gordon]], give Cassandra their blessings to take up the mantle of Batgirl.\n\nEventually, Batgirl's skills attract Shiva's attention. Without telling her of their relationship, Shiva challenges Batgirl to a battle to the death. To Shiva's disappointment, she defeats Batgirl soundly. Batgirl's body language fluency is newly impaired by a [[telepath]]'s forcible inculcation of the ability to speak. Wanting to fight Batgirl at her peak, Shiva spares her life, and promises to retrain her on the condition that they have a rematch in one year. The secret to being undefeatable, Shiva explains, is to not fear death, even to seek it. Under Shiva's care, Batgirl soon regains her abilities.\n\nShiva reappears to fight Batgirl at the Forum of The Twelve Caesars, and kills her in combat. Realizing that Batgirl had not given her all, Shiva revives her. Batgirl admits to harboring a death wish ever since Cain first forced her to kill; her ability to perfectly read the agony of her victim had deeply [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] her. Having overcome her death wish, Batgirl fights Shiva again, shattering her sword. In the midst of battle, Batgirl accuses Shiva of having a death wish herself, really only traveling and fighting in search of her own death. Batgirl thus defeats Shiva.\n\n===A new Sensei===\nIn [[Gail Simone]]'s ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|''Birds of Prey'']]'' series, during a joint hunt with Black Canary for the murderer of a shared, beloved [[sensei]], a sensei Shiva so respected that she has vowed to never use anything he taught her in a fight where her goal was the death of her opponent, Shiva is beaten and kidnapped by supervillain [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]]. Cheshire ties up, gags and locks Shiva in the trunk of a car wired with explosives, so as to use a charred corpse in a plan to fake her death and flee the country after murdering a senator. Shiva is saved when Catwoman discovers her. After Cheshire confesses to murdering their sensei, Black Canary punches her out of a helicopter (using [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted Grant's]] Haymaker) to prevent Shiva from killing her in a vengeful rage. Shiva subsequently offers to share her knowledge with Black Canary, who takes her offer under consideration.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 1) #62-67 (February\u2013July 2004)</ref>\n\nCassandra begins to suspect that Shiva is her mother, but cannot provoke Cain into an admission. She embarks on a search for Shiva, eventually finding her as the new sensei of the [[League of Assassins]] under the leadership of [[Nyssa Raatko]], Ra's al Ghul's eldest daughter. In battle, Cassandra sacrifices her life to save former League member Tigris from an attack by her own unsuccessful experimental predecessor, Mad Dog. Shiva decides to resurrect Cassandra in a [[Lazarus Pit]] to reveal the truth of her heritage, and fight her once more.\n\nOn reviving her, Shiva admits that the reason she agreed to give birth was that she hoped her child would be the one to kill her. In an evenly matched battle, Cassandra breaks Shiva's neck, [[paralysis|paralyzing]] her. She appears ready to place Shiva in the Lazarus Pit, but Shiva pleads with her not to do so. In response, Cassandra impales Shiva on a hook hanging over the pit, apparently killing her. Although Cassandra's intent regarding this action is left ambiguous, whether to kill her or let her fall into the pit and be revived, it has been confirmed that Shiva is alive in ''[[One Year Later]]''. Cassandra then abandons the identity of Batgirl and returns to her life as a wanderer.\n\nDuring the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, Shiva later appears as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].\n\n===\"One Year Later\"===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal \n | header    = \n | width     = 161\n | image1    = Shivaoyl.PNG\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Shiva as the Jade Canary, from ''Birds of Prey'' #92 (May 2006). Art by Paulo Siqueira.\n }}\nIn the 2006 \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline, having switched places with Black Canary in order to allow them both to experience each other's life experiences, Shiva joins [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]'s covert team of female operatives known as the [[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]] (with Canary hoping that spending time with them would soften Shiva), using the name \"Jade Canary\".<ref name=bop92 /> Shiva remains unchanged, however. Oracle semiseriously refers to Shiva as a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]], and refuses to call Shiva by the Jade Canary title, even though Shiva (as part of the deal with Canary) has taken to wearing Black Canary's boots and trademark fishnet stockings (though she hates wearing them).<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 1) #94 (July 2006)</ref>\n\nShiva continues to perform solo work, and visits Robin to assist him (much to Robin's chagrin) in discovering the truth behind Batgirl's recent disappearance and recent upheaval within the League of Assassins. She refuses to allow herself or Oracle's team to be involved, and instead trusts her former pupil to handle the situation. It appears that she holds no ill-will towards Cassandra as she informs Tim that she hopes that her daughter is well.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\nDuring a recent mission, Oracle's team confronts the villain [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]], whose helmet allows him to copy the skills of 30 of the world's greatest martial artists, including Shiva herself. This had allowed him a victory against Batman in the past. Shiva believes that his files on her would be out of date, and that she would be able to defeat her \"old self\". She seems unconcerned about the skills of the other 29 fighters, and apparently decides to attack Prometheus head-on. Prometheus, however, has more up-to-date files than Shiva suspected, and in three seconds knocks her to the ground. After this defeat, Shiva vanishes, leaving a message for Black Canary: \"Tell the Canary, I release her.\"<ref name=\"Prey 2006\">''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 1) #95 (August 2006)</ref>\n\nStripped of her chance to mold Black Canary in her own image, and stripped of Sin, the young girl who was next in line as her successor, Shiva is last seen talking to Bethany Thorne, daughter of the late [[Crime Doctor (DC Comics)|Crime Doctor]]. It appears that she is yet again hoping to train a new heir in the art of her lethal form of martial arts.<ref name=\"Prey 2006\"/>\n\nStill, although Shiva is no longer an active member of the Birds of Prey, she continues to be protective of her former teammates. Such is the case when the Birds of Prey are being threatened by [[Spy Smasher#Katarina Armstrong|Spy Smasher]], who attempts to steal control away from Oracle. After a mission in [[Russia]], Oracle and Spy Smasher fight against one another for control of the team. Although Oracle is unable to use her legs, she is victorious, although Spy Smasher attempts to go back on their deal. Unfortunately, she is confronted outside by every single living Birds of Prey Agent Oracle has ever recruited, who warn her against ever going after Oracle again; Lady Shiva is among them. When Barbara later asks the others who called Shiva, no one responds.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 1) #108 (September 2007)</ref>\n\n===\"Blackest Night\"===\nDuring the events of the \"[[Blackest Night]]\", Shiva tracks down [[Renee Montoya]], the new Question, and tells her she intends to test her in battle. The two women begin their duel, only to be interrupted when Victor Sage, now a reanimated [[Black Lantern]], arrives on the scene and attacks them. Using his new [[supernatural]] abilities, Sage effortlessly defeats Shiva and tries to kill her by tearing out her heart. However, Shiva realizes that the Black Lanterns feed on human emotion, and cuts herself off from all feeling through the use of [[meditation]], rendering her invisible to Sage. After the others on the scene do the same, Victor angrily departs.<ref>''The Question'' (vol. 1) #37 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n===\"Brightest Day\"===\nDuring the events of the \"[[Brightest Day]]\" crossover, a new martial artist known as the [[Twelve Brothers In Silk|White Canary]] comes to Gotham and sets a plan into motion to ruin Black Canary's life by framing her for the murder of a European terrorist. When Black Canary first encounters the White Canary, she muses that the villain may be Shiva in disguise.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 2) #1-2 (July\u2013August 2010)</ref> but later White Canary pits Black Canary against Lady Shiva in an honor bound match to the death after breaking Black Canary's wrist, thereby making sure she would be killed. Both parties accept because White Canary dangles the life of Sin, Black Canary's adopted daughter, as her bait. However, [[Helena Bertinelli|the Huntress]] challenges Shiva instead and even manages to knock her down, to everyone's surprise, even after receiving many blows. The death match is stopped when Black Canary rescues Sin herself and points out a technicality, they need not continue the battle to the death immediately and can pick it up at any time in the future.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\n===The New 52===\nIn [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Lady Shiva appears in ''Nightwing'' #0. After she defeats Batman, Dick Grayson fights her in his debut as Robin with a costume composed of spare Bat costume parts. Lady Shiva easily defeats him and encourages him to stop living in Batman's shadow. In issue #13, she returns to Gotham City several years later to kill another target and Dick Grayson as Nightwing sets out to stop her.<ref>''Nightwing'' #0</ref>\n\nShe is later revealed to be a League of Assassins member who taught Red Hood along with Bronze Tiger. She fights alongside Bronze Tiger, Cheshire, December Graystone, Rictus, and Red Hood as the Untitled infiltrated the League of Assassin's secret city.<ref>''Red Hoot and the Outlaws'' #21</ref>\n\nInstead of her traditional black coat, the New 52 version of Shiva has appeared in a teal kabuki-like garb and mask, and is shown to be a master of weapons and martial arts, going to battle with throwing knives, swords, and usually a pair of [[kusarigama]]. In full gear she appears to have an extremely long, auburn braid with blades embedded in the hair that can be used offensively. However this is merely a wig connected to her mask. With the hooded mask off, her hair is shown to be black, and while it appears cropped in one issue, it is medium length in following issues. The character December Greystone is extremely similar in appearance to Lady Shiva's pre-New 52 look, but is a male and spell caster. \nIn all of her appearances so far, she has soundly defeated nearly every opponent, including Batman, Nightwing, and Arsenal. However, when she engages Red Hood, her own arrogance gets the better of her, as he is able to defeat her with a simple chop to the neck that she taught him long ago, as a way of balancing their sparring lessons because she believed he could never actually beat her without using \"shortcuts\".\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{Update|date=August 2017}}\nShe appears in the flesh at the end of ''Detective Comics'' #950, observing Cassandra Cain from a rooftop.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Detective Comics #950|publisher=DC Comics|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=23|quote=|via=}}</ref> Batman later finds out from both Shiva herself and Ra's that she has separated from him & the League of Assassins, believing him to be too complacent with the wealthy and aiming for peace rather than destruction.<ref>Detective Comics #954 & #956</ref> She had taken Ra's' secret League of Shadows with her, and was responsible for multiple attacks across the city and attacks on the anti-League military squad, the Colony.<ref>Detective Comics #951-953</ref> After a duel with her daughter Cassandra, Ra's Al Ghul appears and shoots Shiva with a rifle. Ra's takes her body with the intent of resurrecting her for questioning.<ref>Detective Comics #956</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLady Shiva has no superpowers, but she is regarded as one of the best assassins and martial artists on the planet. She is known to have mastered numerous martial arts, including [[Kung Fu]], [[Judo]], [[Jujutsu]], [[Wing Chun]], [[Capoeira]], [[Savate]], [[Karate]], [[Aikido]], [[Kobud\u014d]], and [[Eskrima]]. She is able to read people's movements through their body language, predicting their movements beforehand. She taught this trick to her daughter [[Cassandra Cain]]. She is able to hold her own against multiple opponents. She is commonly seen as the world's foremost martial artist, as powerful as [[Richard Dragon]] and [[Batman]]. Batman, who is also considered to be one of the greatest martial artists, stated that \"she may well be the best fighter alive.\" However, numerous martial artists have held their own against her or even defeated her. Cassandra Cain and Batman have both defeated Shiva in single combat (she claims she let Batman win), but others like [[Connor Hawke]], [[King Snake]], [[Nightwing]] and [[Black Canary]] have survived duels with Shiva.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\nAlthough she is willing to kill, and on one occasion attempted to manipulate Batman into a position where he would have to kill in order to make a worthy opponent in the future, Shiva has shown a certain sense of honor, helping to train the third Robin in combat while working with him during an investigation, and assisting Batman in regaining his skills after he was injured by [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]] and lost his fighting instinct even after his back was healed. She has also been noted as having some respect for her old teachers; when she and Black Canary learned that they had each studied under Sensei Otomo, Shiva noted that, out of respect for Otomo's preference not to kill his opponents, she never uses the skills he taught her in fights where her goal is the death of her enemies.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n[[File: Lady Shiva in Birds of Prey.jpg|[[Sung-Hi Lee]] as Lady Shiva in ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey.]]''|thumb|upright]]\n* Lady Shiva appears in the ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' TV series in the episode \"Lady Shiva\", portrayed by [[Sung-Hi Lee]]. Here, she is about equally skilled as [[Barbara Gordon]] and the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]. She is a nemesis of Barbara Gordon's from her career as [[Batgirl]]. In her civilian identity, she is a former schoolmate of [[Helena Wayne|Helena Kyle]]. Unlike her comic book counterpart, she is portrayed as a common thief with no ties to any known organizations, and she wears a mask. She seeks revenge against Batgirl for the accidental death of her 15-year-old sister who was killed when Batgirl tried to apprehend Shiva.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/987638-image1_super.jpg |title=Picture |date= |accessdate=March 15, 2011|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713005622/http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/987638-image1_super.jpg |archivedate=July 13, 2012|df= }}</ref>\n* According to ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' recurring guest star [[Katrina Law]] at Dragoncon, she believed that she was auditioned for Lady Shiva before being cast as [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wew1pdOIYow#t=365 Arrow - Dragoncon 2014 - Interview]</ref>\n* Lady Shiva was going to appear in the fifth and final season of the series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', but this never came.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gerding |first=Stephen |url=https://www.cbr.com/gotham-season-5-orphan-scarface-ventriloquist-lady-shiva/|title='EXCLUSIVE: Gotham's Final Season Adds Scarface, Orphan & More Batman Foes|publisher=CBR|date=May 17, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2019}}</ref> Shiva was originally supposed to appear in the final episode of [[Gotham (season 4)|fourth season]], \"No Man's Land\", in a scene which she is seen fighting three thugs in Gotham Chinatown.<ref name=Redditmedia>[https://i.redditmedia.com/j5v_xAL26tGkU8-cE0qylQHeeL-xd-Z6cpdF-rFYoyw.png?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=960&s=9cce26978e627e9e90fbd3e94766b337 ''Gotham - Episode 4.22 - Leaked script segment'' - Redditmedia]</ref>\n\n====Animation====\n* Lady Shiva appears in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'',<ref>{{cite news|last=Truitt|first=Bryan|title='Beware' of new villains in new Batman cartoon|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/07/12/beware-the-batman-animated-series/2513533/|newspaper=USA Today|date=July 12, 2013}}</ref> voiced by [[Finola Hughes]]. She appears as an elite member of the League of Assassins. In \"Safe\", Lady Shiva sends Silver Monkey to capture [[Kobra (DC comics)|Dr. Jason Burr]] so that they can get the Ion Cortex. After the mission fails, Lady Shiva learns from Silver Monkey that [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] faked her death, had the Soultaker Sword in her possession all this time, and was helping to defend Burr. Lady Shiva states that they will obtain the Ion Cortex another way and that Katana is now the bigger prize for the League of Assassins. In \"Family\", Lady Shiva shows up in person at the Argos Club where she foils Silver Monkey's scheme to usurp her position within the League. Lady Shiva commented that the League of Assassins' ninjas are more afraid of her than Silver Monkey. After Silver Monkey was incapacitated by the ninjas, Lady Shiva uses the reclaimed Soultaker Sword to steal the soul of Bethanie Ravencroft (who claimed that she wasn't working against her) and Lady Shiva announces that she has other plans to deal with Silver Monkey. Lady Shiva then fights Batman and Katana to a draw, but escapes and leaves her ninjas to deal with them. In \"Sacrifice\", Lady Shiva learns that a package bound to the League of Assassins was stolen by [[Anarky]]. Anarky makes a deal with Lady Shiva where she will get back her package in exchange for a small favor. Lady Shiva leads the League of Assassin ninjas to the supposed location of the package at the Gotham Contagion Research Center. Batman and Katana arrive where Lady Shiva unleashes her League of Assassin ninjas and then she fights Batman and Katana as they try to prevent her from unknowingly releasing a virus. When a League of Assassins ninja unknowingly releases a vial of Calibosix (a cell mutation virus), Lady Shiva leaves as two of her ninjas get infected. Batman, Katana, and Lady Shiva had to work together to evade the infected ninjas while Anarky taunts them from his lair. As Batman tries to get them out, Lady Shiva states that Batman is more of a hero and that Katana is just a killer like her. Batman, Katana, and Lady Shiva then climb to Level 1 while evading the infected ninjas. While Katana buys Batman and Katana some time to get away, Lady Shiva ends up attacking Batman as the building's Breach Protocol is activated. Batman defeats Lady Shiva and handcuffs her to pipe. By the time Katana is cured with the serum, Lady Shiva has already gotten away. When Lady Shiva returns to her lair, she finds the package with a note from Anarky as it is shown that the package contains the body of Ra's al Ghul. In \"Instinct\", Jason Burr (who still has some of [[Cypher (DC Comics)|Cypher's]] control in him from a previous episode) tells Lady Shiva that the Ion Cortex will soon belong to the League of Assassins. Lady Shiva then ends up \"welcoming\" Jason to the League of Assassins. In \"Fall\", Lady Shiva revives Ra's al Ghul from suspended animation so that the League of Assassins can put their plans to control the Ion Cortex in order to plunge Gotham City into darkness. When Jason Burr fights off Cypher's control and tries to regain control of the Ion Cortex, Lady Shiva uses the Soultaker Sword to steal Jason Burr's soul. In \"Darkness\", Lady Shiva continues to help her master. When Silver Monkey stalls the ninjas to allow Batman to escape, she takes on Silver Monkey by herself. After a close battle, it is implied that she used the Soultaker Sword's abilities on Silver Monkey as she is later seen holding Silver Monkey's mask. In \"Reckoning\", Lady Shiva is seen by Ra's al Ghul side before she is defeated by Katana.\n* Lady Shiva appears in ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'', voiced by [[Gwendoline Yeo]]. She is the current enforcer of the Light as well as a member of the League of Shadows. She offered a place in the League of Shadows to [[Ocean Master]], but he refused. In response, she beheaded him and foiled his plan to kill the Justice League's families to prevent him from interfering in the Light's plans. In \"Elder Wisdom\", she was one of several who attempted to assassinate [[Aqualad|Prince Garth]] of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]], ambassador to the surface world, and ensure to discredit the Outsiders- Beast Boy, El Dorado, Wonder Girl, Static, Halo, and Terra- in the eyes of the world. She and the immortal [[Vandal Savage]]'s daughter, Cassandra, warned Deathstoke of their failure.\n\n===Films===\n====''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]''====\nVoiced by [[Rachael MacFarlane]], she is among the villains that try to claim the bounty on Superman and Batman. She has no dialogue (she is subjected to [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s mental control) and only makes vocal noises, and her role is entirely unchanged from the comic in which she fights Batman briefly before he knocks her out.\n\n====''[[Batman: Hush (film)|Batman: Hush]]''====\nVoiced by Sachie Alessio, she has a minor role. She came to warn Batman that a [[Riddler|person unknown]] has come seeking the rejuvenating/life-returning abilities of the ancient [[Lazarus Pit]].\n*Lady Shiva will also be appearing in the film ''[[Justice League Dark: Apokolips War]]'' with Sachie Alessio reprising her role\n\n===Video games===\n* Lady Shiva appears in the ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' video game.\n* Lady Shiva appears in the portable version of ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'' as a playable character.\n* Lady Shiva appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', voiced by [[Kelly Hu]]. She is among the eight assassins hired by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] to kill Batman. In order to \"test\" Batman, she kidnaps two corrupt police officers, killing one and leaving the other to be rescued. After Batman rescues the surviving officer and locates the one who was murdered, Lady Shiva confronts him, offering him a chance to fight her at Sheldon Park. Batman duels her with several of her subordinates, emerging as the victor. Declaring that he is worthy of living, Shiva lets him continue his efforts to protect Gotham, but insists he will soon learn it is beyond saving and deserves destruction (heavily implying that she is currently affiliated with the League of Assassins), so that it can rise from the ashes (similar to the message delivered to Batman by [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] in Arkham City). Before vanishing, Lady Shiva states that Batman's skills would impress her \"[[Ra's al Ghul|master]]\" when he hears of it. It is revealed in the extortion files collected by Edward Nigma that she, just like her master, is aware of Bane's addiction to Venom and his desire to break it. She also approaches Quincy Sharp with an offer for assistance in his political ambitions if he reopens the derelict Arkham Asylum, setting in motion events that would lead to the construction of Arkham City. Lady Shiva is also featured in the \"Initiation\" downloadable content as the final opponent that Kirigi unleashes upon Bruce Wayne.\n* Lady Shiva appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.\n\n===Web series===\n* A heroic version of Lady Shiva appears in the web series ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced by [[Tania Gunadi]].\n* Lady Shiva appears in ''[[Deathstroke: Knights and Dragons]]'' voiced by Panta Mosleh.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Lady Shiva was voiced by [[Lorelei King]] in the 1994 ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'' audio book.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn 2011, [[UGO Networks]] featured Lady Shiva on their list of 25 Hot Ninja Girls: \"She's the type of woman who makes it obvious why Bruce Wayne never really found love - his type is all too capable of kicking his ass.\"<ref>[http://www.ugo.com/girls/hot-ninja-girls?page=2 Ninja Chicks are So Freakin' Hot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111180030/http://www.ugo.com/girls/hot-ninja-girls?page=2 |date=January 11, 2011}}, [[UGO.com]], January 5, 2011</ref> She was ranked #8 on the list of Top 10 Fictional Ninjas by Fandomania for being \"one of the deadliest martial artists in the DC Comics universe\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Dorough |first=Jason |url=http://fandomania.com/top-10-fictional-ninjas/ |title=Top 10 Fictional Ninjas |publisher=Fandomania |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Batman (comics)#Lady Shiva|Lady Shiva}}\n* [http://webspace.webring.com/people/na/apothenea/Shiva.htm Women of Gotham Biography: Lady Shiva]\n* [http://www.canarynoir.com/ CanaryNoir]\n\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{Batgirl}}\n{{Birds of Prey}}\n{{Black Canary}}\n{{The Outsiders}}\n{{Robin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shiva, Lady}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Dennis O'Neil]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1975]]\n[[Category:DC Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:DC Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:DC Comics female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Black Canary characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Asian descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional female assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Detroit]]\n[[Category:Fictional female ninja]]\n[[Category:Fictional martial arts trainers]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ric Estrada]]\n[[Category:Chinese superheroes]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toWildcat (disambiguation)(link changed toWildcat (DC Comics)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Shiva"}

The Ju 290 was also intended to meet the need for large transport aircraft. A [[bomber]] version, the '''A-8''', was planned, but never built.<ref name=sweeting123>Sweeting 2001, p. 123.</ref> Design was headed by Konrad Eicholtz.<ref name=\"Zoeller\"/>\n\nThe development programme resulted in the Ju 290 V1 [[prototype]] BD+TX, which first flew on 16 July 1942. It featured a lengthened [[fuselage]], more powerful engines, and a ''Trapoklappe'' hydraulic rear loading ramp. Both the V1 and the first eight A-1 production aircraft were unarmed transports. The need for heavy transports saw the A-1s pressed into service as soon as they were completed. Several were lost in early 1943, including one taking part in the [[Battle of Stalingrad#The Sixth Army Encircled|Stalingrad Airlift]], and two flying supplies to [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces in [[Tunisia]], and arming them became a priority.\n\nThe urgent need for Ju 290s in the long-range maritime [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] role was now also high priority, and resulted in the Ju 290A-2. Three A-1 aircraft were converted to A-2 specification on the assembly line. Production was slow due to the modifications necessary and the installation of strong defensive armament. The A-2 was fitted with [[Hohentwiel (Radar)|FuG 200 ''Hohentwiel'']] low-UHF band search [[radar]] and a dorsal [[Gun turret|turret]] fitted with a 20&nbsp;mm [[MG 151 cannon]]. The ''Hohentwiel'' radar was successfully used to locate [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] convoys at ranges of up to {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} from an altitude of {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} or {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} from an altitude of {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It allowed the Ju 290 to track convoys while remaining out of range of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] fire and carrier-based fighters.\n\nThe A-3 version followed shortly after with additional navigational equipment and a heavier defensive armament. It was fitted with two hydraulically powered HDL 151 dorsal turrets armed with 20&nbsp;mm [[MG 151 cannon|MG 151/20 cannon]]s, with a further 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 and a 13&nbsp;mm (.51&nbsp;in) [[MG 131 machine gun]] fitted in a typically German [[Gondola (airplane)|''Bola'' gondola]] (a fitment for almost all German WW II bomber aircraft) directly underneath the forward dorsal gun turret, and a 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 fitted in the tail operated by a gunner in a prone position. Two 13&nbsp;mm (.51&nbsp;in) MG 131s were also fitted in waist positions (''Fensterlafetten''). The A-3, along with the A-2, also featured large fuselage auxiliary [[fuel tank]]s. Both retained the rear loading ramp so that they could be used as transports if required.\n\nThe improved A-7 version appeared in spring 1944; 13 were completed, and 10 served with the long-range reconnaissance group, ''Fernaufkl\u00e4rungsgruppe'' (FAGr) 5. Some A-7s and some A-4s were fitted with a detachable nose turret armed with a 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 for added defense against frontal attack. No bombs were carried, as it was intended that the A-5 and A-7 would be fitted with the FuG 203 ''Kehl'' radio guidance system to launch MCLOS-guided Fritz X and Hs 293 anti-ship missiles.\n\nProduction lines were set up at the [[Letov Kbely|Letov]] aircraft factory in [[Prague]] for combat versions of the aircraft, commencing with the '''Ju 290 A-2''', which carried the aforementioned ''Hohentwiel'' maritime search radar for its patrol role. Minor changes in armament distinguished the '''A-3''' and '''A-4''', leading to the definitive '''A-5''' variant. The '''A-6''' was a 50-passenger transport aircraft.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Junkers Ju 290 A-3 FAGr 5 on ground.jpg|thumb|Operational maritime patrol Junker Ju 290 A-3 used by FAGr 5 on the ground]]\n[[File:Ju290-3s.jpg|thumb|right|Rear view with extended ''Trapoklappe'' ramp]]\nA special long-range reconnaissance group, FAGr 5 (''Fernaufkl\u00e4rungsgruppe'' 5), had been formed on 1 July 1943 and during the late summer of 1943 three of the new Ju 290 A-2s were delivered to its 1 ''Staffel'', which became operational at Mont-de-Marsan near [[Bordeaux]] on 15 October of that year. They flew their first operational missions in November 1943, shadowing Allied convoys in cooperation with U-boats, often remaining airborne for up to 18 hours.\n\nFive Ju 290 A-3 aircraft with more powerful [[BMW 801|BMW 801D]] engines in [[Kraftei|unitized]] mounts followed, as did five Ju 290 A-4 aircraft with improved dorsal turrets mounting 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20s. The Ju 290s were well suited to their patrol role and began replacing the Fw 200 ''Condors''. An A-4, Works no. 0165, was experimentally equipped with attachments for [[Fritz X|FX 1400]] [[Precision-guided munition|PGM]], and either the [[Henschel Hs 293]] or [[Henschel Hs 294|Hs 294]] anti-ship missiles, and fitted with the [[Kehl-Strasbourg radio control link|FuG 203e ''Kehl'' MCLOS radio control transmitter system]] for controlling any of them after release; it was surrendered to the US after the war and flown across the Atlantic to the USA.<ref name=sweeting123/>\n\nIn November 1943, a second ''Staffel'' was activated and, with a range of over 6,100&nbsp;km (3,790&nbsp;mi) the Ju 290s ranged far out over the Atlantic, relaying sightings of Allied convoys to U-boats. 11 '''Ju 290 A-5'''s with increased armour, 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 cannons in place of the earlier waist-mounted [[machine gun]]s, and [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s were delivered to FAGr 5 early in 1944, as were around 12 of the '''Ju 290 A-7''' version; the A-7 could carry three Hs 293 glide bombs or Fritz X armoured, anti-warship [[precision-guided munition]]s when fitted with the FuG 203 ''Kehl'' radio guidance system for them, and featured a redesigned nose section which combined a 20&nbsp;mm [[Autocannon|cannon]] installation with the [[Hohentwiel (Radar)|FuG 200 radar]] aerial array.\n\nTowards the end of 1943, [[Karl D\u00f6nitz|Admiral D\u00f6nitz]] demanded that the entire output of Ju 290s be made available for U-boat warfare. However, only 20 were assigned for this purpose. Even though both Hitler and D\u00f6nitz demanded an increase, the Luftwaffe General Staff declared it was unable to assign any more for naval reconnaissance purposes. The General Staff argued that there could be no increase in output so long as the Luftwaffe was not conceded \"precedence in overall armaments\".\n\nIn the spring of 1944, after [[Albert Speer]] had taken over the direction of air armaments, the Luftwaffe High Command boldly announced that production of the Ju 290 was to be suspended despite it being urgently needed for maritime reconnaissance; suspending production meant that resources could instead be diverted to building [[fighter aircraft|fighters]]. At that point in time, Speer's position was weak and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] was trying to find allies to help him strip Speer of his power, and the Luftwaffe was not prepared to offer the Navy more than \"goodwill\".<ref>Deist and Schreiber et al. 1990, p. 657.</ref>\n\nOn 26 May 1944, shortly after daybreak, a [[Sea Hurricane]] piloted by Sub Lieutenant Burgham from the [[escort carrier]] [[HMS Nairana (D05)|HMS ''Nairana'']] shot down Ju 290 9V+FK of FAGr 5<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luftarchiv.de/index.htm?/flugzeugbau/vbkzb.htm |title=Kennzeichen ab 1939 \u2013 Verbandskennzeichen |last=Hartmann |first=Bert |date= |website=Luftarchiv.de |publisher= |accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref> over the Bay of Biscay. The afternoon of the same day, Sub Lieutenants Mearns and Wallis attacked two more Ju 290s. Mearns shot down 9V+GK piloted by Kurt Nonneberg, which ditched in the sea.

Retrieved: 4 June 2013.</ref>\n\nAs the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] swung irrevocably in favour of the Allies with the loss by the Germans of French bases in August 1944, FAGr 5 withdrew eastwards and the remaining Ju 290s were reassigned to transport duties, including service with [[KG 200]], where they were used to drop agents behind enemy lines and other special missions.<ref>Sweeting 2001, p. 124.</ref>\n\nJu 290 A-5, works number 0178, D-AITR, ''Bayern'' of ''[[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Luft Hansa]]'' flew to [[Barcelona]] on 5 April 1945, piloted by Captain Sluzalek. The aircraft suffered damage to its landing gear on landing and was repaired with parts brought from Germany by a Lufthansa Fw 200. It remained in Spain because the Spanish Government ordered that regular Luft Hansa flights on route K22 be terminated from 21 April and was turned over to the Spanish authorities.<ref name=\"Sweeting, p. 116\">Sweeting 2001, p. 116.</ref>\n\n===Flights to Japan===\nFollowing the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, plans were made to connect Germany and Japan by air using Luftwaffe aircraft modified for very long range flights. Commercial flights to the Far East by Lufthansa were no longer possible, and it had become too dangerous for ships or U-boats to make the trip by sea. Field Marshal [[Erhard Milch]] authorised a study into the feasibility of such direct flights. Various routes were considered, including departing from German-occupied Russia and Bulgaria. Nautsi, near [[Lake Inari]] in the north of [[Finland]], was finally selected as the optimum starting point for a [[Great-circle navigation|great circle route]] along the [[Arctic Ocean]] then across eastern Siberia, to refuel in [[Manchuria]] before completing the flight to Japan.\n\nIn 1943, the Ju 290 was selected for the flights and tests began in February 1944 of a Ju 290 A-5 (works number 0170, ''Stammkennzeichen'' factory code of KR+LA) loaded with 41&nbsp;tonnes (45&nbsp;tons) of fuel and cargo. Three Ju 290 A-9s (works numbers 0182, 0183 and 0185) were modified for long-range work at the Junkers factory in March 1943. The plan was eventually put on indefinite hold after the [[Japan]]ese failed to agree on a route, as they did not want to provoke the [[Soviet Union]] by an overflight of Siberia, and the three aircraft were eventually transferred to KG 200 without any attempt at a long-range flight to Japan.\n\nThe idea for a flight to Japan was revived again in December 1944 to transport Luftwaffe General [[Ulrich Kessler]] to Japan as a replacement for the German air attach\u00e9 in Tokyo. Ju 290 A-3, no. 0163, was flown to [[Travem\u00fcnde]] for the necessary modifications, but the work was delayed and it was decided to send Kessler aboard the submarine [[Unterseeboot 234|''U-234'']] instead. The aircraft was destroyed on 3 May 1945 as British troops arrived.<ref name=\"Sweeting and Boyne, p. 125\">Sweeting and Boyne 2001, p. 125.</ref> Some sources claim that the trip to Japan took place, departing from [[Odessa]] and [[Mielec]] and landing in Manchuria.<ref>Polmar and Allen 1991, p. 455.</ref>\n\n===KG 200===\nThe Luftwaffe Special Operations squadron, [[KG 200]] used the Ju 290 amongst its various aircraft types. Their  best-known Ju 290 mission was flown on the night of 27 November 1944.&nbsp;KG 200 pilots Braun and Pohl flew a Ju 290 from Vienna to a position just south of [[Mosul]], Iraq, where they successfully air-dropped five Iraqi parachutists. Staging through the island of Rhodes, which was still under German occupation, they evacuated some thirty casualties from there to Vienna.<ref>Stahl 1981, pp. 78\u201388.</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Hitler's personal transport===\nOn 26 November 1943, Ju 290 A-5, no. 0170, along with many other new aircraft and prototypes, was shown to Adolf Hitler at [[Insterburg]], [[East Prussia]]. Hitler was impressed by its potential and told G\u00f6ring that he wanted a Ju 290 for his personal use.<ref>Sweeting 2001, p. 87.</ref>  A Ju 290 was not however assigned to the ''Fliegerstaffel des Fuehrers'' (FdF) until late 1944, when an A-7 was supplied, works number 0192, which had formerly been assigned to FAGr 5. Modifications were completed by February 1945 at the FdF's base at [[Pocking]], [[Bavaria]], a ''Stammkennzeichen ''alphabetic designation code of KR+LW being applied. Hitler's pilot, [[Hans Baur]], tested the aircraft, but Hitler never flew in it.<ref>Sweeting and Boyne 2001, p. 85.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft was fitted with a special passenger compartment in the front of the aircraft for Hitler, which was protected by 12&nbsp;mm (.5&nbsp;in) [[Vehicle armour|armour plate]] and 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in) bulletproof glass. A special escape hatch was fitted in the floor and a parachute was built into Hitler's seat; in an emergency it was intended that he would put on the parachute, pull a lever to open the hatch, and roll out through the opening. This arrangement was tested using life-size mannequins.\n\nHans Baur flew the aircraft to [[Munich-Riem Airport|Munich-Riem airport]] on 24 March 1945, landing just as an air-raid alert was sounded. He went home after parking it in a hangar but on returning to the airport, he discovered that both hangar and aircraft had been destroyed by American bombers.<ref>Sweeting and Boyne 2001, p. 87.</ref>\n\n===Amerika Bomber precursor===\n{{main|Amerika Bomber}}\nThe long range of the Ju 290 made it a good candidate for further development concerning the ''[[Amerika Bomber]]'' project, competing with the three airworthy examples of the [[Messerschmitt Me 264]], the never-built [[Heinkel He 277]] and [[Focke-Wulf Ta 400]] designs, and as a result, the six-engined [[Junkers Ju 390|Ju 390]], based directly on the Ju 290 airframe with even longer range was built in prototype form, two airframes being completed and test-flown.<ref name=\"Griehl Luftwaffe p49\">Griehl 2006, p. 49.</ref> The Ju 290 itself was under consideration to serve as a tanker to refuel [[Messerschmitt Me 264|the Messerschmitt entry]]<ref name=\"Griehl Luftwaffe p53\">Griehl 2006, p. 53.</ref> in the ''Amerika Bomber'' design competition. In late 1942 Field Marshal Milch ordered that the possibility of increasing the fuel capacity of the Ju 290 to enable it to perform the Amerika Bomber mission itself.

The Ju 290 was also intended to meet the need for large transport aircraft. A [[bomber]] version, the '''A-8''', was planned, but never built.<ref name=sweeting123>Sweeting 2001, p. 123.</ref> Design was headed by Konrad Eicholtz.<ref name=\"Zoeller\"/>\n\nThe development programme resulted in the Ju 290 V1 [[prototype]] BD+TX, which first flew on 16 July 1942. It featured a lengthened [[fuselage]], more powerful engines, and a ''Trapoklappe'' hydraulic rear loading ramp. Both the V1 and the first eight A-1 production aircraft were unarmed transports. The need for heavy transports saw the A-1s pressed into service as soon as they were completed. Several were lost in early 1943, including one taking part in the [[Battle of Stalingrad#The Sixth Army Encircled|Stalingrad Airlift]], and two flying supplies to [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces in [[Tunisia]], and arming them became a priority.\n\nThe urgent need for Ju 290s in the long-range maritime [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] role was now also high priority, and resulted in the Ju 290A-2. Three A-1 aircraft were converted to A-2 specification on the assembly line. Production was slow due to the modifications necessary and the installation of strong defensive armament. The A-2 was fitted with [[Hohentwiel (Radar)|FuG 200 ''Hohentwiel'']] low-UHF band search [[radar]] and a dorsal [[Gun turret|turret]] fitted with a 20&nbsp;mm [[MG 151 cannon]]. The ''Hohentwiel'' radar was successfully used to locate [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] convoys at ranges of up to {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} from an altitude of {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} or {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} from an altitude of {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It allowed the Ju 290 to track convoys while remaining out of range of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] fire and carrier-based fighters.\n\nThe A-3 version followed shortly after with additional navigational equipment and a heavier defensive armament. It was fitted with two hydraulically powered HDL 151 dorsal turrets armed with 20&nbsp;mm [[MG 151 cannon|MG 151/20 cannon]]s, with a further 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 and a 13&nbsp;mm (.51&nbsp;in) [[MG 131 machine gun]] fitted in a typically German [[Gondola (airplane)|''Bola'' gondola]] (a fitment for almost all German WW II bomber aircraft) directly underneath the forward dorsal gun turret, and a 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 fitted in the tail operated by a gunner in a prone position. Two 13&nbsp;mm (.51&nbsp;in) MG 131s were also fitted in waist positions (''Fensterlafetten''). The A-3, along with the A-2, also featured large fuselage auxiliary [[fuel tank]]s. Both retained the rear loading ramp so that they could be used as transports if required.\n\nThe improved A-7 version appeared in spring 1944; 13 were completed, and 10 served with the long-range reconnaissance group, ''Fernaufkl\u00e4rungsgruppe'' (FAGr) 5. Some A-7s and some A-4s were fitted with a detachable nose turret armed with a 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 for added defense against frontal attack. No bombs were carried, as it was intended that the A-5 and A-7 would be fitted with the FuG 203 ''Kehl'' radio guidance system to launch MCLOS-guided Fritz X and Hs 293 anti-ship missiles.\n\nProduction lines were set up at the [[Letov Kbely|Letov]] aircraft factory in [[Prague]] for combat versions of the aircraft, commencing with the '''Ju 290 A-2''', which carried the aforementioned ''Hohentwiel'' maritime search radar for its patrol role. Minor changes in armament distinguished the '''A-3''' and '''A-4''', leading to the definitive '''A-5''' variant. The '''A-6''' was a 50-passenger transport aircraft.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Junkers Ju 290 A-3 FAGr 5 on ground.jpg|thumb|Operational maritime patrol Junker Ju 290 A-3 used by FAGr 5 on the ground]]\n[[File:Ju290-3s.jpg|thumb|right|Rear view with extended ''Trapoklappe'' ramp]]\nA special long-range reconnaissance group, FAGr 5 (''Fernaufkl\u00e4rungsgruppe'' 5), had been formed on 1 July 1943 and during the late summer of 1943 three of the new Ju 290 A-2s were delivered to its 1 ''Staffel'', which became operational at Mont-de-Marsan near [[Bordeaux]] on 15 October of that year. They flew their first operational missions in November 1943, shadowing Allied convoys in cooperation with U-boats, often remaining airborne for up to 18 hours.\n\nFive Ju 290 A-3 aircraft with more powerful [[BMW 801|BMW 801D]] engines in [[Kraftei|unitized]] mounts followed, as did five Ju 290 A-4 aircraft with improved dorsal turrets mounting 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20s. The Ju 290s were well suited to their patrol role and began replacing the Fw 200 ''Condors''. An A-4, Works no. 0165, was experimentally equipped with attachments for [[Fritz X|FX 1400]] [[Precision-guided munition|PGM]], and either the [[Henschel Hs 293]] or [[Henschel Hs 294|Hs 294]] anti-ship missiles, and fitted with the [[Kehl-Strasbourg radio control link|FuG 203e ''Kehl'' MCLOS radio control transmitter system]] for controlling any of them after release; it was surrendered to the US after the war and flown across the Atlantic to the USA.<ref name=sweeting123/>\n\nIn November 1943, a second ''Staffel'' was activated and, with a range of over 6,100&nbsp;km (3,790&nbsp;mi) the Ju 290s ranged far out over the Atlantic, relaying sightings of Allied convoys to U-boats. 11 '''Ju 290 A-5'''s with increased armour, 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 cannons in place of the earlier waist-mounted [[machine gun]]s, and [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s were delivered to FAGr 5 early in 1944, as were around 12 of the '''Ju 290 A-7''' version; the A-7 could carry three Hs 293 glide bombs or Fritz X armoured, anti-warship [[precision-guided munition]]s when fitted with the FuG 203 ''Kehl'' radio guidance system for them, and featured a redesigned nose section which combined a 20&nbsp;mm [[Autocannon|cannon]] installation with the [[Hohentwiel (Radar)|FuG 200 radar]] aerial array.\n\nTowards the end of 1943, [[Karl D\u00f6nitz|Admiral D\u00f6nitz]] demanded that the entire output of Ju 290s be made available for U-boat warfare. However, only 20 were assigned for this purpose. Even though both Hitler and D\u00f6nitz demanded an increase, the Luftwaffe General Staff declared it was unable to assign any more for naval reconnaissance purposes. The General Staff argued that there could be no increase in output so long as the Luftwaffe was not conceded \"precedence in overall armaments\".\n\nIn the spring of 1944, after [[Albert Speer]] had taken over the direction of air armaments, the Luftwaffe High Command boldly announced that production of the Ju 290 was to be suspended despite it being urgently needed for maritime reconnaissance; suspending production meant that resources could instead be diverted to building [[fighter aircraft|fighters]]. At that point in time, Speer's position was weak and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] was trying to find allies to help him strip Speer of his power, and the Luftwaffe was not prepared to offer the Navy more than \"goodwill\".<ref>Deist and Schreiber et al. 1990, p. 657.</ref>\n\nOn 26 May 1944, shortly after daybreak, a [[Sea Hurricane]] piloted by Sub Lieutenant Burgham from the [[escort carrier]] [[HMS Nairana (D05)|HMS ''Nairana'']] shot down Ju 290 9V+FK of FAGr 5<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luftarchiv.de/index.htm?/flugzeugbau/vbkzb.htm |title=Kennzeichen ab 1939 \u2013 Verbandskennzeichen |last=Hartmann |first=Bert |date= |website=Luftarchiv.de |publisher= |accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref> over the Bay of Biscay. The afternoon of the same day, Sub Lieutenants Mearns and Wallis attacked two more Ju 290s. Mearns shot down 9V+GK piloted by Kurt Nonneberg, which ditched in the sea. The other Ju 290 disappeared on fire into cloud and was assumed to have crashed.<ref>Thomas and Weal 2003, pp. 81\u201382.</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/naval-obituaries/5533906/Lt-Cdr-Sammy-Mearns.html \"Obituary of Lt-Cdr Sammy Mearns.\"] ''The Telegraph''. Retrieved: 4 June 2013.</ref>\n\nAs the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] swung irrevocably in favour of the Allies with the loss by the Germans of French bases in August 1944, FAGr 5 withdrew eastwards and the remaining Ju 290s were reassigned to transport duties, including service with [[KG 200]], where they were used to drop agents behind enemy lines and other special missions.<ref>Sweeting 2001, p. 124.</ref>\n\nJu 290 A-5, works number 0178, D-AITR, ''Bayern'' of ''[[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Luft Hansa]]'' flew to [[Barcelona]] on 5 April 1945, piloted by Captain Sluzalek. The aircraft suffered damage to its landing gear on landing and was repaired with parts brought from Germany by a Lufthansa Fw 200. It remained in Spain because the Spanish Government ordered that regular Luft Hansa flights on route K22 be terminated from 21 April and was turned over to the Spanish authorities.<ref name=\"Sweeting, p. 116\">Sweeting 2001, p. 116.</ref>\n\n===Flights to Japan===\nFollowing the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, plans were made to connect Germany and Japan by air using Luftwaffe aircraft modified for very long range flights. Commercial flights to the Far East by Lufthansa were no longer possible, and it had become too dangerous for ships or U-boats to make the trip by sea. Field Marshal [[Erhard Milch]] authorised a study into the feasibility of such direct flights. Various routes were considered, including departing from German-occupied Russia and Bulgaria. Nautsi, near [[Lake Inari]] in the north of [[Finland]], was finally selected as the optimum starting point for a [[Great-circle navigation|great circle route]] along the [[Arctic Ocean]] then across eastern Siberia, to refuel in [[Manchuria]] before completing the flight to Japan.\n\nIn 1943, the Ju 290 was selected for the flights and tests began in February 1944 of a Ju 290 A-5 (works number 0170, ''Stammkennzeichen'' factory code of KR+LA) loaded with 41&nbsp;tonnes (45&nbsp;tons) of fuel and cargo. Three Ju 290 A-9s (works numbers 0182, 0183 and 0185) were modified for long-range work at the Junkers factory in March 1943. The plan was eventually put on indefinite hold after the [[Japan]]ese failed to agree on a route, as they did not want to provoke the [[Soviet Union]] by an overflight of Siberia, and the three aircraft were eventually transferred to KG 200 without any attempt at a long-range flight to Japan.\n\nThe idea for a flight to Japan was revived again in December 1944 to transport Luftwaffe General [[Ulrich Kessler]] to Japan as a replacement for the German air attach\u00e9 in Tokyo. Ju 290 A-3, no. 0163, was flown to [[Travem\u00fcnde]] for the necessary modifications, but the work was delayed and it was decided to send Kessler aboard the submarine [[Unterseeboot 234|''U-234'']] instead. The aircraft was destroyed on 3 May 1945 as British troops arrived.<ref name=\"Sweeting and Boyne, p. 125\">Sweeting and Boyne 2001, p. 125.</ref> Some sources claim that the trip to Japan took place, departing from [[Odessa]] and [[Mielec]] and landing in Manchuria.<ref>Polmar and Allen 1991, p. 455.</ref>\n\n===KG 200===\nThe Luftwaffe Special Operations squadron, [[KG 200]] used the Ju 290 amongst its various aircraft types. Their  best-known Ju 290 mission was flown on the night of 27 November 1944.&nbsp;KG 200 pilots Braun and Pohl flew a Ju 290 from Vienna to a position just south of [[Mosul]], Iraq, where they successfully air-dropped five Iraqi parachutists. Staging through the island of Rhodes, which was still under German occupation, they evacuated some thirty casualties from there to Vienna.<ref>Stahl 1981, pp. 78\u201388.</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Hitler's personal transport===\nOn 26 November 1943, Ju 290 A-5, no. 0170, along with many other new aircraft and prototypes, was shown to Adolf Hitler at [[Insterburg]], [[East Prussia]]. Hitler was impressed by its potential and told G\u00f6ring that he wanted a Ju 290 for his personal use.<ref>Sweeting 2001, p. 87.</ref>  A Ju 290 was not however assigned to the ''Fliegerstaffel des Fuehrers'' (FdF) until late 1944, when an A-7 was supplied, works number 0192, which had formerly been assigned to FAGr 5. Modifications were completed by February 1945 at the FdF's base at [[Pocking]], [[Bavaria]], a ''Stammkennzeichen ''alphabetic designation code of KR+LW being applied. Hitler's pilot, [[Hans Baur]], tested the aircraft, but Hitler never flew in it.<ref>Sweeting and Boyne 2001, p. 85.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft was fitted with a special passenger compartment in the front of the aircraft for Hitler, which was protected by 12&nbsp;mm (.5&nbsp;in) [[Vehicle armour|armour plate]] and 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in) bulletproof glass. A special escape hatch was fitted in the floor and a parachute was built into Hitler's seat; in an emergency it was intended that he would put on the parachute, pull a lever to open the hatch, and roll out through the opening. This arrangement was tested using life-size mannequins.\n\nHans Baur flew the aircraft to [[Munich-Riem Airport|Munich-Riem airport]] on 24 March 1945, landing just as an air-raid alert was sounded. He went home after parking it in a hangar but on returning to the airport, he discovered that both hangar and aircraft had been destroyed by American bombers.<ref>Sweeting and Boyne 2001, p. 87.</ref>\n\n===Amerika Bomber precursor===\n{{main|Amerika Bomber}}\nThe long range of the Ju 290 made it a good candidate for further development concerning the ''[[Amerika Bomber]]'' project, competing with the three airworthy examples of the [[Messerschmitt Me 264]], the never-built [[Heinkel He 277]] and [[Focke-Wulf Ta 400]] designs, and as a result, the six-engined [[Junkers Ju 390|Ju 390]], based directly on the Ju 290 airframe with even longer range was built in prototype form, two airframes being completed and test-flown.<ref name=\"Griehl Luftwaffe p49\">Griehl 2006, p. 49.</ref> The Ju 290 itself was under consideration to serve as a tanker to refuel [[Messerschmitt Me 264|the Messerschmitt entry]]<ref name=\"Griehl Luftwaffe p53\">Griehl 2006, p. 53.</ref> in the ''Amerika Bomber'' design competition. In late 1942 Field Marshal Milch ordered that the possibility of increasing the fuel capacity of the Ju 290 to enable it to perform the Amerika Bomber mission itself. The draw backs were twofold, first the initial rate of climb would be very poor, and the fully loaded airplane could only operate out of two fields in France.<ref name=\"Griehl Luftwaffe p53\">Griehl 2006, p. 53.</ref> A lightened Ju 290E subtype was proposed in March 1943, but remained on paper.<ref name=\"Griehl Luftwaffe p493\">Griehl 2006, p. 93.</ref> The Ju 390 at its gross weight required a tow to take off.

When used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, boceprevir  resulted in significantly higher sustained viral response (SVR) rates in the most difficult-to-treat patients with genotype 1.\n\nThe phase-II trial compared three different regimens: four weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg once weekly) plus ribavirin (800 to 1400&nbsp;mg daily based on patient weight) followed by boceprevir (800&nbsp;mg three times a day in addition to peginterferon and ribavirin) for 24 weeks or 44 weeks; boceprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin as above for 28 or 48 weeks (triple therapy); and peginterferon alfa-2b plus low-dose ribavirin (400 to 1000&nbsp;mg/day) and boceprevir for 48 weeks.\n\nThe patients enrolled in the SPRINT-1 study were among the most difficult to treat, and were exclusively those with genotype 1. (The patients were all treatment naive.) Additionally, many of the patients had other difficult-to-treat indices, including cirrhosis (6\u20139%), high viral load (90%), and African-American ancestry (14\u201317%).  An SVR after 24 weeks off therapy of 75% was achieved in the group treated for 48 weeks with four weeks of lead-in therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin followed by the addition of boceprivir.  This represents a near doubling of the rate of SVR compared to standard therapy without boceprevir in this group.\n\nAnemia was the most common adverse event. It occurred in half of the patients who received boceprevir and by about a third of the patients taking peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin at the standard dose.\n\nThe lead investigator of the study was Dr. Paul Kwo, associate professor of medicine at the School of Medicine, Indiana University, in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hcvadvocate.org/news/reports/EASL_2009/Advocate_EASL_2009_Coverage.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511003248/http://www.hcvadvocate.org/news/reports/EASL_2009/Advocate_EASL_2009_Coverage.htm# |archive-date=2009-05-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== SPRINT-2 trial ===\nThe SPRINT-2 trial <ref name=\"SPRINT2\">{{cite journal |author=Poordad, F |title=Boceprevir for Untreated Chronic HCV Genotype 1 Infection |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=364 |issue=13 |pages=1195\u2013206 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21449783|pmc=3766849 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa1010494|url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> was a double-blind study which randomly assigned adults with untreated hepatitis C virus, genotype 1, to one of three groups.

When used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, boceprevir  resulted in significantly higher sustained viral response (SVR) rates in the most difficult-to-treat patients with genotype 1.\n\nThe phase-II trial compared three different regimens: four weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg once weekly) plus ribavirin (800 to 1400&nbsp;mg daily based on patient weight) followed by boceprevir (800&nbsp;mg three times a day in addition to peginterferon and ribavirin) for 24 weeks or 44 weeks; boceprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin as above for 28 or 48 weeks (triple therapy); and peginterferon alfa-2b plus low-dose ribavirin (400 to 1000&nbsp;mg/day) and boceprevir for 48 weeks.\n\nThe patients enrolled in the SPRINT-1 study were among the most difficult to treat, and were exclusively those with genotype 1. (The patients were all treatment naive.) Additionally, many of the patients had other difficult-to-treat indices, including cirrhosis (6\u20139%), high viral load (90%), and African-American ancestry (14\u201317%).  An SVR after 24 weeks off therapy of 75% was achieved in the group treated for 48 weeks with four weeks of lead-in therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin followed by the addition of boceprivir.  This represents a near doubling of the rate of SVR compared to standard therapy without boceprevir in this group.\n\nAnemia was the most common adverse event. It occurred in half of the patients who received boceprevir and by about a third of the patients taking peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin at the standard dose.\n\nThe lead investigator of the study was Dr. Paul Kwo, associate professor of medicine at the School of Medicine, Indiana University, in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hcvadvocate.org/news/reports/EASL_2009/Advocate_EASL_2009_Coverage.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511003248/http://www.hcvadvocate.org/news/reports/EASL_2009/Advocate_EASL_2009_Coverage.htm# |archive-date=2009-05-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== SPRINT-2 trial ===\nThe SPRINT-2 trial <ref name=\"SPRINT2\">{{cite journal |author=Poordad, F |title=Boceprevir for Untreated Chronic HCV Genotype 1 Infection |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=364 |issue=13 |pages=1195\u2013206 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21449783|pmc=3766849 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa1010494|url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> was a double-blind study which randomly assigned adults with untreated hepatitis C virus, genotype 1, to one of three groups.

From the age of 16, she was mainly resident in England, where she was sent for her education. She is best known for her novel ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' (1966), written as a [[prequel]] to [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Modjeska |first=Drusilla  |title=Stravinsky's Lunch |publisher=Picador |year=1999 |location=Sydney |isbn=0-330-36259-3}}</ref> In 1978 she was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire]] for her writing.\n\n==Early life==\nRhys was born in [[Roseau]], the capital of [[Dominica]], one of the [[British Leeward Islands]]. Her father, William Rees Williams, was a Welsh doctor and her mother, Minna Williams, n\u00e9e Lockhart, was a third-generation Dominican [[Creole peoples#Caribbean|Creole]] of Scots ancestry. (\"Creole\" was broadly used in those times to refer to any person born on the island, whether they were of European or African descent, or both.) She had a brother. Her mother's family had an estate, a former plantation, on the island.\n\nRhys was educated in Dominica until the age of 16, when she was sent to England to live with an aunt, as her relations with her mother were difficult. She attended the [[Perse School for Girls]] in Cambridge,<ref name=\"carr\" /> where she was mocked as an outsider and for her accent. She attended two terms at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London by 1909. Her instructors despaired of her ever learning to speak \"proper English\" and advised her father to take her away. Unable to train as an actress and refusing to return to the Caribbean as her parents wished, Williams worked with varied success as a [[chorus girl]], adopting the names Vivienne, Emma or Ella Gray. She toured Britain's small towns and returned to rooming or boarding houses in rundown neighbourhoods of London.<ref name=\"carr\">Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nAfter her father died in 1910, Rhys appeared to have experimented with living as a [[demimonde|demimondaine]]. She became the mistress of wealthy stockbroker Lancelot Grey Hugh (\"Lancey\") Smith, whose father [[Hugh Colin Smith]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://genealogy.links.org/links-cgi/readged?/home/ben/camilla-genealogy/current+c-smith81059+2-2-0-1-0|title=Lancelot Grey Hugh SMITH |website=genealogy.links.org |access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> had been [[Governor of the Bank of England]]. Though he was a bachelor, Smith did not offer to marry Rhys, and their affair soon ended. However, he continued to be an occasional source of financial help. Distraught by events, including a near-fatal abortion (not Smith's child), Rhys began writing and produced an early version of her novel ''Voyage in the Dark''.<ref name=\"carr\"/> In 1913 she worked for a time in London as a nude model.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], Rhys served as a volunteer worker in a soldiers' canteen. In 1918 she worked in a pension office.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1919 Rhys married Willem Johan Marie (Jean) Lenglet, a French-Dutch journalist, spy and songwriter. He was the first of her three husbands.<ref name=\"carr\"/> She and Lenglet wandered through Europe. They had two children, a son who died young and a daughter. They divorced in 1933, and her daughter lived mostly with her father.\n\nThe next year Rhys married Leslie Tilden-Smith, an English editor. In 1930 they went briefly to Dominica, the first time Rhys had returned since she had left for school. She found her family estate deteriorating and island conditions less agreeable. Her brother Oscar was living in England, and she took care of some financial affairs for him, making a settlement with an island [[mixed-race]] woman and Oscar's illegitimate children by her.\n\nIn 1937 Rhys began a friendship with novelist [[Eliot Bliss]] (who had taken her first name in honour of two authors she admired). The two women shared Caribbean backgrounds. The correspondence between them survives.<ref>McFarlin Library [http://orgs.utulsa.edu/spcol/?p=2073 Retrieved 17 September 2015.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027074557/http://orgs.utulsa.edu/spcol/?p=2073 |date=27 October 2017 }} Bliss is quoted on their relations in Alexandra Pringle's introduction to the 1984 reissue of Bliss's novel ''Luminous Isle'': \"She used to make me delightful West-Indian suppers, and we used to drink an awful lot. Well, she could hold it, but it used to make me ill, frequently ill. And she had a delightful husband who used to leave us, go out. Well, often he would come home and find us drunk. He once picked her off the floor. And he was furious if he found we'd drunk his wine.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1939 Rhys and Tilden-Smith moved to [[Devon]], where they lived for several years. He died in 1945. In 1947 Rhys married Max Hamer, a solicitor who was a cousin of Tilden-Smith. He was convicted of fraud and imprisoned after their marriage.<ref>[http://readingdetectives.org/kent/2009/10/from-maidstone-prison-to-the-wide-sargasso-sea.html \"Kent: From Maidstone Prison to the Wide Sargasso Sea!\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002910/http://readingdetectives.org/kent/2009/10/from-maidstone-prison-to-the-wide-sargasso-sea.html |date= 3 December 2013}}, Reading Detectives.</ref> He died in 1966.\n\n==Writing career==\nIn 1924 Rhys came under the influence of English writer [[Ford Madox Ford]]. After meeting Ford in Paris, Rhys wrote short stories under his patronage. Ford recognised that her experience as an exile gave Rhys a unique viewpoint, and praised her \"singular instinct for form\". \"Coming from the [[West Indies]], [Ford] declared, 'with a terrifying insight and... passion for stating the case of the underdog, she has let her pen loose on the Left Banks of the Old World'.\"<ref name=\"carr\"/> This he wrote in his preface to her debut short story collection, [[The Left Bank and Other Stories|''The Left Bank and Other Stories'']] (1927).\n\nIt was Ford who suggested she change her name from Ella Williams to Jean Rhys.<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\">Owen, Katie, \"Introduction\", ''Quartet'', Penguin Modern Classics edition, Penguin, 2000, p. vi. {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref> At the time her husband was in jail for what Rhys described as currency irregularities.\n\nRhys moved in with Ford and his long-time partner, [[Stella Bowen]]. An affair with Ford ensued, which she portrayed in fictionalised form in her novel ''[[Quartet (Jean Rhys novel)|Quartet]]'' (1928)<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\" /> Her protagonist is a stranded foreigner, Marya Zelli, who finds herself at the mercy of strangers when her husband is jailed in Paris. ''Quartet's'' 1981 [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory film]] adaptation starred [[Maggie Smith]], [[Isabelle Adjani]], [[Anthony Higgins (actor)|Anthony Higgins]], and [[Alan Bates]]. \n\nIn ''[[After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie]]'' (1931), the protagonist, Julia Martin, is a more unravelled version of Marya Zelli, romantically dumped and inhabiting the sidewalks, cafes and cheap hotel rooms of Paris.\n\nWith ''[[Voyage in the Dark]]'' (1934), Rhys continued to portray a mistreated, rootless woman. Here the narrator, Anna, is a young chorus girl who grew up in the West Indies and feels alienated in England. \n\n''[[Good Morning, Midnight (Rhys novel)|Good Morning, Midnight]]'' (1939) is often considered a continuation of Rhys's first two novels. Here she uses modified [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to voice the experiences of an ageing woman, Sasha Jansen, who drinks, takes sleeping pills and obsesses over her looks, and is adrift again in Paris. ''Good Morning, Midnight'', acknowledged as well written but deemed depressing, came as [[World War II]] broke out and readers sought optimism. This seemingly ended Rhys's literary career. \n\nIn the 1940s Rhys largely withdrew from public life. From 1955 to 1960 she lived in [[Bude]], Cornwall, where she was unhappy, calling it \"Bude the Obscure\", before moving to [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]] in Devon.\n\nAfter a long absence from the public eye she was rediscovered by [[Selma Vaz Dias]], who in 1949 placed an advertisement in the [[New Statesman]] asking about her whereabouts, with a view to obtaining the rights to adapt her novel [[Good_Morning,_Midnight_(Rhys_novel)|''Good Morning Midnight'']] for radio. Rhys responded, and thereafter developed a long-lasting and collaborative friendship with Vaz Dias, who encouraged her to start writing again. This encouragement ultimately led to the publication in 1966 of her critically acclaimed novel ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]''. She intended it as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. Begun well before she settled in Bude, the book won the notable [[WH Smith Literary Award]] in 1967. She returned to themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Dominica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr Rochester and deteriorates in England as the \"madwoman in the attic\". Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in ''Jane Eyre''. [[Diana Athill]] of [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] gambled on publishing ''Wide Sargasso Sea''. She and the writer [[Francis Wyndham (Writer)|Francis Wyndham]] helped to revive interest in Rhys's work.<ref name=Penguin>Preliminary page in Jean Rhys, ''Quartet'', Penguin: 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published a collection of Rhys's short stories, ''[[Tigers Are Better-Looking]]'', of which eight were written during her 1950s period of obscurity and nine republished from her 1927 collection ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]''. In 1976 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published another collection of her short stories, ''[[Sleep It Off Lady]]'', consisting of 16 pieces from an approximately 75-year period, starting from the end of the 19th century.\n\n==Later years==\nFrom 1960, and for the rest of her life, Rhys lived in [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]], a small village in Devon that she once described as \"a dull spot which even drink can't enliven much.\"<ref>[http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html \"Villagers Reject 'Dull Spot' Jibe\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121084752/http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html |date=21 November 2015}}, ''Exeter Express & Echo'', 11 February 2010.</ref> Characteristically, she remained unimpressed by her belated ascent to literary fame, commenting, \"It has come too late.\"<ref name=Penguin /> In an interview shortly before her death she questioned whether any novelist, not least herself, could ever be happy for any length of time: \"If I could choose I would rather be happy than write... if I could live my life all over again, and choose....\"<ref>''In Their Own Words: British Novelists.

Her mother's family had an estate, a former plantation, on the island.\n\nRhys was educated in Dominica until the age of 16, when she was sent to England to live with an aunt, as her relations with her mother were difficult. She attended the [[Perse School for Girls]] in Cambridge,<ref name=\"carr\" /> where she was mocked as an outsider and for her accent. She attended two terms at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London by 1909. Her instructors despaired of her ever learning to speak \"proper English\" and advised her father to take her away. Unable to train as an actress and refusing to return to the Caribbean as her parents wished, Williams worked with varied success as a [[chorus girl]], adopting the names Vivienne, Emma or Ella Gray. She toured Britain's small towns and returned to rooming or boarding houses in rundown neighbourhoods of London.<ref name=\"carr\">Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nAfter her father died in 1910, Rhys appeared to have experimented with living as a [[demimonde|demimondaine]]. She became the mistress of wealthy stockbroker Lancelot Grey Hugh (\"Lancey\") Smith, whose father [[Hugh Colin Smith]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://genealogy.links.org/links-cgi/readged?/home/ben/camilla-genealogy/current+c-smith81059+2-2-0-1-0|title=Lancelot Grey Hugh SMITH |website=genealogy.links.org |access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> had been [[Governor of the Bank of England]]. Though he was a bachelor, Smith did not offer to marry Rhys, and their affair soon ended. However, he continued to be an occasional source of financial help. Distraught by events, including a near-fatal abortion (not Smith's child), Rhys began writing and produced an early version of her novel ''Voyage in the Dark''.<ref name=\"carr\"/> In 1913 she worked for a time in London as a nude model.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], Rhys served as a volunteer worker in a soldiers' canteen. In 1918 she worked in a pension office.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1919 Rhys married Willem Johan Marie (Jean) Lenglet, a French-Dutch journalist, spy and songwriter. He was the first of her three husbands.<ref name=\"carr\"/> She and Lenglet wandered through Europe. They had two children, a son who died young and a daughter. They divorced in 1933, and her daughter lived mostly with her father.\n\nThe next year Rhys married Leslie Tilden-Smith, an English editor. In 1930 they went briefly to Dominica, the first time Rhys had returned since she had left for school. She found her family estate deteriorating and island conditions less agreeable. Her brother Oscar was living in England, and she took care of some financial affairs for him, making a settlement with an island [[mixed-race]] woman and Oscar's illegitimate children by her.\n\nIn 1937 Rhys began a friendship with novelist [[Eliot Bliss]] (who had taken her first name in honour of two authors she admired). The two women shared Caribbean backgrounds. The correspondence between them survives.<ref>McFarlin Library [http://orgs.utulsa.edu/spcol/?p=2073 Retrieved 17 September 2015.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027074557/http://orgs.utulsa.edu/spcol/?p=2073 |date=27 October 2017 }} Bliss is quoted on their relations in Alexandra Pringle's introduction to the 1984 reissue of Bliss's novel ''Luminous Isle'': \"She used to make me delightful West-Indian suppers, and we used to drink an awful lot. Well, she could hold it, but it used to make me ill, frequently ill. And she had a delightful husband who used to leave us, go out. Well, often he would come home and find us drunk. He once picked her off the floor. And he was furious if he found we'd drunk his wine.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1939 Rhys and Tilden-Smith moved to [[Devon]], where they lived for several years. He died in 1945. In 1947 Rhys married Max Hamer, a solicitor who was a cousin of Tilden-Smith. He was convicted of fraud and imprisoned after their marriage.<ref>[http://readingdetectives.org/kent/2009/10/from-maidstone-prison-to-the-wide-sargasso-sea.html \"Kent: From Maidstone Prison to the Wide Sargasso Sea!\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002910/http://readingdetectives.org/kent/2009/10/from-maidstone-prison-to-the-wide-sargasso-sea.html |date= 3 December 2013}}, Reading Detectives.</ref> He died in 1966.\n\n==Writing career==\nIn 1924 Rhys came under the influence of English writer [[Ford Madox Ford]]. After meeting Ford in Paris, Rhys wrote short stories under his patronage. Ford recognised that her experience as an exile gave Rhys a unique viewpoint, and praised her \"singular instinct for form\". \"Coming from the [[West Indies]], [Ford] declared, 'with a terrifying insight and... passion for stating the case of the underdog, she has let her pen loose on the Left Banks of the Old World'.\"<ref name=\"carr\"/> This he wrote in his preface to her debut short story collection, [[The Left Bank and Other Stories|''The Left Bank and Other Stories'']] (1927).\n\nIt was Ford who suggested she change her name from Ella Williams to Jean Rhys.<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\">Owen, Katie, \"Introduction\", ''Quartet'', Penguin Modern Classics edition, Penguin, 2000, p. vi. {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref> At the time her husband was in jail for what Rhys described as currency irregularities.\n\nRhys moved in with Ford and his long-time partner, [[Stella Bowen]]. An affair with Ford ensued, which she portrayed in fictionalised form in her novel ''[[Quartet (Jean Rhys novel)|Quartet]]'' (1928)<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\" /> Her protagonist is a stranded foreigner, Marya Zelli, who finds herself at the mercy of strangers when her husband is jailed in Paris. ''Quartet's'' 1981 [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory film]] adaptation starred [[Maggie Smith]], [[Isabelle Adjani]], [[Anthony Higgins (actor)|Anthony Higgins]], and [[Alan Bates]]. \n\nIn ''[[After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie]]'' (1931), the protagonist, Julia Martin, is a more unravelled version of Marya Zelli, romantically dumped and inhabiting the sidewalks, cafes and cheap hotel rooms of Paris.\n\nWith ''[[Voyage in the Dark]]'' (1934), Rhys continued to portray a mistreated, rootless woman. Here the narrator, Anna, is a young chorus girl who grew up in the West Indies and feels alienated in England. \n\n''[[Good Morning, Midnight (Rhys novel)|Good Morning, Midnight]]'' (1939) is often considered a continuation of Rhys's first two novels. Here she uses modified [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to voice the experiences of an ageing woman, Sasha Jansen, who drinks, takes sleeping pills and obsesses over her looks, and is adrift again in Paris. [[Good Morning, Midnight (Rhys novel)|''Good Morning, Midnight'']], acknowledged as well written but deemed depressing, came as [[World War II]] broke out and readers sought optimism. This seemingly ended Rhys's literary career. \n\nIn the 1940s Rhys largely withdrew from public life. From 1955 to 1960 she lived in [[Bude]], Cornwall, where she was unhappy, calling it \"Bude the Obscure\", before moving to [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]] in Devon.\n\nAfter a long absence from the public eye she was rediscovered by [[Selma Vaz Dias]], who in 1949 placed an advertisement in the [[New Statesman]] asking about her whereabouts, with a view to obtaining the rights to adapt her novel [[Good_Morning,_Midnight_(Rhys_novel)|''Good Morning Midnight'']] for radio. Rhys responded, and thereafter developed a long-lasting and collaborative friendship with Vaz Dias, who encouraged her to start writing again. This encouragement ultimately led to the publication in 1966 of her critically acclaimed novel ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]''. She intended it as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. Begun well before she settled in Bude, the book won the notable [[WH Smith Literary Award]] in 1967. She returned to themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Dominica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr Rochester and deteriorates in England as the \"madwoman in the attic\". Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in ''Jane Eyre''. [[Diana Athill]] of [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] gambled on publishing ''Wide Sargasso Sea''. She and the writer [[Francis Wyndham (Writer)|Francis Wyndham]] helped to revive interest in Rhys's work.<ref name=Penguin>Preliminary page in Jean Rhys, ''Quartet'', Penguin: 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published a collection of Rhys's short stories, ''[[Tigers Are Better-Looking]]'', of which eight were written during her 1950s period of obscurity and nine republished from her 1927 collection ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]''. In 1976 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published another collection of her short stories, ''[[Sleep It Off Lady]]'', consisting of 16 pieces from an approximately 75-year period, starting from the end of the 19th century.\n\n==Later years==\nFrom 1960, and for the rest of her life, Rhys lived in [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]], a small village in Devon that she once described as \"a dull spot which even drink can't enliven much.\"<ref>[http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html \"Villagers Reject 'Dull Spot' Jibe\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121084752/http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html |date=21 November 2015}}, ''Exeter Express & Echo'', 11 February 2010.</ref> Characteristically, she remained unimpressed by her belated ascent to literary fame, commenting, \"It has come too late.\"<ref name=Penguin /> In an interview shortly before her death she questioned whether any novelist, not least herself, could ever be happy for any length of time: \"If I could choose I would rather be happy than write... if I could live my life all over again, and choose....\"<ref>''In Their Own Words: British Novelists.

A parliamentary minister, [[Philippe S\u00e9guin]], wished to create a French-language equivalent.\n\nIn 1996, after nineteen governmental reports in ten years, Prime Minister [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] asked [[Radio France Internationale]] president [[Jean-Paul Cluzel]] (who was also [[General Inspection of Finances (France)|General Inspector of Finances]]) to create a French international news channel. Cluzel proposed in 1997 to group TV5, RFI, and CFI within a corporation entitled T\u00e9l\u00e9fi. The [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]-led government decided to follow that recommendation but, with the return of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to government and the nomination of [[Hubert V\u00e9drine]], the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, favoured the augmentation of existing outlets such as TV5, which started to produce its own programming, notably its news bulletins, which in turn created its own news team.\n\nAdditionally with the creation of [[EuroNews]] in 1993 (with French-language commentary), the media presence of France overseas became more complex, more fragmented, and costlier, without being able to rely on a true round-the-clock international news channel.\n\n===Relaunched project (2002\u20132003)===\nIn 2002, President Jacques Chirac relaunched the project to create a French international news channel; after a speech given at a reception in honour of the High Council of the Francophonie at the '\u00c9lys\u00e9e on 12 February 2002, he stated:\n\n''\"Is it understandable that year after year we are still lamenting our persistent failure with news and the French-language media on the international scene? Admittedly, we have with [[Agence France-Presse]] a remarkable information tool that we must continue to reinforce, notably in its international mission. Indeed, everyone here recognises the recent progress made by RFI, by TV5, by CFI, thanks to the efforts of their teams and to the determination of the public bodies. But everybody notices that we are still far from having a large international news channel in French, capable of competing with the BBC or CNN.\"''<ref>[http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/fevrier/allocution_prononcee_par_m_jacques_chirac_president_de_la_republique_lors_de_la_reception_en_l_honneur_du_haut_conseil_de_la_francophonie-palais_de_l_elysee.2162.html Speech given by Jacques Chirac to the High Commission of the Francophonie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210853/http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/fevrier/allocution_prononcee_par_m_jacques_chirac_president_de_la_republique_lors_de_la_reception_en_l_honneur_du_haut_conseil_de_la_francophonie-palais_de_l_elysee.2162.html |date=30 September 2007 }} (French), 12 February 2002.</ref>\n\n''The recent crises have shown the handicap that a country suffers, a cultural area, which doesn't possess a sufficient weight in the battle of the images and the airwaves.

Broadcasting primarily in the French language, this service will assure a more important and more visible presence of France in the worldwide battle of images, and to contribute to the pluralism of international information by offering to our viewers the choice of a different viewpoint on the news, marked by a singular point of view of our country on world affairs, by its culture and by its own ideas, and to value its historical links and its privileged geography. The international news channel must contribute to a long-lasting strategy of influence of France in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071022113155/http://www.ddm.gouv.fr/article.php3?id_article=615 Consultation guide, Direction and Developemt of Media (Archive)] (French)</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the application deadline on 22 April 2003, three candidates replied:\n* '''France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions''' & '''RFI''': to operate a channel entirely run by the public service sector;\n* '''Groupe TF1''' : proposed an international version of its '''LCI''' channel;\n* '''Groupe Canal+''' : proposed a news \"factory\" to reinforce its '''[[i-T\u00e9l\u00e9|i>T\u00e9l\u00e9]]''' channel, already seen in 47 countries but running at a financial loss.\n\nOne month later, a parliamentary commission gave its conclusion, voted with a unanimous decision by its members in the National Assembly, to form a '''public-owned corporation''' ''(groupement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public)'' grouping all of the public broadcasters (France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, RFO, RFI, TV5 and AFP) with the goal of launching the channel at the end of 2004.\n\nIgnoring the work of the parliamentary commission, the government asked a member of the assembly, Bernard Brochand, to form a partnership between the applying candidates for the international channel, something which the parliamentary commission did not demand. Brochard attempted to group both '''Groupe TF1''' and '''Groupe Canal+''', with no success. He then proposed a 50/50 partnership between '''France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions''' and '''Groupe TF1''' (whilst at the same time rejecting '''RFI'''), both groups possessing the technical means and experience of broadcasting externally: TF1 with its LCI channel and France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions' editorial teams at [[France 2]] and [[France 3]].\n\n===Preparing for launch (2004\u20132006)===\n\n====Defying parliament====\nAfter a press conference in January 2004, President Chirac wished for a launch of the channel towards the end of the year. However, various disputes began to surface. The ministers of the assembly that voted were angry that the recommendations voted for in the parliamentary commission were thrown out in favour of one prepared outside the parliamentary framework. Unionised journalists working for France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions denounced the potential alliance with the private sector, calling it ''\"the marriage of the snake and the rabbit\"''; [[Radio France International]] was angry that it would not be associated with the project. A headline published in ''[[Le Monde]]'' described the partnership having a ''\"public channel, private owner\"'',<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2006/01/BENILDE/13103 |title=Parrain priv\u00e9, cha\u00eene publique |work=Le Monde diplomatique |location =Paris |date=January 2006 |language=French}}</ref> while other sections of the press criticised its modest budget of 80 million euro (compared with 600 million euro for [[BBC World News|BBC World]]). Finally the Minister for Foreign Affairs had worried that the budget would take away from existing funded channels such as [[TV5Monde|TV5]].\n\nFacing discontentment, the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] delayed all discussion of the project in 2004. Then Foreign Minister Michel Barnier announced on 21 July that the channel would not be funded before 2007, which was confirmed by a vote in parliament on the Finance Bill.\n\nHowever, the Prime Minister acceded to pressure from the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e]]; a press conference by Raffarin on 9 December confirmed the launch of the new news channel in 2005.\n\n''\"I have decided to accept the proposed joint venture proposed by France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions and TF1. As desired by the President, the new channel will draw on the talents of major French television companies, and will promote the expression of a French vision, more necessary than ever in the world today. The Government will present an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the start of the channel, to a total of 30 million euro.\"''<ref>Press conference, 9 December 2005.</ref>\nThe amendment was carried the same day in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].\n\n====Public-private angst====\nThe start of 2005 concerned obtaining the authorisation necessary from the [[European Union]] and the relevant competition commissions. Trade union members working for France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions continued to voice opposition to the project and circulated a petition in March 2005. The newly elected president of the public corporation, [[Patrick de Carolis]], who assumed his position in the summer (and who had been accused of being too close to the President), expressed doubts about an alliance with TF1:\n\n''\"To be effective, you need a single driver in a car\".''<ref>Delesalle, Nicolas (11 January 2006). \"La voix de la France, en l\u00e9ger diff\u00e9r\u00e9\u2026\", ''[[T\u00e9l\u00e9rama]]'', n\u00b02922.</ref>\n\nHe insisted that the channel be made available within France, which the members of parliament required, and which [[TF1]], wanting to protect its own news channel [[La Cha\u00eene Info|LCI]], could object to. Patrick Le Lay, president of TF1, gave his blessing for the channel to be broadcast domestically and wished the direction of the channel to alternate every six months between the two parties, and eventually a Supervisory Board devolved to France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions. These few amendments needed new authorisation from the French and European authorities, obtained this time round without difficulty.\n\n===Birth (2006\u20132008)===\nThe launch of the channel was made official after a statement to the cabinet of the [[Minister of Culture (France)#Names of the Ministry of Culture|Ministry of Culture and Communication]], headed by [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]] on 30 November 2005:\n\n''\" The project of the International French News Channel (abbreviated in French to '''CFII''')[...] will allow us to propose our own country's vision of world events and to reinforce its presence in the world.\"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/salle_de_presse/communiques_du_conseil_des_ministres/2005/novembre/communique_du_conseil_des_ministres_du_30_11_2005.33186.html&title=communiqu%C3%A9%20officiel%20du%20Conseil%20des%20ministres|title=Statement by the Ministry of Culture and Communication (Archive)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAlain de Pouzilhac, former CEO of Havas, was named President, along with two deputies, one each from group partners TF1 and France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions.\n\nPrime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin declared that CFII, against the wishes of TF1, would be broadcast within mainland France.<ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/071/article_39709.asp \"Financ\u00e9e par l'argent public, il est l\u00e9gitime qu'elle soit diffus\u00e9e en France\"].

Following the election of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as President in May 2007, a \"steering committee\" of twenty members was called in with view to reform in June 2007. President Sarkozy called on [[Bernard Kouchner]] and [[Christine Albanel]], respectively [[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (France)|Foreign Minister]] and [[Minister of Culture (France)|Culture Minister]] to reform the current system. The proposition of reform was met with concern from Belgium, Switzerland and Canada/[[Qu\u00e9bec]], as the public broadcasters involved in '''[[TV5Monde|TV5]]''' (of which the French government holds a 49% share whilst the three aforementioned countries hold 11% each) consider TV5 to be a promoter of the wider French-language world.<ref>\"Audiovisuel ext\u00e9rieur.

''Le Monde'' (Paris).</ref>\n\nIn January 2012 '''AEF''' announced a merger between '''France 24''' and '''Radio France International''', a procedure finalised on 13 February 2012. It is expected that staff from Radio France International (which includes Arabic sister station '''Monte Carlo Doualiya''') will move to premises currently home to France 24. Alain de Pouzilhac, president of AEF stated in ''Le Monde'':\n\n{{quote|\"We have just created a French audiovisual group of international dimensions, that aspires to be powerful and ambitious; [the merger] is irreversible and is definitive\"}}\n\n102 posts, of which 85 from RFI, were cut preceding the official merger. Editorial teams, technical and distribution, financial and human resources departments of both France 24 and RFI were involved. On 13 February 2012 the merger of France 24 and RFI was made official.\n\n===Long-term goals===\nFrance 24 aims to compete with leading English-language international news channels [[BBC World News]] and [[CNN International]]. Its intention is to put more emphasis on debate, dialogue and the role of cultural differences. It also competes with [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Al Jazeera English]], and [[NHK World]] news channels. The Arabic programming competes with [[Al Jazeera]]'s Arabic service, [[RT Arabic]], [[BBC Arabic Television|BBC Arabic]] and [[Sky News Arabia]]. The new Spanish channel for the Latin American market is expected to start in September 2017. It will compete with [[CNN en Espa\u00f1ol]], [[DW (Latinoam\u00e9rica)]], [[NTN24]], [[TeleSUR]], [[RT Spanish|RT en espa\u00f1ol]] and [[CCTV-E]]\n\nThe French government allocated around \u20ac100&nbsp;million for the project. The [[European Commission]] gave the green light to France 24 in June 2006, saying it did not breach [[European Union]] state aid rules.\n\n=== Overnight simulcast ===\nFrom 2 September 2016, France's new news channel, [[France Info (TV channel)|France Info]], started simulcasting France 24 from midnight to 6{{nbsp}}am daily, when the channel doesn't broadcast live except for newscasts every half hour.\n\nHowever, from 20 March 2017, on weekdays, France Info started simulcasting France 24 until 6:30 am, due to the main presenter Laurent Bignolas anchoring the early newscast on France 2 ''Le 6H Info'', which isn't simulcast on France Info.\n\n==Organisation==\nFrom its creation in 2006 to 2008, France 24 is managed by a management board and a supervisory board. In 2008, the French State bought the shares of the two shareholders for an amount of 2 million euros each. Since then, France 24 has been a chain of the national program company [[France M\u00e9dias Monde]] (formerly Exterior Audiovisual of France), 100% owned by the French State through the State Participation Agency (APE).\n\nFrance 24 has two main sources of [[funding]] : the audiovisual license fee, paid by each household equipped with a television, and the state subsidy.\n\n==Shows and presenters==\n===Programmes===\n* Beyond Business\n* The Business Interview \u2013 hosted by Raphael Kahane\n* Business Matters \u2013 hosted by St\u00e9phane Marchand, Pierre Brian\u00e7on\n* Culture \u2013 hosted by Genie Godula\n* Culture Critique \u2013 hosted by Augustin Trapenard on literature, Amobe Mevegue on music, Sean Rose on exhibitions, Lisa Nesselson on cinema and Stephen Clarke\n* The Debate \u2013 hosted by Fran\u00e7ois Picard\n* Environment \u2013 hosted by Eve Irvine\n* Europe District \u2013 Christophe Robeet\n* Fashion\n* Focus\n* France Bon App\u00e9tit\n* Health \u2013 hosted by Eve Irvine\n* In the Papers \u2013 hosted by James Creedon\n* In the Weeklies\n* The Interview\n* Lifestyle\n* Media Watch\n* The Observers \u2013 hosted by Derek Thomson\n* Planet Hope \u2013 hosted by Louise Hannah\n* Politics\n* Reporters \u2013 hosted by Mark Owen\n* Talking Europe\n* Talking Points\n* Tech 24 \u2013 hosted by Rebecca Bowring\n* This Week in Africa \u2013 hosted by Genie Godula\n* This Week in Asia \u2013 hosted by Claire Pryde\n* This Week in Europe \u2013 hosted by Rebecca Bowring\n* This Week in France \u2013 hosted by Nadia Charbit\n* This Week in the Americas \u2013 hosted by Annette Young\n* This Week in the Maghreb \u2013 hosted by Georja Calvin Smith\n* This Week in the Middle East \u2013 hosted by Lanah Kammourieh\n* Top Story\n* Vice Versa\n* Web News\n* The World This Week\n\n==Availability==\n[[File:France 24 News presenter.jpg|thumb|Inaugural News presenter, Fran\u00e7ois Picard]]\n[[File:France 24 News ident.jpg|thumb|The News title 2006\u20132011]]\n\nFrance 24 is available by satellite in most of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as by cable and antenna in the US cities of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Atlanta]], [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], and [[San Francisco]].

A parliamentary minister, [[Philippe S\u00e9guin]], wished to create a French-language equivalent.\n\nIn 1996, after nineteen governmental reports in ten years, Prime Minister [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] asked [[Radio France Internationale]] president [[Jean-Paul Cluzel]] (who was also [[General Inspection of Finances (France)|General Inspector of Finances]]) to create a French international news channel. Cluzel proposed in 1997 to group TV5, RFI, and CFI within a corporation entitled T\u00e9l\u00e9fi. The [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]-led government decided to follow that recommendation but, with the return of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to government and the nomination of [[Hubert V\u00e9drine]], the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, favoured the augmentation of existing outlets such as TV5, which started to produce its own programming, notably its news bulletins, which in turn created its own news team.\n\nAdditionally with the creation of [[EuroNews]] in 1993 (with French-language commentary), the media presence of France overseas became more complex, more fragmented, and costlier, without being able to rely on a true round-the-clock international news channel.\n\n===Relaunched project (2002\u20132003)===\nIn 2002, President Jacques Chirac relaunched the project to create a French international news channel; after a speech given at a reception in honour of the High Council of the Francophonie at the '\u00c9lys\u00e9e on 12 February 2002, he stated:\n\n''\"Is it understandable that year after year we are still lamenting our persistent failure with news and the French-language media on the international scene? Admittedly, we have with [[Agence France-Presse]] a remarkable information tool that we must continue to reinforce, notably in its international mission. Indeed, everyone here recognises the recent progress made by RFI, by TV5, by CFI, thanks to the efforts of their teams and to the determination of the public bodies. But everybody notices that we are still far from having a large international news channel in French, capable of competing with the BBC or CNN.\"''<ref>[http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/fevrier/allocution_prononcee_par_m_jacques_chirac_president_de_la_republique_lors_de_la_reception_en_l_honneur_du_haut_conseil_de_la_francophonie-palais_de_l_elysee.2162.html Speech given by Jacques Chirac to the High Commission of the Francophonie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210853/http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/fevrier/allocution_prononcee_par_m_jacques_chirac_president_de_la_republique_lors_de_la_reception_en_l_honneur_du_haut_conseil_de_la_francophonie-palais_de_l_elysee.2162.html |date=30 September 2007 }} (French), 12 February 2002.</ref>\n\n''The recent crises have shown the handicap that a country suffers, a cultural area, which doesn't possess a sufficient weight in the battle of the images and the airwaves.

The international news channel must contribute to a long-lasting strategy of influence of France in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071022113155/http://www.ddm.gouv.fr/article.php3?id_article=615 Consultation guide, Direction and Developemt of Media (Archive)] (French)</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the application deadline on 22 April 2003, three candidates replied:\n* '''France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions''' & '''RFI''': to operate a channel entirely run by the public service sector;\n* '''Groupe TF1''' : proposed an international version of its '''LCI''' channel;\n* '''Groupe Canal+''' : proposed a news \"factory\" to reinforce its '''[[i-T\u00e9l\u00e9|i>T\u00e9l\u00e9]]''' channel, already seen in 47 countries but running at a financial loss.\n\nOne month later, a parliamentary commission gave its conclusion, voted with a unanimous decision by its members in the National Assembly, to form a '''public-owned corporation''' ''(groupement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public)'' grouping all of the public broadcasters (France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, RFO, RFI, TV5 and AFP) with the goal of launching the channel at the end of 2004.\n\nIgnoring the work of the parliamentary commission, the government asked a member of the assembly, Bernard Brochand, to form a partnership between the applying candidates for the international channel, something which the parliamentary commission did not demand. Brochard attempted to group both '''Groupe TF1''' and '''Groupe Canal+''', with no success. He then proposed a 50/50 partnership between '''France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions''' and '''Groupe TF1''' (whilst at the same time rejecting '''RFI'''), both groups possessing the technical means and experience of broadcasting externally: TF1 with its LCI channel and France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions' editorial teams at [[France 2]] and [[France 3]].\n\n===Preparing for launch (2004\u20132006)===\n\n====Defying parliament====\nAfter a press conference in January 2004, President Chirac wished for a launch of the channel towards the end of the year. However, various disputes began to surface. The ministers of the assembly that voted were angry that the recommendations voted for in the parliamentary commission were thrown out in favour of one prepared outside the parliamentary framework. Unionised journalists working for France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions denounced the potential alliance with the private sector, calling it ''\"the marriage of the snake and the rabbit\"''; [[Radio France International]] was angry that it would not be associated with the project. A headline published in ''[[Le Monde]]'' described the partnership having a ''\"public channel, private owner\"'',<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2006/01/BENILDE/13103 |title=Parrain priv\u00e9, cha\u00eene publique |work=Le Monde diplomatique |location =Paris |date=January 2006 |language=French}}</ref> while other sections of the press criticised its modest budget of 80 million euro (compared with 600 million euro for [[BBC World News|BBC World]]). Finally the Minister for Foreign Affairs had worried that the budget would take away from existing funded channels such as [[TV5Monde|TV5]].\n\nFacing discontentment, the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] delayed all discussion of the project in 2004. Then Foreign Minister Michel Barnier announced on 21 July that the channel would not be funded before 2007, which was confirmed by a vote in parliament on the Finance Bill.\n\nHowever, the Prime Minister acceded to pressure from the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e]]; a press conference by Raffarin on 9 December confirmed the launch of the new news channel in 2005.\n\n''\"I have decided to accept the proposed joint venture proposed by France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions and TF1. As desired by the President, the new channel will draw on the talents of major French television companies, and will promote the expression of a French vision, more necessary than ever in the world today. The Government will present an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the start of the channel, to a total of 30 million euro.\"''<ref>Press conference, 9 December 2005.</ref>\nThe amendment was carried the same day in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].\n\n====Public-private angst====\nThe start of 2005 concerned obtaining the authorisation necessary from the [[European Union]] and the relevant competition commissions. Trade union members working for France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions continued to voice opposition to the project and circulated a petition in March 2005. The newly elected president of the public corporation, [[Patrick de Carolis]], who assumed his position in the summer (and who had been accused of being too close to the President), expressed doubts about an alliance with TF1:\n\n''\"To be effective, you need a single driver in a car\".''<ref>Delesalle, Nicolas (11 January 2006). \"La voix de la France, en l\u00e9ger diff\u00e9r\u00e9\u2026\", ''[[T\u00e9l\u00e9rama]]'', n\u00b02922.</ref>\n\nHe insisted that the channel be made available within France, which the members of parliament required, and which [[TF1]], wanting to protect its own news channel [[La Cha\u00eene Info|LCI]], could object to. Patrick Le Lay, president of TF1, gave his blessing for the channel to be broadcast domestically and wished the direction of the channel to alternate every six months between the two parties, and eventually a Supervisory Board devolved to France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions. These few amendments needed new authorisation from the French and European authorities, obtained this time round without difficulty.\n\n===Birth (2006\u20132008)===\nThe launch of the channel was made official after a statement to the cabinet of the [[Minister of Culture (France)#Names of the Ministry of Culture|Ministry of Culture and Communication]], headed by [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]] on 30 November 2005:\n\n''\" The project of the International French News Channel (abbreviated in French to '''CFII''')[...] will allow us to propose our own country's vision of world events and to reinforce its presence in the world.\"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/salle_de_presse/communiques_du_conseil_des_ministres/2005/novembre/communique_du_conseil_des_ministres_du_30_11_2005.33186.html&title=communiqu%C3%A9%20officiel%20du%20Conseil%20des%20ministres|title=Statement by the Ministry of Culture and Communication (Archive)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAlain de Pouzilhac, former CEO of Havas, was named President, along with two deputies, one each from group partners TF1 and France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions.\n\nPrime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin declared that CFII, against the wishes of TF1, would be broadcast within mainland France.<ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/071/article_39709.asp \"Financ\u00e9e par l'argent public, il est l\u00e9gitime qu'elle soit diffus\u00e9e en France\"].

The [[European Commission]] gave the green light to France 24 in June 2006, saying it did not breach [[European Union]] state aid rules.\n\n=== Overnight simulcast ===\nFrom 2 September 2016, France's new news channel, [[France Info (TV channel)|France Info]], started simulcasting France 24 from midnight to 6{{nbsp}}am daily, when the channel doesn't broadcast live except for newscasts every half hour.\n\nHowever, from 20 March 2017, on weekdays, France Info started simulcasting France 24 until 6:30 am, due to the main presenter Laurent Bignolas anchoring the early newscast on France 2 ''Le 6H Info'', which isn't simulcast on France Info.\n\n==Organisation==\nFrom its creation in 2006 to 2008, France 24 is managed by a management board and a supervisory board. In 2008, the French State bought the shares of the two shareholders for an amount of 2 million euros each. Since then, France 24 has been a chain of the national program company [[France M\u00e9dias Monde]] (formerly Exterior Audiovisual of France), 100% owned by the French State through the State Participation Agency (APE).\n\nFrance 24 has two main sources of [[funding]] : the audiovisual license fee, paid by each household equipped with a television, and the state subsidy.\n\n==Shows and presenters==\n===Programmes===\n* Beyond Business\n* The Business Interview \u2013 hosted by Raphael Kahane\n* Business Matters \u2013 hosted by St\u00e9phane Marchand, Pierre Brian\u00e7on\n* Culture \u2013 hosted by Genie Godula\n* Culture Critique \u2013 hosted by Augustin Trapenard on literature, Amobe Mevegue on music, Sean Rose on exhibitions, Lisa Nesselson on cinema and Stephen Clarke\n* The Debate \u2013 hosted by Fran\u00e7ois Picard\n* Environment \u2013 hosted by Eve Irvine\n* Europe District \u2013 Christophe Robeet\n* Fashion\n* Focus\n* France Bon App\u00e9tit\n* Health \u2013 hosted by Eve Irvine\n* In the Papers \u2013 hosted by James Creedon\n* In the Weeklies\n* The Interview\n* Lifestyle\n* Media Watch\n* The Observers \u2013 hosted by Derek Thomson\n* Planet Hope \u2013 hosted by Louise Hannah\n* Politics\n* Reporters \u2013 hosted by Mark Owen\n* Talking Europe\n* Talking Points\n* Tech 24 \u2013 hosted by Rebecca Bowring\n* This Week in Africa \u2013 hosted by Genie Godula\n* This Week in Asia \u2013 hosted by Claire Pryde\n* This Week in Europe \u2013 hosted by Rebecca Bowring\n* This Week in France \u2013 hosted by Nadia Charbit\n* This Week in the Americas \u2013 hosted by Annette Young\n* This Week in the Maghreb \u2013 hosted by Georja Calvin Smith\n* This Week in the Middle East \u2013 hosted by Lanah Kammourieh\n* Top Story\n* Vice Versa\n* Web News\n* The World This Week\n\n==Availability==\n[[File:France 24 News presenter.jpg|thumb|Inaugural News presenter, Fran\u00e7ois Picard]]\n[[File:France 24 News ident.jpg|thumb|The News title 2006\u20132011]]\n\nFrance 24 is available by satellite in most of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as by cable and antenna in the US cities of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Atlanta]], [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], and [[San Francisco]].

It featured the [[Justice League of America]], several members of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and more than two dozen allied heroes, villains and scientists of the [[DC Universe]] banding together in the face of global calamity when an extraterrestrial entity called the [[Sun-Eater]] envelopes and extinguishes the Sun, causing Earth to freeze and wither into ecological collapse. \n\nUnlike other crossover events published by DC, the conflict of ''The Final Night'' did not revolve around a conventional villain. It was primarily a story of survival that focused on the main characters performing disaster response, while attempting to prevent impending mass extinction of all life on Earth. At the end of each issue was an in-story website feature written by [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], giving information updates and emergency support to residents of the DC Universe as the crisis progressed.\n\nThe storyline is notable in DC canon for the death and disputed redemption of [[Green Lantern]] [[Hal Jordan]], whose character at the time had been transformed into the villainous [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. Jordan's character was later restored to life and to his role as Earth's Green Lantern in the 2004 miniseries ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a brief prologue originally published as a promotional preview to the miniseries, before traveling to Earth's solar system, the Sun-Eater consumes the sun neighboring [[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]]'s newly-settled planet, New [[Tamaran]] and eventually triggers a supernova, seemingly killing all of New Tamaran's inhabitants. \n\nAn unspecified amount of time later, Dusk arrives on Earth to warn the population that a giant [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] being, known as the Sun-Eater, is heading our way. Dusk is a member of an unknown alien race and does not speak or understand a word of English, so [[Saturn Girl]] uses her telepathic powers to translate and teach her the language. Dusk has attempted to warn hundreds of worlds, prior to Earth, about the Sun-Eater. Each planet had tried, in its own way, to stop the Sun-Eater, but every attempt was as unsuccessful as the last one. This has convinced Dusk that the Sun-Eater is indestructible.\n\nDespite her warnings, the [[Justice League]] still try to stop the Sun-Eater. For their first attempt, [[Mister Miracle]] tries using his [[boom tube]] to send it into another dimension. This proves unsuccessful, since they discover that the Sun-Eater is not entirely in our dimension. As a last resort, Superman and several other \"heat-producing\" heroes combine their energies to create a second sun and try to lure the Sun-Eater away from the [[Sun]]. The [[Sun-Eater]] quickly consumes that sun before moving on to the Sun.\n\nAs the Sun is extinguished, Earth falls into chaos and the planet starts to freeze. There are only five days to restore the Sun, after which Earth will become uninhabitable. Powerless to do anything to stop the freeze, the League tries to help control the chaos and to keep hope alive. Many people freeze to death. [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] is badly injured. [[Etrigan the Demon]] offers the entire world heat at the cost of their souls; the world rejects him, primarily because his plan was to shift Earth into [[Hell (DC Comics)#Fictional history|Hell]]. [[Lex Luthor]] teams up with the League to try to reignite the [[Sun]].\n\nThe events of this series cross over into other books as well. Superman encounters [[Ferro Lad]], who would later make an abortive attempt to destroy the Sun-Eater. The [[Ray (comics)|Ray]] devotes his attentions to a small Mexican town. Tommy Monaghan ([[Hitman (DC Comics)|Hitman]]) holes up in his favorite bar, Noonan's.\n\nSeeing Earth as just another failure (and after being attacked by an angry mob who had accused her of bringing the Sun-Eater to Earth in the first place), Dusk decides that it is time for her to move on. As she prepares for takeoff, she encounters a [[Phantom Stranger|stranger]], and is shocked that he understands her language. The stranger takes Dusk on a quick trip around the world and shows her the League's efforts to keep hope alive. Dusk doubts that there is any hope left for the world. Eventually, the stranger disappears and Dusk is left alone in an alleyway. She is found by a small group of people and, thinking they are going to attack her again, prepares to defend herself. To her surprise, the group offer to take her to a shelter where she will be safe. This act of kindness gives her hope for the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, scientists have realized that the Sun is losing energy, but not mass, to the Sun-Eater. This will cause the Sun to go [[Supernova|nova]] and the explosion will catapult the Sun-Eater into another solar system, where it will consume another sun. The assembled heroes construct a technological means of destroying the Sun-Eater. Lex Luthor angrily bows out of piloting the ship needed, revealing that he was in it simply to save his own skin, prompting Superman to volunteer in the hope that his powers will be restored by the solar surge as the Sun is restored. Ferro Lad steals the ship, only to be shunted back to Earth by [[Hal Jordan]], the former [[Green Lantern]] then known as [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. Parallax sacrifices his life to absorb the Sun-Eater and reignite the Sun, simultaneously using his powers to safely restore it to its original form without causing any side-effects, such as the mass flooding that would have resulted if the Sun had been restored purely by Luthor's plan.\n\nThe League watches in astonishment and Dusk says she no longer believes that anything is impossible.\n\n==Key events and aftermath==\n* ''The Final Night'' culminates in the death of Hal Jordan and is the first in a series of storylines that eventually redeem him for his crimes committed as Parallax in ''[[Emerald Twilight]]'' and ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!]]''. Hal Jordan returns in the 1999 crossover storyline ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgement]]'', in which his soul becomes a host for the Spectre-Force. He later returns to life and is reinstated as Earth's Green Lantern in 2004's ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'' miniseries. His death in defeating the Sun-Eater remains a key point in the character's history, as it has been referenced in numerous storylines since, including 2009's ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover storyline.\n\n* [[Ferro Lad]] is re-introduced in post-''Zero Hour'' continuity as Ferro. The young hero's death was a [[Death of Ferro Lad|major event]] in the Legion of Super-Heroes' Silver Age adventures, but was no longer in continuity at this time. This new incarnation of the character later joins the faction of Legionnaires stranded in the present and eventually returns to the 30th Century with them.\n\n* Starfire's recently settled home world of New Tamaran is destroyed, marking the second Tamaranean world to die. Though Starfire survives the cataclysm, casualties include her sister and former [[Teen Titans]] villain, [[Blackfire (DC Comics)|Blackfire]], who is presumed dead until 2005's ''Rann-Thanagar War''.  The death of her world and people prompts Starfire to return to Earth some time later, eventually rejoining the Titans.\n\n* Superman remains powerless after the Sun is re-ignited. This plotline continues throughout the ''[[Superman]]'' comics as his body converts into a being of pure energy and he develops new, energy-based powers requiring a specialized containment suit to maintain control of them and stay alive, while also causing his skin to assume a blue pigment when his powers are fully active. Superman adapts the suit into a new blue-and-white costume, which he sports for a period of time before he eventually regains his original powers and defaults back to his traditional costume.\n\n* In a later flashback to ''The Final Night'' occurring in the final page of ''Green Arrow'' (vol. 2) #137 (Oct. 1998), it is revealed that, prior to sacrificing his life, Hal Jordan had used his power as Parallax to resurrect his longtime friend Oliver Queen, the [[Green Arrow]], who died in his own series in 1995. Queen made his official return to the DC Universe in [[Quiver (comics)|''Green Arrow'' (vol. 3) #1 in 2001]].\n\n==Reading order==\n''The Final Night'' was primarily self-contained to a weekly four-issue limited series, with a number of tie-in issues reflecting the impacts of the storyline across the DC Universe in different characters' ongoing series. A special eight-page black-and-white preview solicitation was released prior to the first issue starring Starfire, which introduced Dusk and detailed the Sun-Eater's destruction of New Tamaran prior to traveling to Earth's solar system.

It featured the [[Justice League of America]], several members of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and more than two dozen allied heroes, villains and scientists of the [[DC Universe]] banding together in the face of global calamity when an extraterrestrial entity called the [[Sun-Eater]] envelopes and extinguishes the Sun, causing Earth to freeze and wither into ecological collapse. \n\nUnlike other crossover events published by DC, the conflict of ''The Final Night'' did not revolve around a conventional villain. It was primarily a story of survival that focused on the main characters performing disaster response, while attempting to prevent impending mass extinction of all life on Earth. At the end of each issue was an in-story website feature written by [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], giving information updates and emergency support to residents of the DC Universe as the crisis progressed.\n\nThe storyline is notable in DC canon for the death and disputed redemption of [[Green Lantern]] [[Hal Jordan]], whose character at the time had been transformed into the villainous [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. Jordan's character was later restored to life and to his role as Earth's Green Lantern in the 2004 miniseries ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a brief prologue originally published as a promotional preview to the miniseries, before traveling to Earth's solar system, the Sun-Eater consumes the sun neighboring [[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]]'s newly-settled planet, New [[Tamaran]] and eventually triggers a supernova, seemingly killing all of New Tamaran's inhabitants. \n\nAn unspecified amount of time later, Dusk arrives on Earth to warn the population that a giant [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] being, known as the Sun-Eater, is heading our way. Dusk is a member of an unknown alien race and does not speak or understand a word of English, so [[Saturn Girl]] uses her telepathic powers to translate and teach her the language. Dusk has attempted to warn hundreds of worlds, prior to Earth, about the Sun-Eater. Each planet had tried, in its own way, to stop the Sun-Eater, but every attempt was as unsuccessful as the last one. This has convinced Dusk that the Sun-Eater is indestructible.\n\nDespite her warnings, the [[Justice League]] still try to stop the Sun-Eater. For their first attempt, [[Mister Miracle]] tries using his [[boom tube]] to send it into another dimension. This proves unsuccessful, since they discover that the Sun-Eater is not entirely in our dimension. As a last resort, Superman and several other \"heat-producing\" heroes combine their energies to create a second sun and try to lure the Sun-Eater away from the [[Sun]]. The [[Sun-Eater]] quickly consumes that sun before moving on to the Sun.\n\nAs the Sun is extinguished, Earth falls into chaos and the planet starts to freeze. There are only five days to restore the Sun, after which Earth will become uninhabitable. Powerless to do anything to stop the freeze, the League tries to help control the chaos and to keep hope alive. Many people freeze to death. [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] is badly injured. [[Etrigan the Demon]] offers the entire world heat at the cost of their souls; the world rejects him, primarily because his plan was to shift Earth into [[Hell (DC Comics)#Fictional history|Hell]]. [[Lex Luthor]] teams up with the League to try to reignite the [[Sun]].\n\nThe events of this series cross over into other books as well. Superman encounters [[Ferro Lad]], who would later make an abortive attempt to destroy the Sun-Eater. The [[Ray (comics)|Ray]] devotes his attentions to a small Mexican town. Tommy Monaghan ([[Hitman (DC Comics)|Hitman]]) holes up in his favorite bar, Noonan's.\n\nSeeing Earth as just another failure (and after being attacked by an angry mob who had accused her of bringing the Sun-Eater to Earth in the first place), Dusk decides that it is time for her to move on. As she prepares for takeoff, she encounters a [[Phantom Stranger|stranger]], and is shocked that he understands her language. The stranger takes Dusk on a quick trip around the world and shows her the League's efforts to keep hope alive. Dusk doubts that there is any hope left for the world. Eventually, the stranger disappears and Dusk is left alone in an alleyway. She is found by a small group of people and, thinking they are going to attack her again, prepares to defend herself. To her surprise, the group offer to take her to a shelter where she will be safe. This act of kindness gives her hope for the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, scientists have realized that the Sun is losing energy, but not mass, to the Sun-Eater. This will cause the Sun to go [[Supernova|nova]] and the explosion will catapult the Sun-Eater into another solar system, where it will consume another sun. The assembled heroes construct a technological means of destroying the Sun-Eater. Lex Luthor angrily bows out of piloting the ship needed, revealing that he was in it simply to save his own skin, prompting Superman to volunteer in the hope that his powers will be restored by the solar surge as the Sun is restored. Ferro Lad steals the ship, only to be shunted back to Earth by [[Hal Jordan]], the former [[Green Lantern]] then known as [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. Parallax sacrifices his life to absorb the Sun-Eater and reignite the Sun, simultaneously using his powers to safely restore it to its original form without causing any side-effects, such as the mass flooding that would have resulted if the Sun had been restored purely by Luthor's plan.\n\nThe League watches in astonishment and Dusk says she no longer believes that anything is impossible.\n\n==Key events and aftermath==\n* ''The Final Night'' culminates in the death of Hal Jordan and is the first in a series of storylines that eventually redeem him for his crimes committed as Parallax in ''[[Emerald Twilight]]'' and ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!]]''. Hal Jordan returns in the 1999 crossover storyline ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgement]]'', in which his soul becomes a host for the Spectre-Force. He later returns to life and is reinstated as Earth's Green Lantern in 2004's ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'' miniseries. His death in defeating the Sun-Eater remains a key point in the character's history, as it has been referenced in numerous storylines since, including 2009's ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover storyline.\n\n* [[Ferro Lad]] is re-introduced in post-''Zero Hour'' continuity as Ferro. The young hero's death was a [[Death of Ferro Lad|major event]] in the Legion of Super-Heroes' Silver Age adventures, but was no longer in continuity at this time. This new incarnation of the character later joins the faction of Legionnaires stranded in the present and eventually returns to the 30th Century with them.\n\n* Starfire's recently settled home world of New Tamaran is destroyed, marking the second Tamaranean world to die. Though Starfire survives the cataclysm, casualties include her sister and former [[Teen Titans]] villain, [[Blackfire (DC Comics)|Blackfire]], who is presumed dead until 2005's ''Rann-Thanagar War''.  The death of her world and people prompts Starfire to return to Earth some time later, eventually rejoining the Titans.\n\n* Superman remains powerless after the Sun is re-ignited. This plotline continues throughout the ''[[Superman]]'' comics as his body converts into a being of pure energy and he develops new, energy-based powers requiring a specialized containment suit to maintain control of them and stay alive, while also causing his skin to assume a blue pigment when his powers are fully active. Superman adapts the suit into a new blue-and-white costume, which he sports for a period of time before he eventually regains his original powers and defaults back to his traditional costume.\n\n* In a later flashback to ''The Final Night'' occurring in the final page of ''Green Arrow'' (vol. 2) #137 (Oct. 1998), it is revealed that, prior to sacrificing his life, Hal Jordan had used his power as Parallax to resurrect his longtime friend Oliver Queen, the [[Green Arrow]], who died in his own series in 1995. Queen made his official return to the DC Universe in [[Quiver (comics)|''Green Arrow'' (vol. 3) #1 in 2001]].\n\n==Reading order==\n''The Final Night'' was primarily self-contained to a weekly four-issue limited series, with a number of tie-in issues reflecting the impacts of the storyline across the DC Universe in different characters' ongoing series. A special eight-page black-and-white preview solicitation was released prior to the first issue starring Starfire, which introduced Dusk and detailed the Sun-Eater's destruction of New Tamaran prior to traveling to Earth's solar system. A special tie-in one-shot starring Hal Jordan, ''Parallax: Emerald Night'' #1, was released between ''The Final Night'' #3 and #4, which told the events leading to Jordan's appearance in ''The Final Night'' #4. Both the Parallax one-shot and the fully colored preview story were later reprinted in the ''Final Night'' collected edition, along with the central miniseries.<br>\n<br>\n'''Week Zero'''<br>\n''The Final Night Preview''<br>\n<br>\n'''Week One'''<br>\n''The Final Night'' #1<br>\n''The Power of Shazam!'' #20<br>\n''Sovereign Seven'' #16<br>\n''Superman'' (vol. 2) #117<br>\n<br>\n'''Week Two'''<br>\n''The Final Night'' #2<br>\n''The Adventures of Superman'' #540<br>\n''Batman'' #536<br>\n''Green Arrow'' (vol. 2) #114<br>\n''Supergirl'' (vol. 2) #3<br>\n<br>\n'''Week Three'''<br>\n''The Final Night'' #3<br>\n''Action Comics'' #727<br>\n''Aquaman'' (vol. 4) #26<br>\n''Detective Comics'' #703<br>\n''Superboy'' (vol. 3) #33<br>\n<br>\n'''Week Four'''<br>\n''Parallax: Emerald Night'' #1<br>\n''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #119<br>\n''Hitman'' #8<br>\n''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #86<br>\n''Robin'' (vol. 4) #35<br>\n''The Spectre'' (vol. 3) #47<br>\n''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #62<br>\n''Takion'' #6<br>\n<br>\n'''Week Five'''<br>\n''The Final Night'' #4<br>\n''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #81<br>\n<br>\n''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #81, while not an official tie-in, featured the funeral of Hal Jordan and served as an epilogue to the story.

Ordway discovered Marvel comics in \"June of 1967,\" and wrote in 1975 (aged 17) that he had \"been drawing superheroes [ever] since.\" His first published work, a story entitled \"The Messenger\", appeared in ''Tim Corrigan's Superhero Comics'' No.&nbsp;4 (April, 1975), and his own self-published fanzine ''Okay Comix'' followed in May\u2013June, 1975.<ref name=OKAY>Ordway, Jerry \"What?

Popular writer Marv Wolfman and artist Jerry Ordway handled the creative chores.\"</ref>\n\nWhen Wolfman departed the title with issue #435, Byrne briefly took over script writing duties before Ordway assumed the mantle of writer-artist and took over the series solely with issue #445 (Oct. 1988), making his writing debut two issues earlier with #443 (Aug. 1988). Ordway had also served as co-plotter on a few issues during both Wolfman and Bryne's writing tenures (issues #426, 435-437, 439-442, and 444). Switching from ''The Adventures of Superman'', Ordway became the writer-artist on the companion title ''[[Superman vol. 2]]'' between #34 (Aug. 1989) and #55 (May 1991), before later returning to ''Adventures of Superman'' as writer and sometimes as cover artist from issues #480 (July 1991) to #500 (June 1993). Ordway was the writer and primary artist for the story in which Clark Kent proposes to [[Lois Lane]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Ordway, Jerry| penciller= [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]]; [[Brett Breeding|Breeding, Brett]]; [[Kerry Gammill|Gammill, Kerry]]; [[Curt Swan|Swan, Curt]]; Ordway, Jerry; [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | inker= Breeding, Brett; [[Dennis Janke|Janke, Dennis]]; Byrne, John; Ordway, Jerry | story= Krisis of the Krimson Kryptonite, Part 4: The Human Factor| title= Superman| volume= 2| issue= 50 | date= December 1990 }}</ref><ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 247: \"When [Clark Kent] proposed to his longtime love Lois Lane, he did so in a modest fashion...Lois accepted and comic book history was made, served up by writer/artist Jerry Ordway.\"</ref>  While writing for the Superman family of titles, Ordway cowrote such storylines as \"Panic in the Sky\"<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 253: \"In this seven-part adventure...writers Dan Jurgens, Jerry Ordway, Roger Stern, and Louise Simonson, with artists Brett Breeding, Tom Grummett, Jon Bogdanove, and Bob McLeod assembled many of DC's favorite characters to defend the world.\"</ref> and \"[[The Death of Superman]]\" storyline in 1992.

The story saw Ordway depict the revamped origins of the former-[[Fawcett Comics]] superhero. It proved to be a success, and was followed by an ongoing monthly series, also titled ''The Power of Shazam!'' (which ran between 1995 and 1999). Ordway wrote and provided painted covers for the entire run of the regular series, as well as illustrating fill-in issues between series-regular artists [[Peter Krause (artist)|Peter Krause]] and [[Mike Manley (artist)|Mike Manley]].<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 269: \"Writer Jerry Ordway chronicled the further adventures of Billy Batson, the World's Mightiest Mortal, in the new ongoing effort ''The Power of Shazam!'', alongside artists Mike Manley and Peter Krause.\"</ref> Towards the end of the series run, he again took on the dual role of writer & artist.\n\n===Non-DC work===\nDuring the mid-1980s, Ordway provided covers and occasional artwork to titles from a number of different comics companies. Companies included [[Wendy and Richard Pini]]'s [[WaRP Graphics]], [[AC Comics]], [[Charlton Comics]], [[Paragon Publications]] and fan-turned-pro [[Martin Greim|Marty Greim]]. For [[Eclipse Comics]], Ordway provided pencils for a short \"Epilogue\" story in [[Mark Evanier]]'s ''[[DNAgents]]'' No.&nbsp;18 (Jan. 1985).<ref name=\"GCD\" /> He produced ''Munden's Bar'' for [[First Comics]], and provided pencils and inks on an issue of ''[[T.H.U.N.D.E.R.

He produced occasional work for Marvel between 1984 and 1988, then returned a decade later to write and illustrate a three-issue arc of ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' vol. 3 #16\u201318 (1999), guest artist on ''Captain America'' (vol. 3) #32 (Aug. 2000) with writer [[Dan Jurgens]], as well as penciling the four-issue crossover mini-series ''Maximum Security'' (#1\u20133 and prologue ''Dangerous Planet''), and writer/penciller on a ''[[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]]'' mini-series in 2000&ndash;2001.<ref name=\"GCD\" /> He was artist for the one-shot ''Captain America and the Invaders: Bahamas Triangle'' with writer Roy Thomas, released in July 2019.\n\n===Other DC work===\nAs well as inking most of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Ordway inked the second of DC's continuity-redefining event titles in 1994 by inking writer-artist [[Dan Jurgens]]' pencils on ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]''.<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 266: \"In DC's newest summer blockbuster ''Zero Hour'', writer/artist Dan Jurgens and finisher Jerry Ordway crafted a five-issue story that began with issue #4, and counted backward to zero.\"</ref> In 2001, he drew the one-shot ''[[Just Imagine...]] Stan Lee with Jerry Ordway Creating the JLA'' as part of Marvel-stalwart [[Stan Lee]]'s foray into the DC Universe, in which the two of them re-imagined DC's [[Justice League of America]]. He inked the last year (May 2002&ndash;May 2003) of the Batman-related title ''[[Azrael (comics)|Azrael: Agent of the Bat]]'' (#88&ndash;100), and provided the artwork for a six-issue story arc in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 2, issues #189&ndash;194), with writer [[Walt Simonson]] in 2003. In 2004, Ordway was inker on ''[[JLA (comics)|JLA]]'' issues #94&ndash;99, the \u201cTenth Circle\u201d story arc which reunited the former ''Uncanny X-Men'' creative team of writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].

which Ordway provided the artwork for the flashback scenes set on [[Earth-Two]], including a recreation of the cover to [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]], which he cites as another favorite piece of his.<ref name=Rough/> In the wake of ''Infinite Crisis'', he inked [[Dan Jurgens]]' pencils once again in the \"History of the Multiverse\" back-up stories in the weekly comic book

He subsequently worked his way \"from the ground floor up at the art studio\" between 1978 and 1981.<ref name=\"Bails\"/><ref name=Rough/>\n\n==Comics career==\nBefore beginning his professional career as an inker, Jerry Ordway entered the comics industry as an artist and publisher for small-press [[comics fanzine]]s. Ordway discovered Marvel comics in \"June of 1967,\" and wrote in 1975 (aged 17) that he had \"been drawing superheroes [ever] since.\" His first published work, a story entitled \"The Messenger\", appeared in ''Tim Corrigan's Superhero Comics'' No.&nbsp;4 (April, 1975), and his own self-published fanzine ''Okay Comix'' followed in May\u2013June, 1975.<ref name=OKAY>Ordway, Jerry \"What?

Ordway's own hero \"Proton\" headlined the 'zine, which featured a pin-up of a character \"called Acrobat\" who was \"the first superhero [Ordway] created. His birth was Dec. 1969.\"<ref name=\"Okay2\">''Okay Comix'' No.&nbsp;1 (May\u2013June, 1975), p. 24</ref>\n\nSpending the late 1970s working as a painter in a commercial art studio in Milwaukee, between 1978 and 1979, he provided illustrations for a number of fanzines and pro-zines, including ''Omniverse'' and ''[[The Comics Journal]]''. His first professional work was for [[Western Publishing]]'s [[Golden Books]] on young-reader Marvel books, and the ''Superheroes Golden Beginning Stampbook '79''.<ref name=\"Bails\"/><ref name=Rough/>\n\n===DC Comics===\nHaving produced comics-related artwork for fanzines and licensed publishers, Ordway attended \"a talent search at the 1980 Chicago Comicon,\" held by DC Comics. After showing them his \"DC related artwork from the Golden Books,\" he \"walked away with a promise of work.\"<ref name=Rough/> This work began in the summer of 1980 for \"DC's anthology comics,\" (including ''[[Weird War Tales]]'' and ''[[Mystery in Space]]''<ref name=\"Bails\"/>) in which he \"inked [[Carmine Infantino]], [[Trevor Von Eeden]], as well as [[Joe Staton]], and [[Dave Cockrum]].\" After continuing to work at the art studio for a further six months, inking comics for DC by night, Ordway began \"freelancing full time in February 1981.\" During the mid-1980s, he \"shared a studio with other artists, including [[Mike Machlan|Machlan]], [[Pat Broderick]], and [[Al Vey]].\"<ref name=Rough/>\n\nAt DC, he would illustrate ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'', a series which he helped launch in an [[DC Comics insert previews|insert preview]] in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' No.&nbsp;193 (Aug. 1981).<ref name=\"GCD\">{{gcdb|type=credit|search= Jerry+Ordway|title= Jerry Ordway}}</ref> With writer [[Roy Thomas]], he co-created ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' in ''All-Star Squadron'' No.&nbsp;25 (Sept. 1983)<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 203 |quote = The children of the original Justice Society of America made their smash debut in this issue by writer Roy Thomas and penciler Jerry Ordway...''All-Star Squadron'' #25 marked the first appearances of future cult-favorite heroes Jade, Obsidian, Fury,<!--[Hippolyta \"Lyta\" Trevor made her first appearance in ''Wonder Woman'' #300 (Feb. 1983), ''All-Star Squadron'' #25 was her first appearance using the name \"Fury\"]--> Brainwave Jr., the Silver Scarab, Northwind, and Nuklon.}}</ref> and the new team was launched in its own series in March 1984.<ref>Manning \"1980s\" in Dolan, p. 207: \"Written by DC's Golden Age guru Roy Thomas and drawn by Jerry Ordway, ''Infinity, Inc.'' was released in DC's new deluxe format on bright Baxter paper.\"</ref> Ordway inked ''[[DC Comics Presents]] Annual'' No.&nbsp;4 (1985) over artist [[Eduardo Barreto]]'s pencils, was one of several artists on ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]] Annual'' No.&nbsp;9 (July 1985), inked [[George P\u00e9rez]]'s pencils on the epic crossover miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in 1985 and Superman artist [[Wayne Boring]]'s pencils for a retelling of the definitive [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Golden Age Superman]] origin story written by [[Roy Thomas]] in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' No.&nbsp;1 (April 1986), which he considers a particular favorite.<ref name=Rough/> Ordway was the penciller and inker for the DC Comics adaptation of the 1989 [[Batman (1989 film)|''Batman'' film]] which was published as a \"movie special\".<ref name=\"GCD\" />\n\nOrdway has noted that \"Inking is a weird job, because as much as you put into it, the page still belongs to the penciler.\"<ref name=Rough/>\n\n===Superman===\n{{main|Superman|The Man of Steel (comics)}}\nIn 1986, along with writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and writer [[Marv Wolfman]], Ordway revamped [[Superman]], in the wake of the Ordway-inked continuity-redefining maxiseries ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Launching, with a revised origin and new continuity, in Byrne's miniseries, ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'', Superman soon returned to featuring in a number of titles. After the titular title ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' was cancelled and replaced with ''The Man of Steel'', it was relaunched as ''The Adventures of Superman'', continuing the numbering of the original ''Superman'' series, with Wolfman as writer and Ordway as artist.<ref>Manning \"1980s\" in Dolan, p. 226: \"The original Superman title had adopted the new title ''The Adventures of Superman'' but continued the original numbering of its long and storied history. Popular writer Marv Wolfman and artist Jerry Ordway handled the creative chores.\"</ref>\n\nWhen Wolfman departed the title with issue #435, Byrne briefly took over script writing duties before Ordway assumed the mantle of writer-artist and took over the series solely with issue #445 (Oct. 1988), making his writing debut two issues earlier with #443 (Aug. 1988). Ordway had also served as co-plotter on a few issues during both Wolfman and Bryne's writing tenures (issues #426, 435-437, 439-442, and 444). Switching from ''The Adventures of Superman'', Ordway became the writer-artist on the companion title ''[[Superman vol. 2]]'' between #34 (Aug. 1989) and #55 (May 1991), before later returning to ''Adventures of Superman'' as writer and sometimes as cover artist from issues #480 (July 1991) to #500 (June 1993).

The story saw Ordway depict the revamped origins of the former-[[Fawcett Comics]] superhero. It proved to be a success, and was followed by an ongoing monthly series, also titled ''The Power of Shazam!'' (which ran between 1995 and 1999). Ordway wrote and provided painted covers for the entire run of the regular series, as well as illustrating fill-in issues between series-regular artists [[Peter Krause (artist)|Peter Krause]] and [[Mike Manley (artist)|Mike Manley]].<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 269: \"Writer Jerry Ordway chronicled the further adventures of Billy Batson, the World's Mightiest Mortal, in the new ongoing effort ''The Power of Shazam!'', alongside artists Mike Manley and Peter Krause.\"</ref> Towards the end of the series run, he again took on the dual role of writer & artist.\n\n===Non-DC work===\nDuring the mid-1980s, Ordway provided covers and occasional artwork to titles from a number of different comics companies.

He inked the last year (May 2002&ndash;May 2003) of the Batman-related title ''[[Azrael (comics)|Azrael: Agent of the Bat]]'' (#88&ndash;100), and provided the artwork for a six-issue story arc in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 2, issues #189&ndash;194), with writer [[Walt Simonson]] in 2003.
