[http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/StaffCorps/Pages/CivilEngineerCorps(CEC).aspx] Several Civil Engineer Corps officers, primarily those serving during or around the time of World War 2, have held the rank of Vice Admiral, and one officer has held the 4 star rank of Admiral, but there are no current billets within the US Navy that require Civil Engineer Corps officers of either rank.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:CEC Insignia.jpg|thumb|WWII Naval Officers from the Civil Engineer Corps, Medical Corps, Dental Corps and Supply Corps assigned to Naval Construction Battalions had a Silver Seabee on their Corps insignia. ]]\n[[File:U.S. Naval insignia per USMC regulation.jpg|thumb|U.S. Naval insignia, brass subdued per USMC regulation for officers in CBs transferred to the Corps.]]\n\n\nCivil engineers were employed by the Navy Department as early as 1827, when Mr. Loammi Baldwin was appointed to superintendent of the construction of dry docks at Boston and Norfolk.<ref name= \"CEC\"/> Prior to the passage of the Act of 2 March 1867 civil engineers were appointed by the Secretary, but under authority of that act they were to be commissioned by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; they were appropriated for as part of the civil establishment at the several navy yards and stations under the control of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] until 1870.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   At that time their pay was regulated by section 3 of the Act of 15 July, 1870 that  \"fixed\" the annual pay of officers of the Navy on the active list.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   Appropriations for their pay have been made since 1870 under the head of \"Pay of the Navy\".\n\nThe discretionary authority given to the President by the Statute of 3 March 1871, to determine and fix the relative rank of civil engineers was not exercised until the 24th of February 1881, when relative rank was conferred upon them and fixed as follows: One with the relative rank of captain ([[Captain (United States)|CAPT]]), two with that of commander ([[Commander|CDR]]), three with that of lieutenant-commander ([[lieutenant commander|LCDR]]), and four with that of lieutenant ([[lieutenant|LT]]).<ref name= \"CEC\"/>\n\nThe Navy Regulations for 1876 failed to list civil engineers among the staff officers of the Navy, and the uniform regulations for that year did not prescribe a uniform or a corps device for that class of officer. In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, but with the distinctive letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.  The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps replacing the Old English letters C.E.  These were to be worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by enlisted, pay grades E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N.

For CEC the standard gold and silver officer corps insignia was replaced by a brass subdued one on the garrison hat.  The battalions involved were the 18th, 19th, 25th, 53rd and 121st.(see [[17th Marine Regiment]], [[18th Marine Regiment]], [[19th Marine Regiment]], and [[20th Marine Regiment]])   The 31st and 133rd CBs were issued USMC fatigues and attached to the shore parties of the [[4th Marine Division]] and [[5th Marine Division]] for [[Iwo Jima]].

It's purpose was to enable the Marines to land on Tinian's beaches bordered by coral embankments up to 15 feet high.  Ten LVTs were modified using iron beams salvaged from a sugar factory on Saipan.  The  commanding  Marine General was skeptical of the design.  He ordered that a tank test one a hundred times before he would use it it combat.  The ramps not only stood up, but they allowed the Marines land where there were no defenses as a landing there had been  thought impossible.  So, the astonished Japanese were completely outflanked due to CEC engineering.\n\n===Naval Combat Demolition Units===\nOperational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. was the very first USN \"demolitions\" unit.  In early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) [[Solomons, Maryland]] with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course. Those Seabees, lead by  Lieutenant Fred Wise CEC, were immediately sent to participate in the [[invasion of Sicily]]. <ref name=\"Fane\"/><ref name=\"navysealmuseum.org\">{{cite web |url=https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii |title=Seal History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare \u2013 WWII |website=Navy Seal Museum Archives |date= |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> When the unit returned to [[Camp Peary]] most of the men were assigned to the new [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] being formed there.   \n\nNaval Combat Demolition Units were led by junior CEC officers.<ref>Seabee online magazine- this week in Seabee History[http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2016/09/12/this-week-in-seabee-history-week-of-sept-11/]</ref>  There were over 200 NCDUs formed with all but five being reqresitioned for the UDTs.\n\n===UDTs===\n[[File:80-G-244701 Lt Crist, Lt Cmdr.

Lt. Thomas C. Crist CEC, from NCB 10 was in [[Honolulu]] from [[Canton Island]] where he had been involved in a lagoon [[coral|coral head]] clearance project.<ref>Lt Crist, \"The MOCK-UP\", Fort Pierce Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Newspaper, 20 July 1945 , p. 4, Fort Pierce SEAL Archives, Fort Pierce,  FL.</ref> His being in Pearl Harbor turned out to be pivotal in [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] history.  He heard that Admiral Turner was interested in blasting coral and made contact.  The Admiral commissioned Lt. Crist with developing a method to blast coral under combat  conditions and staging qualified men in [[Pearl Harbor|Pearl]] to form a unit for that task.  Lt. Crist had staged 30 officers and 150  enlisted when the disaster at [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] happened.  With [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] the next operation Lt. Crist's 180 men were used to form UDT 1 and UDT 2.  Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) was selected to command UDT 1 and Lt Crist was picked for UDT 2.  That did not last as Admiral Connelly wanted a commander with combat experience.  So, Lt. Crist was made ops officer for team 2.  Upon returning to Hawaii Lt. Crist was named as the first Training Officer of the UDT  program.  He was in the position only a short time when he was selected as commander of UDT 3.  For the Marianas operation (Kwajelein, Roi-Namur, Siapan, Tinian, [[Eniwetok]], and Guam) Admiral Turner recommended sixty silver stars and over three hundred [[bronze star]]s with Vs for the Seabees and others of UDTs 1-7<ref name= \"Frogman\">\"America's First Frogman\", Elizabeth K.

In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, but with the distinctive letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.  The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps replacing the Old English letters C.E.  These were to be worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by enlisted, pay grades E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N. Laycock discussing his modular pontoon box system with Admiral Moreell.]]\nBesides providing the command leadership and engineering skills needed by the Naval Construction Force(NCF), the CEC made a major contribution to the war effort.

It's purpose was to enable the Marines to land on Tinian's beaches bordered by coral embankments up to 15 feet high.  Ten LVTs were modified using iron beams salvaged from a sugar factory on Saipan.  The  commanding  Marine General was skeptical of the design.  He ordered that a tank test one a hundred times before he would use it it combat.  The ramps not only stood up, but they allowed the Marines land where there were no defenses as a landing there had been  thought impossible.  So, the astonished Japanese were completely outflanked due to CEC engineering.\n\n===Naval Combat Demolition Units===\nOperational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. was the very first USN \"demolitions\" unit.  In early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) [[Solomons, Maryland]] with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course.

Lt. Thomas C. Crist CEC, from NCB 10 was in [[Honolulu]] from [[Canton Island]] where he had been involved in a lagoon [[coral|coral head]] clearance project.<ref>Lt Crist, \"The MOCK-UP\", Fort Pierce Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Newspaper, 20 July 1945 , p. 4, Fort Pierce SEAL Archives, Fort Pierce,  FL.</ref> His being in Pearl Harbor turned out to be pivotal in [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] history.  He heard that Admiral Turner was interested in blasting coral and made contact.  The Admiral commissioned Lt. Crist with developing a method to blast coral under combat  conditions and staging qualified men in [[Pearl Harbor|Pearl]] to form a unit for that task.  Lt. Crist had staged 30 officers and 150  enlisted when the disaster at [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] happened.  With [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] the next operation Lt. Crist's 180 men were used to form UDT 1 and UDT 2.  Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) was selected to command UDT 1 and Lt Crist was picked for UDT 2.  That did not last as Admiral Connelly wanted a commander with combat experience.  So, Lt. Crist was made ops officer for team 2.  Upon returning to Hawaii Lt. Crist was named as the first Training Officer of the UDT  program.  He was in the position only a short time when he was selected as commander of UDT 3.  For the Marianas operation (Kwajelein, Roi-Namur, Siapan, Tinian, [[Eniwetok]], and Guam) Admiral Turner recommended sixty silver stars and over three hundred [[bronze star]]s with Vs for the Seabees and others of UDTs 1-7<ref name= \"Frogman\">\"America's First Frogman\", Elizabeth K.

{"title_page": "Self-agency", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=May 2016}}\n\n'''Self-agency''', also known as the phenomenal will, is the sense that some actions are self-generated. Scientist [[Benjamin Libet]] was the first to study it, discovering that brain activity predicts the action before one even has conscious awareness of his or her intention to act upon that action. [[Daniel Wegner]] later defined the three criteria of self-agency: priority, exclusivity, and consistency.\n\nAccording to Wegner, priority means that an action must be planned before the action is initiated. The interval between the action and the effect is known as the intentional binding. Another criterion for self-agency is exclusivity, which means the effect is due to the person's action and not because of other potential causes for the effect. The last criterion Wegner suggested was consistency. Consistency means that one's planned action must occur as planned.\n\nInternal motor cues are also an indicator in deciding whether an action occurred through self-agency, and can be measured by the generation of movement. If the predicted sensory state matches the actual sensory state, then self-agency has likely occurred. No models that predict agency have ever been proved.\n\n== Self-Agency as inference under uncertainty ==\n\n[[Fritz Heider]] and Mary-Ann Simmel (1944) conducted seminal work on the perception of external causal events.  Work on attribution of agency to oneself, however, began with [[Benjamin Libet]]'s demonstration that brain activity predictive of action precedes conscious awareness of the intention to act (Libet, Gleason, Wright and Pearl 1983; Libet 1985).  Since this demonstration psychologists have been trying to determine the relationship between the sense of agency, also known as the phenomenal will, and actual self-agency.\n\n[[Daniel Wegner]]\u2019s book The Illusion of Conscious Will ([[Illusion of control]]; 2002; see also Wegner 2003 and 2004) posits the phenomenal will as the illusory product of post hoc inference.  [[Sense of agency]], on this view, is a product of fallible post hoc inference rather than infallible direct access to one's conscious force of will.  The attribution of self-agency is made most strongly when the following three conditions are met: priority, exclusivity, and consistency.  Thus, one's action must be the exclusive potential cause of the event (exclusivity), one must have had prior thoughts or plans about the action before it occurred (priority), and the action the occurred must match the action that was planned (consistency).  An inference of self-agency is thus made under at least three parameters of uncertainty.\n\n== Uncertainty in Wegner\u2019s three conditions: postdictive accounts of agency ==\n\nMost studies of self-attribution of agency can be categorized as examining one or more of Wegner's three conditions of priority, exclusivity, and consistency.  By manipulating these three parameters in systematic ways, researchers have shed light on the role that each plays in self-attributions of agency.\n\n=== Priority ===\nWegner suggests that temporal order is critical to attributions of self-agency; the agent must have planned or thought about the event/action before it occurred it in order to feel that he has willed it.  This is a natural extension of the commonsense notion that a cause cannot occur after its effect.  However, a range of findings have shown that, beyond the basic requirement of cause preceding effect, the specifics of the timing are important.  Moreover, judgments of timing (and thus priority) can be influenced by variation of other parameters, chiefly Wegner's consistency condition.\n\nThe experience of causing an event alters the subjective experience of their timing. For instance, actions are perceived as temporally shifted towards their effects when they are performed volitionally, but not when involuntarily evoked by [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (Haggard, Clark, and Kalogeras 2002).  This distortion of the perceived interval between movement and effect is known as intentional binding and is considered an implicit measure of the sense of agency.  Moore, Wegner, and Haggard (2009) show that supraliminal priming affects intentional binding.  This effect contains an inferential \u2018\u2018postdictive\u201d component, because the effect shifts the perceived time of action, even when the probability of the effect's occurrence is low (Moore and Haggard, 2008).\n\nGentsch and Sch\u00fctz-Bosbach (2011) find top\u2013down modulation of visual event-related potentials (ERPs) by both self agency and priming of self-agency, suggesting that both efferent information and prior thoughts about action consequence inform the sense of agency.  Furthermore, Engbert et al. (2008) showed that intentional binding occurred only when the movement of the response lever was actively generated by the subject; passive movements (initiated by the response lever) did not result in intentional binding. They take these results to suggest that efferent motor commands, rather than just priority and consistency (see below), is key to self-agency attributions.\n\nIntentional binding may not be exclusive to self-agency, however; Strother, House, and Sukhvinder (2010) found intentional binding in a shared action situation where other agents with similar goals and actions were present.\n\n=== Exclusivity===\nWegner's exclusivity condition posits that attribution of self-agency occurs most strongly in the absence of other potential causes. The presence of other potential causes in temporal and spatial proximity to the event will, all else being equal, result in a diminished sense of self-agency.\n\nDijksterhuis and colleagues (2008) found that nonconscious priming with first-person singular pronouns increased feelings of self-agency, while nonconscious priming with other potential causes (computer, God) decreased feelings of self-agency.  Hindriks et al. (2011) have proposed a computational [[Bayesian inference]] model of self-attribution of agency that deals mainly with the exclusivity dimension.  (For another Bayesian approach to agency and control, see Huys and Dayan, 2009.)\n\n=== Consistency===\nWegner argues that the event must match the planned action; attribution will be low if the outcome does not match the perceived cause. Wegner and Wheatley (1999) demonstrated that priming participants with thoughts relevant to a movement just before it was made by another person caused participants to feel they had caused the action themselves.  Ebert and Wegner (2010) also showed that manipulating consistency enhanced both judgments of self-authorship and temporal binding between cause and effect (see also Haggard, Clark and Kalogeras, 2002; Moore, Wegner and Haggard, 2009).\n\nOther studies have shown that consistency between prior thought and subsequent action can produce a sense of vicarious agency for another person's actions (Wegner, Sparrow and Winerman, 2004), increase self-agency attributions for one's own actions (Pronin, Wegner, McCarthy and Rodriguez, 2006), and even produce changes in self-attribution when the prior thought is unconscious (Aarts, Custers and Wegner, 2005) or the result of nonconscious priming (Aarts, Custers and Marien, 2009).\n\n== Internal motor cues: predictive accounts of agency ==\n\nWegner's account is a leading example of a postdictive or inferential account of the attribution of self-agency.  On this type of view, the feeling of self-agency emerges entirely from post hoc inference and does not track or emerge from anything directly related to the actual causation of the action.\n\nComputational models of motor control, by contrast, hypothesize that the sense of agency for a given action arises most directly from internal motor representations associated with generating the movement.  An internal forward model based on efference copy, for example, can predict the sensory consequences of a motor command and compare them with the actual sensory state after that action has been initiated (Blakemore, Wolpert and Frith, 2000, 2002; Haggard, 2005).  If the actual sensory state matches the predicted one, self-agency is (likely to be) inferred.  Indeed, the intentional binding effect (described above) may depend on the motor efference command; Engbert, Wohlschl\u00e4ger and Haggard (2008) provide data suggesting that compression of estimated intervals between action and effect occurs only for volitional actions initiated by the self and not for passive actions or for actions performed by others.  These authors maintain an efferent motor command is necessary for a sense of agency.  Indeed, omitting the effect of an action does eliminate intentional binding, so long as the probability of an effect given an action is sufficiently high (Moore and Haggard, 2008).\n\n== Attempts to synthesize predictive and postdictive accounts of agency ==\n\nSynofzik, Vosgerau and Newen (2008) review findings on comparator models and argue that they cannot account for either a feeling of agency or a judgment of agency.  Their multifactorial model separates feeling from judgment and discusses the conceptual level of processing that is added to the latter.  Their discussion concerns explicit judgments of agency, however, which may differ from results obtained using implicit measures (e.g., Engbert, Wohlschl\u00e4ger and Haggard 2008).\n\nMoore, Lagnado, Deal and Haggard (2009) investigated whether statistical contingency alone could explain both predictive and inferential \u2018\u2018postdictive\u201d intentional binding effects.  Both predictive and \u2018postdictive' shifts in the time of action perception depended on strong contingency between the action and effect, suggesting that the experience of agency involves causal learning based on statistical contingency.\n\nAlthough predictive and postdictive accounts of agency are often cast as competitors, they may in fact be reconcilable when attributions of self-agency are viewed within the framework of cognition under uncertainty.  In particular, a comparator model based on efference copy can be seen as a more sophisticated way of characterizing Wegner's consistency parameter and the computations that are likely to be a part of it.  Basing outcome predictions on motor commands, rather than just higher-level representations of the goal state that an action is intended to bring about, is likely to provide finer-grained predictions with which to compare outcomes, thereby reducing uncertainty in agency attributions.  This higher predictive resolution, in turn, could be useful in making exclusivity judgments (Wegner's second condition): even if a particular goal state is brought about, if the way it is brought about does not closely match the motoric prediction, the attribution of agency may be reduced or blocked entirely.  Similarly, given evidence (discussed above \u2013 see Haggard, Clark and Kalogeras 2002) that whether or not an action is volitional affects intentional binding, motoric representations and predictions seem also to affect Wegner's priority parameter.  As such, predictive and postdictive accounts may simply differ in emphasis and in the level at which they describe the phenomenon, rather than being fundamentally incompatible.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Free will]]\n* [[Neuroscience of free will]]\n* [[Self-efficacy]]\n* [[Volition (psychology)]]\n\n== Citations ==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Aarts H, Custers R, & Marien H (2009).

If the predicted sensory state matches the actual sensory state, then self-agency has likely occurred. No models that predict agency have ever been proved.\n\n== Self-Agency as inference under uncertainty ==\n\n[[Fritz Heider]] and Mary-Ann Simmel (1944) conducted seminal work on the perception of external causal events.  Work on attribution of agency to oneself, however, began with [[Benjamin Libet]]'s demonstration that brain activity predictive of action precedes conscious awareness of the intention to act (Libet, Gleason, Wright and Pearl 1983; Libet 1985).  Since this demonstration psychologists have been trying to determine the relationship between the sense of agency, also known as the phenomenal will, and actual self-agency.\n\n[[Daniel Wegner]]\u2019s book The Illusion of Conscious Will ([[Illusion of control]]; 2002; see also Wegner 2003 and 2004) posits the phenomenal will as the illusory product of post hoc inference.  [[Sense of agency]], on this view, is a product of fallible post hoc inference rather than infallible direct access to one's conscious force of will.  The attribution of self-agency is made most strongly when the following three conditions are met: priority, exclusivity, and consistency.  Thus, one's action must be the exclusive potential cause of the event (exclusivity), one must have had prior thoughts or plans about the action before it occurred (priority), and the action the occurred must match the action that was planned (consistency).  An inference of self-agency is thus made under at least three parameters of uncertainty.\n\n== Uncertainty in Wegner\u2019s three conditions: postdictive accounts of agency ==\n\nMost studies of self-attribution of agency can be categorized as examining one or more of Wegner's three conditions of priority, exclusivity, and consistency.  By manipulating these three parameters in systematic ways, researchers have shed light on the role that each plays in self-attributions of agency.\n\n=== Priority ===\nWegner suggests that temporal order is critical to attributions of self-agency; the agent must have planned or thought about the event/action before it occurred it in order to feel that he has willed it.  This is a natural extension of the commonsense notion that a cause cannot occur after its effect.  However, a range of findings have shown that, beyond the basic requirement of cause preceding effect, the specifics of the timing are important.  Moreover, judgments of timing (and thus priority) can be influenced by variation of other parameters, chiefly Wegner's consistency condition.\n\nThe experience of causing an event alters the subjective experience of their timing. For instance, actions are perceived as temporally shifted towards their effects when they are performed volitionally, but not when involuntarily evoked by [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (Haggard, Clark, and Kalogeras 2002).  This distortion of the perceived interval between movement and effect is known as intentional binding and is considered an implicit measure of the sense of agency.  Moore, Wegner, and Haggard (2009) show that supraliminal priming affects intentional binding.  This effect contains an inferential \u2018\u2018postdictive\u201d component, because the effect shifts the perceived time of action, even when the probability of the effect's occurrence is low (Moore and Haggard, 2008).\n\nGentsch and Sch\u00fctz-Bosbach (2011) find top\u2013down modulation of visual event-related potentials (ERPs) by both self agency and priming of self-agency, suggesting that both efferent information and prior thoughts about action consequence inform the sense of agency.  Furthermore, Engbert et al. (2008) showed that intentional binding occurred only when the movement of the response lever was actively generated by the subject; passive movements (initiated by the response lever) did not result in intentional binding. They take these results to suggest that efferent motor commands, rather than just priority and consistency (see below), is key to self-agency attributions.\n\nIntentional binding may not be exclusive to self-agency, however; Strother, House, and Sukhvinder (2010) found intentional binding in a shared action situation where other agents with similar goals and actions were present.\n\n=== Exclusivity===\nWegner's exclusivity condition posits that attribution of self-agency occurs most strongly in the absence of other potential causes. The presence of other potential causes in temporal and spatial proximity to the event will, all else being equal, result in a diminished sense of self-agency.\n\nDijksterhuis and colleagues (2008) found that nonconscious priming with first-person singular pronouns increased feelings of self-agency, while nonconscious priming with other potential causes (computer, God) decreased feelings of self-agency.  Hindriks et al. (2011) have proposed a computational [[Bayesian inference]] model of self-attribution of agency that deals mainly with the exclusivity dimension.  (For another Bayesian approach to agency and control, see Huys and Dayan, 2009.)\n\n=== Consistency===\nWegner argues that the event must match the planned action; attribution will be low if the outcome does not match the perceived cause. Wegner and Wheatley (1999) demonstrated that priming participants with thoughts relevant to a movement just before it was made by another person caused participants to feel they had caused the action themselves.  Ebert and Wegner (2010) also showed that manipulating consistency enhanced both judgments of self-authorship and temporal binding between cause and effect (see also Haggard, Clark and Kalogeras, 2002; Moore, Wegner and Haggard, 2009).\n\nOther studies have shown that consistency between prior thought and subsequent action can produce a sense of vicarious agency for another person's actions (Wegner, Sparrow and Winerman, 2004), increase self-agency attributions for one's own actions (Pronin, Wegner, McCarthy and Rodriguez, 2006), and even produce changes in self-attribution when the prior thought is unconscious (Aarts, Custers and Wegner, 2005) or the result of nonconscious priming (Aarts, Custers and Marien, 2009).\n\n== Internal motor cues: predictive accounts of agency ==\n\nWegner's account is a leading example of a postdictive or inferential account of the attribution of self-agency.  On this type of view, the feeling of self-agency emerges entirely from post hoc inference and does not track or emerge from anything directly related to the actual causation of the action.\n\nComputational models of motor control, by contrast, hypothesize that the sense of agency for a given action arises most directly from internal motor representations associated with generating the movement.  An internal forward model based on efference copy, for example, can predict the sensory consequences of a motor command and compare them with the actual sensory state after that action has been initiated (Blakemore, Wolpert and Frith, 2000, 2002; Haggard, 2005).  If the actual sensory state matches the predicted one, self-agency is (likely to be) inferred.  Indeed, the intentional binding effect (described above) may depend on the motor efference command; Engbert, Wohlschl\u00e4ger and Haggard (2008) provide data suggesting that compression of estimated intervals between action and effect occurs only for volitional actions initiated by the self and not for passive actions or for actions performed by others.  These authors maintain an efferent motor command is necessary for a sense of agency.  Indeed, omitting the effect of an action does eliminate intentional binding, so long as the probability of an effect given an action is sufficiently high (Moore and Haggard, 2008).\n\n== Attempts to synthesize predictive and postdictive accounts of agency ==\n\nSynofzik, Vosgerau and Newen (2008) review findings on comparator models and argue that they cannot account for either a feeling of agency or a judgment of agency.  Their multifactorial model separates feeling from judgment and discusses the conceptual level of processing that is added to the latter.  Their discussion concerns explicit judgments of agency, however, which may differ from results obtained using implicit measures (e.g., Engbert, Wohlschl\u00e4ger and Haggard 2008).\n\nMoore, Lagnado, Deal and Haggard (2009) investigated whether statistical contingency alone could explain both predictive and inferential \u2018\u2018postdictive\u201d intentional binding effects.  Both predictive and \u2018postdictive' shifts in the time of action perception depended on strong contingency between the action and effect, suggesting that the experience of agency involves causal learning based on statistical contingency.\n\nAlthough predictive and postdictive accounts of agency are often cast as competitors, they may in fact be reconcilable when attributions of self-agency are viewed within the framework of cognition under uncertainty.  In particular, a comparator model based on efference copy can be seen as a more sophisticated way of characterizing Wegner's consistency parameter and the computations that are likely to be a part of it.  Basing outcome predictions on motor commands, rather than just higher-level representations of the goal state that an action is intended to bring about, is likely to provide finer-grained predictions with which to compare outcomes, thereby reducing uncertainty in agency attributions.  This higher predictive resolution, in turn, could be useful in making exclusivity judgments (Wegner's second condition): even if a particular goal state is brought about, if the way it is brought about does not closely match the motoric prediction, the attribution of agency may be reduced or blocked entirely.  Similarly, given evidence (discussed above \u2013 see Haggard, Clark and Kalogeras 2002) that whether or not an action is volitional affects intentional binding, motoric representations and predictions seem also to affect Wegner's priority parameter.  As such, predictive and postdictive accounts may simply differ in emphasis and in the level at which they describe the phenomenon, rather than being fundamentally incompatible.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Free will]]\n* [[Neuroscience of free will]]\n* [[Self-efficacy]]\n* [[Volition (psychology)]]\n\n== Citations ==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Aarts H, Custers R, & Marien H (2009).

Caltech's unique House system is modeled after the [[residential college]] system of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in England, although the houses are probably more similar in size and character to the [[Residential colleges at Yale University|Yale University residential colleges]] and [[Harvard College#House system|Harvard University house system]].  Like a residential college, a House embodies two closely connected concepts; it serves as both a physical building where a majority of its members reside and as the center of social activity for its members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://turli.caltech.edu/reports/TURLIFinalReport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128004211/http://turli.caltech.edu/reports/TURLIFinalReport.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-28 }} Caltech Task Force on Undergraduate Residence Life Initiatives, Background Section</ref>\n\nThe Houses resemble [[fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] at other American universities in the shared loyalties they engender. Unlike in fraternities, however, potentially dangerous \"rushing\" or \"pledging\" is replaced with two weeks of \"rotation\" at the beginning of a student's freshman year, and students generally remain affiliated with one House for the duration of their undergraduate studies.<ref name=\"IHC\">{{cite web|url=http://ihc.caltech.edu/|title=IHC - Home|website=ihc.caltech.edu}}</ref>\n\nFreshmen have historically gone through a process known as Rotation for a week before term through the first week of classes, leading to their eventual House assignment by way of a matching process.  This process has rules associated with it to try to give freshmen a chance to choose among the Houses in an unbiased way.<ref name=\"IHC\"/>  These rules are located on [http://ihc.caltech.edu/rotation.html the IHC (Interhouse Committee) website].\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of the Caltech House System}}\nCaltech established the House System in 1931, disbanding the existing fraternities and recasting them as '''Blacker House''', '''Dabney House''', '''Fleming House''' and '''Ricketts House,''' now known as the South Houses.<ref name=feb2018end>{{cite web|last=Jou|first=Ted|title=A History of Undergraduate Self-Governance at Caltech|url=http://donut.caltech.edu/w/images/0/00/Jou.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2011}}</ref>   The fraternities were as follows:\n\n*Blacker:  Phi Alpha Rho, also known as Pharo\n*Dabney:  Gamma Sigma\n*Fleming: Sigma Alpha Pi and Pi Alpha Tau\n*Ricketts:  Kappa Gamma, also known as Gnome\n\nExpanding student population was accommodated in 1960 with the North Houses: '''Lloyd House,''' '''Page House,''' and '''Ruddock House.'''\n\nA new state-of-the-art residential facility named '''Avery House,''' was opened in 1996, touted as a facility that allowed undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty to not only mingle, but live together.  As a result, Avery was not initially considered part of the House System, and freshmen were not allowed to live there.  In the 2003&ndash;2004 school year, the Avery Council (the student government of Avery House) campaigned for Avery to participate in Rotation and take freshmen.  This change was opposed by the Caltech undergraduate student body by a five-to-one margin, but the Faculty Board voted overwhelmingly to approve the change.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bartz|first=Kevin|title=Faculty Board agrees with SHC proposal|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/1912/|accessdate=13 November 2011|newspaper=The California Tech|date=17 May 2004|location=Pasadena, CA|page=1|quote=Nearly 60 house demonstrators convened near Millikan Library last Monday to protest the measure, but it wasn't enough to stop the Faculty Board from approving the Student Housing Committee's recommendation opening Avery House to freshmen in 2005 by a resounding 14-1 vote....  Foremost in representing opponents' concerns was IHC Chair Kim Popendorf '06, who arrived at the meeting to a rock star's ovation from demonstrating students.  Her two-minute address to the board stressed a recent IHC survey showing undergraduates opposed to the measure by a five-to-one margin, underlining opponents' fears that an Avery with freshmen would be lost as an unaffiliated option for students dissatisfied with the seven on-campus houses.}}</ref>  Beginning in the 2005&ndash;2006 school year, [[Student#First year|freshmen]] began to rotate into Avery, changing its status to a fully represented House.\n\nAlso in 2005, work began on a major renovation project for the aging South Houses, whose residents were relocated to a temporary modular housing complex. The renovations were completed at the beginning of the 2007 calendar year.  Students moved back into the South Houses on 15 December 2006, though construction continued through the beginning of 2007.\n\nLike most of the older buildings on campus, Avery House and the South Houses are in [[Mission Revival Style architecture|California Mission]] style, and resemble [[cloister]]ed [[Abbey|monasteries]] with enclosed courtyards; the North Houses are of [[Modernism|Modern]] design.\n\n== House memberships ==\nThere are two ways to gain membership in a House: Rotate in at the beginning of one's freshman year and become a full member, or become a social or full member afterwards.  Procedures for admitting new members vary depending upon House bylaws and type of membership.\n\n=== Rotation ===\nRotation is the process by which incoming freshmen choose (and are chosen by) the House they will be affiliated with.  In Caltech parlance, freshmen are called \"frosh\" and are referred to as \"prefrosh\" until the revelation of their house affiliation at the end of Rotation.  Upon first arriving at Caltech, the incoming freshmen are given a random room assignment in a random House that is different from their Prefrosh Weekend assignment, and then spend a week eating mainly dinner and dessert in all of the Houses, getting an opportunity to meet people in all of the Houses.\n\nThese meals and meetings are an opportunity both for the prefrosh to get to know the feel of the different houses and for the upperclassmen to meet and rate the prefrosh so both can see where they might belong.  Many Houses also show house-made videos to the prefrosh, which yield the prefrosh additional information about the various personalities of the Houses.  At the end of this week, the frosh rate each of the 8 Houses in order of preference. Based on this, and the opinions of the Houses' existing members, the prefrosh are placed into a House which will be their home physically and socially for the next few years. The InterHouse Committee attempts to ensure a certain level of secrecy regarding the exact process, so that the confidentiality of both the freshmen, and those involved with their final housing assignments, is maintained.<ref name=\"IHC\"/>  Also, the selection process is constrained:  there are only a limited number of openings in each House, and it is impossible to simultaneously meet the preferences of all of the Freshmen and Houses.\n\nDespite the constraints, this two-way selection process of joining a House, and social interaction after joining, gives each House a distinctive personality that is stable over decades{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.\n\n=== Later membership ===\nThere is a second way to obtain membership in a House: to apply at some point after Rotation. The process varies from House to House, but in general one makes an announcement at dinner to the effect of \"I would like to be a member of Booty House,\" and the House conducts a vote (the nature of the vote, again, varying). (\"Booty House\" is commonly used to refer to any unspecified House, and appears as the house named in examples of Rotation Rules violations.<ref name=\"IHC\"/>) All Houses except Ricketts have two tiers of memberships: Full members and social members.\n\nAnyone who rotates into a House is automatically a full member; individuals who would like to become members afterward can choose between full and social membership. The relative difficulties in attaining full and social memberships differ from House to House, as do the relative privileges that each membership type affords. The only universal truths are that full membership is harder to attain than social and that full members may live in House-associated property while social members may not. Generally speaking, social members are able to attend all House social events (ski trips, hikes, etc.).\n\n== List of the Houses ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! House !! Members !! Color (#hex) !!

Dabney Hall of the Humanities, a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Dabney, is one of the four corner buildings of Caltech's central courtyard. It was built in 1927.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn 1928, the Dabneys gave $200,000 to build Dabney House, one of four new residence halls.\n\nDabney House, as part of the single building that makes up the four \"South Houses,\" was constructed in 1930 and 1931.  It was known as the House of Gentlemen and the House of Captains, but underwent a dramatic change in personality during the 1960s.  In 1973, the House was disowned by the Dabney family when students from Dabney House protested then-President Nixon's role in the Watergate affair with a sign on the library bearing the phrase  \"Impeach [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]].\"\n\n[[Image:Dabney-minimalist-vector.svg|thumb|175px|right|The \"minimalist coat-of-arms\" of Dabney House, designed by old Darb Kaihsu Tai in the late 1990s, based on the Dabney family coat-of-arms.<ref name=\"BelletJaquelin1907\">{{cite book|last1=Bellet|first1=Louise Pecquet du|last2=Jaquelin|first2=Edward|last3=Jaquelin|first3=Martha Cary|title=Some prominent Virginia families|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iQSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA87|accessdate=11 March 2011|year=1907|publisher=J.P. Bell company (inc.)|page=87}}</ref>]]\nTraditionally standing for \"Dabney Eats It,\" referring to a particularly unpalatable plate of noodles in the 1950s, the trigraph DEI has come to be a badge of pride for Darbs.  Besides naming the house's recreation room after it and spreading it all across campus, Dabney alumni have made DEI a hidden code in the outside world.  The letters can be seen in movies (most notably ''[[Real Genius]]'') and video games (including ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City|GTA: Vice City]]'' and several [[Intellivision]] games).  There are even stories of the trigraph making its way into space on JPL [[space probe|probe]]s including the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] space craft, and being written on the Moon by astronaut Darb [[Harrison Schmitt]].  In the late 1960s, during on-campus shooting of an episode of the TV series [[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]], students stenciled the cryptic letters \"DEI\" high on a wall in a steam (utility) tunnel scheduled to be filmed the next day. The marking was subsequently visible on national television behind [[Peter Lupus]] as he paused in one shot, unaware of this Caltech contribution to spy drama.\n\nMore recently, Dabney started the Student Coffee House, or \"Chouse\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/2011/04/sfc-and-mannion-food.html|title=SFC and Mannion Food! *|website=Caltech}}</ref> and provided the majority of the staff for a couple years. Since then, Coffee House has become a part of Caltech's Dining Services and is now managed by CDS.  Dabney hosts the annual Millikan Pumpkin Drop Experiment (a parody of the [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Millikan]] [[oil-drop experiment]]) where pumpkins frozen in liquid nitrogen are dropped from Millikan library. This tradition was featured on the TV show [[Numb3rs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/10/27/numb3rs-robin-hood/|title=TV - Latest Recaps, Best Shows To Watch|website=www.tvsquad.com}}</ref> Dabney also hosts Drop Day, a party held the Saturday after the second term drop day to celebrate the point of no return, and Dabney Metal Night, an opportunity for the amateur bands of Caltech to play for the crowd.\n\nWhile the traditional motto of Dabney House (Fidelis et gratus \"Faithfulness and thankfulness\") still stands on the Dabney crest, Dabney House has instituted a new, changeable motto. In line with Caltech's tradition of wall murals and wall writings, any member may change the house motto by striking the previous motto on a designated motto wall and writing a new one.\n\n=== Fleming House ===\n[[File:Fleming courtyard.jpg|thumb|300px|Fleming courtyard in 2008]]\n'''Fleming House''' was built with funds donated by a number of people, and the name Fleming was chosen to honor [[Arthur H. Fleming]], then the chairman of Caltech's Board of Trustees.\n\nMembers of Fleming House are called ''Flems.'' The house color is red. The motto, from the crest as commonly seen on house beer steins, is \"Let the Deed Shaw.\"<ref>\"Let the Deed Shaw\", archaic for \"Let the Deed Show\", is also the motto for [[Fleming College]], in [[Peterborough, Ontario]].  The crest and motto derive from the noble [[Earl of Wigtown|House of Fleming]] of [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]].</ref>  The house battle cry is \"Go Big Red!\"  Another important maxim is \"Flems stick together!\", as well as the slogan \"Where men are men, giants walk the earth, and the thundering herd is real\".  Historically, Fleming House did not offer social memberships (nominally citing all non-Fleming undergraduates as \"social members\"), but a recent decision by the house leadership changed this long-standing policy. Students may now apply for and obtain Fleming House social membership.\n\nThe physical layout of Fleming House includes rooms numbered 8.5 (formerly the RA apartment, now a triple) and [[pi|\u03c0]].  The Interhouse Trophy, awarded to the winner of the Interhouse Athletic Competitions, has been awarded to Fleming for the past five years.\n\nFor the past few years, Fleming and Page House have pranked each other regularly and included each other in initiations.\n\n==== Fleming Cannon ====\n[[File:Caltech cannon.jpg|thumb|left|The Fleming Cannon in June 2007]]\n\nThe Fleming Cannon, a Caltech landmark, rests on its wheels on the Olive Walk in front of Fleming.  As it makes a very loud noise when fired, it is fired to mark important events, such as the end of rotation, Ditch Day, the end of the term, and graduation.  It was originally cast for use in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] but eventually found its way to the then-military themed [[Southwestern Academy]] in [[San Marino, California]], where it remained on the front lawn between 1925 and 1972.\n\nIn 1972 Fleming class officers got permission from Southwestern Academy to take the cannon, but the underclassmen who mounted new wheels on it and dragged it to campus at night thought they were stealing it.  It took months of paint stripping and other work to restore it to operational status. The Caltech administration ordered its return in 1975, but negotiations began for an official transfer of the cannon back to Caltech in 1980, and in 1981 it was [https://web.archive.org/web/20110717032549/http://www.flemingcannon.com/history.html returned] on a permanent basis to the Caltech campus.\n\nThe cannon was stolen by [[Harvey Mudd College|Harvey Mudd]] students in 1986 ([http://people.bu.edu/fmri/somers/cannon.html as detailed in this article]). At the demands of both college administrations, the Cannon was returned to Fleming House approximately 8 weeks after the prank.\n\nIt was rumored that Harvey Mudd would attempt to steal the cannon again in 2006 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their original theft; however, the cannon disappeared on March 28, a day before the anniversary, only to show up at [[MIT]], just in time for Campus Preview Weekend, during which many rising freshmen visit MIT.  A (seemingly fake) moving company by the name of [http://www.howeandser.com/ Howe & Ser Moving Co.] has taken credit. (The name is a double [[pun]]: When substituting \"and\" for the [[ampersand]], it reads \"how we answer\", while substituting the [[Latin]] ''[[Grammatical conjunction|et]]'' for the ampersand gives \"[[Howitzer]]\".)  Displayed prominently in front of MIT's [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]], the Fleming Cannon sported a giant, gold-plated [[MIT class ring]] around its barrel.\n\nA day after the prank was disclosed, Fleming's members began planning a recovery operation on the night of April 7. They immediately sent twenty-three members to Boston to retrieve their cannon. The Flems were greeted at MIT by a group of students and police who watched as the cannon was loaded into a truck. Afterward, a friendly barbecue celebrated the event.\n\n==== Notable Flems ====\n* [[George O.

D. Ricketts]]. Members of Ricketts House are called Skurves (or Scurves) due to a play on the similarity of the name Ricketts to the disease [[rickets]] and the fact that [[scurvy]] is another vitamin deficiency disease.  Members of Ricketts Hovse were known as ''Rowdies'' until about 1960; alumni of that period still draw the distinction between ''Rowdies'' and ''Skurves''.  \n\nRicketts traditions include fire related activities and the brakedrum.  Prior to early 2003, the Ricketts courtyard housed a large concrete firepot, in which massive fires were often enjoyed during cool Pasadena evenings.  The courtyard originally featured a large Italian marble well head (historically attributed to and named \"Millikan's Pot\"). It was used as a measure for height of serves in the singles and doubles games of four square played in the courtyard.  By the mid-1970s, it existed only as chunks of rubble, after destruction in an experiment in more exciting pot fires allegedly involving newspaper, xylene, and matches.  Around that time, enterprising house officers arranged for its replacement with a large section of concrete sewer pipe, which was eventually replaced with a concrete facsimile of the original pot.  Due to tightening of Pasadena fire codes and the Caltech administration's recent focus on liability concerns, the firepot was removed.  A portable fireplace temporarily replaced the firepot.  The brakedrum is a contest between the freshman class and the sophomore class over ownership of the brakedrum.\n\nRicketts House was known for athletics and student government in the 1950s, but soon after that they became known less for these activities and more for activities that pushed the motto \"Take me as I am\" to the limit. Recently, Ricketts had an inverted [[pentagram]] on the front wall of its dining room.  Administration members called for its removal as it was a symbol that may have offended the general public who viewed the house during tours. The pentagram was originally painted in the dining hall for the Interhouse party of 1989 - prior to this time this symbol had no particular connection to Ricketts House. In later years the inverted pentagram was added to the Ricketts House crest (the original had had ship's wheels instead of pentagrams). During the renovations from 2004 to 2006, the mural was painted over, and a new mural policy was put in place. Conflicts regarding the new mural policy continued until the early 2010s, when the policy was relaxed. The House features a number of murals, including one featuring the cover art of the [[Grateful Dead]]'s eponymous [[Grateful Dead (album) | album]] that was painted in the 1970s. Today the house hosts a number of social events throughout the year, including a termly open mic night, featuring music performances by students, a termly formal dinner, and an interhouse party formerly known as Apache. \n\nThe building has space for approximately 70 students, while the house had a total membership of about 110 at commencement in 2019. Two graduate student resident associates live in apartments in the house.\n\nRicketts remains the only house not to offer social membership. A [[referendum]] to add social membership in 2018 was defeated by  vote of 16 in favour, 43 against, and 3 abstentions.\n\n====Notable Skurves and Rowdies====\n* Carl V.

The North Houses were constructed in 1960 with funds provided by the Lloyd Foundation and other donors. Lloyd House was named in memory of Mr. Ralph B. Lloyd and his wife, Mrs. Lulu Hull Lloyd.  Mr. Lloyd was a member of the Board of Trustees of Caltech, 1939\u20131952.\nMembers of Lloyd House are called Lloydies. The house color is gold, and its motto is \"I live and die for those I love\", popularly corrupted by mis-reading the banner as \"I live for those I love and die.\"\n\nLloyd House is governed by a student-elected, student-run Executive Committee, or \"Excomm,\" of 9\u201310 members: President, Secretary, Superintendent, Treasurer, Social Director(s), Athletic Manager, and 3 representatives at large.  The Social Director(s) and Athletic Manager are aided by the Social Team and the Athletic Team.  There are 7 Upperclass Counselors (UCCs) and various appointed positions, such as Librarian, Fridgemaster, and Pool Monkey.  Traditional house events include a meet-the-frosh Ultimate Egg competition (in which Ultimate Frisbee is played using eggs), Airband, and Beach Trip (for which some members bike, roller blade, longboard, walk, or even run 42 miles from Caltech to Huntington Beach).\n\nLloyd House is located along the Olive Walk, and is an \"L\"-shaped, two-story building.  At the intersection of the two branches of the house are \"Lower Crotch\" and \"Upper Crotch,\" which serve as communal lounge areas.\n\nLloyd is divided into seven alleys: Purple, Kaos, VI ([[Virgin Islands]]), [[Fingal's Cave]], [[Valhalla]], Inferno, and Tropic.  Each alley is decorated with theme-appropriate [[mural]]s.  Some murals include the expansive Purple mural in the theme of Japanese [[tsunami]] waves, the [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] mural in Kaos, the tropical mural in VI, the \"Enjoy [[Crack cocaine|Crack]]\" mural in Inferno that mocks the [[Coca-Cola]] slogan and contains a reference to [[Alan Moore]]'s graphic novel ''[[Watchmen]]'', and the Lloyd Dragon in Fingal's.  Several of the names have been changes since the 1970s when the names were:  Headquarters (now purple), Penthouse (now Kaos), Virgin Islands, Cave (though Fingal still lived in this alley), Valhalla, Inferno and Creek (now Tropic).  At this time the alleys were mostly painted solid colors with some minimal designs and pictures (including flames on the walls of Inferno).\n\nThe \"shed\" used to be a stand-alone building in the courtyard that housed Lloyd's big screen TV. Now the \"shed\" exists indoors, in a room adjacent to Valhalla that used to be part of the MOSH's office.\n\nIn the 1980s, Lloyd had two off-campus alleys, one named \"The Place\" and one named \"Corona\" (in reference to the corona of the sun as a metaphor for the outer reaches of Lloyd).  The Place used to exist on the corner of Michigan Ave and Lura St; it was removed around 1988 and is now a parking lot. Corona used to be on the east side of Holliston Ave; it was removed in 1992 and the location is now the new parking structure.  Because of Pasadena preservation laws, both houses were moved to other places in Pasadena.  The Corona house was donated to a minister (for free) who restored it at 1792 Newport Ave, Pasadena, CA. The house is no longer owned by the minister, but it still exists.\n\nAround 1990, in exchange for the loss of Corona, Lloyd adopted \"the Quads\" alley at 232, 234, and 236 Chester Ave.  (The 232 and 234 addresses were still affiliated with Lloyd House until the opening of the Bechtel Residence, after which they became housing for graduate students)\n\n====Lloydies====\n[http://cripplingdepression.com/ Crippling Depression], a satirical [[comic strip]] that was published regularly in the California Tech, the student newspaper, was drawn and written by Lloydies.\n\nIn the past, some Lloydies have pulled elaborate pranks.  The [[Great Rose Bowl Hoax|prank of the 1961 Rose Bowl]] was pulled off by the \"Fiendish Fourteen,\" members of Lloyd House.  Flashcards that were intended to cheer for the Washington Huskies football team were changed to read Caltech.  The Hollywood sign was changed to read \"Caltech\" in 1987 by a group of Pageboys and Lloydies.\n\nEvery year since 1994, Lloydies have climbed onto the top of Millikan Library to construct the Lloyd Christmas Tree, a monumental structure of numerous Christmas lights strung together to resemble a 10-story Christmas tree topped with a 12-feet-tall \"L.\"  During the big wind storm of 2013, the L broke apart into pieces, so the Lloydies rebuilt the \"L\", but replaced it instead with a double \"L\" that is now 16-feet-tall. In 2018, neighbors and the city of Pasadena filed a complaint, as the Lloyd Christmas tree was a religious symbol. The tree is now referred to as the \"Lloyd Lights\".  The latest off-campus pranks have been the pranking of MIT's Campus Preview Weekend, which included many Lloydies.\n\nA folklore that has been passed down throughout the years is that of the Purple LSD lab.  It has been said that sometime in the 1970s, a group of [[chemistry]] majors living in Purple blocked off some of the alley for a special project.  The product of their project, was dubbed \"Lloyd-grade\" LSD, to denote its extraordinary purity. The rumor goes that it was one of the largest sources of LSD at the time.  Nearly the entire senior class was expelled when the [[FBI]] invaded the house (only three seniors are mentioned in the yearbook from 1970), though folklore also holds that the perpetrators escaped capture, leaving only a teasing banner for the invaders reading \"Welcome, FBI!\"\n\nNotable former Lloydies include:\n\n* [[Cleve Moler]] (1961) \u2013 inventor of Matlab and one of the original Lloydies (having been \"transferred\" there from Ricketts House)\n* [[Douglas Osheroff]] (1967) \u2013 Nobel Prize in Physics (1996) for discovery of superfluidity in Helium-3\n* [[Steven E.

Cox]] (1978) \u2013 political scientist; one of only three political scientists to have won twice the George H. Hallett Award\n* [[Schelte J. Bus]] (1979) \u2013 astronomer\n* [[AdSense#History|Adam Weissman]] (1990) \u2013 co-founder of Applied Semantics, which was bought by Google and became [[AdSense]]\n* [[AdSense#History|Gil Elbaz]] (1991) \u2013 co-founder of Applied Semantics\n* [[Adam D'Angelo]] (2006) \u2013 founder of [[Quora (website)|Quora]] and early Facebook CTO\n\n=== Page House ===\n[[File:Page House Caltech 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|Page courtyard in 2009]]\n\nUpon the arrival of the North Houses in the 1960s, members of Ricketts house splintered off to populate the newly constructed Page House.  Members of the house are known as Pageboys (even the women), and the house crest includes the \"mechanical horse\" with a banner reading ''spe labor levis'', a Latin [[idiom]] meaning \"May the work be light\" (and is often followed by \"And the drinks be heavy\").  House construction was funded by J.R. Page, former vice president of the First National Bank in Los Angeles, and chairman of the Caltech board of trustees from 1943 to 1954.  One of the largest houses, Page has been home to KCAL, the Interhouse Roller Coaster.  It also used its access to the basement so that Pageboys could cover the concrete with dry ice, a prank copied in the movie [[Real Genius]].\n\nIn response to other houses quixotically claiming certain items to be off-limits in regard to pranks (rendering them \"Non-RF-able\", where RF stands for Rat Fu*k), the Page House president at the time named that the President be unprankable as well. In the past, there were two items in Page House that could not be the target of pranks: the pool table felt and a poster of President Nixon that is passed on to each House President shortly after s/he is elected.\n\nAll student rooms in Page are designed as doubles; however, when vacancies arise, upperclassmen may live in rooms as singles.  According to house bylaws, the newly elected Page House president may choose to reside in any room as a single. The FU, across from the Library, is Page House's entertainment room, complete with dozens of bean bags.  Its name originates from a Ditch Day stack in which the resident graduating senior and president painted a large \"F\" on its door. Rather than painting over it, Pageboys simply painted a \"U\" below it. The FU was formerly a triple, and before that was the RA apartment, which is now located downstairs. The Library itself is important to Page House culture, and although its collection is always being removed to be recycled elsewhere, its contents are meant to reflect the works and contributions of contemporary Pageboys.  Owing to its distinguished status, one must wear shoes while in the Library. Recently, as a result of pressure from the Deans, the Library underwent renovation, and was reopened after a few weeks.\n\nPageboy activities include grilling on The Bridge, champagne at Millikan (\"Bubbly\") to celebrate the end of quarter, and Intrahouse, in which all eight alleys in Page partake in the annual tradition of applying primer and painting edgy, humorous pictures.  The painting in between alleys 6 and 7 covers \"the fruit wall\", a favorite target for PVC-borne projectiles, particularly fruit which tend to vaporize on contact.  In addition to Intrahouse, there is the Wait Staff Initiation, and the Greased Frosh Race, in which Pageboys make liberal use of Caltech's grounds and upkeep fund by selecting a designated freshman in each alley (referred to as that alley's Greased Frosh), who is then sent running on the Beckman lawn in the effort to evade upperclassmen who are trying to tackle an opposing alley's Greased Frosh before theirs is tackled.  Pageboys then rinse themselves in Gene Pool, producing a visible Crisco and lard film on the surface.  Until 2003, they first rinsed in Millikan Pond, but the location has changed owing to administrative request, and now all the Pageboys rinse off completely in the Fleming showers.\n\n=== Ruddock House ===\n[[File:Ruddock courtyard.jpg|thumb|300px|Ruddock courtyard in 2008.]]\n'''Ruddock House''' was constructed in 1960 in honor of Albert Billings Ruddock, then the Chairman of the Caltech Board of Trustees. Approximately 160 Caltech undergraduates are members of the House and approximately 80 reside in the House. Members of Ruddock House are nicknamed \"Rudds.\"\n\nDuring the week, student waiters serve family-style dinners in the dining room; some notable dinner traditions include the throwing of bread rolls and \"floating\" members who break dinner rules by pouring water on them. The hallways, referred to as \"alleys\" by undergraduates, are adorned with various murals including reproductions of M. C. Escher works, a Monopoly Board, Simpsons characters, and a two-story mural of an astronaut. This mural, called \"The Spaceman,\" is based on a photograph of Ed White's spacewalk during Gemini 4.  The painting was made completely by Phil Cormier ('79) in a day's worth of work.  A few years later Rusty Schweickart, Jr. (whose [[Rusty Schweickart|father]] walked in space on [[Apollo 9]]) was elected house president.  Another Rudd connected to the space program is Phillip Engelauf ('78), who later became a flight director at JSC.\n\nOther Rudds include [[Bill T. Gross|Bill Gross]] of [[idealab|idealab!]], MIT's [[Peter Shor]]  (1981) \u2013 applied mathematician best known for [[Shor's algorithm]] in [[quantum computation]], and Nobel Prize recipients [[Eric Betzig]] (Chemistry 2014) and [[Michael Rosbash]] (Physiology/Medicine 2017).\n\n==== OPI ====\nAfter the end of a campus-wide undergraduate party tradition, Interhouse, Ruddock began the tradition of OPI. OPI, standing for either \"Our Private Interhouse\" or \"(Our) Own Private Interhouse,\" traditionally occurs during the winter term of the academic year. One of the most notable aspects of the OPI is the amount of time and effort put into construction and artwork for the sets of the party. The past decade's preparations have included a Mayan temple, Roman Colosseum, skylines of Tokyo, a giant Egyptian pyramid, a 16' tall windmill and 20' tall elephant statue from Moulin Rouge, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and a Gothic Cathedral with 32' tall facades.\n\n== Avery House ==\n[[File:Avery House Caltech 2010.jpg|thumb|300px|Avery in 2010]]\n'''Avery House''' is part of the housing system at the California Institute of Technology, participating in Rotation and housing [[undergraduate]]s, yearlong exchange students, [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]], and visiting guests. Avery's members are called \"Averites.\" \n\nFounded in 1991, Avery had previously only housed upperclass students, graduate students, and faculty, but by a 10-to-1 vote in May 2004, the Faculty Board approved the decision to make Avery open to incoming freshmen on a two-year experimental basis. Since the 2005\u20132006 school year, Avery has been part of the Rotation process and houses incoming freshman. \n\nSome recent traditions include Team Gotcha (Assassins using water guns), an Iron Chef competition, and a Faculty Dessert Night with an open talent show. Avery House most definitely participates in Interhouse Sports, holds an annual Interhouse party, and organizes annual ski trips, beach trips, and BBQs. In line with its historical position as an alternative option to the House system, Avery embraces an accepting mindset whereby anyone who wants to become an Avery member only needs to attain ten signatures from Avery members who are living in the house or have lived there previously.\n\nAvery enjoys an environment of faculty families. The Faculty in Residence (FiRs) are chosen by the students in an interview and discussion process and the faculty are provided budget to hold social events for the undergraduates of the house. Events held by faculty include Super Bowl parties and casual dinners.\n\nIn both physical size and bedspaces, Avery House is noticeably larger than the other Houses, housing almost twice as many undergraduates as other Houses. Avery House has several facilities, including a dining hall with a large kitchen, a conference room, a piano room (Gary Lorden Recreation Room), a library, a garden, and a basement garage. The dining hall, library, and conference room are available to the Caltech community for official events after approval by the Avery ExComm or reservation via the Housing website. Avery also holds a number of \u201coff-campus\u201d spots, which are physically in the house but can be chosen by any undergraduate participating in the off-campus lottery. Finally, owing to a policy said to have been put in place by R. Stanton Avery himself {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, Avery members are not allowed to place anything \"nonremovable\" on the walls, though the true origins of this policy are unclear. As a result, murals are painted on canvas and hung up on bulletin boards, instead of painted on the walls directly.\n\n== Bechtel Residence ==\nThe Bechtel residence started construction in late 2016, and began housing undergraduates in Fall 2018. It is by far the largest housing option on campus, at over 200 beds. However, it is not a House, lacking the self-determining political systems, defined membership, and collection of dues like those of the existing 8 houses. Bechtel additionally has apartments for various live-in staff and faculty, specifically a professional staff member called a residential life coordinator, six graduate students employed as [[Resident assistant | Residential Associates (RAs)]], and two faculty-in-residence. <ref>{{cite web|title=Bechtel Residence|url=http://www.dandc.caltech.edu/_projects/complete-capital-projects/bechtel-residence=Caltech Design and Construction|accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Other \"off-campus\" housing ==\n\nCaltech-owned housing that is not part of any of the eight Houses is known as \"off-campus\" housing, even if it is actually physically located on the Caltech campus (non-Caltech owned housing is called \"off-off-campus\" or \"off-squared\").  These housing units do not maintain memberships or have the community or traditions that the other Houses have.  Off-campus housing besides Bechtel currently consists of Marks house and Braun house. Freshmen will not rotate into these. Historically, before the advent of Bechtel, they included Del Mar apartments, Chester apartments, and a number of \"Off-Campus Alleys\" (OCAs) nicknamed e.g. Batcave, Fort Knight, Hazard, Munth, ROCAs, and Watchtower.

Like a residential college, a House embodies two closely connected concepts; it serves as both a physical building where a majority of its members reside and as the center of social activity for its members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://turli.caltech.edu/reports/TURLIFinalReport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128004211/http://turli.caltech.edu/reports/TURLIFinalReport.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-28 }} Caltech Task Force on Undergraduate Residence Life Initiatives, Background Section</ref>\n\nThe Houses resemble [[fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] at other American universities in the shared loyalties they engender.

As a result, Avery was not initially considered part of the House System, and freshmen were not allowed to live there.  In the 2003&ndash;2004 school year, the Avery Council (the student government of Avery House) campaigned for Avery to participate in Rotation and take freshmen.  This change was opposed by the Caltech undergraduate student body by a five-to-one margin, but the Faculty Board voted overwhelmingly to approve the change.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bartz|first=Kevin|title=Faculty Board agrees with SHC proposal|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/1912/|accessdate=13 November 2011|newspaper=The California Tech|date=17 May 2004|location=Pasadena, CA|page=1|quote=Nearly 60 house demonstrators convened near Millikan Library last Monday to protest the measure, but it wasn't enough to stop the Faculty Board from approving the Student Housing Committee's recommendation opening Avery House to freshmen in 2005 by a resounding 14-1 vote....

Her two-minute address to the board stressed a recent IHC survey showing undergraduates opposed to the measure by a five-to-one margin, underlining opponents' fears that an Avery with freshmen would be lost as an unaffiliated option for students dissatisfied with the seven on-campus houses.}}</ref>  Beginning in the 2005&ndash;2006 school year, [[Student#First year|freshmen]] began to rotate into Avery, changing its status to a fully represented House.\n\nAlso in 2005, work began on a major renovation project for the aging South Houses, whose residents were relocated to a temporary modular housing complex. The renovations were completed at the beginning of the 2007 calendar year.  Students moved back into the South Houses on 15 December 2006, though construction continued through the beginning of 2007.\n\nLike most of the older buildings on campus, Avery House and the South Houses are in [[Mission Revival Style architecture|California Mission]] style, and resemble [[cloister]]ed [[Abbey|monasteries]] with enclosed courtyards; the North Houses are of [[Modernism|Modern]] design.\n\n== House memberships ==\nThere are two ways to gain membership in a House: Rotate in at the beginning of one's freshman year and become a full member, or become a social or full member afterwards.  Procedures for admitting new members vary depending upon House bylaws and type of membership.\n\n=== Rotation ===\nRotation is the process by which incoming freshmen choose (and are chosen by) the House they will be affiliated with.  In Caltech parlance, freshmen are called \"frosh\" and are referred to as \"prefrosh\" until the revelation of their house affiliation at the end of Rotation.  Upon first arriving at Caltech, the incoming freshmen are given a random room assignment in a random House that is different from their Prefrosh Weekend assignment, and then spend a week eating mainly dinner and dessert in all of the Houses, getting an opportunity to meet people in all of the Houses.\n\nThese meals and meetings are an opportunity both for the prefrosh to get to know the feel of the different houses and for the upperclassmen to meet and rate the prefrosh so both can see where they might belong.  Many Houses also show house-made videos to the prefrosh, which yield the prefrosh additional information about the various personalities of the Houses.  At the end of this week, the frosh rate each of the 8 Houses in order of preference. Based on this, and the opinions of the Houses' existing members, the prefrosh are placed into a House which will be their home physically and socially for the next few years. The InterHouse Committee attempts to ensure a certain level of secrecy regarding the exact process, so that the confidentiality of both the freshmen, and those involved with their final housing assignments, is maintained.<ref name=\"IHC\"/>  Also, the selection process is constrained:  there are only a limited number of openings in each House, and it is impossible to simultaneously meet the preferences of all of the Freshmen and Houses.\n\nDespite the constraints, this two-way selection process of joining a House, and social interaction after joining, gives each House a distinctive personality that is stable over decades{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.\n\n=== Later membership ===\nThere is a second way to obtain membership in a House: to apply at some point after Rotation. The process varies from House to House, but in general one makes an announcement at dinner to the effect of \"I would like to be a member of Booty House,\" and the House conducts a vote (the nature of the vote, again, varying). (\"Booty House\" is commonly used to refer to any unspecified House, and appears as the house named in examples of Rotation Rules violations.<ref name=\"IHC\"/>) All Houses except Ricketts have two tiers of memberships: Full members and social members.\n\nAnyone who rotates into a House is automatically a full member; individuals who would like to become members afterward can choose between full and social membership. The relative difficulties in attaining full and social memberships differ from House to House, as do the relative privileges that each membership type affords. The only universal truths are that full membership is harder to attain than social and that full members may live in House-associated property while social members may not. Generally speaking, social members are able to attend all House social events (ski trips, hikes, etc.).\n\n== List of the Houses ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! House !! Members !! Color (#hex) !!

Blacker House#Robert .26 Nellie Blacker|Robert Roe Blacker]], a trustee of Caltech. Members of Blacker House are referred to as ''Moles.''\n\nOne of the traditions of Blacker House is the ''Hellride.''  In a defiant response to the prohibition against playing [[Ride of the Valkyries]], the freshmen living in a part of the House named Hell (so called for its unbearable heat in the summer and cramped quarters) would announce a Hellride.  They then barricade the hallway and play The Ride at high volume, daring the upperclassmen to break in and drag everyone to be drenched in the showers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdbg.org/|title=This is Blacker Hovse|website=www.gdbg.org}}</ref>\n\nBlacker House features halls painted as Heaven and Hell, as well as a small lounge and kitchenette in between them known as Purgatory.  Blacker's [[courtyard]] formerly featured a habitable treehouse and a giant tire swing, but the tree that bore them was cut down during renovations of the house in the 2005\u20132006 academic year. Attached to another tree is now a wooden swing, and to another side of the courtyard are two couch swings.\n\n[[File:Blacker Hovse slogan on Mars.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Blacker House slogan '''\u03b3\u03b4\u03b2\u03b3''' mysteriously appears on a camera calibration target on NASA's [[Mars Science Laboratory|Curiosity rover]].

One time, security went inside the elevator looking for the students, who were on top of the elevator.  The security muttered, \"God Damn Blacker Gang\", and the phrase stuck.  Blacker students began signing GDBG or \u03b3\u03b4\u03b2\u03b3 on all their pranks. Blacker has also been referred to as the ''Hovse of Fucking Geniuses'' and the inscription ''HOFG'' can be found throughout the tunnels along with ''\u03b3\u03b4\u03b2\u03b3''. In the 1960s the hovse slogan was \"Blacker Hovse for gracious living\" which became \"The Hovse of Gracious Living\" by the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blacker.caltech.edu/|title=Home - Blacker|website=blacker.caltech.edu}}</ref>\n\nNotable alumni include:\n\n* [[William Shockley]] (1932) co-inventor of the [[transistor]] and Nobel laureate\n* [[Walter Munk]] (1939) oceanographer who determined the reason for the moon's [[tidal locking]] with earth\n* [[Carver Mead]] (1956) a key pioneer of modern [[microelectronics]]\n* [[Kip Thorne]] (1962) Nobel Laureate and one of the world's leading experts on the astrophysical implications of Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]], Richard P.

Members of Dabney House are referred to as ''Darbs,'' a combination of the name of the House with a 1920s slang term ''darb,'' meaning something or someone very handsome, valuable, attractive, or otherwise excellent.<ref>dab, darb.

Dabney Hall of the Humanities, a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Dabney, is one of the four corner buildings of Caltech's central courtyard. It was built in 1927.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn 1928, the Dabneys gave $200,000 to build Dabney House, one of four new residence halls.\n\nDabney House, as part of the single building that makes up the four \"South Houses,\" was constructed in 1930 and 1931.  It was known as the House of Gentlemen and the House of Captains, but underwent a dramatic change in personality during the 1960s.  In 1973, the House was disowned by the Dabney family when students from Dabney House protested then-President Nixon's role in the Watergate affair with a sign on the library bearing the phrase  \"Impeach [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]].\"\n\n[[Image:Dabney-minimalist-vector.svg|thumb|175px|right|The \"minimalist coat-of-arms\" of Dabney House, designed by old Darb Kaihsu Tai in the late 1990s, based on the Dabney family coat-of-arms.<ref name=\"BelletJaquelin1907\">{{cite book|last1=Bellet|first1=Louise Pecquet du|last2=Jaquelin|first2=Edward|last3=Jaquelin|first3=Martha Cary|title=Some prominent Virginia families|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iQSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA87|accessdate=11 March 2011|year=1907|publisher=J.P. Bell company (inc.)|page=87}}</ref>]]\nTraditionally standing for \"Dabney Eats It,\" referring to a particularly unpalatable plate of noodles in the 1950s, the trigraph DEI has come to be a badge of pride for Darbs.  Besides naming the house's recreation room after it and spreading it all across campus, Dabney alumni have made DEI a hidden code in the outside world.  The letters can be seen in movies (most notably ''[[Real Genius]]'') and video games (including ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City|GTA: Vice City]]'' and several [[Intellivision]] games).  There are even stories of the trigraph making its way into space on JPL [[space probe|probe]]s including the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] space craft, and being written on the Moon by astronaut Darb [[Harrison Schmitt]].  In the late 1960s, during on-campus shooting of an episode of the TV series [[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]], students stenciled the cryptic letters \"DEI\" high on a wall in a steam (utility) tunnel scheduled to be filmed the next day. The marking was subsequently visible on national television behind [[Peter Lupus]] as he paused in one shot, unaware of this Caltech contribution to spy drama.\n\nMore recently, Dabney started the Student Coffee House, or \"Chouse\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/2011/04/sfc-and-mannion-food.html|title=SFC and Mannion Food! *|website=Caltech}}</ref> and provided the majority of the staff for a couple years. Since then, Coffee House has become a part of Caltech's Dining Services and is now managed by CDS.  Dabney hosts the annual Millikan Pumpkin Drop Experiment (a parody of the [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Millikan]] [[oil-drop experiment]]) where pumpkins frozen in liquid nitrogen are dropped from Millikan library. This tradition was featured on the TV show [[Numb3rs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/10/27/numb3rs-robin-hood/|title=TV - Latest Recaps, Best Shows To Watch|website=www.tvsquad.com}}</ref> Dabney also hosts Drop Day, a party held the Saturday after the second term drop day to celebrate the point of no return, and Dabney Metal Night, an opportunity for the amateur bands of Caltech to play for the crowd.\n\nWhile the traditional motto of Dabney House (Fidelis et gratus \"Faithfulness and thankfulness\") still stands on the Dabney crest, Dabney House has instituted a new, changeable motto. In line with Caltech's tradition of wall murals and wall writings, any member may change the house motto by striking the previous motto on a designated motto wall and writing a new one.\n\n=== Fleming House ===\n[[File:Fleming courtyard.jpg|thumb|300px|Fleming courtyard in 2008]]\n'''Fleming House''' was built with funds donated by a number of people, and the name Fleming was chosen to honor [[Arthur H. Fleming]], then the chairman of Caltech's Board of Trustees.\n\nMembers of Fleming House are called ''Flems.'' The house color is red. The motto, from the crest as commonly seen on house beer steins, is \"Let the Deed Shaw.\"<ref>\"Let the Deed Shaw\", archaic for \"Let the Deed Show\", is also the motto for [[Fleming College]], in [[Peterborough, Ontario]].  The crest and motto derive from the noble [[Earl of Wigtown|House of Fleming]] of [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]].</ref>  The house battle cry is \"Go Big Red!\"  Another important maxim is \"Flems stick together!\", as well as the slogan \"Where men are men, giants walk the earth, and the thundering herd is real\".  Historically, Fleming House did not offer social memberships (nominally citing all non-Fleming undergraduates as \"social members\"), but a recent decision by the house leadership changed this long-standing policy. Students may now apply for and obtain Fleming House social membership.\n\nThe physical layout of Fleming House includes rooms numbered 8.5 (formerly the RA apartment, now a triple) and [[pi|\u03c0]].  The Interhouse Trophy, awarded to the winner of the Interhouse Athletic Competitions, has been awarded to Fleming for the past five years.\n\nFor the past few years, Fleming and Page House have pranked each other regularly and included each other in initiations.\n\n==== Fleming Cannon ====\n[[File:Caltech cannon.jpg|thumb|left|The Fleming Cannon in June 2007]]\n\nThe Fleming Cannon, a Caltech landmark, rests on its wheels on the Olive Walk in front of Fleming.  As it makes a very loud noise when fired, it is fired to mark important events, such as the end of rotation, Ditch Day, the end of the term, and graduation.  It was originally cast for use in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] but eventually found its way to the then-military themed [[Southwestern Academy]] in [[San Marino, California]], where it remained on the front lawn between 1925 and 1972.\n\nIn 1972 Fleming class officers got permission from Southwestern Academy to take the cannon, but the underclassmen who mounted new wheels on it and dragged it to campus at night thought they were stealing it.  It took months of paint stripping and other work to restore it to operational status. The Caltech administration ordered its return in 1975, but negotiations began for an official transfer of the cannon back to Caltech in 1980, and in 1981 it was [https://web.archive.org/web/20110717032549/http://www.flemingcannon.com/history.html returned] on a permanent basis to the Caltech campus.\n\nThe cannon was stolen by [[Harvey Mudd College|Harvey Mudd]] students in 1986 ([http://people.bu.edu/fmri/somers/cannon.html as detailed in this article]). At the demands of both college administrations, the Cannon was returned to Fleming House approximately 8 weeks after the prank.\n\nIt was rumored that Harvey Mudd would attempt to steal the cannon again in 2006 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their original theft; however, the cannon disappeared on March 28, a day before the anniversary, only to show up at [[MIT]], just in time for Campus Preview Weekend, during which many rising freshmen visit MIT.  A (seemingly fake) moving company by the name of [http://www.howeandser.com/ Howe & Ser Moving Co.] has taken credit. (The name is a double [[pun]]: When substituting \"and\" for the [[ampersand]], it reads \"how we answer\", while substituting the [[Latin]] ''[[Grammatical conjunction|et]]'' for the ampersand gives \"[[Howitzer]]\".)  Displayed prominently in front of MIT's [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]], the Fleming Cannon sported a giant, gold-plated [[MIT class ring]] around its barrel.\n\nA day after the prank was disclosed, Fleming's members began planning a recovery operation on the night of April 7. They immediately sent twenty-three members to Boston to retrieve their cannon. The Flems were greeted at MIT by a group of students and police who watched as the cannon was loaded into a truck. Afterward, a friendly barbecue celebrated the event.\n\n==== Notable Flems ====\n* [[George O.

D. Ricketts]]. Members of Ricketts House are called Skurves (or Scurves) due to a play on the similarity of the name Ricketts to the disease [[rickets]] and the fact that [[scurvy]] is another vitamin deficiency disease.  Members of Ricketts Hovse were known as ''Rowdies'' until about 1960; alumni of that period still draw the distinction between ''Rowdies'' and ''Skurves''.  \n\nRicketts traditions include fire related activities and the brakedrum.  Prior to early 2003, the Ricketts courtyard housed a large concrete firepot, in which massive fires were often enjoyed during cool Pasadena evenings.  The courtyard originally featured a large Italian marble well head (historically attributed to and named \"Millikan's Pot\"). It was used as a measure for height of serves in the singles and doubles games of four square played in the courtyard.  By the mid-1970s, it existed only as chunks of rubble, after destruction in an experiment in more exciting pot fires allegedly involving newspaper, xylene, and matches.  Around that time, enterprising house officers arranged for its replacement with a large section of concrete sewer pipe, which was eventually replaced with a concrete facsimile of the original pot.  Due to tightening of Pasadena fire codes and the Caltech administration's recent focus on liability concerns, the firepot was removed.  A portable fireplace temporarily replaced the firepot.  The brakedrum is a contest between the freshman class and the sophomore class over ownership of the brakedrum.\n\nRicketts House was known for athletics and student government in the 1950s, but soon after that they became known less for these activities and more for activities that pushed the motto \"Take me as I am\" to the limit. Recently, Ricketts had an inverted [[pentagram]] on the front wall of its dining room.  Administration members called for its removal as it was a symbol that may have offended the general public who viewed the house during tours. The pentagram was originally painted in the dining hall for the Interhouse party of 1989 - prior to this time this symbol had no particular connection to Ricketts House. In later years the inverted pentagram was added to the Ricketts House crest (the original had had ship's wheels instead of pentagrams). During the renovations from 2004 to 2006, the mural was painted over, and a new mural policy was put in place. Conflicts regarding the new mural policy continued until the early 2010s, when the policy was relaxed. The House features a number of murals, including one featuring the cover art of the [[Grateful Dead]]'s eponymous [[Grateful Dead (album) | album]] that was painted in the 1970s. Today the house hosts a number of social events throughout the year, including a termly open mic night, featuring music performances by students, a termly formal dinner, and an interhouse party known as Apache. \n\nThe building has space for approximately 70 students, while the house had a total membership of about 110 at commencement in 2019. Two graduate student resident associates live in apartments in the house.\n\nRicketts remains the only house not to offer social membership. A [[referendum]] to add social membership in 2018 was defeated by  vote of 16 in favour, 43 against, and 3 abstentions.\n\n====Notable Skurves and Rowdies====\n* Carl V.

The North Houses were constructed in 1960 with funds provided by the Lloyd Foundation and other donors. Lloyd House was named in memory of Mr. Ralph B. Lloyd and his wife, Mrs. Lulu Hull Lloyd.  Mr. Lloyd was a member of the Board of Trustees of Caltech, 1939\u20131952.\nMembers of Lloyd House are called Lloydies. The house color is gold, and its motto is \"I live and die for those I love\", popularly corrupted by mis-reading the banner as \"I live for those I love and die.\"\n\nLloyd House is governed by a student-elected, student-run Executive Committee, or \"Excomm,\" of 9\u201310 members: President, Secretary, Superintendent, Treasurer, Social Director(s), Athletic Manager, and 3 representatives at large.  The Social Director(s) and Athletic Manager are aided by the Social Team and the Athletic Team.  There are 7 Upperclass Counselors (UCCs) and various appointed positions, such as Librarian, Fridgemaster, and Pool Monkey.  Traditional house events include a meet-the-frosh Ultimate Egg competition (in which Ultimate Frisbee is played using eggs), Airband, and Beach Trip (for which some members bike, roller blade, longboard, walk, or even run 42 miles from Caltech to Huntington Beach).\n\nLloyd House is located along the Olive Walk, and is an \"L\"-shaped, two-story building.  At the intersection of the two branches of the house are \"Lower Crotch\" and \"Upper Crotch,\" which serve as communal lounge areas.\n\nLloyd is divided into seven alleys: Purple, Kaos, VI ([[Virgin Islands]]), [[Fingal's Cave]], [[Valhalla]], Inferno, and Tropic.  Each alley is decorated with theme-appropriate [[mural]]s.  Some murals include the expansive Purple mural in the theme of Japanese [[tsunami]] waves, the [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] mural in Kaos, the tropical mural in VI, the \"Enjoy [[Crack cocaine|Crack]]\" mural in Inferno that mocks the [[Coca-Cola]] slogan and contains a reference to [[Alan Moore]]'s graphic novel ''[[Watchmen]]'', and the Lloyd Dragon in Fingal's.  Several of the names have been changes since the 1970s when the names were:  Headquarters (now purple), Penthouse (now Kaos), Virgin Islands, Cave (though Fingal still lived in this alley), Valhalla, Inferno and Creek (now Tropic).  At this time the alleys were mostly painted solid colors with some minimal designs and pictures (including flames on the walls of Inferno).\n\nThe \"shed\" used to be a stand-alone building in the courtyard that housed Lloyd's big screen TV. Now the \"shed\" exists indoors, in a room adjacent to Valhalla that used to be part of the MOSH's office.\n\nIn the 1980s, Lloyd had two off-campus alleys, one named \"The Place\" and one named \"Corona\" (in reference to the corona of the sun as a metaphor for the outer reaches of Lloyd).  The Place used to exist on the corner of Michigan Ave and Lura St; it was removed around 1988 and is now a parking lot. Corona used to be on the east side of Holliston Ave; it was removed in 1992 and the location is now the new parking structure.  Because of Pasadena preservation laws, both houses were moved to other places in Pasadena.  The Corona house was donated to a minister (for free) who restored it at 1792 Newport Ave, Pasadena, CA. The house is no longer owned by the minister, but it still exists.\n\nAround 1990, in exchange for the loss of Corona, Lloyd adopted \"the Quads\" alley at 232, 234, and 236 Chester Ave.  (The 232 and 234 addresses were still affiliated with Lloyd House until the opening of the Bechtel Residence, after which they became housing for graduate students)\n\n====Lloydies====\n[http://cripplingdepression.com/ Crippling Depression], a satirical [[comic strip]] that was published regularly in the California Tech, the student newspaper, was drawn and written by Lloydies.\n\nIn the past, some Lloydies have pulled elaborate pranks.  The [[Great Rose Bowl Hoax|prank of the 1961 Rose Bowl]] was pulled off by the \"Fiendish Fourteen,\" members of Lloyd House.  Flashcards that were intended to cheer for the Washington Huskies football team were changed to read Caltech.  The Hollywood sign was changed to read \"Caltech\" in 1987 by a group of Pageboys and Lloydies.\n\nEvery year since 1994, Lloydies have climbed onto the top of Millikan Library to construct the Lloyd Christmas Tree, a monumental structure of numerous Christmas lights strung together to resemble a 10-story Christmas tree topped with a 12-feet-tall \"L.\"  During the big wind storm of 2013, the L broke apart into pieces, so the Lloydies rebuilt the \"L\", but replaced it instead with a double \"L\" that is now 16-feet-tall. In 2018, neighbors and the city of Pasadena filed a complaint, as the Lloyd Christmas tree was a religious symbol. The tree is now referred to as the \"Lloyd Lights\".  The latest off-campus pranks have been the pranking of MIT's Campus Preview Weekend, which included many Lloydies.\n\nA folklore that has been passed down throughout the years is that of the Purple LSD lab.  It has been said that sometime in the 1970s, a group of [[chemistry]] majors living in Purple blocked off some of the alley for a special project.  The product of their project, was dubbed \"Lloyd-grade\" LSD, to denote its extraordinary purity. The rumor goes that it was one of the largest sources of LSD at the time.  Nearly the entire senior class was expelled when the [[FBI]] invaded the house (only three seniors are mentioned in the yearbook from 1970), though folklore also holds that the perpetrators escaped capture, leaving only a teasing banner for the invaders reading \"Welcome, FBI!\"\n\nNotable former Lloydies include:\n\n* [[Cleve Moler]] (1961) \u2013 inventor of Matlab and one of the original Lloydies (having been \"transferred\" there from Ricketts House)\n* [[Douglas Osheroff]] (1967) \u2013 Nobel Prize in Physics (1996) for discovery of superfluidity in Helium-3\n* [[Steven E. Koonin]] (1972) - physicist, Caltech Provost, United States Under Secretary of Energy for Science\n* [[David Brin]] (1973) \u2013 astronomer and science-fiction writer\n* [[Richard F.

Bus]] (1979) \u2013 astronomer\n* [[AdSense#History|Adam Weissman]] (1990) \u2013 co-founder of Applied Semantics, which was bought by Google and became [[AdSense]]\n* [[AdSense#History|Gil Elbaz]] (1991) \u2013 co-founder of Applied Semantics\n* [[Adam D'Angelo]] (2006) \u2013 founder of [[Quora (website)|Quora]] and early Facebook CTO\n\n=== Page House ===\n[[File:Page House Caltech 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|Page courtyard in 2009]]\n\nUpon the arrival of the North Houses in the 1960s, members of Ricketts house splintered off to populate the newly constructed Page House.  Members of the house are known as Pageboys (even the women), and the house crest includes the \"mechanical horse\" with a banner reading ''spe labor levis'', a Latin [[idiom]] meaning \"May the work be light\" (and is often followed by \"And the drinks be heavy\").  House construction was funded by J.R. Page, former vice president of the First National Bank in Los Angeles, and chairman of the Caltech board of trustees from 1943 to 1954.  One of the largest houses, Page has been home to KCAL, the Interhouse Roller Coaster.  It also used its access to the basement so that Pageboys could cover the concrete with dry ice, a prank copied in the movie [[Real Genius]].\n\nIn response to other houses quixotically claiming certain items to be off-limits in regard to pranks (rendering them \"Non-RF-able\"), the Page House president at the time named that the President be unprankable as well. In the past, there were two items in Page House that could not be the target of pranks: the pool table felt and a poster of President Nixon that is passed on to each House President shortly after s/he is elected.\n\nAll student rooms in Page are designed as doubles; however, when vacancies arise, upperclassmen may live in rooms as singles.  According to house bylaws, the newly elected Page House president may choose to reside in any room as a single. The FU, across from the Library, is Page House's entertainment room, complete with dozens of bean bags.  Its name originates from a Ditch Day stack in which the resident graduating senior and president painted a large \"F\" on its door. Rather than painting over it, Pageboys simply painted a \"U\" below it. The FU was formerly a triple, and before that was the RA apartment, which is now located downstairs. The Library itself is important to Page House culture, and although its collection is always being removed to be recycled elsewhere, its contents are meant to reflect the works and contributions of contemporary Pageboys.  Owing to its distinguished status, one must wear shoes while in the Library. Recently, as a result of pressure from the Deans, the Library underwent renovation, and was reopened after a few weeks.\n\nPageboy activities include grilling on The Bridge, champagne at Millikan (\"Bubbly\") to celebrate the end of quarter, and Intrahouse, in which all eight alleys in Page partake in the annual tradition of applying primer and painting edgy, humorous pictures.  The painting in between alleys 6 and 7 covers \"the fruit wall\", a favorite target for PVC-borne projectiles, particularly fruit which tend to vaporize on contact.  In addition to Intrahouse, there is the Wait Staff Initiation, and the Greased Frosh Race, in which Pageboys make liberal use of Caltech's grounds and upkeep fund by selecting a designated freshman in each alley (referred to as that alley's Greased Frosh), who is then sent running on the Beckman lawn in the effort to evade upperclassmen who are trying to tackle an opposing alley's Greased Frosh before theirs is tackled.  Pageboys then rinse themselves in Gene Pool, producing a visible Crisco and lard film on the surface.  Until 2003, they first rinsed in Millikan Pond, but the location has changed owing to administrative request, and now all the Pageboys rinse off completely in the Fleming showers.\n\n=== Ruddock House ===\n[[File:Ruddock courtyard.jpg|thumb|300px|Ruddock courtyard in 2008.]]\n'''Ruddock House''' was constructed in 1960 in honor of Albert Billings Ruddock, then the Chairman of the Caltech Board of Trustees. Approximately 160 Caltech undergraduates are members of the House and approximately 80 reside in the House. Members of Ruddock House are nicknamed \"Rudds.\"\n\nDuring the week, student waiters serve family-style dinners in the dining room; some notable dinner traditions include the throwing of bread rolls and \"floating\" members who break dinner rules by pouring water on them. The hallways, referred to as \"alleys\" by undergraduates, are adorned with various murals including reproductions of M. C. Escher works, a Monopoly Board, Simpsons characters, and a two-story mural of an astronaut. This mural, called \"The Spaceman,\" is based on a photograph of Ed White's spacewalk during Gemini 4.  The painting was made completely by Phil Cormier ('79) in a day's worth of work.  A few years later Rusty Schweickart, Jr. (whose [[Rusty Schweickart|father]] walked in space on [[Apollo 9]]) was elected house president.  Another Rudd connected to the space program is Phillip Engelauf ('78), who later became a flight director at JSC.\n\nOther Rudds include [[Bill T. Gross|Bill Gross]] of [[idealab|idealab!]], MIT's [[Peter Shor]]  (1981) \u2013 applied mathematician best known for [[Shor's algorithm]] in [[quantum computation]], and Nobel Prize recipients [[Eric Betzig]] (Chemistry 2014) and [[Michael Rosbash]] (Physiology/Medicine 2017).\n\n==== OPI ====\nAfter the end of a campus-wide undergraduate party tradition, Interhouse, Ruddock began the tradition of OPI. OPI, standing for either \"Our Private Interhouse\" or \"(Our) Own Private Interhouse,\" traditionally occurs during the winter term of the academic year. One of the most notable aspects of the OPI is the amount of time and effort put into construction and artwork for the sets of the party. The past decade's preparations have included a Mayan temple, Roman Colosseum, skylines of Tokyo, a giant Egyptian pyramid, a 16' tall windmill and 20' tall elephant statue from Moulin Rouge, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and a Gothic Cathedral with 32' tall facades.\n\n== Avery House ==\n[[File:Avery House Caltech 2010.jpg|thumb|300px|Avery in 2010]]\n'''Avery House''' is part of the housing system at the California Institute of Technology, participating in Rotation and housing [[undergraduate]]s, yearlong exchange students, [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]], and visiting guests. Avery's members are called \"Averites.\" \n\nFounded in 1991, Avery had previously only housed upperclass students, graduate students, and faculty, but by a 10-to-1 vote in May 2004, the Faculty Board approved the decision to make Avery open to incoming freshmen on a two-year experimental basis. Since the 2005\u20132006 school year, Avery has been part of the Rotation process and houses incoming freshman. \n\nSome recent traditions include Team Gotcha (Assassins using water guns), an Iron Chef competition, and a Faculty Dessert Night with an open talent show. Avery House most definitely participates in Interhouse Sports, holds an annual Interhouse party, and organizes annual ski trips, beach trips, and BBQs. In line with its historical position as an alternative option to the House system, Avery embraces an accepting mindset whereby anyone who wants to become an Avery member only needs to attain ten signatures from Avery members who are living in the house or have lived there previously.\n\nAvery enjoys an environment of faculty families. The Faculty in Residence (FiRs) are chosen by the students in an interview and discussion process and the faculty are provided budget to hold social events for the undergraduates of the house. Events held by faculty include Super Bowl parties and casual dinners.\n\nIn both physical size and bedspaces, Avery House is noticeably larger than the other Houses, housing almost twice as many undergraduates as other Houses. Avery House has several facilities, including a dining hall with a large kitchen, a conference room, a piano room (Gary Lorden Recreation Room), a library, a garden, and a basement garage. The dining hall, library, and conference room are available to the Caltech community for official events after approval by the Avery ExComm or reservation via the Housing website. Avery also holds a number of \u201coff-campus\u201d spots, which are physically in the house but can be chosen by any undergraduate participating in the off-campus lottery. Finally, owing to a policy said to have been put in place by R. Stanton Avery himself {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, Avery members are not allowed to place anything \"nonremovable\" on the walls, though the true origins of this policy are unclear. As a result, murals are painted on canvas and hung up on bulletin boards, instead of painted on the walls directly.\n\n== Bechtel Residence ==\nThe Bechtel residence started construction in late 2016, and began housing undergraduates in Fall 2018. It is by far the largest housing option on campus, at over 200 beds. However, it is not a House, lacking the self-determining political systems, defined membership, and collection of dues like those of the existing 8 houses. Bechtel additionally has apartments for various live-in staff and faculty, specifically a professional staff member called a residential life coordinator, six graduate students employed as [[Resident assistant | Residential Associates (RAs)]], and two faculty-in-residence. <ref>{{cite web|title=Bechtel Residence|url=http://www.dandc.caltech.edu/_projects/complete-capital-projects/bechtel-residence=Caltech Design and Construction|accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Other \"off-campus\" housing ==\n\nCaltech-owned housing that is not part of any of the eight Houses is known as \"off-campus\" housing, even if it is actually physically located on the Caltech campus (non-Caltech owned housing is called \"off-off-campus\" or \"off-squared\").  These housing units do not maintain memberships or have the community or traditions that the other Houses have.  Off-campus housing besides Bechtel currently consists of Marks house and Braun house. Freshmen will not rotate into these. Historically, before the advent of Bechtel, they included Del Mar apartments, Chester apartments, and a number of \"Off-Campus Alleys\" (OCAs) nicknamed e.g. Batcave, Fort Knight, Hazard, Munth, ROCAs, and Watchtower. These other resources have now been re-allocated towards graduate student housing.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://ihc.caltech.edu/ the Interhouse Committee (IHC)] - committee of the presidents of the Houses; plans and supervises Rotation, inter-House sports and activities, and works closely with Housing and some Faculty Board committees as the representative of the undergraduate body\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070206153940/http://www.housing.caltech.edu/undergrad/ Caltech Undergraduate Housing] - from the Institute's Housing Department\n*[http://donut.caltech.edu/w/images/7/7e/Jou02Houses.pdf  A History of Undergraduate Self-Governance at Caltech; Part II, A History of the Undergraduate Houses (1930-2002)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070220014447/http://turli.caltech.edu/ Task force on Undergraduate Residence Life Initiatives (TURLI) report]\n*[http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/2093/1/2010_04_06_111_18.pdf Caltech Tech article on Eco-Rotation] - Caltech is updating the Rotation process for the 2010 entering freshman class.

It is the principal city of the [[Hanford-Corcoran metropolitan area]] (MSA Code 25260), which encompasses all of Kings County, including the cities of Hanford and [[Corcoran, California|Corcoran]]. The [[ZIP Code]] is 93230 (with 93232 used for [[post office box]]es). The city of Hanford is surrounded by communities that do not fall within the city limits but share the same ZIP Code. These communities include [[Grangeville, California|Grangeville]], [[Hardwick, California|Hardwick]] and [[Home Garden, California|Home Garden]].\n\nThe population was 53,967 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

It is the principal city of the [[Hanford-Corcoran metropolitan area]] (MSA Code 25260), which encompasses all of Kings County, including the cities of Hanford and [[Corcoran, California|Corcoran]]. The [[ZIP Code]] is 93230 (with 93232 used for [[post office box]]es). The city of Hanford is surrounded by communities that do not fall within the city limits but share the same ZIP Code. These communities include [[Grangeville, California|Grangeville]], [[Hardwick, California|Hardwick]] and [[Home Garden, California|Home Garden]].\n\nThe population was 53,967 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

The area was inhabited by the Tachi [[Yokut people|Yokut]] Indians for several thousand years prior to Euro-American contact. They occupied locations along watercourses such as creeks, springs and seep areas (such as [[Slough (hydrology)|sloughs]]), along perennial and seasonal drainages, as well as flat ridges and terraces.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Hanford Mall'', Earth Metrics Inc. for the city of Hanford and State of California Clearinghouse, rpt. 10082, March 8, 1990</ref> Therefore, places along streams are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on an elevation above the seasonal flood levels. Surrounding areas were used for hunting and seed, acorn, and grass gathering.\n[[File:WS1359-10-N-Downtown-HanfordCA-1877-1.png|thumb|Hanford in 1877. Resident J.T.

Hanford's namesake was [[James Madison Hanford]], an executive for the company.

The city's first [[water supply network]] was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer [[Firefighter|fire company]] was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\n\nIn 1817, the [[Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina]] was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\n\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the [[North Carolina State House]]. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried [[gneiss]] being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new [[North Carolina State Capitol|State Capitol]] and new [[Raleigh and Gaston Railroad|Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company]] in 1840.\n\nIn 1853, the first [[North Carolina State Fair|State Fair]] was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, [[Peace College]], was established in 1857. Raleigh's [[Historic Oakwood]] contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\n\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began, Governor [[Zebulon Baird Vance]] ordered the construction of [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] around the city as protection from [[Union Army|Union]] troops. During General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman's]] [[Carolinas Campaign]], Raleigh was captured by Union [[cavalry]] under the command of General [[Hugh Judson Kilpatrick]] on April 13, 1865. As the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby [[Battle of Morrisville]].<ref name=\"The Battle of Morrisville\">{{cite web|title=The Battle of Morrisville|publisher=Ernest Dollar|url=http://www.mindspring.com/~nixnox/history2.html|accessdate=March 17, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512014502/http://www.mindspring.com/%7enixnox/history2.html|archivedate=May 12, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The city was spared significant destruction during the War.\n\nDue to the economic and social problems of the post-war period and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], with a state economy still overly based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.\n[[File:NC State Capitol 1861.jpg|thumb|right|[[North Carolina State Capitol]], c.1861; Governor [[David Settle Reid|David S.

The [[Reconstruction era]] legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedmen's Bureau]], many [[freedmen]] migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had an established free black community, more work opportunities, and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas.\n\n[[Shaw University]], the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its [[Estey Hall]] was the first building constructed for the [[higher education]] of black women, and [[Leonard Hall (Shaw University)|Leonard Medical Center]] was the first four-year [[medical school]] in the country for African Americans.\n\nIn 1867, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] clergy founded [[St. Augustine's College (Raleigh)|St. Augustine's College]] for the education of [[free negro|freedmen]]. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation's first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the [[Federal Building (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Federal Building]] in Raleigh, the first [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] project in the South following the Civil War.\n\nIn 1880, the newspapers ''News'' and ''Observer'' combined to form ''[[The News & Observer]]''. It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as [[North Carolina State University]], was founded as a [[land-grant college]] in 1887. The city's [[Rex Hospital]] opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as [[Meredith College]], opened in 1891, and in 1898, [[The Academy of Music]], a private music conservatory, was established.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. [[George Henry White]] sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on a white supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new [[State constitution (United States)|constitution]], with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the [[North Carolina Republican Party|Republican Party]] was no longer competitive in the state.\n\nIt was not until after federal [[civil rights]] legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride.

It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\n\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh]] was officially established by [[Pope Pius XI]]. The [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] became the official seat of the diocese with [[William Joseph Hafey]] as its bishop.\n\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929.

The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, [[Raleigh Memorial Auditorium]] was dedicated. The [[North Carolina Symphony]], founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] constructed the area now known as [[William B. Umstead State Park]]. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943.\n\nIn 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a [[Council\u2013manager government|council\u2013manager]] form of government, the current form.

Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman [[Clarence Lightner]] defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G.

Some of the names have become common place among locals such as the Warehouse, Fayetteville Street, and [[Glenwood South]] Districts.\n\nThe Inside the Beltline neighborhoods include [[Cameron Park Historic District|Cameron Park]], [[Boylan Heights (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Boylan Heights]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boylanheights.org/|title=Historic Boylan Heights Neighborhood Main Page|publisher=Boylanheights.org|date=|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref> Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, [[Glenwood-Brooklyn Historic District|Glenwood-Brooklyn]], [[Hayes Barton Historic District]], [[Moore Square Historic District|Moore Square]], [[Mordecai Place Historic District|Mordecai]] (home to the historic [[Mordecai House]]), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and [[Historic Oakwood]]. Inside the Beltline refers to I-440 which used to be called the Beltline before being re-branded to ease driver navigation. These neighborhoods were typically built before World War II.\n\n====Midtown Raleigh====\n[[File:Solasglenwood.jpeg|thumb|Solas Restaurant in the Glenwood South District of Raleigh]]\nMidtown Raleigh is a residential and commercial area just North of the I-440 Beltline and is part of North Raleigh. It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Creedmoor Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as [[North Hills (Raleigh)|North Hills]] and [[Crabtree Valley Mall]]. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. The ''News & Observer'' newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who birthed Midtown|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2009/09/30/117476/who-birthed-midtown.html#storylink|author=Matthew Eisley|newspaper=[[The News & Observer]]|accessdate=November 12, 2011|date=September 20, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105113548/http://www.newsobserver.com/2009/09/30/117476/who-birthed-midtown.html#storylink|archivedate=November 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area.<ref>{{cite news|title=Slideshow: Midtown Raleigh Alliance|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2011/07/25/slideshow-midtown-ralleigh-alliance.html#storylink|author=Dathan Kazsuk|newspaper=[[Triangle Business Journal]]|accessdate=April 12, 2013|date=July 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====East Raleigh====\n[[File:North Hills in Raleigh.jpg|thumb|Office towers overlooking shops and restaurants in North Hills in Midtown Raleigh 2019]]\nEast Raleigh is situated roughly from [[Capital Boulevard]] near the [[Interstate 440 (North Carolina)|I-440]] beltline to New Hope Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as [[U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina|U.S. 1]] (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road. Neighborhoods in East Raleigh include Hedingham, Longview, Lockwood, [[Madonna Acres Historic District (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Madonna Acres]], New Hope, Thompson-Hunter and Wilder's Grove. The area is bordered to the east by the town of [[Knightdale, North Carolina|Knightdale]].\n\n====West Raleigh====\n[[File:Dorton Arena.jpg|thumb|[[Dorton Arena]] in Raleigh, designed by [[Maciej Nowicki (architect)|Matthew Nowicki]]]]\nWest Raleigh lies along [[Hillsborough Street]] and Western Boulevard. The area is bordered to the west by suburban [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]]. It is home to [[North Carolina State University]], [[Meredith College]], [[Pullen Park]], [[Pullen Memorial Baptist Church]], the Islamic Association of Raleigh, [[Cameron Village]], Lake Johnson, the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]] and historic [[Saint Mary's School (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Saint Mary's School]]. Primary thoroughfares serving West Raleigh, in addition to Hillsborough Street, are Avent Ferry Road, Blue Ridge Road, and Western Boulevard. The [[PNC Arena]] is also located here adjacent to the [[North Carolina State Fairgrounds]]. These are located approximately 2 miles from [[Rex Hospital]].\n\n====North Raleigh====\nNorth Raleigh is an expansive, diverse, and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built [[subdivision (land)|subdivisions]] and along its northern fringes. The area generally falls North of Millbrook Road. It is primarily suburban with large shopping areas. Primary neighborhoods and subdivisions in North Raleigh include Bartons Creek Bluffs, Bedford, Bent Tree, Black Horse Run, Brier Creek, Brookhaven, Coachman's Trail, Crossgate, Crosswinds, Dominion Park, Durant Trails, Ethan's Glenn, Falls River, Greystone Village, Harrington Grove, Hidden Valley, Lake Park, Long Lake, North Haven, [[North Ridge Country Club|North Ridge]], Oakcroft, Shannon Woods, Six Forks Station, Springdale Estates, Stonebridge, Stone Creek, Stonehenge, Summerfield, Valley Estates, Wakefield, Weathersfield, Windsor Forest, and Wood Valley. The area is served by a number of primary transportation corridors including Glenwood Avenue [[U.S. Route 70 (North Carolina)|U.S. Route 70]], [[Interstate 540 (North Carolina)|Interstate 540]], Wake Forest Road, Millbrook Road, Lynn Road, Six Forks Road, Spring Forest Road, [[Creedmoor Road]], Leesville Road, Norwood Road, Strickland Road, and North Hills Drive.\n\n====South Raleigh====\nSouth Raleigh is located along [[U.S. Route 401 (North Carolina)|U.S. 401]] south toward [[Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina|Fuquay-Varina]] and along [[U.S. Route 70 in North Carolina|US 70]] into suburban [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]]. This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the [[Swift Creek Township, Wake County, North Carolina|Swift Creek]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], to the east by [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]], to the southwest by [[Holly Springs, North Carolina|Holly Springs]] and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke, and Enchanted Oaks.\n\n====Southeast Raleigh====\nSoutheast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]] on the southwest, and rural [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]] to the southeast. The area includes areas along Rock Quarry Road, Poole Road, and New Bern Avenue. Primary neighborhoods include Chastain, Chavis Heights, Raleigh Country Club, Southgate, Kingwood Forest, Rochester Heights, Emerald Village and Biltmore Hills. [[Coastal Credit Union Music Park]] (formerly Time Warner Cable Music Pavilion, Alltel Pavilion and Walnut Creek Amphitheatre) is one of the region's major outdoor concert venues and is located on Rock Quarry Road. [[Shaw University]] is located in this part of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Ducks in Fall.jpg|thumb|Ducks swimming at Durant Nature Reserve in the Fall]]Like much of the southeastern United States, Raleigh has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa''). Winters are short and generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of {{convert|41.0|\u00b0F|1}}<!--(maximum+minimum)/2, NOT the maximum-->.<ref name=\"NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)\" /> On average, there are 69&nbsp;nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7&nbsp;days that fail to rise above freezing.<ref name=\"NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)\" /> Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of {{convert|43.34|in|cm|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/raleigh/north-carolina/united-states/usnc0558|title=Climate - Raleigh - North Carolina|last=|first=|date=November 10, 2018|website=U.S. Climate Data|accessdate=November 10, 2018}}</ref> Annual and monthly (temperature and) precipitation data are in chart below. April is the driest month, with an average of {{convert|2.92|in|1}} of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of {{convert|80.0|\u00b0F|1}}<!--(maximum+minimum)/2, NOT the maximum-->.<ref name=\"NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)\" /> There are 48&nbsp;days per year with highs at or above {{convert|90|\u00b0F|0}}.<ref name=\"NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)\" /> Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316. Extremes in temperature have ranged from {{convert|\u22129|\u00b0F|0}} on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]] up to {{convert|105|\u00b0F|0}}, most recently on [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave|July 8, 2012]].  Raleigh falls in [[USDA]] [[hardiness zones]] 7b (5&nbsp;\u00b0F to 10&nbsp;\u00b0F) and 8a (10&nbsp;\u00b0F to 15&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.plantmaps.com/hardiness-zones-for-raleigh-north-carolina |title=Raleigh North Carolina USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=plantmaps.com plantmaps|accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref>[[File:Raleigh snow.jpg|thumb|Heavy snow in downtown Raleigh along [[Hillsborough Street|Hillsborough street]] 2015]]Raleigh receives an average of {{convert|6.0|in|cm|1}} of snow in winter. [[Freezing rain]] and [[Ice pellets|sleet]] also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging [[ice storm]]. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm{{spaced ndash}}{{convert|20.3|in|cm|0}}{{spaced ndash}}the [[January 25, 2000 Winter Storm|Winter Storm of January 2000]]. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of [[cold air damming]] that affects the city due to its proximity to the [[Appalachian Mountains]].  Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\n\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of [[drought]], during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience [[hurricane]]s. In 1996, [[Hurricane Fran]] caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was [[Hurricane Florence]] in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the November 28, 1988 tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated an F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale and affected northwestern portions of the city. There also was the April 16, 2011 EF3 tornado, which affected portions of downtown and northeast Raleigh and the suburb of Holly Springs.\n\n<section begin=\"weather box\" />{{Weather box |location = [[Raleigh\u2013Durham International Airport]], North Carolina (1981\u20132010 normals,{{efn|Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1981 to 2010.}} extremes 1887\u2013present{{efn|Official records for Raleigh kept January 1887 to 17 May 1944 at downtown and at Raleigh Durham Int'l since 18 May 1944.

There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] with [[light rail]] technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the [[Federal Transit Administration]] declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.\n\nThe region's two [[metropolitan planning organization]]s appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |title=Regional Transit Infrastructure Blueprint |publisher=Transitblueprint.org |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=January 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106111406/http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |archivedate=November 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Greyhound Lines]] provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.\n\n====Bicycle and pedestrian====\n*The Maine-to-Florida [[U.S. Bicycle Route#1]] routes through suburban Raleigh, along with [[North Carolina Bicycle Route 2|N.C.

The city's first [[water supply network]] was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer [[Firefighter|fire company]] was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\n\nIn 1817, the [[Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina]] was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\n\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the [[North Carolina State House]]. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried [[gneiss]] being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new [[North Carolina State Capitol|State Capitol]] and new [[Raleigh and Gaston Railroad|Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company]] in 1840.\n\nIn 1853, the first [[North Carolina State Fair|State Fair]] was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, [[Peace College]], was established in 1857. Raleigh's [[Historic Oakwood]] contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\n\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began, Governor [[Zebulon Baird Vance]] ordered the construction of [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] around the city as protection from [[Union Army|Union]] troops. During General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman's]] [[Carolinas Campaign]], Raleigh was captured by Union [[cavalry]] under the command of General [[Hugh Judson Kilpatrick]] on April 13, 1865. As the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby [[Battle of Morrisville]].<ref name=\"The Battle of Morrisville\">{{cite web|title=The Battle of Morrisville|publisher=Ernest Dollar|url=http://www.mindspring.com/~nixnox/history2.html|accessdate=March 17, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512014502/http://www.mindspring.com/%7enixnox/history2.html|archivedate=May 12, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The city was spared significant destruction during the War.\n\nDue to the economic and social problems of the post-war period and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], with a state economy still overly based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.\n[[File:NC State Capitol 1861.jpg|thumb|right|[[North Carolina State Capitol]], c.1861; Governor [[David Settle Reid|David S.

The [[Reconstruction era]] legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedmen's Bureau]], many [[freedmen]] migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had an established free black community, more work opportunities, and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas.\n\n[[Shaw University]], the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its [[Estey Hall]] was the first building constructed for the [[higher education]] of black women, and [[Leonard Hall (Shaw University)|Leonard Medical Center]] was the first four-year [[medical school]] in the country for African Americans.\n\nIn 1867, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] clergy founded [[St. Augustine's College (Raleigh)|St. Augustine's College]] for the education of [[free negro|freedmen]]. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation's first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the [[Federal Building (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Federal Building]] in Raleigh, the first [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] project in the South following the Civil War.\n\nIn 1880, the newspapers ''News'' and ''Observer'' combined to form ''[[The News & Observer]]''. It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as [[North Carolina State University]], was founded as a [[land-grant college]] in 1887. The city's [[Rex Hospital]] opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as [[Meredith College]], opened in 1891, and in 1898, [[The Academy of Music]], a private music conservatory, was established.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. [[George Henry White]] sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on a white supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new [[State constitution (United States)|constitution]], with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the [[North Carolina Republican Party|Republican Party]] was no longer competitive in the state.\n\nIt was not until after federal [[civil rights]] legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride.

It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\n\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh]] was officially established by [[Pope Pius XI]]. The [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] became the official seat of the diocese with [[William Joseph Hafey]] as its bishop.\n\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929.

The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, [[Raleigh Memorial Auditorium]] was dedicated. The [[North Carolina Symphony]], founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] constructed the area now known as [[William B. Umstead State Park]]. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943.\n\nIn 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a [[Council\u2013manager government|council\u2013manager]] form of government, the current form.

Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman [[Clarence Lightner]] defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G.

Some of the names have become common place among locals such as the Warehouse, Fayetteville Street, and [[Glenwood South]] Districts.\n\nThe Inside the Beltline neighborhoods include [[Cameron Park Historic District|Cameron Park]], [[Boylan Heights (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Boylan Heights]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boylanheights.org/|title=Historic Boylan Heights Neighborhood Main Page|publisher=Boylanheights.org|date=|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref> Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, [[Glenwood-Brooklyn Historic District|Glenwood-Brooklyn]], [[Hayes Barton Historic District]], [[Moore Square Historic District|Moore Square]], [[Mordecai Place Historic District|Mordecai]] (home to the historic [[Mordecai House]]), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and [[Historic Oakwood]]. Inside the Beltline refers to I-440 which used to be called the Beltline before being re-branded to ease driver navigation. These neighborhoods were typically built before World War II.\n\n====Midtown Raleigh====\n[[File:Solasglenwood.jpeg|thumb|Solas Restaurant in the Glenwood South District of Raleigh]]\nMidtown Raleigh is a residential and commercial area just North of the I-440 Beltline and is part of North Raleigh. It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Creedmoor Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as [[North Hills (Raleigh)|North Hills]] and [[Crabtree Valley Mall]]. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. The ''News & Observer'' newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who birthed Midtown|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2009/09/30/117476/who-birthed-midtown.html#storylink|author=Matthew Eisley|newspaper=[[The News & Observer]]|accessdate=November 12, 2011|date=September 20, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105113548/http://www.newsobserver.com/2009/09/30/117476/who-birthed-midtown.html#storylink|archivedate=November 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area.<ref>{{cite news|title=Slideshow: Midtown Raleigh Alliance|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2011/07/25/slideshow-midtown-ralleigh-alliance.html#storylink|author=Dathan Kazsuk|newspaper=[[Triangle Business Journal]]|accessdate=April 12, 2013|date=July 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====East Raleigh====\n[[File:North Hills in Raleigh.jpg|thumb|Office towers overlooking shops and restaurants in North Hills in Midtown Raleigh 2019]]\nEast Raleigh is situated roughly from [[Capital Boulevard]] near the [[Interstate 440 (North Carolina)|I-440]] beltline to New Hope Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as [[U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina|U.S. 1]] (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road. Neighborhoods in East Raleigh include Hedingham, Longview, Lockwood, [[Madonna Acres Historic District (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Madonna Acres]], New Hope, Thompson-Hunter and Wilder's Grove. The area is bordered to the east by the town of [[Knightdale, North Carolina|Knightdale]].\n\n====West Raleigh====\n[[File:Dorton Arena.jpg|thumb|[[Dorton Arena]] in Raleigh, designed by [[Maciej Nowicki (architect)|Matthew Nowicki]]]]\nWest Raleigh lies along [[Hillsborough Street]] and Western Boulevard. The area is bordered to the west by suburban [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]]. It is home to [[North Carolina State University]], [[Meredith College]], [[Pullen Park]], [[Pullen Memorial Baptist Church]], the Islamic Association of Raleigh, [[Cameron Village]], Lake Johnson, the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]] and historic [[Saint Mary's School (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Saint Mary's School]]. Primary thoroughfares serving West Raleigh, in addition to Hillsborough Street, are Avent Ferry Road, Blue Ridge Road, and Western Boulevard. The [[PNC Arena]] is also located here adjacent to the [[North Carolina State Fairgrounds]]. These are located approximately 2 miles from [[Rex Hospital]].\n\n====North Raleigh====\nNorth Raleigh is an expansive, diverse, and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built [[subdivision (land)|subdivisions]] and along its northern fringes. The area generally falls North of Millbrook Road. It is primarily suburban with large shopping areas. Primary neighborhoods and subdivisions in North Raleigh include Bartons Creek Bluffs, Bedford, Bent Tree, Black Horse Run, Brier Creek, Brookhaven, Coachman's Trail, Crossgate, Crosswinds, Dominion Park, Durant Trails, Ethan's Glenn, Falls River, Greystone Village, Harrington Grove, Hidden Valley, Lake Park, Long Lake, North Haven, [[North Ridge Country Club|North Ridge]], Oakcroft, Shannon Woods, Six Forks Station, Springdale Estates, Stonebridge, Stone Creek, Stonehenge, Summerfield, Valley Estates, Wakefield, Weathersfield, Windsor Forest, and Wood Valley. The area is served by a number of primary transportation corridors including Glenwood Avenue [[U.S. Route 70 (North Carolina)|U.S. Route 70]], [[Interstate 540 (North Carolina)|Interstate 540]], Wake Forest Road, Millbrook Road, Lynn Road, Six Forks Road, Spring Forest Road, [[Creedmoor Road]], Leesville Road, Norwood Road, Strickland Road, and North Hills Drive.\n\n====South Raleigh====\nSouth Raleigh is located along [[U.S. Route 401 (North Carolina)|U.S. 401]] south toward [[Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina|Fuquay-Varina]] and along [[U.S. Route 70 in North Carolina|US 70]] into suburban [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]]. This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the [[Swift Creek Township, Wake County, North Carolina|Swift Creek]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], to the east by [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]], to the southwest by [[Holly Springs, North Carolina|Holly Springs]] and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke, and Enchanted Oaks.\n\n====Southeast Raleigh====\nSoutheast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]] on the southwest, and rural [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]] to the southeast. The area includes areas along Rock Quarry Road, Poole Road, and New Bern Avenue. Primary neighborhoods include Chastain, Chavis Heights, Raleigh Country Club, Southgate, Kingwood Forest, Rochester Heights, Emerald Village and Biltmore Hills. [[Coastal Credit Union Music Park]] (formerly Time Warner Cable Music Pavilion, Alltel Pavilion and Walnut Creek Amphitheatre) is one of the region's major outdoor concert venues and is located on Rock Quarry Road. [[Shaw University]] is located in this part of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Ducks in Fall.jpg|thumb|Ducks swimming at Durant Nature Reserve in the Fall]]Like much of the southeastern United States, Raleigh has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa''). Winters are short and generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of {{convert|41.0|\u00b0F|1}}<!--(maximum+minimum)/2, NOT the maximum-->.<ref name=\"NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)\" /> On average, there are 69&nbsp;nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7&nbsp;days that fail to rise above freezing.<ref name=\"NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)\" /> Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of {{convert|43.34|in|cm|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/raleigh/north-carolina/united-states/usnc0558|title=Climate - Raleigh - North Carolina|last=|first=|date=November 10, 2018|website=U.S. Climate Data|accessdate=November 10, 2018}}</ref> Annual and monthly (temperature and) precipitation data are in chart below. April is the driest month, with an average of {{convert|2.92|in|1}} of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of {{convert|80.0|\u00b0F|1}}<!--(maximum+minimum)/2, NOT the maximum-->.<ref name=\"NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)\" /> There are 48&nbsp;days per year with highs at or above {{convert|90|\u00b0F|0}}.<ref name=\"NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)\" /> Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316. Extremes in temperature have ranged from {{convert|\u22129|\u00b0F|0}} on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]] up to {{convert|105|\u00b0F|0}}, most recently on [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave|July 8, 2012]].  Raleigh falls in [[USDA]] [[hardiness zones]] 7b (5&nbsp;\u00b0F to 10&nbsp;\u00b0F) and 8a (10&nbsp;\u00b0F to 15&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.plantmaps.com/hardiness-zones-for-raleigh-north-carolina |title=Raleigh North Carolina USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=plantmaps.com plantmaps|accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref>[[File:Raleigh snow.jpg|thumb|Heavy snow in downtown Raleigh along [[Hillsborough Street|Hillsborough street]] 2015]]Raleigh receives an average of {{convert|6.0|in|cm|1}} of snow in winter. [[Freezing rain]] and [[Ice pellets|sleet]] also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging [[ice storm]]. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm{{spaced ndash}}{{convert|20.3|in|cm|0}}{{spaced ndash}}the [[January 25, 2000 Winter Storm|Winter Storm of January 2000]]. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of [[cold air damming]] that affects the city due to its proximity to the [[Appalachian Mountains]].  Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\n\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of [[drought]], during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience [[hurricane]]s. In 1996, [[Hurricane Fran]] caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was [[Hurricane Florence]] in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the November 28, 1988 tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated an F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale and affected northwestern portions of the city. There also was the April 16, 2011 EF3 tornado, which affected portions of downtown and northeast Raleigh and the suburb of Holly Springs.\n\n<section begin=\"weather box\" />{{Weather box |location = [[Raleigh\u2013Durham International Airport]], North Carolina (1981\u20132010 normals,{{efn|Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1981 to 2010.}} extremes 1887\u2013present{{efn|Official records for Raleigh kept January 1887 to 17 May 1944 at downtown and at Raleigh Durham Int'l since 18 May 1944.

There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] with [[light rail]] technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the [[Federal Transit Administration]] declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.\n\nThe region's two [[metropolitan planning organization]]s appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |title=Regional Transit Infrastructure Blueprint |publisher=Transitblueprint.org |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=January 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106111406/http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |archivedate=November 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Greyhound Lines]] provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.\n\n====Bicycle and pedestrian====\n*The Maine-to-Florida [[U.S. Bicycle Route#1]] routes through suburban Raleigh, along with [[North Carolina Bicycle Route 2|N.C.

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Overflow]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.
