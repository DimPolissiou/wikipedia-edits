He attended [[Benalla College|Benalla High School]] for two years of his education. He started an apprenticeship in pharmacy when he finished school, and moved to Melbourne in 1927. There, he studied at the [[Victorian College of Pharmacy]] and then the [[University of Melbourne]], where he obtained a scholarship in medicine.<ref>[http://www.vcp.monash.edu.au/125/stories/dunlopw.html 125 Stories for 125 Years<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203215140/http://www.vcp.monash.edu.au/125/stories/dunlopw.html |date=3 December 2008 }}</ref> Dunlop graduated from the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1934 with first class honours in [[pharmacy]] and in medicine,<ref>At that time, it was not uncommon for a student to first study pharmacy, because the gaining of a pharmacy diploma guaranteed advanced-level admission to a medical degree at Melbourne University.</ref> and excelled as a sportsman at Melbourne University and [[Ormond College]].

This statue \"commemorates all Australian doctors and medical staff who served Australian prisoners of war in the Asia-Pacific region between 1939 and 1945.\" Conserved 1995, remounted 2010]]\nDunlop had been a school cadet, and he continued his part-time army service until 1929, when his service ceased under pressure from his pharmacy studies. He re-enlisted in 1935 and was commissioned into the [[Australian Army Medical Corps]] on 1 July with the rank of Captain. In May 1938 Dunlop left Australia for London on a ship, where he served as her medical officer. In London he attended St Bartholomew's Medical School and in 1938 became a [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]]. The distinguished medical mentors Dunlop met in London, Professor [[George Grey Turner|Grey-Turner]] and Sir [[Thomas Peel Dunhill|Thomas Dunhill]], impressed him with their dedication to their job and he resolved to emulate their example.\n\n==War and imprisonment==\nDuring [[World War II]], Dunlop was appointed to medical headquarters in the Middle East, where he developed the mobile surgical unit. In [[Greece]] he liaised with forward medical units and Allied headquarters, and at [[Tobruk]] he was a surgeon until the Australian Divisions were withdrawn for home defence. His troopship was diverted to [[Java (island)|Java]] in an ill-planned attempt to bolster the defences there. On 26 February 1942, he was promoted to temporary [[lieutenant-colonel]]. Dunlop became a Japanese [[prisoner of war]] in 1942 when he was captured in [[Bandung]], Java, together with the hospital he was commanding.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/medicine-obituaries/7130574/Maurice-Kinmonth.html |title=Obituary of Maurice Kinmonth |date=2 February 2010 |publisher=Daily Telegraph |accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nBecause of his leadership skills, he was placed in charge of [[prisoner-of-war]] camps in Java, and was later transferred briefly to Changi, and in January 1943 commanded the first Australians sent to work on the Thai segment of the [[Death Railway|Burma-Thailand railway]] where prisoners of the Japanese were being used as [[Unfree labour|forced labourers]] to construct a strategically important supply route between Bangkok and Rangoon. Conditions in the railway camps were primitive and horrific\u2014food was totally inadequate, beatings were frequent and severe, there were no medical supplies, [[tropical diseases]] were rampant, and the Japanese required a level of productivity that would have been difficult for fully fit and properly equipped men to achieve.\n\nAlong with a number of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Medical Officers, Dunlop's dedication and heroism became a legend among prisoners.\n\nA courageous leader and compassionate doctor, he restored morale in those terrible prison camps and jungle hospitals. Dunlop defied his captors, gave hope to the sick and eased the anguish of the dying. He became, in the words of one of his men, \"a lighthouse of sanity in a universe of madness and suffering\". His example was one of the reasons why Australian survival rates were the highest.\n\nHe is depicted in a lighter moment during these terrible times on a [[birthday card]] painted by [[Ashley George Old]] for Major [[Arthur Moon]] and now held at the [[State Library of Victoria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/pictures/gid/slv-pic-aaa37760 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621042311/http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/pictures/gid/slv-pic-aaa37760 |archivedate=21 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Post-war life==\nAfter 1945, with the darkness of the war years behind him, Dunlop forgave his captors and turned his energies to the task of healing and building. He was to state later that \" in suffering we are all equal\". He devoted himself to the health and welfare of former prisoners-of-war and their families, and worked to promote better relations between Australia and Asia.\n\nHe was active in many spheres of endeavour. He became closely involved with a wide range of health and educational organisations, and served as President of the Australian Drug Foundation for 13 years, and also on the board of [[Cancer Council Victoria]]. He was the first Australian Patron of St. Andrew's Ambulance Association (now [[St. Andrew's First Aid]]). His tireless community work had a profound influence on Australians and on the people of Asia. As well as numerous tributes and distinctions bestowed upon him in his own country, he received honours from [[Thailand]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the United Kingdom.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n'Weary' Dunlop received many honours and awards throughout his life, including: \n* Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (1947)<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1110379&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: OBE]</ref>\n* Companion of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (1965)<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1066602&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: CMG]</ref>\n* [[Knight Bachelor]] (1969)<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1083456&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: Knight Bachelor]</ref>\n* named [[Australian of the Year]] 1976<ref>{{cite book | author= Lewis, Wendy | title=Australians of the Year | publisher=Pier 9 Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-74196-809-5 | authorlink=Wendy Lewis  }}</ref>\n* Companion of the [[Order of Australia]] (1987)<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=873963&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: AC]</ref>\n* Knight Commander of the Order of St John of Jerusalem ([[Knights Hospitaller]]) of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of St John of Jerusalem]] (1992)\n* Knight Grand Cross (1st Class) of the [[Order of the Crown of Thailand|Most Noble Order of the Royal Crown of Thailand]] (1993)\n* Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]\n* Fellow of the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]]\n* Honorary Fellow of the [[Imperial College London]]\n* Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]]\n* Honorary Life Member of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia]]\n* Life Governor of the [[Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne|Royal Women's Hospital]] and the [[Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital]].\n\nIn 1988 'Weary' Dunlop was named one of '200 Great Australians'.

He attended [[Benalla College|Benalla High School]] for two years of his education. He started an apprenticeship in pharmacy when he finished school, and moved to Melbourne in 1927.

This statue \"commemorates all Australian doctors and medical staff who served Australian prisoners of war in the Asia-Pacific region between 1939 and 1945.\" Conserved 1995, remounted 2010]]\nDunlop had been a school cadet, and he continued his part-time army service until 1929, when his service ceased under pressure from his pharmacy studies. He re-enlisted in 1935 and was commissioned into the [[Australian Army Medical Corps]] on 1 July with the rank of Captain. In May 1938 Dunlop left Australia for London on a ship, where he served as her medical officer. In London he attended St Bartholomew's Medical School and in 1938 became a [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]]. The distinguished medical mentors Dunlop met in London, Professor [[George Grey Turner|Grey-Turner]] and Sir [[Thomas Peel Dunhill|Thomas Dunhill]], impressed him with their dedication to their job and he resolved to emulate their example.\n\n==War and imprisonment==\nDuring [[World War II]], Dunlop was appointed to medical headquarters in the Middle East, where he developed the mobile surgical unit. In [[Greece]] he liaised with forward medical units and Allied headquarters, and at [[Tobruk]] he was a surgeon until the Australian Divisions were withdrawn for home defence. His troopship was diverted to [[Java (island)|Java]] in an ill-planned attempt to bolster the defences there. On 26 February 1942, he was promoted to temporary [[lieutenant-colonel]]. Dunlop became a Japanese [[prisoner of war]] in 1942 when he was captured in [[Bandung]], Java, together with the hospital he was commanding.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/medicine-obituaries/7130574/Maurice-Kinmonth.html |title=Obituary of Maurice Kinmonth |date=2 February 2010 |publisher=Daily Telegraph |accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nBecause of his leadership skills, he was placed in charge of [[prisoner-of-war]] camps in Java, and was later transferred briefly to Changi, and in January 1943 commanded the first Australians sent to work on the Thai segment of the [[Death Railway|Burma-Thailand railway]] where prisoners of the Japanese were being used as [[Unfree labour|forced labourers]] to construct a strategically important supply route between Bangkok and Rangoon. Conditions in the railway camps were primitive and horrific\u2014food was totally inadequate, beatings were frequent and severe, there were no medical supplies, [[tropical diseases]] were rampant, and the Japanese required a level of productivity that would have been difficult for fully fit and properly equipped men to achieve.\n\nAlong with a number of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Medical Officers, Dunlop's dedication and heroism became a legend among prisoners.\n\nA courageous leader and compassionate doctor, he restored morale in those terrible prison camps and jungle hospitals. Dunlop defied his captors, gave hope to the sick and eased the anguish of the dying. He became, in the words of one of his men, \"a lighthouse of sanity in a universe of madness and suffering\". His example was one of the reasons why Australian survival rates were the highest.\n\nHe is depicted in a lighter moment during these terrible times on a [[birthday card]] painted by [[Ashley George Old]] for Major [[Arthur Moon]] and now held at the [[State Library of Victoria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/pictures/gid/slv-pic-aaa37760 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621042311/http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/pictures/gid/slv-pic-aaa37760 |archivedate=21 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Post-war life==\nAfter 1945, with the darkness of the war years behind him, Dunlop forgave his captors and turned his energies to the task of healing and building. He was to state later that \" in suffering we are all equal\". He devoted himself to the health and welfare of former prisoners-of-war and their families, and worked to promote better relations between Australia and Asia.\n\nHe was active in many spheres of endeavour. He became closely involved with a wide range of health and educational organisations, and served as President of the Australian Drug Foundation for 13 years, and also on the board of [[Cancer Council Victoria]]. He was the first Australian Patron of St. Andrew's Ambulance Association (now [[St. Andrew's First Aid]]). His tireless community work had a profound influence on Australians and on the people of Asia. As well as numerous tributes and distinctions bestowed upon him in his own country, he received honours from [[Thailand]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the United Kingdom.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n'Weary' Dunlop received many honours and awards throughout his life, including: \n* Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (1947)<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1110379&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: OBE]</ref>\n* Companion of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (1965)<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1066602&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: CMG]</ref>\n* [[Knight Bachelor]] (1969)<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1083456&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: Knight Bachelor]</ref>\n* named [[Australian of the Year]] 1976<ref>{{cite book | author= Lewis, Wendy | title=Australians of the Year | publisher=Pier 9 Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-74196-809-5 | authorlink=Wendy Lewis  }}</ref>\n* Companion of the [[Order of Australia]] (1987)<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=873963&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: AC]</ref>\n* Knight Commander of the Order of St John of Jerusalem ([[Knights Hospitaller]]) of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of St John of Jerusalem]] (1992)\n* Knight Grand Cross (1st Class) of the [[Order of the Crown of Thailand|Most Noble Order of the Royal Crown of Thailand]] (1993)\n* Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]\n* Fellow of the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]]\n* Honorary Fellow of the [[Imperial College London]]\n* Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]]\n* Honorary Life Member of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia]]\n* Life Governor of the [[Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne|Royal Women's Hospital]] and the [[Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital]].\n\nIn 1988 'Weary' Dunlop was named one of '200 Great Australians'.

The region was closed to pilgrims from the outside following the [[Battle of Chamdo]]; no foreigners were allowed between 1951 and 1980.

The lake has a few [[vihara|monasteries]] on its shores, the most notable of which is the ancient Chiu Monastery built on a steep hill, looking as if it has been carved right out of the rock.\n\nThe lake is very popular in Buddhist literature and associated with many teachings and stories. The Buddha, it is reported, stayed and meditated near this lake on several occasions. Lake Manasa Sarovara is also the subject of the meditative Tibetan tradition, \"The Jewel of Tibet\".

The son of Bhagwan Rishabhdev, [[Bharata Chakravartin|Chakravati Bharat]], had built a palace adorned with gems on the Ashtapad Mountain located in the serene [[Himalayas]].

He or she is believed to be cleansed of all their sins committed over even a hundred lifetimes.<ref name=\"In Search of Myths & Heroes\" />\n\nLike [[Mount Kailash]], Lake Manasarovar is a place of pilgrimage, attracting religious people from [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]] and neighboring countries. Bathing in Manasarovar and drinking its water is believed by Hindus to cleanse all sins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kailash-yatra.org/about-mansarovar-lake.html#main_articles_sec|title=About Holy Manasarovar Lake \u2013 Kailash Yatra|last=Kailash Yatra|website=www.kailash-yatra.org|access-date=2016-04-25|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502155525/http://www.kailash-yatra.org/about-mansarovar-lake.html#main_articles_sec|archivedate=2016-05-02}}</ref> [[Pilgrimage]] tours are organized regularly, especially from India, the most famous of which is the yearly \"Kailash Manasarovar Yatra\". Pilgrims come to take ceremonial baths in the waters of the lake.\n\nLake Manasarovar has long been viewed by the pilgrims as being nearby to the sources of four great rivers of Asia, namely the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra,]] [[Ghaghara]], Sindhu and [[Sutlej]], thus it is an axial point which has been thronged to by pilgrims for thousands of years. The region was closed to pilgrims from the outside following the [[Battle of Chamdo]]; no foreigners were allowed between 1951 and 1980. After the 1980s it has again become a part of the Indian pilgrim trail.<ref name=\"In Search of Myths & Heroes\">In Search of Myths & Heroes By Michael Wood</ref>\n\nAccording to the Hinduism, the lake was first created in the mind of [[Brahma]] after which it manifested on Earth.<ref name=\"Charles Allen 1999 p. 10\" /> Hence it is called \"Manasa sarovaram\", which is a combination of the [[Sanskrit]] words for \"mind\" and \"lake\". The lake is also supposed to be the summer abode of the [[Hamsa (bird)|hamsa]]. Considered to be sacred, the hamsa is an important element in the symbology of the subcontinent, representing wisdom and beauty.<ref>Eckard Schleberger, Die Indische G\u00f6tterwelt.'' Eugen Diederich Verlag. 1997 {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hindu theology, there are five sacred lakes; collectively called ''Panch-Sarovar''; Mansarovar, [[Siddhpur|Bindu Sarovar]], [[Narayan Sarovar]], [[Pampa Sarovar]] and [[Pushkar Lake|Pushkar Sarovar]].<ref name=w /> They are also mentioned in [[Shrimad Bhagavata Purana]].<ref name=b>{{cite web |url=http://kutchguide.blogspot.com/2011/03/narayan-sarovar-temple-in-kutch-city.html |title=Narayan Sarovar Temple in Kutch ~ KACHCHH GUIDE |publisher=Kutchguide.blogspot.com |date=2010-12-19 |accessdate=2015-07-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723073313/http://kutchguide.blogspot.com/2011/03/narayan-sarovar-temple-in-kutch-city.html |archivedate=2015-07-23 }}</ref><ref name=a>{{cite web |url=http://www.gujaratguideonline.com/Kutch-Places.html |title=Kutch Visiting Places and Tourist Attraction : Kutch Guide \u2013 Gujarat |publisher=Gujaratguideonline.com |accessdate=2015-07-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024153/http://www.gujaratguideonline.com/Kutch-Places.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"w\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=nxtnsT8CdZ4C&pg=PA112&dq=narayan+sarovar&hl=en&ei=jZa1TbzPDsrKrAe0j-3IDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=narayan%20sarovar&f=false] Encyclopaedia of tourism resources in India, Volume 2 By Manohar Sajnani</ref>\n\nThe People who belong to this region are called [[Manasarovar]]iya. Most of those who follow Hinduism here belong to the [[Koli people|Koli]] tribe called [[Manasarovar|Manasarovariya Patels]] or [[Mandhatri|Mandhata Patels]] and they claim that their tribe are descendants of the ancient King [[Mandhatri|Mandhata]] of [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Suryavansha or Ikshvaku dynasty]]. There is a mountain nearby named after him. It is called [[Gurla Mandhata]] and is the highest peak of the [[Nalakankar Himal]].\n\n=== In the Bon religion ===\nThe [[Bon]] religion is also associated with the holy place of [[Zhang Zhung Meri]] sacred deity. When [[Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche|Tonpa Shenrab]], the founder of the Bon religion, visited Tibet for the first time \u2013 from [[Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring|Tagzig Wolmo Lungring]] \u2013 he bathed in the lake.\n\n=== In Buddhism ===\n[[Buddhism|Buddhists]] associate the lake with the legendary lake [[Anavatapta]] ([[Sanskrit]]; [[Pali]] ''Anotatta'') where [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]] is believed to have conceived the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The lake has a few [[vihara|monasteries]] on its shores, the most notable of which is the ancient Chiu Monastery built on a steep hill, looking as if it has been carved right out of the rock.\n\nThe lake is very popular in Buddhist literature and associated with many teachings and stories. The Buddha, it is reported, stayed and meditated near this lake on several occasions. Lake Manasarovar is also the subject of the meditative Tibetan tradition, \"The Jewel of Tibet\". A modern narration and description of the meditation was made popular by [[Robert Thurman]].<ref>[http://www.soundstrue.com/shop/420.productdetails?couponCode=NOVAA The Jewel Tree of Tibet \u2013 Robert Thurman]. Soundstrue.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-18.</ref>\n\n=== In Jainism ===\n\nIn [[Jainism]], Lake Manasarovar is associated with the first [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabha]]. As per Jain scriptures, the first Tirthankar, Bhagwan Rushabhdev, had attained [[nirvana]] on the Ashtapad Mountain. The son of Bhagwan Rishabhdev, [[Bharata Chakravartin|Chakravati Bharat]], had built a palace adorned with gems on the Ashtapad Mountain located in the serene [[Himalayas]]. There are many stories related to Ashtapad Maha Tirth like Kumar and Sagar's sons, Tapas Kher Parna, Ravan and Mandodri Bhakti, among many others.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-lost-tirth-of-jains-traced-to-himalayas-1631581|title='Lost' tirth of Jains traced to Himalayas - Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=30 December 2011|website=dnaindia.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815022808/http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-lost-tirth-of-jains-traced-to-himalayas-1631581|archivedate=15 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rakshas Tal]]\n* [[Lakes of India]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Lake Manasarovar}}\n* {{Wikivoyage-inline|Mount_Kailash}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Hinduism (compact)}}\n{{Buddhist temples in China}}\n{{Lakes of China}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manasarovar}}\n[[Category:Lakes of the Tibet Autonomous Region]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in China]]\n[[Category:Sacred lakes]]\n[[Category:Indus basin]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in China]]\n[[Category:Buddhist temples in China]]\n", "name_user": "Gurudatta Rao", "label": "safe", "comment": "Editied some typos", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Manasarovar"}

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

It was created on the Unity engine by [[AlternativaPlatform]], a Russia-based game developing company. The game uses the [[free-to-play]] business model, where players can download and play the game for free. However, players can also pay real world money in the form of [[Micro-transactions|micro transactions]] to get \"X Crystals\". These X Crystals unlock special cosmetic features for tanks and blueprint containers which can unlock and upgrade modules.

At the moment, Tanki X features three game modes: [[Deathmatch]], [[Team deathmatch|Team Deathmatch]], and [[Capture the Flag]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://help.tankix.com/en/tanki-x/articles/basics/Battles|title=Knowledge Base \u2014 Tanki X \u2014 Battle modes|website=help.tankix.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref> Players can create their own tank combination from a selection of different turrets and hulls, all unique in their strengths and weaknesses.    [[File:Tanki X Area159.jpg|thumb|Capture the Flag on Tanki X map \"Area 159\".]]\n\n=== In-game Currency and Ranking System ===\nFor every tank destroyed or flag captured, players build up a number of XP (rank experience points) which they are rewarded, and container points. The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real world money, and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.\n\n=== Ranked Battles ===\nThe ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season. At that time, the game will award players with crystals, x crystals, and league containers for the league they ended the season in. The game also reduces each player's RP by a certain amount, depending on where they are at.\n\n==Reception==\n\nOn September 15, 2016, Tanki X began its Open Beta test.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.forum.tankix.com/forums/topic/1176-open-beta-testing-still-a-testing-environment/?tab=comments#comment-13280 |title=Open Beta Testing - still a testing environment|date=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\nOn April 13, 2017, Alternativa Platform announced their plans to release Tanki X on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mmos.com/news/tanki-x-go-live-steam-early-access-april-20tjh|title=Tanki X To Go Live On Steam Early Access On April 20th - MMOs.com|date=2017-04-13|work=MMOs.com|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-US}}</ref> As promised, Tanki X was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/607200/Tanki_X/|title=Tanki X on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|accessdate=2017-05-20}}</ref>\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Tanki X left the Open Beta Testing stage and was officially released with the Arms Race update.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tankix.com/en/news/tanki-x-officially-released/ |title=Tanki X has been officially released! |last= |first= |date=13 March 2018 |website=tankix.com |publisher=Tanki Online Europe Ltd. |access-date=14 March 2018 |quote=Today, '''March 13th, 2018''', becomes the official release date of Tanki X.

It was created on the Unity engine by [[AlternativaPlatform]], a Russia-based game developing company. The game uses the [[free-to-play]] business model, where players can download and play the game for free. However, players can also pay real world money in the form of [[Micro-transactions|micro transactions]] to get \"X Crystals\". These X Crystals unlock special cosmetic features for tanks and blueprint containers which can unlock and upgrade modules.

At the moment, Tanki X features three game modes: [[Deathmatch]], [[Team deathmatch|Team Deathmatch]], and [[Capture the Flag]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://help.tankix.com/en/tanki-x/articles/basics/Battles|title=Knowledge Base \u2014 Tanki X \u2014 Battle modes|website=help.tankix.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref> Players can create their own tank combination from a selection of different turrets and hulls, all unique in their strengths and weaknesses.    [[File:Tanki X Area159.jpg|thumb|Capture the Flag on Tanki X map \"Area 159\".]]\n\n=== In-game Currency and Ranking System ===\nFor every tank destroyed or flag captured, players build up a number of XP (rank experience points) which they are rewarded, and container points. The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real world money, and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.\n\n=== Ranked Battles ===\nThe ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season. At that time, the game will award players with crystals, x crystals, and league containers for the league they ended the season in. The game also reduces each player's RP by a certain amount, depending on where they are at.\n\n==Reception==\n\nOn September 15, 2016, Tanki X began its Open Beta test.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.forum.tankix.com/forums/topic/1176-open-beta-testing-still-a-testing-environment/?tab=comments#comment-13280 |title=Open Beta Testing - still a testing environment|date=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\nOn April 13, 2017, Alternativa Platform announced their plans to release Tanki X on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mmos.com/news/tanki-x-go-live-steam-early-access-april-20tjh|title=Tanki X To Go Live On Steam Early Access On April 20th - MMOs.com|date=2017-04-13|work=MMOs.com|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-US}}</ref> As promised, Tanki X was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/607200/Tanki_X/|title=Tanki X on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|accessdate=2017-05-20}}</ref>\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Tanki X left the Open Beta Testing stage and was officially released with the Arms Race update.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tankix.com/en/news/tanki-x-officially-released/ |title=Tanki X has been officially released! |last= |first= |date=13 March 2018 |website=tankix.com |publisher=Tanki Online Europe Ltd. |access-date=14 March 2018 |quote=Today, '''March 13th, 2018''', becomes the official release date of Tanki X.

Simple [[commodity]] exchange and consequently simple commodity production, which is the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history. [[Classical Islam|Arabs]] promulgated capitalist economic policies such as free trade and banking. Their use of [[Indo-Arabic numerals]] facilitated [[bookkeeping]].  These innovations migrated to Europe through trade partners in cities such as Venice and Pisa.  The Italian mathematician [[Fibonacci]] traveled the Mediterranean talking to Arab traders and returned to popularize the use of Indo-Arabic numerals in Europe.<ref name=\"Koehler, Benedikt\">Koehler, Benedikt. ''Early Islam and the Birth of Capitalism'',  \"In Baghdad, by the early tenth century a fully-fledged banking sector had come into being...\" p. 2, (Lexington Books, 2014).</ref>\n\nCapital and commercial trade thus existed for much of history, but it did not lead to industrialization or dominate the production process of society. That required a set of conditions, including specific technologies of mass production, the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production, a class of workers willing to sell their [[labor power]] for a living, a [[legal]] framework promoting commerce, a physical infrastructure allowing the circulation of goods on a large scale and security for private accumulation. Many of these conditions do not currently exist in many [[Third World]] countries, although there is plenty of capital and labor. The obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are therefore less technical and more social, cultural and political.\n\n=== Agrarian capitalism ===\nThe economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16th-century England as the [[manorial system]] had broken down and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. Instead of a [[serf]]-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy. The system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit; the weakened coercive power of the [[aristocracy]] to extract peasant [[Excess supply|surpluses]] encouraged them to try better methods, and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods in order to flourish in a competitive [[labor economics|labor market]]. Terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brenner|first1=Robert|title=The Agrarian Roots of European Capitalism|journal=Past & Present|date=1 January 1982|issue=97|pages=16\u2013113|jstor=650630}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://monthlyreview.org/1998/07/01/the-agrarian-origins-of-capitalism|title= The Agrarian Origins of Capitalism|accessdate= 17 December 2012|date= July 1998}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 17th century, England was a centralized state in which much of the feudal order of [[Medieval Europe]] had been swept away. This centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and by a disproportionately large capital city, [[London]]. The capital acted as a central market hub for the entire country, creating a very large internal market for goods, contrasting with the fragmented feudal holdings that prevailed in most parts of the [[Continental Europe|Continent]].\n\n=== Mercantilism ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\n[[File:Lorrain.seaport.jpg|left|thumb|A painting of a French seaport from 1638 at the height of [[mercantilism]]]]\nThe economic doctrine prevailing from the 16th to the 18th centuries is commonly called [[mercantilism]].<ref name=GSGB /><ref name=\"Burnham\">{{cite book |author=Burnham, Peter|title=Capitalism: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003}}</ref> This period, the [[Age of Discovery]], was associated with the geographic exploration of the foreign lands by merchant traders, especially from England and the [[Low Countries]].

Moderate critics have recently challenged this, stating that the current influence lobbying groups have had on policy in the United States is a contradiction, given the approval of [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]]. This has led people to question the idea that competitive capitalism promotes political freedom. The ruling on Citizens United allows corporations to spend undisclosed and unregulated amounts of money on political campaigns, shifting outcomes to the interests and undermining true democracy. As explained in [[Robin Hahnel]]\u2019s writings, the centerpiece of the ideological defense of the free market system is the concept of economic freedom and that supporters equate economic democracy with economic freedom and claim that only the free market system can provide economic freedom. According to Hahnel, there are a few objections to the premise that capitalism offers freedom through economic freedom. These objections are guided by critical questions about who or what decides whose freedoms are more protected. Often, the question of inequality is brought up when discussing how well capitalism promotes democracy. An argument that could stand is that economic growth can lead to inequality given that capital can be acquired at different rates by different people. In ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', [[Thomas Piketty]] of the [[Paris School of Economics]] asserts that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting [[Wealth concentration|concentration of wealth]] can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built.<ref>[[Thomas Piketty|Piketty, Thomas]] (2014).

In mixed economies, which are almost universal today,<ref>James Fulcher, ''Capitalism A Very Short Introduction'', \"...in the wake of the 1970 crisis, the neoliberal model of capitalism became intellectually and ideologically dominant\", p. 58, Oxford, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-19-280218-7}}.</ref> markets continue to play a dominant role, but they are regulated to some extent by the state in order to correct [[market failure]]s, promote [[social welfare]], conserve [[natural resource]]s, fund [[military|defense]] and [[public safety]] or other rationale. In [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on [[state-owned enterprises]] or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital.\n\nSupply is the amount of a good or service that is available for purchase or sale. Demand is the measure of value for a good that people are willing to buy at a given time. Prices tend to rise when demand for an available resource increases or its supply diminishes and fall with demand or when supply increases.{{According to whom|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nCompetition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. Adherents of the capitalist theory believe that competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. [[Monopoly|Monopolies]] or [[cartels]] can develop, especially if there is no competition. A monopoly occurs when a firm is granted exclusivity over a market. Hence, the firm can engage in [[rent seeking]] behaviors such as limiting output and raising prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and prices.\n\nGovernments have implemented legislation for the purpose of preventing the creation of monopolies and cartels. In 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act became the first legislation passed by the United States Congress to limit monopolies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp|title=Monopoly|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=24 November 2003|work=Investopedia|access-date=2 March 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Profit motive ===\n{{Main|Profit motive}}\nThe [[profit motive]], in the theory in capitalism, is the desire to earn income in the form of profit. Stated differently, the reason for a business's existence is to turn a profit. The profit motive functions according to [[rational choice theory]], or the theory that individuals tend to pursue what is in their own best interests. Accordingly, businesses seek to benefit themselves and/or their shareholders by maximizing profit.\n\nIn capitalist theoretics, the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently. For instance, [[Austrian economist]] [[Henry Hazlitt]] explains: \"If there is no profit in making an article, it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected: the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself\".<ref>Hazlitt, Henry. \"The Function of Profits\". ''Economics in One Lesson''. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. Web. 22 April 2013.</ref> In other words, profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing. Theoretically{{according to whom|date=March 2020}}, in free and competitive markets maximising profit ensures that resources are not wasted.\n\n=== Private property ===\n{{Main|Private property}}\nThe relationship between the [[state (polity)|state]], its formal mechanisms and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] is a contemporary Peruvian economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=The mystery of capital|author=Hernando de Soto|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital, which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy.

Private money-making in various forms (renting, banking, merchant trade, production for profit and so on) preceded the development of the capitalist mode of production as such. The capitalist mode of production proper based on wage-labour and private ownership of the means of production and on industrial technology began to grow rapidly in Western Europe from the [[Industrial Revolution]], later extending to most of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe term capitalist mode of production is defined by [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], extraction of [[surplus value]] by the owning class for the purpose of [[capital accumulation]], [[Wage labour|wage-based labour]] and at least as far as [[Commodity|commodities]] are concerned being [[Market economy|market-based]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capitalism | title=Capitalism. | publisher=marxists.org | accessdate=8 July 2011 | author=Encyclopedia of Marxism at marxism.org}}</ref>\n\nCapitalism in the form of money-making activity has existed in the shape of merchants and money-lenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in [[simple commodity production]] (hence the reference to \"[[merchant capitalism]]\") since the beginnings of civilisation. What is specific about the \"capitalist mode of production\" is that most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market (i.e. they are commodities) and essentially all production is in this mode.<ref name=\"Modern Economics 1986, p. 54\" /> For example, in flourishing feudalism most or all of the factors of production including labour are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind, it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade.<ref name=ch32/> This has the important consequence that the whole organisation of the production process is reshaped and re-organised to conform with economic [[bounded rationality|rationality as bounded]] by capitalism, which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs (wages, non-labour factor costs, sales and profits) rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall\u2014that is, the whole process is organised and re-shaped in order to conform to \"commercial logic\".

It posulates that in a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]], the [[unit price]] for a particular [[Good (economics)|good]] will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded by consumers (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied by producers (at the current price), resulting in an [[economic equilibrium]] for price and [[Output (economics)|quantity]].\n\nThe four basic \"laws\" of [[Supply (economics)|supply]] and [[demand]], as described by [[David Besanko]] and [[Ronald Braeutigam]], are:<ref name=\"besanko-and-braeutigam-2010\">{{Cite book | last = Besanko | first = David | last2 = Braeutigam | first2 = Ronald | year = 2010 | title = Microeconomics | publisher = Wiley | edition = 4th }}</ref>{{rp|37}}\n# If demand increases (demand curve shifts to the right) and supply remains unchanged, then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n# If demand decreases (demand curve shifts to the left) and supply remains unchanged, then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply increases (supply curve shifts to the right), then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply decreases (supply curve shifts to the left), then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n\n=== Graphical representation of supply and demand ===\nAlthough it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of the price of the goods, the standard graphical representation, usually attributed to [[Alfred Marshall]], has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the opposite of the standard convention for the representation of a mathematical function.\n\nSince determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply-demand diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves (often described as \"shifts\" in the curves). By contrast, responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves.\n\n==== Supply schedule ====\nA supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. Under the assumption of [[perfect competition]], supply is determined by [[marginal cost]]. That is: firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive.\n\nA hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply and shifting costs up while a discount would increase supply, shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases.\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a supply curve requires the firm to be a perfect competitor (i.e. to have no influence over the market price). This is true because each point on the supply curve is the answer to the question \"If this firm is ''faced with'' this potential price, how much output will it be able to and willing to sell?\". If a firm has market power, its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price, therefore the firm is not \"faced with\" any price and the question becomes less relevant.\n\nEconomists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and the market supply curve. The market supply curve is obtained by summing the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the supply curve individual firms' supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.\n\nEconomists also distinguish the short-run market supply curve from the long-run market supply curve. In this context, two things are assumed constant by definition of the short run: the availability of one or more fixed inputs (typically [[physical capital]]) and the number of firms in the industry. In the long-run, firms can adjust their holdings of physical capital, enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long-run potential competitors can [[Market entry strategy|enter]] or exit the industry in response to market conditions. For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.\n\nThe determinants of supply are:\n# Production costs: how much a goods costs to be produced. Production costs are the cost of the inputs; primarily labor, capital, energy and materials. They depend on the technology used in production and/or technological advances. See [[productivity]].\n# Firms' expectations about future prices.\n# Number of suppliers.\n\n==== Demand schedule ====\nA demand schedule, depicted graphically as the [[demand curve]], represents the amount of some [[Good (economics)|goods]] that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming all determinants of demand other than the price of the good in question, such as income, tastes and preferences, the price of [[substitute good]]s and the price of [[complementary good]]s, remain the same. According to the [[law of demand]], the demand curve is almost always represented as downward-sloping, meaning that as price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good.<ref name=\"axes\">Note that unlike most [[Graph of a function|graphs]], supply & demand curves are plotted with the independent variable (price) on the vertical axis and the dependent variable (quantity supplied or demanded) on the horizontal axis.</ref>\n\nJust like the supply curves reflect [[marginal cost]] curves, demand curves are determined by [[marginal utility]] curves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marginal Utility and Demand|url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=marginal+utility+and+demand|accessdate=9 February 2007}}</ref> Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the [[opportunity cost]] determined by the price\u2014that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time.\n\nWhile the aforementioned demand curve is generally downward-sloping, there may be rare examples of goods that have upward-sloping demand curves. Two different hypothetical types of goods with upward-sloping demand curves are [[Giffen good]]s (an inferior, but [[Staple food|staple]] good) and [[Veblen good]]s (goods made more fashionable by a higher price).\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor\u2014that is, that the purchaser has no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question \"If this buyer is faced with this potential price, how much of the product will it purchase?\". If a buyer has market power, so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price, then the buyer is not \"faced with\" any price and the question is meaningless.\n\nLike with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve. The market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the demand curve individuals' demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.\n\nThe determinants of demand are:\n# Income.\n# Tastes and preferences.\n# Prices of related goods and services.\n# Consumers' expectations about future prices and incomes that can be checked.\n# Number of potential consumers.\n\n=== Equilibrium ===\n{{Further|Economic equilibrium}}\nIn the context of supply and demand, economic equilibrium refers to a state where economic forces such as [[supply and demand]] are balanced and in the absence of external influences the ([[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]]) values of economic variables will not change. For example, in the standard text-book model of [[perfect competition]] equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Hal Varian |first=Hal R. |last=Varian |title=Microeconomic Analysis |edition=Third |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-393-95735-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/microeconomicana00vari_0 }}</ref> Market equilibrium in this case refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by [[Law of supply and demand|buyers]] is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by [[Law of supply and demand|sellers]]. This price is often called the competitive price or [[market clearing]] price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes and the quantity is called \"competitive quantity\" or market clearing quantity.\n\n=== Partial equilibrium ===\n{{Main|Partial equilibrium}}\nPartial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.\n\nJain proposes (attributed to [[George Stigler]]): \"A partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data, a standard example is price of a single product, the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Jain|first=T.R.|title=Microeconomics and Basic Mathematics|year=2006|publisher=VK Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-87140-89-4|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUUoFwco2Z8C}}</ref>\n\nThe supply and demand model is a partial equilibrium model of [[economic equilibrium]], where the clearance on the [[Market (economics)|market]] of some specific [[good (economics)|goods]] is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all [[substitute good|substitutes]] and [[complement good|complements]] as well as [[income]] levels of [[consumer]]s are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a [[general equilibrium]] model which includes an entire economy.\n\nHere the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[Pareto Efficiency|efficiency]] and [[comparative statics]]. The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach make the model considerably more tractable, but it may produce results which while seemingly precise do not effectively model real world economic phenomena.\n\nPartial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any.\n\nHence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Walras]] first formalised the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] and English political economist [[Alfred Marshall]] who developed tractable models to analyse an economic system.\n\n=== Empirical estimation ===\nDemand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity and other [[data]] with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with [[System of linear equations|simultaneous-equation]] methods of estimation in [[econometrics]]. Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant \"structural coefficients\", the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The [[Identification (parameter)|parameter identification problem]] is a common issue in \"structural estimation\". Typically, data on [[exogenous variable]]s (that is, variables other than price and quantity, both of which are [[endogenous variable]]s) are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to \"structural estimation\" is [[Reduced form|reduced-form]] estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables.\n\n=== Macroeconomic uses of demand and supply ===\nDemand and supply have also been generalised to explain [[macroeconomic]] variables in a [[market economy]], including the [[Real GDP|quantity of total output]] and the general [[price level]]. The [[AD-AS model|Aggregate Demand\u2013Aggregate Supply model]] may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to [[microeconomic]] uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such [[macroeconomic]] counterparts as [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate [[money supply]] and money demand to [[interest rate]]s and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates.\n\n=== History ===\nAccording to Hamid S. Hosseini, the \"power of supply and demand\" was discussed to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century [[Mamluk]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], who wrote: \"If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down\".<ref name=Hosseini>{{cite book |title=A Companion to the History of Economic Thought |chapter=Contributions of Medieval Muslim Scholars to the History of Economics and their Impact: A Refutation of the Schumpeterian Great Gap |last=Hosseini |first=Hamid S. |editor=Biddle, Jeff E. |editor2=Davis, Jon B. |editor3=Samuels, Warren J. |year=2003 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-631-22573-7 |doi=10.1002/9780470999059.ch3 |pages=28\u201345 [28 & 38]}} (citing Hamid S.

In this description, demand is [[Economic rent|rent]]: \"The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers\" and \"that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent\".\n\nThe phrase \"supply and demand\" was first used by [[James Denham-Steuart]] in his ''Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy'', published in 1767. [[Adam Smith]] used the phrase in his 1776 book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', and [[David Ricardo]] titled one chapter of his 1817 work ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' \"On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price\".<ref name=Humphrey>Thomas M.

In ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', Ricardo more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand. [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his 1838 ''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth'', including diagrams.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the marginalist school of thought emerged. This field mainly was started by [[William Stanley Jevons|Stanley Jevons]], [[Carl Menger]] and [[L\u00e9on Walras]]. The key idea was that the price was set by the most expensive price\u2014that is, the price at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price.\n\nIn his 1870 essay \"On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand\", [[Fleeming Jenkin]] in the course of \"introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature\" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein,<ref>A.D.

In most cases, the government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. However, many countries have [[minimum wage]] laws and minimum safety standards.\n\nUnder some versions of capitalism, the government carries out a number of economic functions, such as issuing money, supervising public utilities, and enforcing private contracts. Many countries have [[competition law]]s that prohibit monopolies and cartels. Despite anti-monopoly laws, large corporations can form near-monopolies in some industries. Such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market and then raise them again once the threat of competition is reduced. In many countries, public utilities such as electricity, heating fuel and communications are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation due to high economies of scale.\n\nGovernment agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting, as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control such factors as inflation and unemployment.<ref>\"Capitalism.\" World Book Encyclopedia. 1988. p. 194.</ref>\n\n=== Relationship to political freedom ===\nIn his book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', [[Friedrich Hayek]] asserts that the free market understanding of [[economic freedom]] as present in capitalism is a requisite of [[political freedom]]. He argues that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion. [[Milton Friedman]], [[Andrew Brennan (economist)|Andrew Brennan]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] also promoted this view. Friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminishes their power to coerce. Some of Friedman's views were shared by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive.<ref>{{cite book |author=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|journal=Nature|volume=154|issue=3911|pages=473\u201374|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=1944|isbn=978-0-226-32061-8|bibcode=1944Natur.154..473C|doi=10.1038/154473a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bellamy, Richard|title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-56354-3|page=60}}</ref> [[Freedom House]], an American think tank that conducts international research on, and advocates for, democracy, political freedom and human rights, has argued \"there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom [[Freedom in the World|as measured by Freedom House]] and economic freedom [[Index of Economic Freedom|as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey]]\".<ref>Adrian Karatnycky.

They vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies. The common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are based on the production of goods and services for profit, predominantly market-based allocation of resources and they are structured upon the accumulation of capital. They include advanced capitalism, corporate capitalism, finance capitalism, free-market capitalism, mercantilism, social capitalism, state capitalism and welfare capitalism. Other variants of capitalism include [[anarcho-capitalism]], [[community capitalism]], [[humanistic capitalism]], [[neo-capitalism]], [[state monopoly capitalism]], [[Supercapitalism (modern)|supercapitalism]] and [[technocapitalism]].\n\n=== Advanced ===\n{{Main|Advanced capitalism}}\nAdvanced capitalism is the situation that pertains to a society in which the [[capitalist model]] has been integrated and developed deeply and extensively for a prolonged period. Various writers identify [[Antonio Gramsci]] as an influential early theorist of advanced capitalism, even if he did not use the term himself. In his writings, Gramsci sought to explain how capitalism had adapted to avoid the revolutionary overthrow that had seemed inevitable in the 19th century.

It typically entails support for highly [[Competition (economics)|competitive markets]] and [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. ''Laissez-faire'' capitalism is a more extensive form of this free-market economy, but one in which the role of the state is limited to protecting [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]]. In [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] theory, property rights are protected by private firms and market-generated law. According to anarcho-capitalists, this entails property rights without statutory law through market-generated tort, contract and property law as well as the self-sustaining private industry.\n\n=== Mercantile ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\n{{See also|Protectionism}}\n[[File:Lloyds Subscription Room edited.jpg|thumb|The subscription room at [[Lloyd's of London]] in the early 19th century]]\nMercantilism is a nationalist form of early capitalism that came into existence approximately in the late 16th century. It is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to state-interest and imperialism; and consequently, the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad. An example of this is colonists living in America who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries (e.g. Britain, France and Portugal). Mercantilism was driven by the belief that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations\u2014it corresponds to the phase of capitalist development sometimes called the [[primitive accumulation of capital]].\n\n=== Social ===\n{{Main|Social market economy}}\n{{See also|Nordic model}}\nA social market economy is a free-market or mixed-market capitalist system, sometimes classified as a [[coordinated market economy]], where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum, but the state provides significant services in the area of social security, unemployment benefits and recognition of [[labor rights]] through national [[collective bargaining]] arrangements. This model is prominent in Western and Northern European countries as well as Japan, albeit in slightly different configurations. The vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model.\n\n[[Rhine capitalism]] is the contemporary model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental Western Europe today.\n\n=== State ===\n{{Main|State capitalism}}\nState capitalism is a capitalist market economy dominated by state-owned enterprises, where the state enterprises are organized as commercial, profit-seeking businesses. The designation has been used broadly throughout the 20th century to designate a number of different economic forms, ranging from state-ownership in market economies to the command economies of the former [[Eastern Bloc]]. According to Aldo Musacchio, a professor at Harvard Business School, state capitalism is a system in which governments, whether democratic or autocratic, exercise a widespread influence on the economy either through direct ownership or various subsidies. Musacchio notes a number of differences between today's state capitalism and its predecessors. In his opinion, gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies: the world's largest state-owned enterprises are now traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors. Contemporary state capitalism is associated with the [[East Asian model of capitalism]], [[dirigisme]] and the economy of Norway.<ref>{{cite news |last=Musacchio |first=Aldo |url=http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/802 |title=Economist Debates: State capitalism: Statements |work=The Economist}}</ref> Alternatively, [[Merriam-Webster]] defines state capitalism as \"an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control\".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/state%20capitalism State capitalism].

Today, welfare capitalism is most often associated with the models of capitalism found in Central Mainland and Northern Europe such as the [[Nordic model]], [[social market economy]] and [[Rhine capitalism]]. In some cases, welfare capitalism exists within a mixed economy, but welfare states can and do exist independently of policies common to mixed economies such as [[state interventionism]] and extensive regulation.\n\nA mixed economy is a largely market-based capitalist economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and [[economic interventionism]] through macroeconomic policies intended to correct [[market failure]]s, reduce unemployment and keep inflation low. The degree of intervention in markets varies among different countries. Some mixed economies such as France under [[dirigisme]] also featured a degree of [[Indicative planning|indirect economic planning]] over a largely capitalist-based economy.\n\nMost modern capitalist economies are defined as mixed economies to some degree.\n\n== Capital accumulation ==\n{{Main|Capital accumulation}}\n{{Further|Money}}\nThe [[accumulation of capital]] is the process of \"making money\", or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production. Capitalism is based on the accumulation of capital, whereby [[financial capital]] is invested in order to make a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation. In Marxian economic theory, this dynamic is called the [[law of value]]. Capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism, where economic activity is structured around the accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], defined as investment in order to realize a financial profit.<ref name=\"Economist definition\">{{cite news | title = Economics A\u2013Z: ''Capital'' | url = http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/c#node-21529870 | website = [[economist.com|The Economist]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref> In this context, \"capital\" is defined as money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).<ref name=\"MIA definition\">{{cite web | title = Encyclopedia of Marxism \u2013 Glossary of terms: ''Capital'' | url = http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capital | website = [[Marxists Internet Archive]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn mainstream [[economics]], [[accounting]] and [[Marxian economics]], capital accumulation is often equated with [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]] of profit income or saving, especially in [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] capital goods. The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation. In modern [[macroeconomics]] and [[econometrics]], the phrase \"[[capital formation]]\" is often used in preference to \"accumulation\", though the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) refers nowadays to \"accumulation\". The term \u201caccumulation\u201d is occasionally used in [[national accounts]].\n\n=== Background ===\nAccumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments, the amount of income that is reinvested, or as the change in the value of assets owned (the increase in the value of the capital stock). Using company [[balance sheet]]s, [[tax]] data and direct [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as a basis, government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of [[national accounts]], national [[balance of payments]] and [[flow of funds]] statistics. The [[Federal Reserve|Reserve Banks]] and the [[Treasury]] usually provide interpretations and analysis of this data. Standard indicators include [[capital formation]], [[gross fixed capital formation]], [[fixed capital]], household asset wealth and [[foreign direct investment]].\n\nOrganisations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the UNCTAD, the [[World Bank Group]], the [[OECD]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]] used national investment data to estimate world trends. The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], [[Eurostat]] and the Japan Statistical Office provide data on the United States, Europe and Japan respectively. Other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]], [[Forbes]], [[The Economist]], [[Business Week]]'' and so on as well as various corporate \"[[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]]\" organisations and [[non-governmental organisation]] publications. A reputable scientific journal is the ''Review of Income & Wealth''. In the case of the United States, the \"Analytical Perspectives\" document (an annex to the yearly budget) provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country.\n\nIn [[Karl Marx]]' economic theory, capital accumulation refers to the operation whereby profits are reinvested increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital is viewed by Marx as expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value, extracted as profits and expressed as money. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset [[Value (economics)|value]] in search of additional value or [[surplus-value]]. This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established. Capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in [[Confiscation|expropriation]], both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or \"trading up\", but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else without compensation. [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] calls this [[accumulation by dispossession]].\n\nThe continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. However, capital accumulation may also confront resistance when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a [[Strike action|strike]] by investors or workers, or [[consumer resistance]]).\n\n=== Concentration and centralisation ===\nAccording to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and centralization in the hands of the wealthy. Marx explains: \"It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals. [...] Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many. [...] The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, ''caeteris paribus'', on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages [...] It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm|title=Economic Manuscripts: Capital Vol. I \u2013 Chapter Twenty-Five|first=Karl|last=Marx}}</ref>\n\n=== Rate of accumulation ===\nIn [[Marxian economics]], the rate of accumulation is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the [[stock and flow|stock]] of capital in an accounting period; and (2) the proportion of realised [[surplus-value]] or profit-income which is reinvested, rather than consumed. This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay, the realised turnover, surplus-value or profit and reinvestments (e.g. the writings of the economist [[Micha\u0142 Kalecki]]).\n\nOther things being equal, the greater the amount of profit-income that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes, the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be. However, earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment. This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about \"how much to spend, and how much to save\".\n\nIn a boom period of capitalism, the growth of investments is cumulative, i.e. one investment leads to another, leading to a constantly expanding market, an expanding [[labor force]] and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn a stagnating, decadent capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces, real estate, financial speculation and luxury consumption. In that case, income from [[value added|value-adding]] production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow. The inverse is also true and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] emphasised that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on (1) the division of a society's social product between \"[[necessary product]]\" and \"[[surplus product]]\"; and (2) the division of the surplus product between [[investment]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. In turn, this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of [[competition]] among capitalists, competition between capitalists and workers and competition between workers. The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors as it also involved social factors and [[economic power|power]] relationships.\n\n=== Circuit of capital accumulation from production ===\nStrictly speaking, capital has accumulated only when realised [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] income has been reinvested in capital assets. As suggested in the first volume of Marx' ''[[Das Kapital]]'', the process of capital accumulation in production has at least seven distinct but linked moments:\n* The initial investment of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (which could be borrowed capital) in [[means of production]] and [[labor power]].\n* The command over [[surplus-labour]] and its appropriation.\n* The [[valorisation]] (increase in value) of capital through production of new outputs.\n* The appropriation of the new output produced by employees, containing the added value.\n* The realisation of [[surplus-value]] through output sales.\n* The appropriation of realised surplus-value as (profit) income after deduction of costs.\n* The reinvestment of profit income in production.\n\nAll of these moments do not refer simply to an \"economic\" or commercial process. Rather, they assume the existence of legal, social, cultural and economic power conditions, without which creation, distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur. This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists, or where people refuse to trade.\n\n=== Simple and expanded reproduction ===\nIn the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx continues the story and shows that with the aid of bank [[credit (finance)|credit]] capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another, alternately taking the form of money capital (liquid deposits, securities and so on), commodity capital (tradable products, real estate and the like), or production capital ([[means of production]] and labor power).\n\nHis discussion of the simple and expanded [[reproduction (economics)|reproduction]] of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole. At simple reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given [[living standard]]; the stock of capital stays constant. At expanded reproduction, more product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard (a [[surplus product]]); the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production.\n\nThe bourgeois claim there is no [[economic law]] according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realised by Dept. 1\u2014producers of means of production\u2014exactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (p.&nbsp;524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced, but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (p.&nbsp;514).\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] introduced the additional concept of contracted economic reproduction, i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or de[[valorisation]].\n\nBalanced [[economic growth]] requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions. However, markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance and in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between [[supply and demand]]: inequality is the motor of growth. This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal, even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long-time. Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and [[protectionism]].\n\n=== Capital accumulation as social relation ===\n\"Accumulation of capital\" sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist [[social relations]] (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e. the expansion of the size of the [[proletariat]] and of the wealth owned by the [[bourgeoisie]].\n\nThis interpretation emphasises that capital ownership, predicated on command over labor, is a social relation: the growth of capital implies the growth of the [[working class]] (a \"[[law of accumulation]]\"). In the first volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s theory of colonisation: {{Quotation|Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies, property in money, means of subsistence, machines, and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative\u2014the wage-worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will. He discovered that capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things. Mr. Peel, he moans, took with him from England to Swan River, West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of \u00a350,000. Mr. Peel had the foresight to bring with him, besides, 3,000 persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once arrived at his destination, 'Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.' Unhappy Mr. Peel, who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River!|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 33}}\n\nIn the [[Capital, Volume III|third volume]] of ''Das Kapital'', Marx refers to the \"fetishism of capital\" reaching its highest point with interest-bearing capital because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything: {{Quotation|The relations of capital assume their most externalised and most fetish-like form in interest-bearing capital. We have here <math>M - M'</math>, money creating more money, self-expanding value, without the process that effectuates these two extremes. In merchant's capital, <math>M - C - M'</math>, there is at least the general form of the capitalistic movement, although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation, so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation; but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation, not the product of a mere thing. [...] This is obliterated in <math>M - M'</math>, the form of interest-bearing capital. [...] The thing (money, commodity, value) is now capital even as a mere thing, and capital appears as a mere thing. The result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself. It depends on the owner of the money, i.e., of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form, whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital. In interest-bearing capital, therefore, this automatic fetish, self-expanding value, money generating money, are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birth-marks of its origin. The [[Social relations|social relation]] is consummated in the relation of a thing, of money, to itself. Instead of the actual transformation of money into capital, we see here only form without content.|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 24|source=}}\n\n== Wage labour ==\n{{Main|Wage labour}}\n[[File:Worker 9.JPG|thumb|An industrial [[worker]] amidst heavy steel [[semi-product]]s (Kinex Bearings, [[Byt\u010da]], [[Slovakia]], c. 1995\u20132000)]]\n[[Wage labour]] refers to the sale of [[Labour economics|labour]] under a formal or informal [[employment contract]] to an [[employer]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinfeld|2009|p=3}}: \"All labor contracts were/are designed legally to bind a worker in one way or another to fulfill the labor obligations the worker has undertaken.

Print.</ref>\n\nCritics of the capitalist mode of production see wage labour as a major, if not defining, aspect of hierarchical industrial systems. Most opponents of the institution support [[worker self-management]] and [[economic democracy]] as alternatives to both wage labour and to capitalism. While most opponents of the wage system<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> blame the capitalist owners of the means of production for its existence, most [[anarchists]] and other [[libertarian socialists]] also hold the state as equally responsible as it exists as a tool utilised by capitalists to subsidise themselves and protect the institution of [[privatism|private ownership of the means of production]]. As some opponents of wage labour take influence from Marxist propositions, many are opposed to [[private property]], but maintain respect for [[personal property]].\n\n=== Types ===\nThe most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct, or \"full-time\", employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time (from a few years to the entire career of the worker) in return for a money-wage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff. However, wage labour takes many other forms and explicit as opposed to implicit (i.e. conditioned by local labour and tax law) contracts are not uncommon. Economic history shows a great variety of ways in which labour is traded and exchanged. The differences show up in the form of:\n* Employment status: a worker could be employed full-time, part-time, or on a casual basis. He or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only, or on a permanent basis. Part-time wage labour could combine with part-time [[self-employment]]. The worker could be employed also as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]].\n* Civil (legal) status: the worker could for example be a free citizen, an [[indentured labour]]er, the subject of [[forced labour]] (including some prison or army labour); a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task, they could be a [[slavery|semi-slave]] or a [[serfdom|serf]] bound to the land who is hired out part of the time. So the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis, or on a more or less involuntary basis, in which there are many gradations.\n* Method of payment (remuneration or [[Compensation of employees|compensation]]): the work done could be paid \"in cash\" (a money-wage) or \"in kind\" (through receiving goods and/or services), or in the form of \"[[Piecework|piece rates]]\" where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces. In some cases, the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services, or in the form of [[Employee stock option|stock options]] or [[Share (finance)|shares]] in an enterprise.\n* Method of hiring: the worker might engage in a labour-contract on his or her own initiative, or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group. However, he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary (such as an employment agency) to a third party. In this case, he or she is paid by the intermediary, but works for a third party which pays the intermediary. In some cases, labour is [[Subcontracting|subcontracted]] several times, with several intermediaries. Another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority, or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise together with the [[means of production]].\n\n== Effects of war ==\n[[File:Alfred T. Palmer - Assembling the North American B-25 Mitchell at Kansas City, Kansas (USA).jpg|thumb|The common view among economic historians is that the [[Great Depression]] ended with the advent of World War II (assembling the North American [[B-25 Mitchell]] at [[Kansas City]], 1942)]]\nWar typically causes the diversion, destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war. Many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war. War driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war. Often this has induced laws against perceived and real [[war profiteering]].\n\nThe total hours worked in the United States rose by 34 percent during World War II, even though the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by 11 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ellen R. |last=Grattan |first2=Lee E. |last2=Ohanian |title=The macroeconomic effects of big fiscal shocks: the case of world war II |journal=Minneapolis Federal Reserve, Working Paper 599 |date=December 1999 |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp599.pdf }}</ref>\n\nWar destruction can be illustrated by looking at [[World War II]]. Industrial war damage was heaviest in Japan, where 1/4 of factory buildings and 1/3 of plant and equipment were destroyed; 1/7 of electric power-generating capacity was destroyed and 6/7 of oil refining capacity. The Japanese merchant fleet lost 80% of their ships. In Germany in 1944, when air attacks were heaviest, 6.5% of machine tools were damaged or destroyed, but around 90% were later repaired. About 10% of steel production capacity was lost. In Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes, ships, tanks and so on were built and then lost or destroyed.\n\nGermany's total war damage was estimated at about 17.5% of the pre-war total capital stock by value, i.e. about 1/6. In the [[Berlin]] area alone, there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities. In 1945, less than 10% of the railways were still operating. 2,395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7,500 bridges, 10,000 locomotives and more than 100,000 goods wagons were destroyed. Less than 40% of the remaining locomotives were operational.\n\nHowever, by the first quarter of 1946 European rail traffic, which was given assistance and preferences (by Western appointed military governors) for resources and material as an essential asset, regained its prewar operational level. At the end of the year, 90% of Germany's railway lines were operating again. In retrospect, the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing.\n\nInitially, in May 1945 newly installed United States president [[Harry S. Truman]]'s directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of Germany. In fact, the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level; the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of pre-war output. These plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted. In 1946, over 10% of Germany's physical capital stock (plant and equipment) was also dismantled and confiscated, most of it going to the Soviet Union. By 1947, industrial production in Germany was at 1/3 of the 1938 level and industrial investment at about 1/2 the 1938 level.\n\nThe first big strike-wave in the [[Ruhr]] occurred in early 1947\u2014it was about food rations and housing, but soon there were demands for nationalisation. However, the United States appointed military governor (Newman) stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations. The clear message was \"no work, no eat\". As the military controls in Western Germany were nearly all relinquished and the Germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with [[Marshall Plan]] aid things rapidly improved. By 1951, German industrial production had overtaken the prewar level. The Marshall Aid funds were important, but after the currency reform (which permitted German capitalists to revalue their assets) and the establishment of a new political system much more important was the commitment of the United States to rebuilding German capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government, rather than keeping Germany in a weak position. Initially, average [[real wages]] remained low, lower even than in 1938, until the early 1950s while profitability was unusually high. So the total investment fund, aided by credits, was also high, resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools. This was called the [[German economic miracle]] or ''Wirtschaftswunder''.<ref>Armstrong, Glyn & Harrison, ''Capitalism since world war 2''. Fontana, 1984.

However, damage to [[human capital]] has been much more devastating in terms of fatalities (in the case of World War II, about 55 million deaths), permanent physical disability, enduring ethnic hostility and psychological injuries which have effects for at least several generations.\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{Main|Criticism of capitalism}}\n[[File:Anti-capitalism color\u2014 Restored.png|thumb|The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster \"[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]\" (1911)]]\nCritics of capitalism associate the economic system with [[social inequality]]; unfair [[distribution of wealth]] and power; [[Economic materialism|materialism]]; repression of workers and [[trade union]]ists; [[social alienation]]; [[economic inequality]]; [[unemployment]]; and economic instability.

For Marx, the capitalist stage of development or \"[[bourgeois]] society\" represented the most advanced form of social organization to date, but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide [[socialism|socialist]] or [[communism|communist]] transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic, then capitalist and finally working class rule was reached.<ref>''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''</ref><ref>\"To Marx, the problem of reconstituting society did not arise from some prescription, motivated by his personal predilections; it followed, as an iron-clad historical necessity\u2014on the one hand, from the productive forces grown to powerful maturity; on the other, from the impossibility further to organize these forces according to the will of the [[law of value]].\" \u2014 [[Leon Trotsky]], \"Marxism in our Time\", 1939 (Inevitability of Socialism), [http://wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/time-n01.shtml WSWS.org]</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Adam Smith]], Marx distinguished the [[use value]] of commodities from their [[exchange value]] in the market. According to Marx, capital is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [[labor power]] had itself become a commodity under capitalism and the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.\n\nThis difference in values, he argues, constitutes [[surplus value]], which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', Marx argues that the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers\u2014all prior class societies had extracted [[surplus labor]], but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm|title=Capital.

If these conditions do not hold, then the [[Marshallian surplus|Marshallian]] model cannot be sustained. [[Piero Sraffa|Sraffa's]] critique focused on the inconsistency (except in implausible circumstances) of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good.<ref>Avi J. Cohen, \"'The Laws of Returns Under Competitive Conditions': Progress in Microeconomics Since Sraffa (1926)?\", ''Eastern Economic Journal'', {{abbr|vol.|volume}} 9, no. 3 (Jul.\u2013Sep.): 1983)</ref> The notability of Sraffa's critique is also demonstrated by [[Paul A. Samuelson]]'s comments and engagements with it over many years, for example:\n:What a cleaned-up version of Sraffa (1926) establishes is how nearly empty are all of Marshall's partial equilibrium boxes. To a logical purist of Wittgenstein and Sraffa class, the Marshallian partial equilibrium box of constant cost is even more empty than the box of increasing cost.<ref>Paul A. Samuelson, \"Reply\" in ''Critical Essays on Piero Sraffa's Legacy in Economics'' (edited by H.D. Kurz), Cambridge University Press, 2000</ref>\n\nAggregate excess demand in a market is the difference between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as a function of price. In the model with an upward-sloping supply curve and downward-sloping demand curve, the aggregate excess demand function only intersects the axis at one point, namely at the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. The [[Sonnenschein\u2013Mantel\u2013Debreu theorem]] shows that the standard model cannot be rigorously derived in general from [[general equilibrium theory]].<ref>Alan Kirman, \"The Intrinsic Limits of Modern Economic Theory: The Emperor has No Clothes\", ''The Economic Journal'', {{abbr|vol.|volume}} 99, no. 395, Supplement: Conference Papers (1989): pp. 126\u201339</ref>\n\nThe model of prices being determined by supply and demand assumes [[perfect competition]].

[[Friedrich Hayek]] considered the phenomenon of [[self-organisation]] as underpinning capitalism. Prices serve as a signal as to the urgent and unfilled wants of people and the opportunity to earn profits if successful, or absorb losses if resources are used poorly or left idle, gives entrepreneurs [[incentive]] to use their [[Dispersed knowledge|knowledge]] and resources to satisfy those wants.

Simple [[commodity]] exchange and consequently simple commodity production, which is the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history. [[Classical Islam|Arabs]] promulgated capitalist economic policies such as free trade and banking. Their use of [[Indo-Arabic numerals]] facilitated [[bookkeeping]].  These innovations migrated to Europe through trade partners in cities such as Venice and Pisa.  The Italian mathematician [[Fibonacci]] traveled the Mediterranean talking to Arab traders and returned to popularize the use of Indo-Arabic numerals in Europe.<ref name=\"Koehler, Benedikt\">Koehler, Benedikt. ''Early Islam and the Birth of Capitalism'',  \"In Baghdad, by the early tenth century a fully-fledged banking sector had come into being...\" p. 2, (Lexington Books, 2014).</ref>\n\nCapital and commercial trade thus existed for much of history, but it did not lead to industrialization or dominate the production process of society. That required a set of conditions, including specific technologies of mass production, the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production, a class of workers willing to sell their [[labor power]] for a living, a [[legal]] framework promoting commerce, a physical infrastructure allowing the circulation of goods on a large scale and security for private accumulation. Many of these conditions do not currently exist in many [[Third World]] countries, although there is plenty of capital and labor. The obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are therefore less technical and more social, cultural and political.\n\n=== Agrarian capitalism ===\nThe economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16th-century England as the [[manorial system]] had broken down and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. Instead of a [[serf]]-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy. The system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit; the weakened coercive power of the [[aristocracy]] to extract peasant [[Excess supply|surpluses]] encouraged them to try better methods, and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods in order to flourish in a competitive [[labor economics|labor market]]. Terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brenner|first1=Robert|title=The Agrarian Roots of European Capitalism|journal=Past & Present|date=1 January 1982|issue=97|pages=16\u2013113|jstor=650630}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://monthlyreview.org/1998/07/01/the-agrarian-origins-of-capitalism|title= The Agrarian Origins of Capitalism|accessdate= 17 December 2012|date= July 1998}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 17th century, England was a centralized state in which much of the feudal order of [[Medieval Europe]] had been swept away. This centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and by a disproportionately large capital city, [[London]].

Moderate critics have recently challenged this, stating that the current influence lobbying groups have had on policy in the United States is a contradiction, given the approval of [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]]. This has led people to question the idea that competitive capitalism promotes political freedom. The ruling on Citizens United allows corporations to spend undisclosed and unregulated amounts of money on political campaigns, shifting outcomes to the interests and undermining true democracy. As explained in [[Robin Hahnel]]\u2019s writings, the centerpiece of the ideological defense of the free market system is the concept of economic freedom and that supporters equate economic democracy with economic freedom and claim that only the free market system can provide economic freedom. According to Hahnel, there are a few objections to the premise that capitalism offers freedom through economic freedom. These objections are guided by critical questions about who or what decides whose freedoms are more protected. Often, the question of inequality is brought up when discussing how well capitalism promotes democracy. An argument that could stand is that economic growth can lead to inequality given that capital can be acquired at different rates by different people. In ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', [[Thomas Piketty]] of the [[Paris School of Economics]] asserts that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting [[Wealth concentration|concentration of wealth]] can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built.<ref>[[Thomas Piketty|Piketty, Thomas]] (2014).

In mixed economies, which are almost universal today,<ref>James Fulcher, ''Capitalism A Very Short Introduction'', \"...in the wake of the 1970 crisis, the neoliberal model of capitalism became intellectually and ideologically dominant\", p. 58, Oxford, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-19-280218-7}}.</ref> markets continue to play a dominant role, but they are regulated to some extent by the state in order to correct [[market failure]]s, promote [[social welfare]], conserve [[natural resource]]s, fund [[military|defense]] and [[public safety]] or other rationale. In [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on [[state-owned enterprises]] or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital.\n\nSupply is the amount of a good or service that is available for purchase or sale. Demand is the measure of value for a good that people are willing to buy at a given time. Prices tend to rise when demand for an available resource increases or its supply diminishes and fall with demand or when supply increases.{{According to whom|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nCompetition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. Adherents of the capitalist theory believe that competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. [[Monopoly|Monopolies]] or [[cartels]] can develop, especially if there is no competition. A monopoly occurs when a firm is granted exclusivity over a market. Hence, the firm can engage in [[rent seeking]] behaviors such as limiting output and raising prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and prices.\n\nGovernments have implemented legislation for the purpose of preventing the creation of monopolies and cartels. In 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act became the first legislation passed by the United States Congress to limit monopolies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp|title=Monopoly|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=24 November 2003|work=Investopedia|access-date=2 March 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Profit motive ===\n{{Main|Profit motive}}\nThe [[profit motive]], in the theory in capitalism, is the desire to earn income in the form of profit. Stated differently, the reason for a business's existence is to turn a profit. The profit motive functions according to [[rational choice theory]], or the theory that individuals tend to pursue what is in their own best interests. Accordingly, businesses seek to benefit themselves and/or their shareholders by maximizing profit.\n\nIn capitalist theoretics, the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently. For instance, [[Austrian economist]] [[Henry Hazlitt]] explains: \"If there is no profit in making an article, it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected: the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself\".<ref>Hazlitt, Henry. \"The Function of Profits\". ''Economics in One Lesson''. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. Web. 22 April 2013.</ref> In other words, profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing. Theoretically{{according to whom|date=March 2020}}, in free and competitive markets maximising profit ensures that resources are not wasted.\n\n=== Private property ===\n{{Main|Private property}}\nThe relationship between the [[state (polity)|state]], its formal mechanisms and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] is a contemporary Peruvian economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=The mystery of capital|author=Hernando de Soto|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital, which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy. A number of Marxian economists have argued that the [[Enclosure Acts]] in England and similar legislation elsewhere were an integral part of capitalist [[primitive accumulation]] and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm |title=Capital, v. 1.

Private money-making in various forms (renting, banking, merchant trade, production for profit and so on) preceded the development of the capitalist mode of production as such. The capitalist mode of production proper based on wage-labour and private ownership of the means of production and on industrial technology began to grow rapidly in Western Europe from the [[Industrial Revolution]], later extending to most of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe term capitalist mode of production is defined by [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], extraction of [[surplus value]] by the owning class for the purpose of [[capital accumulation]], [[Wage labour|wage-based labour]] and at least as far as [[Commodity|commodities]] are concerned being [[Market economy|market-based]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capitalism | title=Capitalism. | publisher=marxists.org | accessdate=8 July 2011 | author=Encyclopedia of Marxism at marxism.org}}</ref>\n\nCapitalism in the form of money-making activity has existed in the shape of merchants and money-lenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in [[simple commodity production]] (hence the reference to \"[[merchant capitalism]]\") since the beginnings of civilisation. What is specific about the \"capitalist mode of production\" is that most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market (i.e. they are commodities) and essentially all production is in this mode.<ref name=\"Modern Economics 1986, p. 54\" /> For example, in flourishing feudalism most or all of the factors of production including labour are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind, it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade.<ref name=ch32/> This has the important consequence that the whole organisation of the production process is reshaped and re-organised to conform with economic [[bounded rationality|rationality as bounded]] by capitalism, which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs (wages, non-labour factor costs, sales and profits) rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall\u2014that is, the whole process is organised and re-shaped in order to conform to \"commercial logic\".

It posulates that in a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]], the [[unit price]] for a particular [[Good (economics)|good]] will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded by consumers (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied by producers (at the current price), resulting in an [[economic equilibrium]] for price and [[Output (economics)|quantity]].\n\nThe four basic \"laws\" of [[Supply (economics)|supply]] and [[demand]], as described by [[David Besanko]] and [[Ronald Braeutigam]], are:<ref name=\"besanko-and-braeutigam-2010\">{{Cite book | last = Besanko | first = David | last2 = Braeutigam | first2 = Ronald | year = 2010 | title = Microeconomics | publisher = Wiley | edition = 4th }}</ref>{{rp|37}}\n# If demand increases (demand curve shifts to the right) and supply remains unchanged, then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n# If demand decreases (demand curve shifts to the left) and supply remains unchanged, then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply increases (supply curve shifts to the right), then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply decreases (supply curve shifts to the left), then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n\n=== Graphical representation of supply and demand ===\nAlthough it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of the price of the goods, the standard graphical representation, usually attributed to [[Alfred Marshall]], has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the opposite of the standard convention for the representation of a mathematical function.\n\nSince determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply-demand diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves (often described as \"shifts\" in the curves). By contrast, responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves.\n\n==== Supply schedule ====\nA supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. Under the assumption of [[perfect competition]], supply is determined by [[marginal cost]]. That is: firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive.\n\nA hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply and shifting costs up while a discount would increase supply, shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases.\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a supply curve requires the firm to be a perfect competitor (i.e. to have no influence over the market price). This is true because each point on the supply curve is the answer to the question \"If this firm is ''faced with'' this potential price, how much output will it be able to and willing to sell?\". If a firm has market power, its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price, therefore the firm is not \"faced with\" any price and the question becomes less relevant.\n\nEconomists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and the market supply curve. The market supply curve is obtained by summing the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the supply curve individual firms' supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.\n\nEconomists also distinguish the short-run market supply curve from the long-run market supply curve. In this context, two things are assumed constant by definition of the short run: the availability of one or more fixed inputs (typically [[physical capital]]) and the number of firms in the industry. In the long-run, firms can adjust their holdings of physical capital, enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long-run potential competitors can [[Market entry strategy|enter]] or exit the industry in response to market conditions. For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.\n\nThe determinants of supply are:\n# Production costs: how much a goods costs to be produced. Production costs are the cost of the inputs; primarily labor, capital, energy and materials. They depend on the technology used in production and/or technological advances. See [[productivity]].\n# Firms' expectations about future prices.\n# Number of suppliers.\n\n==== Demand schedule ====\nA demand schedule, depicted graphically as the [[demand curve]], represents the amount of some [[Good (economics)|goods]] that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming all determinants of demand other than the price of the good in question, such as income, tastes and preferences, the price of [[substitute good]]s and the price of [[complementary good]]s, remain the same. According to the [[law of demand]], the demand curve is almost always represented as downward-sloping, meaning that as price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good.<ref name=\"axes\">Note that unlike most [[Graph of a function|graphs]], supply & demand curves are plotted with the independent variable (price) on the vertical axis and the dependent variable (quantity supplied or demanded) on the horizontal axis.</ref>\n\nJust like the supply curves reflect [[marginal cost]] curves, demand curves are determined by [[marginal utility]] curves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marginal Utility and Demand|url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=marginal+utility+and+demand|accessdate=9 February 2007}}</ref> Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the [[opportunity cost]] determined by the price\u2014that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time.\n\nWhile the aforementioned demand curve is generally downward-sloping, there may be rare examples of goods that have upward-sloping demand curves. Two different hypothetical types of goods with upward-sloping demand curves are [[Giffen good]]s (an inferior, but [[Staple food|staple]] good) and [[Veblen good]]s (goods made more fashionable by a higher price).\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor\u2014that is, that the purchaser has no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question \"If this buyer is faced with this potential price, how much of the product will it purchase?\". If a buyer has market power, so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price, then the buyer is not \"faced with\" any price and the question is meaningless.\n\nLike with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve. The market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the demand curve individuals' demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.\n\nThe determinants of demand are:\n# Income.\n# Tastes and preferences.\n# Prices of related goods and services.\n# Consumers' expectations about future prices and incomes that can be checked.\n# Number of potential consumers.\n\n=== Equilibrium ===\n{{Further|Economic equilibrium}}\nIn the context of supply and demand, economic equilibrium refers to a state where economic forces such as [[supply and demand]] are balanced and in the absence of external influences the ([[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]]) values of economic variables will not change. For example, in the standard text-book model of [[perfect competition]] equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Hal Varian |first=Hal R. |last=Varian |title=Microeconomic Analysis |edition=Third |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-393-95735-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/microeconomicana00vari_0 }}</ref> Market equilibrium in this case refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by [[Law of supply and demand|buyers]] is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by [[Law of supply and demand|sellers]]. This price is often called the competitive price or [[market clearing]] price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes and the quantity is called \"competitive quantity\" or market clearing quantity.\n\n=== Partial equilibrium ===\n{{Main|Partial equilibrium}}\nPartial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.\n\nJain proposes (attributed to [[George Stigler]]): \"A partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data, a standard example is price of a single product, the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Jain|first=T.R.|title=Microeconomics and Basic Mathematics|year=2006|publisher=VK Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-87140-89-4|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUUoFwco2Z8C}}</ref>\n\nThe supply and demand model is a partial equilibrium model of [[economic equilibrium]], where the clearance on the [[Market (economics)|market]] of some specific [[good (economics)|goods]] is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all [[substitute good|substitutes]] and [[complement good|complements]] as well as [[income]] levels of [[consumer]]s are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a [[general equilibrium]] model which includes an entire economy.\n\nHere the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[Pareto Efficiency|efficiency]] and [[comparative statics]]. The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach make the model considerably more tractable, but it may produce results which while seemingly precise do not effectively model real world economic phenomena.\n\nPartial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any.\n\nHence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Walras]] first formalised the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] and English political economist [[Alfred Marshall]] who developed tractable models to analyse an economic system.\n\n=== Empirical estimation ===\nDemand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity and other [[data]] with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with [[System of linear equations|simultaneous-equation]] methods of estimation in [[econometrics]]. Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant \"structural coefficients\", the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The [[Identification (parameter)|parameter identification problem]] is a common issue in \"structural estimation\". Typically, data on [[exogenous variable]]s (that is, variables other than price and quantity, both of which are [[endogenous variable]]s) are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to \"structural estimation\" is [[Reduced form|reduced-form]] estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables.\n\n=== Macroeconomic uses of demand and supply ===\nDemand and supply have also been generalised to explain [[macroeconomic]] variables in a [[market economy]], including the [[Real GDP|quantity of total output]] and the general [[price level]]. The [[AD-AS model|Aggregate Demand\u2013Aggregate Supply model]] may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to [[microeconomic]] uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such [[macroeconomic]] counterparts as [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate [[money supply]] and money demand to [[interest rate]]s and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates.\n\n=== History ===\nAccording to Hamid S. Hosseini, the \"power of supply and demand\" was discussed to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century [[Mamluk]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], who wrote: \"If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down\".<ref name=Hosseini>{{cite book |title=A Companion to the History of Economic Thought |chapter=Contributions of Medieval Muslim Scholars to the History of Economics and their Impact: A Refutation of the Schumpeterian Great Gap |last=Hosseini |first=Hamid S. |editor=Biddle, Jeff E. |editor2=Davis, Jon B. |editor3=Samuels, Warren J. |year=2003 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-631-22573-7 |doi=10.1002/9780470999059.ch3 |pages=28\u201345 [28 & 38]}} (citing Hamid S.

In this description, demand is [[Economic rent|rent]]: \"The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers\" and \"that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent\".\n\nThe phrase \"supply and demand\" was first used by [[James Denham-Steuart]] in his ''Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy'', published in 1767. [[Adam Smith]] used the phrase in his 1776 book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', and [[David Ricardo]] titled one chapter of his 1817 work ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' \"On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price\".<ref name=Humphrey>Thomas M.

In ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', Ricardo more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand. [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his 1838 ''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth'', including diagrams.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the marginalist school of thought emerged. This field mainly was started by [[William Stanley Jevons|Stanley Jevons]], [[Carl Menger]] and [[L\u00e9on Walras]]. The key idea was that the price was set by the most expensive price\u2014that is, the price at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price.\n\nIn his 1870 essay \"On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand\", [[Fleeming Jenkin]] in the course of \"introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature\" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein,<ref>A.D.

In most cases, the government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. However, many countries have [[minimum wage]] laws and minimum safety standards.\n\nUnder some versions of capitalism, the government carries out a number of economic functions, such as issuing money, supervising public utilities, and enforcing private contracts. Many countries have [[competition law]]s that prohibit monopolies and cartels. Despite anti-monopoly laws, large corporations can form near-monopolies in some industries. Such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market and then raise them again once the threat of competition is reduced. In many countries, public utilities such as electricity, heating fuel and communications are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation due to high economies of scale.\n\nGovernment agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting, as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control such factors as inflation and unemployment.<ref>\"Capitalism.\" World Book Encyclopedia. 1988. p. 194.</ref>\n\n=== Relationship to political freedom ===\nIn his book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', [[Friedrich Hayek]] asserts that the free market understanding of [[economic freedom]] as present in capitalism is a requisite of [[political freedom]]. He argues that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion. [[Milton Friedman]], [[Andrew Brennan (economist)|Andrew Brennan]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] also promoted this view. Friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminishes their power to coerce. Some of Friedman's views were shared by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive.<ref>{{cite book |author=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|journal=Nature|volume=154|issue=3911|pages=473\u201374|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=1944|isbn=978-0-226-32061-8|bibcode=1944Natur.154..473C|doi=10.1038/154473a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bellamy, Richard|title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-56354-3|page=60}}</ref> [[Freedom House]], an American think tank that conducts international research on, and advocates for, democracy, political freedom and human rights, has argued \"there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom [[Freedom in the World|as measured by Freedom House]] and economic freedom [[Index of Economic Freedom|as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey]]\".<ref>Adrian Karatnycky.

They vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies. The common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are based on the production of goods and services for profit, predominantly market-based allocation of resources and they are structured upon the accumulation of capital. They include advanced capitalism, corporate capitalism, finance capitalism, free-market capitalism, mercantilism, social capitalism, state capitalism and welfare capitalism. Other variants of capitalism include [[anarcho-capitalism]], [[community capitalism]], [[humanistic capitalism]], [[neo-capitalism]], [[state monopoly capitalism]], [[Supercapitalism (modern)|supercapitalism]] and [[technocapitalism]].\n\n=== Advanced capitalism ===\n{{Main|Advanced capitalism}}\nAdvanced capitalism is the situation that pertains to a society in which the [[capitalist model]] has been integrated and developed deeply and extensively for a prolonged period. Various writers identify [[Antonio Gramsci]] as an influential early theorist of advanced capitalism, even if he did not use the term himself. In his writings, Gramsci sought to explain how capitalism had adapted to avoid the revolutionary overthrow that had seemed inevitable in the 19th century. At the heart of his explanation was the decline of raw coercion as a tool of class power, replaced by use of [[civil society]] institutions to manipulate public ideology in the capitalists' favour.<ref>Lears, T.J.

Habermas observed four general features that characterise advanced capitalism:\n# Concentration of industrial activity in a few large firms.\n# Constant reliance on the state to stabilise the economic system.\n# A formally democratic government that legitimises the activities of the state and dissipates opposition to the system.\n# The use of nominal wage increases to pacify the most restless segments of the work force.<ref>Habermas, 1988: 37, 75.</ref>\n\n=== Corporate capitalism ===\n{{Main|Corporate capitalism}}\n{{See also|Crony capitalism|State monopoly capitalism}}\nCorporate capitalism is a free or mixed-market capitalist economy characterized by the dominance of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations.\n\n=== Finance capitalism ===\n{{Main|Finance capitalism}}\n{{See also|Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)}}\nFinance capitalism is the subordination of processes of [[Production (economics)|production]] to the accumulation of [[money]] profits in a [[financial system]]. In their critique of capitalism, [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] both emphasise the role of [[Financial capital|finance capital]] as the determining and [[ruling-class]] interest in capitalist society, particularly in the [[Crisis of capitalism|latter stages]].<ref>[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ch03.htm ibid.

It typically entails support for highly [[Competition (economics)|competitive markets]] and [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. ''Laissez-faire'' capitalism is a more extensive form of this free-market economy, but one in which the role of the state is limited to protecting [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]]. In [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] theory, property rights are protected by private firms and market-generated law. According to anarcho-capitalists, this entails property rights without statutory law through market-generated tort, contract and property law as well as the self-sustaining private industry.\n\n=== Mercantilism ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\n{{See also|Protectionism}}\n[[File:Lloyds Subscription Room edited.jpg|thumb|The subscription room at [[Lloyd's of London]] in the early 19th century]]\nMercantilism is a nationalist form of early capitalism that came into existence approximately in the late 16th century. It is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to state-interest and imperialism; and consequently, the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad. An example of this is colonists living in America who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries (e.g. Britain, France and Portugal). Mercantilism was driven by the belief that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations\u2014it corresponds to the phase of capitalist development sometimes called the [[primitive accumulation of capital]].\n\n=== Social capitalism ===\n{{Main|Social market economy}}\n{{See also|Nordic model}}\nA social market economy is a free-market or mixed-market capitalist system, sometimes classified as a [[coordinated market economy]], where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum, but the state provides significant services in the area of social security, unemployment benefits and recognition of [[labor rights]] through national [[collective bargaining]] arrangements. This model is prominent in Western and Northern European countries as well as Japan, albeit in slightly different configurations. The vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model.\n\n[[Rhine capitalism]] is the contemporary model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental Western Europe today.\n\n=== State capitalism ===\n{{Main|State capitalism}}\nState capitalism is a capitalist market economy dominated by state-owned enterprises, where the state enterprises are organized as commercial, profit-seeking businesses. The designation has been used broadly throughout the 20th century to designate a number of different economic forms, ranging from state-ownership in market economies to the command economies of the former [[Eastern Bloc]]. According to Aldo Musacchio, a professor at Harvard Business School, state capitalism is a system in which governments, whether democratic or autocratic, exercise a widespread influence on the economy either through direct ownership or various subsidies. Musacchio notes a number of differences between today's state capitalism and its predecessors. In his opinion, gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies: the world's largest state-owned enterprises are now traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors. Contemporary state capitalism is associated with the [[East Asian model of capitalism]], [[dirigisme]] and the economy of Norway.<ref>{{cite news |last=Musacchio |first=Aldo |url=http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/802 |title=Economist Debates: State capitalism: Statements |work=The Economist}}</ref> Alternatively, [[Merriam-Webster]] defines state capitalism as \"an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control\".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/state%20capitalism State capitalism].

Today, welfare capitalism is most often associated with the models of capitalism found in Central Mainland and Northern Europe such as the [[Nordic model]], [[social market economy]] and [[Rhine capitalism]]. In some cases, welfare capitalism exists within a mixed economy, but welfare states can and do exist independently of policies common to mixed economies such as [[state interventionism]] and extensive regulation.\n\nA mixed economy is a largely market-based capitalist economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and [[economic interventionism]] through macroeconomic policies intended to correct [[market failure]]s, reduce unemployment and keep inflation low. The degree of intervention in markets varies among different countries. Some mixed economies such as France under [[dirigisme]] also featured a degree of [[Indicative planning|indirect economic planning]] over a largely capitalist-based economy.\n\nMost modern capitalist economies are defined as mixed economies to some degree.\n\n== Capital accumulation ==\n{{Main|Capital accumulation}}\n{{Further|Money}}\nThe [[accumulation of capital]] is the process of \"making money\", or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production. Capitalism is based on the accumulation of capital, whereby [[financial capital]] is invested in order to make a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation. In Marxian economic theory, this dynamic is called the [[law of value]]. Capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism, where economic activity is structured around the accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], defined as investment in order to realize a financial profit.<ref name=\"Economist definition\">{{cite news | title = Economics A\u2013Z: ''Capital'' | url = http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/c#node-21529870 | website = [[economist.com|The Economist]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref> In this context, \"capital\" is defined as money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).<ref name=\"MIA definition\">{{cite web | title = Encyclopedia of Marxism \u2013 Glossary of terms: ''Capital'' | url = http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capital | website = [[Marxists Internet Archive]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn mainstream [[economics]], [[accounting]] and [[Marxian economics]], capital accumulation is often equated with [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]] of profit income or saving, especially in [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] capital goods. The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation. In modern [[macroeconomics]] and [[econometrics]], the phrase \"[[capital formation]]\" is often used in preference to \"accumulation\", though the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) refers nowadays to \"accumulation\". The term \u201caccumulation\u201d is occasionally used in [[national accounts]].\n\n=== Background ===\nAccumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments, the amount of income that is reinvested, or as the change in the value of assets owned (the increase in the value of the capital stock). Using company [[balance sheet]]s, [[tax]] data and direct [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as a basis, government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of [[national accounts]], national [[balance of payments]] and [[flow of funds]] statistics. The [[Federal Reserve|Reserve Banks]] and the [[Treasury]] usually provide interpretations and analysis of this data. Standard indicators include [[capital formation]], [[gross fixed capital formation]], [[fixed capital]], household asset wealth and [[foreign direct investment]].\n\nOrganisations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the UNCTAD, the [[World Bank Group]], the [[OECD]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]] used national investment data to estimate world trends. The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], [[Eurostat]] and the Japan Statistical Office provide data on the United States, Europe and Japan respectively. Other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]], [[Forbes]], [[The Economist]], [[Business Week]]'' and so on as well as various corporate \"[[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]]\" organisations and [[non-governmental organisation]] publications. A reputable scientific journal is the ''Review of Income & Wealth''. In the case of the United States, the \"Analytical Perspectives\" document (an annex to the yearly budget) provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country.\n\nIn [[Karl Marx]]' economic theory, capital accumulation refers to the operation whereby profits are reinvested increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital is viewed by Marx as expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value, extracted as profits and expressed as money. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset [[Value (economics)|value]] in search of additional value or [[surplus-value]]. This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established. Capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in [[Confiscation|expropriation]], both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or \"trading up\", but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else without compensation. [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] calls this [[accumulation by dispossession]].\n\nThe continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. However, capital accumulation may also confront resistance when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a [[Strike action|strike]] by investors or workers, or [[consumer resistance]]).\n\n=== Concentration and centralisation ===\nAccording to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and centralization in the hands of the wealthy. Marx explains: \"It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals. [...] Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many. [...] The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, ''caeteris paribus'', on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages [...] It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm|title=Economic Manuscripts: Capital Vol. I \u2013 Chapter Twenty-Five|first=Karl|last=Marx}}</ref>\n\n=== Rate of accumulation ===\nIn [[Marxian economics]], the rate of accumulation is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the [[stock and flow|stock]] of capital in an accounting period; and (2) the proportion of realised [[surplus-value]] or profit-income which is reinvested, rather than consumed. This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay, the realised turnover, surplus-value or profit and reinvestments (e.g. the writings of the economist [[Micha\u0142 Kalecki]]).\n\nOther things being equal, the greater the amount of profit-income that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes, the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be. However, earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment. This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about \"how much to spend, and how much to save\".\n\nIn a boom period of capitalism, the growth of investments is cumulative, i.e. one investment leads to another, leading to a constantly expanding market, an expanding [[labor force]] and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn a stagnating, decadent capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces, real estate, financial speculation and luxury consumption. In that case, income from [[value added|value-adding]] production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow. The inverse is also true and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] emphasised that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on (1) the division of a society's social product between \"[[necessary product]]\" and \"[[surplus product]]\"; and (2) the division of the surplus product between [[investment]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. In turn, this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of [[competition]] among capitalists, competition between capitalists and workers and competition between workers. The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors as it also involved social factors and [[economic power|power]] relationships.\n\n=== Circuit of capital accumulation from production ===\nStrictly speaking, capital has accumulated only when realised [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] income has been reinvested in capital assets. As suggested in the first volume of Marx' ''[[Das Kapital]]'', the process of capital accumulation in production has at least seven distinct but linked moments:\n* The initial investment of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (which could be borrowed capital) in [[means of production]] and [[labor power]].\n* The command over [[surplus-labour]] and its appropriation.\n* The [[valorisation]] (increase in value) of capital through production of new outputs.\n* The appropriation of the new output produced by employees, containing the added value.\n* The realisation of [[surplus-value]] through output sales.\n* The appropriation of realised surplus-value as (profit) income after deduction of costs.\n* The reinvestment of profit income in production.\n\nAll of these moments do not refer simply to an \"economic\" or commercial process. Rather, they assume the existence of legal, social, cultural and economic power conditions, without which creation, distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur. This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists, or where people refuse to trade.\n\n=== Simple and expanded reproduction ===\nIn the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx continues the story and shows that with the aid of bank [[credit (finance)|credit]] capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another, alternately taking the form of money capital (liquid deposits, securities and so on), commodity capital (tradable products, real estate and the like), or production capital ([[means of production]] and labor power).\n\nHis discussion of the simple and expanded [[reproduction (economics)|reproduction]] of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole. At simple reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given [[living standard]]; the stock of capital stays constant. At expanded reproduction, more product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard (a [[surplus product]]); the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production.\n\nThe bourgeois claim there is no [[economic law]] according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realised by Dept. 1\u2014producers of means of production\u2014exactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (p.&nbsp;524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced, but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (p.&nbsp;514).\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] introduced the additional concept of contracted economic reproduction, i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or de[[valorisation]].\n\nBalanced [[economic growth]] requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions. However, markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance and in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between [[supply and demand]]: inequality is the motor of growth. This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal, even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long-time. Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and [[protectionism]].\n\n=== Capital accumulation as social relation ===\n\"Accumulation of capital\" sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist [[social relations]] (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e. the expansion of the size of the [[proletariat]] and of the wealth owned by the [[bourgeoisie]].\n\nThis interpretation emphasises that capital ownership, predicated on command over labor, is a social relation: the growth of capital implies the growth of the [[working class]] (a \"[[law of accumulation]]\"). In the first volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s theory of colonisation: {{Quotation|Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies, property in money, means of subsistence, machines, and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative\u2014the wage-worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will. He discovered that capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things. Mr. Peel, he moans, took with him from England to Swan River, West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of \u00a350,000. Mr. Peel had the foresight to bring with him, besides, 3,000 persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once arrived at his destination, 'Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.' Unhappy Mr. Peel, who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River!|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 33}}\n\nIn the [[Capital, Volume III|third volume]] of ''Das Kapital'', Marx refers to the \"fetishism of capital\" reaching its highest point with interest-bearing capital because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything: {{Quotation|The relations of capital assume their most externalised and most fetish-like form in interest-bearing capital. We have here <math>M - M'</math>, money creating more money, self-expanding value, without the process that effectuates these two extremes. In merchant's capital, <math>M - C - M'</math>, there is at least the general form of the capitalistic movement, although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation, so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation; but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation, not the product of a mere thing. [...] This is obliterated in <math>M - M'</math>, the form of interest-bearing capital. [...] The thing (money, commodity, value) is now capital even as a mere thing, and capital appears as a mere thing. The result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself. It depends on the owner of the money, i.e., of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form, whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital. In interest-bearing capital, therefore, this automatic fetish, self-expanding value, money generating money, are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birth-marks of its origin. The [[Social relations|social relation]] is consummated in the relation of a thing, of money, to itself. Instead of the actual transformation of money into capital, we see here only form without content.|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 24|source=}}\n\n== Wage labour ==\n{{Main|Wage labour}}\n[[File:Worker 9.JPG|thumb|An industrial [[worker]] amidst heavy steel [[semi-product]]s (Kinex Bearings, [[Byt\u010da]], [[Slovakia]], c. 1995\u20132000)]]\n[[Wage labour]] refers to the sale of [[Labour economics|labour]] under a formal or informal [[employment contract]] to an [[employer]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinfeld|2009|p=3}}: \"All labor contracts were/are designed legally to bind a worker in one way or another to fulfill the labor obligations the worker has undertaken. That is one of the principal purposes of labor contracts.\"</ref> These transactions usually occur in a [[labour market]] where [[wage]]s are market determined.<ref>{{Harvnb|Deakin|Wilkinson|2005}}.<br />{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1005}}, defines wage labour succinctly as \"the labour of the worker who sells his own labour-power.\"</ref> Individuals who possess and supply financial capital or labor to productive ventures often become owners, either jointly (as [[shareholder]]s) or individually.{{Fact|date=March 2020}} In Marxist economics, these owners of the means of production and suppliers of capital are generally called capitalists. The description of the role of the capitalist has shifted, first referring to a useless intermediary between producers to an employer of producers and eventually came to refer to owners of the means of production.<ref name=\"Williams 1983 51\" /> [[Labor (economics)|Labor]] includes all physical and mental human resources, including entrepreneurial capacity and management skills, which are needed to produce products and services. [[Production (economics)|Production]] is the act of making goods or services by applying [[labor power]].<ref>Christopher T.S. Ragan and Richard G. Lipsey. ''Microeconomics''. Twelfth Canadian Edition ed. Toronto, Pearson Education Canada, 2008. Print.</ref><ref>Robbins, Richard H. ''Global problems and the culture of capitalism''. Boston: Allyn & Bacon, 2007. Print.</ref>\n\nCritics of the capitalist mode of production see wage labour as a major, if not defining, aspect of hierarchical industrial systems. Most opponents of the institution support [[worker self-management]] and [[economic democracy]] as alternatives to both wage labour and to capitalism. While most opponents of the wage system<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> blame the capitalist owners of the means of production for its existence, most [[anarchists]] and other [[libertarian socialists]] also hold the state as equally responsible as it exists as a tool utilised by capitalists to subsidise themselves and protect the institution of [[privatism|private ownership of the means of production]]. As some opponents of wage labour take influence from Marxist propositions, many are opposed to [[private property]], but maintain respect for [[personal property]].\n\n=== Types ===\nThe most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct, or \"full-time\", employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time (from a few years to the entire career of the worker) in return for a money-wage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff. However, wage labour takes many other forms and explicit as opposed to implicit (i.e. conditioned by local labour and tax law) contracts are not uncommon. Economic history shows a great variety of ways in which labour is traded and exchanged. The differences show up in the form of:\n* Employment status: a worker could be employed full-time, part-time, or on a casual basis. He or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only, or on a permanent basis. Part-time wage labour could combine with part-time [[self-employment]]. The worker could be employed also as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]].\n* Civil (legal) status: the worker could for example be a free citizen, an [[indentured labour]]er, the subject of [[forced labour]] (including some prison or army labour); a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task, they could be a [[slavery|semi-slave]] or a [[serfdom|serf]] bound to the land who is hired out part of the time. So the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis, or on a more or less involuntary basis, in which there are many gradations.\n* Method of payment (remuneration or [[Compensation of employees|compensation]]): the work done could be paid \"in cash\" (a money-wage) or \"in kind\" (through receiving goods and/or services), or in the form of \"[[Piecework|piece rates]]\" where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces. In some cases, the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services, or in the form of [[Employee stock option|stock options]] or [[Share (finance)|shares]] in an enterprise.\n* Method of hiring: the worker might engage in a labour-contract on his or her own initiative, or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group. However, he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary (such as an employment agency) to a third party. In this case, he or she is paid by the intermediary, but works for a third party which pays the intermediary. In some cases, labour is [[Subcontracting|subcontracted]] several times, with several intermediaries. Another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority, or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise together with the [[means of production]].\n\n== Effects of war ==\n[[File:Alfred T. Palmer - Assembling the North American B-25 Mitchell at Kansas City, Kansas (USA).jpg|thumb|The common view among economic historians is that the [[Great Depression]] ended with the advent of World War II (assembling the North American [[B-25 Mitchell]] at [[Kansas City]], 1942)]]\nWar typically causes the diversion, destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war. Many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war. War driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war. Often this has induced laws against perceived and real [[war profiteering]].\n\nThe total hours worked in the United States rose by 34 percent during World War II, even though the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by 11 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ellen R. |last=Grattan |first2=Lee E. |last2=Ohanian |title=The macroeconomic effects of big fiscal shocks: the case of world war II |journal=Minneapolis Federal Reserve, Working Paper 599 |date=December 1999 |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp599.pdf }}</ref>\n\nWar destruction can be illustrated by looking at [[World War II]]. Industrial war damage was heaviest in Japan, where 1/4 of factory buildings and 1/3 of plant and equipment were destroyed; 1/7 of electric power-generating capacity was destroyed and 6/7 of oil refining capacity. The Japanese merchant fleet lost 80% of their ships. In Germany in 1944, when air attacks were heaviest, 6.5% of machine tools were damaged or destroyed, but around 90% were later repaired. About 10% of steel production capacity was lost. In Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes, ships, tanks and so on were built and then lost or destroyed.\n\nGermany's total war damage was estimated at about 17.5% of the pre-war total capital stock by value, i.e. about 1/6. In the [[Berlin]] area alone, there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities. In 1945, less than 10% of the railways were still operating. 2,395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7,500 bridges, 10,000 locomotives and more than 100,000 goods wagons were destroyed. Less than 40% of the remaining locomotives were operational.\n\nHowever, by the first quarter of 1946 European rail traffic, which was given assistance and preferences (by Western appointed military governors) for resources and material as an essential asset, regained its prewar operational level. At the end of the year, 90% of Germany's railway lines were operating again. In retrospect, the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing.\n\nInitially, in May 1945 newly installed United States president [[Harry S. Truman]]'s directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of Germany. In fact, the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level; the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of pre-war output. These plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted. In 1946, over 10% of Germany's physical capital stock (plant and equipment) was also dismantled and confiscated, most of it going to the Soviet Union. By 1947, industrial production in Germany was at 1/3 of the 1938 level and industrial investment at about 1/2 the 1938 level.\n\nThe first big strike-wave in the [[Ruhr]] occurred in early 1947\u2014it was about food rations and housing, but soon there were demands for nationalisation. However, the United States appointed military governor (Newman) stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations. The clear message was \"no work, no eat\". As the military controls in Western Germany were nearly all relinquished and the Germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with [[Marshall Plan]] aid things rapidly improved. By 1951, German industrial production had overtaken the prewar level. The Marshall Aid funds were important, but after the currency reform (which permitted German capitalists to revalue their assets) and the establishment of a new political system much more important was the commitment of the United States to rebuilding German capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government, rather than keeping Germany in a weak position. Initially, average [[real wages]] remained low, lower even than in 1938, until the early 1950s while profitability was unusually high. So the total investment fund, aided by credits, was also high, resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools. This was called the [[German economic miracle]] or ''Wirtschaftswunder''.<ref>Armstrong, Glyn & Harrison, ''Capitalism since world war 2''. Fontana, 1984.

However, damage to [[human capital]] has been much more devastating in terms of fatalities (in the case of World War II, about 55 million deaths), permanent physical disability, enduring ethnic hostility and psychological injuries which have effects for at least several generations.\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{Main|Criticism of capitalism}}\n[[File:Anti-capitalism color\u2014 Restored.png|thumb|The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster \"[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]\" (1911)]]\nCritics of capitalism associate the economic system with [[social inequality]]; unfair [[distribution of wealth]] and power; [[Economic materialism|materialism]]; repression of workers and [[trade union]]ists; [[social alienation]]; [[economic inequality]]; [[unemployment]]; and economic instability.

According to Marx, capital is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [[labor power]] had itself become a commodity under capitalism and the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.\n\nThis difference in values, he argues, constitutes [[surplus value]], which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', Marx argues that the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers\u2014all prior class societies had extracted [[surplus labor]], but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm|title=Capital.
