The show was produced by [[CBS Paramount Network Television]] and Junction Entertainment, with executive producers [[Jon Turteltaub]], [[Stephen Chbosky]], and [[Carol Barbee]]. It was shown in more than 30 countries.\n\n''Jericho'' ran on [[CBS]] from September 20, 2006, to March 25, 2008. It was cancelled after its first full season, because of poor ratings. A fan campaign persuaded the network to bring the show back for another season, of seven episodes, after which it was cancelled again.

The series begins with a visible nuclear detonation of unknown origin in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. Despite initial belief that it was an accident, Dale Turner, one of the characters, receives a phone call from his mother in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The call is then cut out by the sound of a nuclear blast. Upon showing this to others, it is revealed that the bombings were deliberate. Problems are compounded by loss of power and modern communications, effectively isolating Jericho. Later, power is restored to Jericho by what is alluded to as the efforts of the U.S. government but an [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) from an unknown source disables all electronics.\n\nWhile the first few episodes are about restoring life after the attacks, about halfway through the season some of the citizens meet with citizens of a nearby town, New Bern. At first, relations are established, resulting in a trade of windmills (for power), built in New Bern's factory, for supplies for food from Jericho's farms and salt from its mine (neither of which New Bern could supply on its own). Relations sour as New Bern scapegoats Jericho for its problems and the New Bern [[sheriff]] eventually declares war, leading to the season's climax.\n\nSeveral themes regularly addressed in the show include the gathering of information, community identity, public order, limited resources, the value of family, hardships of fatherhood and internal and external threats. The show also features several mysteries involving the backgrounds of major characters, the perpetrators of the attack and the extent of damage to the United States and its government.\n\nThe pivotal character in this story is [[Jake Green (Jericho)|Jake Green]], the 32-year-old son of Mayor [[Johnston Green]]. Jake had fled the town of Jericho five years earlier, when he became mixed up with the wrong people and was involved in questionable activity. He briefly returns home to claim his inheritance, before being stranded by the catastrophe. After a somewhat awkward return home and a tense reunion with his father, Jake steps up to become a leader in Jericho, fighting to protect the town and its citizens. As the people of Jericho struggle to survive in a changed world, most remain unaware that one of the newest residents, [[Robert Hawkins (Jericho character)|Robert Hawkins]], knows a lot more about the attacks than he is letting on. It is later revealed that he is in possession of an unexploded nuclear bomb that was supposed to be used in the attack but how he obtained it and what side he is on remain anything but clear.\n\nGrey Anderson encounters a [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) camp outside of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], where he learns that the attack on [[New York City]] was foiled by alert [[New York City Police Department|New York City Police]] who shot the bomber before he could detonate the nuclear bomb that he had in the back of a van. Mayor Green reports that the NYPD captured the van in New York with a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb on board but [[Washington, D.C.]] has been bombed. On the way back from the FEMA camp, Anderson's car is stolen by 12 looters and he is forced to walk home to Jericho. Anderson also reports that Lawrence, Kansas has been attacked. Robert Hawkins receives a morse code message on a ham radio stating that Denver, Atlanta, [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[San Diego]] and several more cities not shown on screen have been attacked. A black box flight data recorder that Jake recovers from a crashed airliner indicates that [[air traffic control]] is non-existent, a mushroom cloud is rising {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the atmosphere and that flashes have also been seen towards [[Texas]].\n\nA radiation-burn victim walks into Jericho from Denver, leading a rescue party to Bear Lake but the 20 radiation-burn victims there are dead. Before the unnamed radiation-burn victim dies, while he is interrogated by Hawkins, it is revealed that he is an accomplice of Hawkins and that there is a traitor in the attack. In the season one finale, armed residents of New Bern attack Jericho with crude [[Mortar_(weapon)|mortars]] made at the factories in New Bern. The mortar bombardment injure people in Jericho. Jake and Johnston Green along with Robert Hawkins lead a counter-attack on New Bern's forces outside of town, killing many of the attackers; Johnston Green is mortally wounded. Army units arrive to separate the combatants just as the season ends.\n\n===Second season===\n[[File:Allied States of America flag (Jericho).svg|thumb|Flag of the Allied States of America]]\nThe military forces of the new Allied States of America (ASA), which now govern most of what was formerly the [[Western United States]], except the independent Republic of [[Texas]], have restored order to Jericho and its hinterland, putting an abrupt end to the conflict between Jericho and its rival town, New Bern. As a sense of normality returns to Jericho, the plot shifts away from day-to-day survival to life and political intrigue under the ASA government.\n\nThe garrison commander of the ASA Army's newly established post in Jericho, Major Edward Beck, asks Jake to accept appointment as the Sheriff of Jericho and the county. Jake reluctantly accepts the appointment with reservations about the ASA government's intentions.\n\nKnown only to Hawkins and a select few, the September attacks were neither a foreign nor domestic terrorist act but a conspiracy of unknown perpetrators within the highest level of the former U.S. government, including the president and the secretary of defense of the new ASA government in Cheyenne. Hawkins must calculate his every move to avoid capture, piece together the trail of evidence and bring the truth to light, before the conspiracy's mastermind buries it forever.\n\nJericho's residents deal with the reality of the new ASA government based in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. Welcomed as saviors, the government's military and mercenary agents transform life in Jericho into a repressive [[police state]], led by a [[Private military company|private security]] contracting firm, Ravenwood, owned by Jennings & Rall, which has major ties to and sponsors the leaders of the ASA government. When a Ravenwood contractor kills Bonnie, a deaf farm girl from the outskirts of Jericho, to conceal his embezzlement, the town is put on the edge of revolt as Jake and the deputies protect Mimi, the only witness to Bonnie's murder and the embezzlement.\n\nJake can no longer tolerate the methods of Ravenwood and the ASA government in Jericho and leads an underground movement to remove them from power in the town. He is arrested by Major Beck and interrogated. Jake refuses to break and escapes with the help of his mother and other town residents. The citizens of the town rebel against the local ASA soldiers. All of this causes Major Beck, a decorated former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer, to question his duty to a government that would treat its citizens the way the new ASA government is doing. He orders his men to stand down and return to their garrison.\n\nHawkins tries to transport the bomb to his contacts in the reborn [[Republic of Texas]]. The ASA military is tipped off and after a brief chase, seizes the weapon. Hawkins narrowly escapes and the ASA military then transports the weapon to Cheyenne for safekeeping.\n\nHawkins makes contact with Jake and the two travel to Cheyenne, where they retake the bomb from J&R contractors. Hawkins is wounded in a brief gun battle. The two make it to the Republic of Texas embassy in Cheyenne with the only undetonated bomb (in ASA territory) from the September attacks. The ASA's military is right behind them. The Republic of Texas is considered the [[swing state]] in the struggle for power between the [[Eastern United States]], which is led by the legitimate surviving United States government, now governed from [[Columbus, Ohio]] and the Allied States. Texas has not decided which government to back. The Texan ambassador in Cheyenne shelters Jake and Hawkins at his embassy. He informs his military forces at the embassy to tell the ASA forces outside the fence that any incursion into the embassy by ASA troops will be considered an act of war against the Republic of Texas. The ambassador manages to quickly smuggle Jake, Hawkins and the bomb to the Cheyenne airport. At the airport he secures a small diplomatic jet plane to carry Jake, Hawkins and the device to Texas. While they are ''en route'', two ASA [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighters intercept Jake and Hawkins and order them to turn around or be shot down. When Jake refuses to be escorted back to Cheyenne, the two jets drop back to open fire. Suddenly, two Republic of Texas [[United States Air National Guard|Air National Guard]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters appear and shoot down the ASA planes. Jake and Hawkins make it to Texas with the evidence and Hawkins ominously intones that a [[second American Civil War]] was always coming and the two of them have made history by giving the United States a fighting chance in the war to come.\n\n===Third season===\n{{main|Jericho Season 3: Civil War}}\n{{Missing information |section |the plot |date=April 2020}}\nSeason 3 is not a television show, but a six-part comic book series \"from the minds\" of the original ''Jericho'' production team and written by the ''Jericho'' writing team.\n\nIn April 2013, ''Jericho'' creator Stephen Chbosky revealed during a chat with Nerdacy that talks about a live-action season 3 remain ongoing. In his statement, Chbosky noted, \"you know [[William Morris Endeavor]] Agency, who represents me, executive producer Jon Turteltaub and many other people, and they've been talking to [[Netflix]] and you never know.

It is approximately 47 miles east of the Kansas/Colorado border (which would put it near the location of the real [[Colby, Kansas]]). However, a map (episode 3: Jericho is Ness City, Kansas on the map) in the series seems to show Jericho near the junctions of [[Interstate 70|I-70]] and [[U.S. Route 83|US 83]].  That would place it near the real [[Oakley, Kansas|Oakley]]. Jericho is 90 miles west of the also fictional Rogue River, Kansas, and around 330 miles from the real [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]. New Bern, Kansas is a neighboring fictional town which starts a war with Jericho in the wake of the national destruction. Jericho is served by one state highway and the (fictional) Cedar Run Road.\n\nThe city's population is mentioned to be almost 5,000 as mentioned in season 1 Ep. 2 \"Fallout\" (1,000 in 1957). But after the great war between New Bern and Jericho, the population was reduced to 3,000. The city has one grocery store, owned by Gracie Leigh ([[Beth Grant]]).\n\nJericho is run by two mayors throughout the series. Johnston Green ([[Gerald McRaney]]) was the mayor at the show opening and for most of season one, but loses the election in the show. Gray Anderson ([[Michael Gaston]]), the other electoral candidate, wins the election in the show.\n\n==Production==\n===Early development===\nThe series originated as a feature film idea of co-creators [[Jonathan E. Steinberg|Jonathan Steinberg]] and Josh Schaer: a [[post-apocalyptic]] plot set amidst the trappings of \"a little character drama\" movie, in the vein of ''[[The Day After]]'', ''[[Threads (film)|Threads]]'', and ''[[Testament (1983 film)|Testament]]''. However, they soon realized that a two- or two-and-a-half-hour-long film would still not carry the necessary length they felt such a concept required to properly explore the setting and the characters. Thus, Schaer and Steinberg decided to re-conceive the entire project as a television series, producing a treatment out of the original feature screenplay. Director Jon Turteltaub and producer [[Carol Barbee]] then entered the picture, the pair having pitched the project to them. Turteltaub soon commissioned writer Stephen Chbosky to pen the pilot teleplay based upon Schaer and Steinberg's series treatment.\n\nOne of Chbosky's major contributions to the structure of the series was the introduction of a greater feminine element to the storyline, opining that, \"[We] could use some girls, a little kissing, and some laughs.\" Another significant developmental influence were the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the sense of \"[being] a spectator to a disaster, while not quite being part of it.\" Co-creator Steinberg in particular felt that after 9/11, the United States saw some of the \"best of people,\" and after Hurricane Katrina, some of the \"worst of people,\" and sought to include both in the fabric of ''Jericho'', with Katrina providing \"lots of inspiration\" for the show's overall premise.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html|title=Paley Fest - Jericho |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070307/http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 December 2007 |access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\n[[File:Brad Beyer on Set.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Brad Beyer]], who plays [[Stanley Richmond]], on the set of ''Jericho'']]\n''Jericho'' is set in northwestern Kansas, but the series was filmed in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\">{{cite web|url= https://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=16239|title=A Visit to the Town of Jericho|publisher=Coming Soon Media|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php|title=Insiders' Commentary: Pilot Episode#2|publisher=CBS|accessdate=2007-06-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608165720/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> The pilot and all episodes involving New Bern, Kansas, were filmed in [[Fillmore, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fillmoregazette.com/node/701|publisher=The Fillmore Gazette|date=March 8, 2007|title=Jericho in Fillmore this week}}</ref> Filming also occurred in [[Pasadena, California]], including in front of the city hall.

The television program gave the web address for the online companion. ''Beyond Jericho'' was to feature the \"other survivors\" of the nuclear attacks. According to Barbee, the story was intended to be unique to the site, but as the season of ''Jericho'' progressed, the online story would dovetail into the episodes themselves. However, the site and \"webisode\" are now unavailable, having been removed from the CBS website before the second episode of the TV show was broadcast.\n\nCBS since decided to scrap the current webisode storyline, and instead released a new series of \"prequel\" webisodes named ''Countdown'' that take place before the first explosion. Each of these new webisodes appeared concurrently with the broadcast of new episodes during season 1, and showed Robert Hawkins gathering information before the attack.\n\n===''Beyond Jericho''===\n{{Main|Beyond Jericho}}\nThe first installment of ''Beyond Jericho'' began with an unknown man calling someone on a cell phone, requesting a ransom of $1.2 million for a woman he kidnapped. He then disappears underground through a metal trap door. While climbing down, he hears and feels a bang, but thinks nothing of it. After conversing with an associate about their next plans, he picks the woman up and climbs back up to the roof. When he opens the door, it's surrounded by rubble. The entire city around them has been destroyed. Shortly after, rubble falls through the trap door. With the cell phone (apparently actually the victim's cell phone) dead, and assuming that the man's associate is dead as well in the collapse, they start to climb through the rubble to find out what happened. Nearby, a hand with a surgical glove on emerges from the rubble, as the vignette ends.\n\n===''Countdown''===\nStarting on October 26, ''Beyond Jericho'' was replaced by ''Countdown'', which documents Robert Hawkins' efforts to learn as much as possible about the effects of nuclear bombs before he moved to Jericho.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|title= Jericho on CBS - Countdown|access-date= 2006-10-26|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061102023830/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|archive-date= 2006-11-02|url-status= dead}}</ref> The webisodes do not feature any of the regular characters, and consist primarily of Hawkins, draped in shadows, watching mini-[[Documentary film|documentaries]].\n\nThe mini-documentaries feature expert interviews about the effects of a nuclear attack. They are only minimally connected to each episode's plot. For instance, CBS' 8-episode plot summary reads: \"A shadowy military unit bursts into the chamber Hawkins has just vacated. On his computer, they find a video.\" The video was a short documentary about FEMA's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] and their use of [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]]. The \"shadowy military unit\" then patiently waits until the documentary ends to resume its search for Hawkins.\n\n''Countdown'''s sponsor, [[AT&T]], is heavily promoted in the series using [[product placement]]. Nearly all dialog takes place as [[SMS]] messages on an AT&T cellular phone, and a full-screen AT&T logo appears in every episode when Hawkins views the expert interviews. This web-based programming is not accessible from outside of the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===''JenningsandRall.com''===\nCreated for the Tom Tooman game, JenningsandRall.com is the purported website of Jennings & Rall, the corporate giant which plays an increasingly prominent role in the second season of the series.

Despite initial belief that it was an accident, Dale Turner, one of the characters, receives a phone call from his mother in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The call is then cut out by the sound of a nuclear blast. Upon showing this to others, it is revealed that the bombings were deliberate. Problems are compounded by loss of power and modern communications, effectively isolating Jericho. Later, power is restored to Jericho by what is alluded to as the efforts of the U.S. government but an [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) from an unknown source disables all electronics.\n\nWhile the first few episodes are about restoring life after the attacks, about halfway through the season some of the citizens meet with citizens of a nearby town, New Bern. At first, relations are established, resulting in a trade of windmills (for power), built in New Bern's factory, for supplies for food from Jericho's farms and salt from its mine (neither of which New Bern could supply on its own). Relations sour as New Bern scapegoats Jericho for its problems and the New Bern [[sheriff]] eventually declares war, leading to the season's climax.\n\nSeveral themes regularly addressed in the show include the gathering of information, community identity, public order, limited resources, the value of family, hardships of fatherhood and internal and external threats. The show also features several mysteries involving the backgrounds of major characters, the perpetrators of the attack and the extent of damage to the United States and its government.\n\nThe pivotal character in this story is [[Jake Green (Jericho)|Jake Green]], the 32-year-old son of Mayor [[Johnston Green]]. Jake had fled the town of Jericho five years earlier, when he became mixed up with the wrong people and was involved in questionable activity. He briefly returns home to claim his inheritance, before being stranded by the catastrophe. After a somewhat awkward return home and a tense reunion with his father, Jake steps up to become a leader in Jericho, fighting to protect the town and its citizens. As the people of Jericho struggle to survive in a changed world, most remain unaware that one of the newest residents, [[Robert Hawkins (Jericho character)|Robert Hawkins]], knows a lot more about the attacks than he is letting on. It is later revealed that he is in possession of an unexploded nuclear bomb that was supposed to be used in the attack but how he obtained it and what side he is on remain anything but clear.\n\nGrey Anderson encounters a [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) camp outside of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], where he learns that the attack on [[New York City]] was foiled by alert [[New York City Police Department|New York City Police]] who shot the bomber before he could detonate the nuclear bomb that he had in the back of a van. Mayor Green reports that the NYPD captured the van in New York with a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb on board but [[Washington, D.C.]] has been bombed. On the way back from the FEMA camp, Anderson's car is stolen by 12 looters and he is forced to walk home to Jericho. Anderson also reports that Lawrence, Kansas has been attacked. Robert Hawkins receives a morse code message on a ham radio stating that Denver, Atlanta, [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[San Diego]] and several more cities not shown on screen have been attacked. A black box flight data recorder that Jake recovers from a crashed airliner indicates that [[air traffic control]] is non-existent, a mushroom cloud is rising {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the atmosphere and that flashes have also been seen towards [[Texas]].\n\nA radiation-burn victim walks into Jericho from Denver, leading a rescue party to Bear Lake but the 20 radiation-burn victims there are dead. Before the unnamed radiation-burn victim dies, while he is interrogated by Hawkins, it is revealed that he is an accomplice of Hawkins and that there is a traitor in the attack. In the season one finale, armed residents of New Bern attack Jericho with crude [[Mortar_(weapon)|mortars]] made at the factories in New Bern. The mortar bombardment injure people in Jericho. Jake and Johnston Green along with Robert Hawkins lead a counter-attack on New Bern's forces outside of town, killing many of the attackers; Johnston Green is mortally wounded. Army units arrive to separate the combatants just as the season ends.\n\n===Second season===\n[[File:Allied States of America flag (Jericho).svg|thumb|Flag of the Allied States of America]]\nThe military forces of the new Allied States of America (ASA), which now govern most of what was formerly the [[Western United States]], except the independent Republic of [[Texas]], have restored order to Jericho and its hinterland, putting an abrupt end to the conflict between Jericho and its rival town, New Bern. As a sense of normality returns to Jericho, the plot shifts away from day-to-day survival to life and political intrigue under the ASA government.\n\nThe garrison commander of the ASA Army's newly established post in Jericho, Major Edward Beck, asks Jake to accept appointment as the Sheriff of Jericho and the county. Jake reluctantly accepts the appointment with reservations about the ASA government's intentions.\n\nKnown only to Hawkins and a select few, the September attacks were neither a foreign nor domestic terrorist act but a conspiracy of unknown perpetrators within the highest level of the former U.S. government, including the president and the secretary of defense of the new ASA government in Cheyenne. Hawkins must calculate his every move to avoid capture, piece together the trail of evidence and bring the truth to light, before the conspiracy's mastermind buries it forever.\n\nJericho's residents deal with the reality of the new ASA government based in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. Welcomed as saviors, the government's military and mercenary agents transform life in Jericho into a repressive [[police state]], led by a [[Private military company|private security]] contracting firm, Ravenwood, owned by Jennings & Rall, which has major ties to and sponsors the leaders of the ASA government. When a Ravenwood contractor kills Bonnie, a deaf farm girl from the outskirts of Jericho, to conceal his embezzlement, the town is put on the edge of revolt as Jake and the deputies protect Mimi, the only witness to Bonnie's murder and the embezzlement.\n\nJake can no longer tolerate the methods of Ravenwood and the ASA government in Jericho and leads an underground movement to remove them from power in the town. He is arrested by Major Beck and interrogated. Jake refuses to break and escapes with the help of his mother and other town residents. The citizens of the town rebel against the local ASA soldiers. All of this causes Major Beck, a decorated former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer, to question his duty to a government that would treat its citizens the way the new ASA government is doing. He orders his men to stand down and return to their garrison.\n\nHawkins tries to transport the bomb to his contacts in the reborn [[Republic of Texas]]. The ASA military is tipped off and after a brief chase, seizes the weapon. Hawkins narrowly escapes and the ASA military then transports the weapon to Cheyenne for safekeeping.\n\nHawkins makes contact with Jake and the two travel to Cheyenne, where they retake the bomb from J&R contractors. Hawkins is wounded in a brief gun battle. The two make it to the Republic of Texas embassy in Cheyenne with the only undetonated bomb (in ASA territory) from the September attacks. The ASA's military is right behind them. The Republic of Texas is considered the [[swing state]] in the struggle for power between the [[Eastern United States]], which is led by the legitimate surviving United States government, now governed from [[Columbus, Ohio]] and the Allied States. Texas has not decided which government to back. The Texan ambassador in Cheyenne shelters Jake and Hawkins at his embassy. He informs his military forces at the embassy to tell the ASA forces outside the fence that any incursion into the embassy by ASA troops will be considered an act of war against the Republic of Texas. The ambassador manages to quickly smuggle Jake, Hawkins and the bomb to the Cheyenne airport. At the airport he secures a small diplomatic jet plane to carry Jake, Hawkins and the device to Texas. While they are ''en route'', two ASA [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighters intercept Jake and Hawkins and order them to turn around or be shot down. When Jake refuses to be escorted back to Cheyenne, the two jets drop back to open fire. Suddenly, two Republic of Texas [[United States Air National Guard|Air National Guard]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters appear and shoot down the ASA planes. Jake and Hawkins make it to Texas with the evidence and Hawkins ominously intones that a [[second American Civil War]] was always coming and the two of them have made history by giving the United States a fighting chance in the war to come.\n\n===Third season===\n{{main|Jericho Season 3: Civil War}}\n{{Missing information |section |the plot |date=April 2020}}\nSeason 3 is not a television show, but a six-part comic book series \"from the minds\" of the original ''Jericho'' production team and written by the ''Jericho'' writing team.\n\nIn April 2013, ''Jericho'' creator Stephen Chbosky revealed during a chat with Nerdacy that talks about a live-action season 3 remain ongoing. In his statement, Chbosky noted, \"you know [[William Morris Endeavor]] Agency, who represents me, executive producer Jon Turteltaub and many other people, and they've been talking to [[Netflix]] and you never know. I can't say what it will be in season 3, but I'm excited for the new developments.\"<ref name=\"JerichoSeason3\">{{cite web|last1=Roco|title=ERICHO Netflix Season 3 Update \u2014 Could Series Mount A Nuts Return?|url=http://seriable.com/jericho-netflix-season-3-update-could-series-mount-a-nuts-return/|website=Seriable|publisher=Seriable.com|accessdate=15 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520110343/http://seriable.com/jericho-netflix-season-3-update-could-series-mount-a-nuts-return/|archivedate=20 May 2015|date=15 February 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2017, Skeet Ulrich gave a reason why the show didn't move to Netflix: \"We were close [to a third season] about four or five years ago.

Are you in?\" I said, \"Absolutely, with one proviso: That first script back has to time-jump five years, and the world has devolved way lower than we could ever have imagined.\" And they were on board with it.

It is approximately 47 miles east of the Kansas/Colorado border (which would put it near the location of the real [[Colby, Kansas]]). However, a map (episode 3: Jericho is Ness City, Kansas on the map) in the series seems to show Jericho near the junctions of [[Interstate 70|I-70]] and [[U.S. Route 83|US 83]].  That would place it near the real [[Oakley, Kansas|Oakley]]. Jericho is 90 miles west of the also fictional Rogue River, Kansas, and around 330 miles from the real [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]. New Bern, Kansas is a neighboring fictional town which starts a war with Jericho in the wake of the national destruction. Jericho is served by one state highway and the (fictional) Cedar Run Road.\n\nThe city's population is mentioned to be almost 5,000 as mentioned in season 1 Ep. 2 \"Fallout\" (1,000 in 1957). But after the great war between New Bern and Jericho, the population was reduced to 3,000. The city has one grocery store, owned by Gracie Leigh ([[Beth Grant]]).\n\nJericho is run by two mayors throughout the series. Johnston Green ([[Gerald McRaney]]) was the mayor at the show opening and for most of season one, but loses the election in the show. Gray Anderson ([[Michael Gaston]]), the other electoral candidate, wins the election in the show.\n\n==Production==\n===Early development===\nThe series originated as a feature film idea of co-creators [[Jonathan E. Steinberg|Jonathan Steinberg]] and Josh Schaer: a [[post-apocalyptic]] plot set amidst the trappings of \"a little character drama\" movie, in the vein of ''[[The Day After]]'', ''[[Threads (film)|Threads]]'', and ''[[Testament (1983 film)|Testament]]''. However, they soon realized that a two- or two-and-a-half-hour-long film would still not carry the necessary length they felt such a concept required to properly explore the setting and the characters. Thus, Schaer and Steinberg decided to re-conceive the entire project as a television series, producing a treatment out of the original feature screenplay. Director Jon Turteltaub and producer [[Carol Barbee]] then entered the picture, the pair having pitched the project to them. Turteltaub soon commissioned writer Stephen Chbosky to pen the pilot teleplay based upon Schaer and Steinberg's series treatment.\n\nOne of Chbosky's major contributions to the structure of the series was the introduction of a greater feminine element to the storyline, opining that, \"[We] could use some girls, a little kissing, and some laughs.\" Another significant developmental influence were the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the sense of \"[being] a spectator to a disaster, while not quite being part of it.\" Co-creator Steinberg in particular felt that after 9/11, the United States saw some of the \"best of people,\" and after Hurricane Katrina, some of the \"worst of people,\" and sought to include both in the fabric of ''Jericho'', with Katrina providing \"lots of inspiration\" for the show's overall premise.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html|title=Paley Fest - Jericho |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070307/http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 December 2007 |access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\n[[File:Brad Beyer on Set.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Brad Beyer]], who plays [[Stanley Richmond]], on the set of ''Jericho'']]\n''Jericho'' is set in northwestern Kansas, but the series was filmed in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\">{{cite web|url= https://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=16239|title=A Visit to the Town of Jericho|publisher=Coming Soon Media|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php|title=Insiders' Commentary: Pilot Episode#2|publisher=CBS|accessdate=2007-06-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608165720/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> The pilot and all episodes involving New Bern, Kansas, were filmed in [[Fillmore, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fillmoregazette.com/node/701|publisher=The Fillmore Gazette|date=March 8, 2007|title=Jericho in Fillmore this week}}</ref> Filming also occurred in [[Pasadena, California]], including in front of the city hall.

The television program gave the web address for the online companion. ''Beyond Jericho'' was to feature the \"other survivors\" of the nuclear attacks. According to Barbee, the story was intended to be unique to the site, but as the season of ''Jericho'' progressed, the online story would dovetail into the episodes themselves. However, the site and \"webisode\" are now unavailable, having been removed from the CBS website before the second episode of the TV show was broadcast.\n\nCBS since decided to scrap the current webisode storyline, and instead released a new series of \"prequel\" webisodes named ''Countdown'' that take place before the first explosion. Each of these new webisodes appeared concurrently with the broadcast of new episodes during season 1, and showed Robert Hawkins gathering information before the attack.\n\n===''Beyond Jericho''===\n{{Main|Beyond Jericho}}\nThe first installment of ''Beyond Jericho'' began with an unknown man calling someone on a cell phone, requesting a ransom of $1.2 million for a woman he kidnapped. He then disappears underground through a metal trap door. While climbing down, he hears and feels a bang, but thinks nothing of it. After conversing with an associate about their next plans, he picks the woman up and climbs back up to the roof. When he opens the door, it's surrounded by rubble. The entire city around them has been destroyed. Shortly after, rubble falls through the trap door. With the cell phone (apparently actually the victim's cell phone) dead, and assuming that the man's associate is dead as well in the collapse, they start to climb through the rubble to find out what happened. Nearby, a hand with a surgical glove on emerges from the rubble, as the vignette ends.\n\n===''Countdown''===\nStarting on October 26, ''Beyond Jericho'' was replaced by ''Countdown'', which documents Robert Hawkins' efforts to learn as much as possible about the effects of nuclear bombs before he moved to Jericho.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|title= Jericho on CBS - Countdown|access-date= 2006-10-26|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061102023830/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|archive-date= 2006-11-02|url-status= dead}}</ref> The webisodes do not feature any of the regular characters, and consist primarily of Hawkins, draped in shadows, watching mini-[[Documentary film|documentaries]].\n\nThe mini-documentaries feature expert interviews about the effects of a nuclear attack. They are only minimally connected to each episode's plot. For instance, CBS' 8-episode plot summary reads: \"A shadowy military unit bursts into the chamber Hawkins has just vacated. On his computer, they find a video.\" The video was a short documentary about FEMA's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] and their use of [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]]. The \"shadowy military unit\" then patiently waits until the documentary ends to resume its search for Hawkins.\n\n''Countdown'''s sponsor, [[AT&T]], is heavily promoted in the series using [[product placement]]. Nearly all dialog takes place as [[SMS]] messages on an AT&T cellular phone, and a full-screen AT&T logo appears in every episode when Hawkins views the expert interviews. This web-based programming is not accessible from outside of the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===''JenningsandRall.com''===\nCreated for the Tom Tooman game, JenningsandRall.com is the purported website of Jennings & Rall, the corporate giant which plays an increasingly prominent role in the second season of the series. The site contains a wealth of information about the company's post-holocaust global operations, with significant hints regarding events in the show.\n\nOn November 1, 2008, the domain name jenningsandrall.com expired.\n\n===''Tom Tooman''===\n''Tom Tooman'' is an [[alternate reality game]] that CBS ran in conjunction with ''Jericho'', beginning in August 2007. The game began with a cryptic letter posted on a website, supposedly from a Tom Tooman of [[Lame Deer, Montana]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=20538|title= Tom Tooman discussion on Unfiction.com|access-date= 2008-03-26|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080119214904/http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=20538|archive-date= 2008-01-19|url-status= dead}}</ref> This letter was accompanied by a series of [[bar codes]], some with decimal numbers and others with [[Maya numerals|Mayan numbers]].

The name ''Feteira'' is derived from the Portuguese word for \"[[fern]]\", and indicates a \"location of [many] ferns\"; the name likely refers to the original colonists discovery of this area covered with ferns.\n\n==History==\nThe early inhabitants colonized the area around Ribeira da Granja, along the coast near Lajinha and Ponta Furada.  They built their first community along the coast, although on higher ground.\n\nThe Church of Feteira, consecrated in honor of the Holy Spirit, is one of the older churches on the island.  Lost to history, its date of construction is currently unknown, although the first references to the sanctuary refer to 1562. In that Year,  the local residents were forced to pay higher taxes to the parish.  On June 30, 1568, King D. Sebasti\u00e3o passed a provision in favor of People of Feteira who sought the Crown's intervention. Relating to its church, the historian Gaspar Frutuoso mentioned  that it had three naves, supported by five columns, with arterial chapels on either side.  It was a temple of good proportions (35 m in width) with a single bell-tower. The parish also had a nearby 15th century chapel dedicated to Saint Peter. In 1597, it was sacked and burned by English pirates.  The chapel was a place of pilgrimage and popular religious festivities. Due to lack of attention and care, over time it was abandoned. \nBecause of a history of piracy, there were small forts along the rugged coastline for the protection of the residents. They were part of an overall system of defenses around the island of Fayal, which suffered most of the time from lack of sufficient manpower and artillery. These fortified outposts decayed with time and the erosive action of the sea and tempests. Today, the ruins of these defensive positions have disappeared.\n\nFollowing economic and social hardship in 1862, and weakness of political leaders to satisfy their demands, an uprising occurred in 1862 in several of the island's towns over the imposition of new taxes. The people of Feteirs adhered to the protests.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:FAI HOR FeteiraChurch.JPG|thumb|235px|left|Feteira's village center, known sometimes as Feteira de Baixo, along the eastern border with Ang\u00fastias]]\n[[Image:Faial south feteira.JPG|thumb|235px|left|The southern coast of Faial as seen from the foothills of Feteira, with the summit of [[Mount Pico|Pico]] in the east]]\nIt is located {{convert|5|km|mi}} west of the center of the city of Horta, connected by the southern extension of the regional E.R.1-1\u00aa roadway and a northern municipal road in the interior. Farmlands dominate the coastal plain between the neighbouring parishes of [[Ang\u00fastias]] and [[Castelo Branco (Horta)|Castelo Branco]], while the coast is a rocky area formed by rugged lava stones and cliffs undercut by the Atlantic Ocean. The highest point in the parish is the peak of Cangueiro, approximately {{convert|706|m|ft}} above sea level, below the crater rim of [[Cabe\u00e7o Gordo]]. The coastal cliffs, which mark the southern border of the town, are at most {{convert|61|m|ft}} above sea level. Lava flows formed intricate geomorphological structures, highlighted by the area of Lajinha (on the eastern border). Wave motion and currents have carved this region forming coastal arches, and undercutting the E.R. 1-1\u00aa at points near the ''Rua da Al\u00e9m''.\n\nIntermittent creeks and small seasonal streams bisect the parish., supporting the growth of various settlements and neighbourhoods, involved inagriculture, including (from west to east): ''Ribeira do Granjo'', ''Ribeira do S\u00e3o Pedro'' and ''Ribeira de Fonte do Rego''. Five bridges cross these water courses at S\u00e3o Pedro, Porceir\u00e3o, Igreja, a second one in S\u00e3o Pedro (at the lower part of the parish) and Ponte Nova.\n\nBisected by these natural barriers, the parish developed in various nuclei associated with the roads and pathways that interconnected the pasturelands and woodlots along the flanks of the Cabe\u00e7o Gordo volcano. Consequently, small neighbourhoods or communities developed along: the regional roadway (that included Feteira de Baixo, Caminho do Meio and Alto da Lajinha), another route that connected Feteira to Flamengos (that included Cruz da Portela, Caminho das Ter\u00e7as and Lameiro Grande), a second lateral road that included Farrobim do Sul and intersected the interior towards Flamengos (that included Cimo de S\u00e3o Pedro, Atalaia, Grotas, Fonte do Rego and Cimo do Granjo), and a roadway that bisected these arterials starting in Ang\u00fastias (from Courelas, across Cruz da Portela, to Portela and Grotas, to Fonte do Rego).\n\n==Economy==\nAgriculture is the primary source of income.  Historically, the parish has cultivated potatoes, supported orange and lemon orchards, as well as large quantities of wheat and corn.  Documents for 1886 indicate a cultivation of {{convert|200000|kg|lb}} of potatoes.  Most of these crops were cultivated for export, although small itinerant banana fields were cultivated for local consumption. These continue to important crops, but currently, the cattle and dairy industry is generally accepted as the primary source of agro-business (although some lambs are raised).\n\nThe fishery and paper industries have also supported the local economy.  Yet, economic difficulties, in particular regional politics, have seen a decrease in people participating in these activities, since 1862.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Igreja da Feteira.jpg|thumb|235px|right|The front facade of the parochial church of Feteira, dedicated to the Holy Spirit]]\n\n===Civic===\n* Hayloft on ''Rua das Courelas'' ({{lang-pt|Palheiro - \u00c0s Courelas}})\n* Residence on ''Estrada Regional E.R.1-1\u00aa'' ({{lang-pt|Casa de Habita\u00e7\u00e3o - Estrada Regional}})\n* Residence on ''Rua da Engenhaira'' ({{lang-pt|Casa de Habita\u00e7\u00e3o - Rua da Engenhaira}})\n* Residences on ''Rua da Igreja'' ({{lang-pt|Casa de Habita\u00e7\u00e3o - Rua da Igreja}})\n* Residence/Shop on ''Rua da Igreja'' ({{lang-pt|Casa de Habita\u00e7\u00e3o e Com\u00e9rcio - Rua da Igreja}})\n* Residence on ''Rua das Courelas'' ({{lang-pt|Casa de Habita\u00e7\u00e3o - Rua das Courelas}})\n* Ribeira da Granja Tidal Pool ({{lang-pt|Po\u00e7o de Mar\u00e9 \u00e0 Ribeira da Granja}})\n* Rural Residence on ''Algar'' ({{lang-pt|Casa de Habita\u00e7\u00e3o ao Algar}})\n* Twin Residences on ''Rua da Igreja'' ({{lang-pt|Casas de Habita\u00e7\u00e3o Geminadas - Rua da Igreja}})\n* Windmill of Algar ({{lang-pt|Moinho de Vento ao Algar}})\n* Windmill of Cruz da Portela {{lang-pt|Moinho de Vento da Cruz da Portela}})\n\n===Religious===\n* Church of the Divine Holy Spirit ({{lang-pt|Igreja Paroquial das Feteira/Igreja do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo}})\n* Former Parish Rectory/Residence ({{lang-pt|Passal da Feteira}})\nThere are approximately 37 ''imp\u00e9rios'' or religious structures to honour the [[Cult of the Holy Spirit|Holy Spirit]] on the island, of these seven are located in the civil parish.

That way, the limit coincided with the parish of Ribeirinha (until 1906) and the territory was part of Angra. Many of the references to ''Marco'' refers to the diverse points in the parish, that ''marked'' and demarcated the captaincy's boundaries. This situation changed in 1565, when experienced geographers through a 1565 accord of the ''Tribunal da Rela\u00e7\u00e3o da Corte'' (who had long opposed the Donatary-Captains Ant\u00e3o Martins and Manuel Corte-Real),<ref>Francisco Ferreira Drummond, [[s:Anais da Ilha Terceira/I/VIII|''Anais da Ilha Terceira'', vol.

The final demarkation was concluded on 8 July 1565, and put an end to quarrels that had been raging  since 1525, over the limits of Altares.<ref>Francisco Ferreira Drummond, [[s: Anais da Ilha Terceira/I/XIX#Ano de 1565|''Anais da Ilha Terceira'', vol.

Angra do Hero\u00edsmo, 1974.</ref> By 1568, the parish of S\u00e3o Pedro da Ribeirinha was already created, and included the territory of Feteira. In this context, when they structured the municipalities of Terceira, the limit of Ribeirinha, which extended to the edge of the volcanic fields of Feteira, began to be the border between Angra and S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o. The area east of the volcanic fields, between ''Canada do Marco'' and the parish limits, was part of the region of Porto Judeu (and by extension the municipality of Vila de S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o). This explains the successive changes east of the parish, that occurred between 1911 and 1928.\n\nLocated on the peripheral area, with little potable water, the settlement was late in developing and, then, slow to grow. The original settlement developed from the small nuclei that sprang around the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Merc\u00eas, a small temple constructed at the top of ''Caminho das Vinhas''. Yet, at the beginning of the 18th century, two centuries and a half after its settlement, only included six permanent residences. That hermitage, which maintained its architectural design, was constructed in 1590, through the initiative of Father Manuel Martins Coelho Bai\u00e3o, then vicar of the parish of Ribeirinha, whose territory included Feteira.<ref name=\"Merelim\"/> The locality included few residents, and the priest constructed the hermitage at his own expense, to celebrated mass during the period of grape cultivation and winemaking, and included an improvised building so that the priest could overnight during the harvest. The selection of the invocation, to Our Lady of Mercy, originated in Spain, and was popularized by the monks of the Order of Our Lady of Mercy, founded by [[S\u00e3o Pedro Nolasco]]. The image was considered a protector of captive Christians in North Africa, and specifically to those captured by [[Saracen]] raiders. The invocation was also a patron of various brotherhoods, formed by slaves, who considered the image as vestige of liberation.<ref>Augusto de Lima J\u00fanior, ''Hist\u00f3ria de Nossa Senhora em Minas Gerais: origens das principais invoca\u00e7\u00f5es''. Belo Horizonte: Editora Aut\u00eantica, 2008, p. 117.</ref>\n\nWithout any consistent source of potable water, the area continued to be sparsely populated until the beginning of the 19th century, when the expansion of cistern construction, growth in the winemaking industry and the opening of the ''Royal Roadway'' facilities the settlement of families and the place began to take on a life of its own. At this time, the hermitage, which became the property of the Toste Parreira family, became the centre of village life and embryo for the parish of Feteira.\n\nOn 10 September 1863 Feteira was elevated to the status of suffrage of the parish of S\u00e3o Pedro da Ribeirinha, transforming the small hermitage into local cult. At the time there were 300 permanent inhabitants.<ref name=\"Merelim\"/> It first cura was Father Domingos Correia de \u00c1vila. The hermitage, which was owned by In\u00e1cio Toste Parreira, was too small install the Holy Sacrament, meaning the parish of Ribeirinha still retained its importance. As a consequence, after its elevation, there was an upswell of interest in constructing a new church of adequate dimensions, therein the intention to expand the hermitage. Yet, the propertyowner opposed the idea, and did not cede any land for its construction. Following his obstruction, the townsfolk decided to construct the new temple along the Royal Road linking Angra and Vila de S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, along the ''Caminho das Vinhas'' (today ''Canada das Merc\u00eas'').\n\nAs a consequence of this decision, the new Church of Nossa Senhora da Consola\u00e7\u00e3o was inaugurated in 1868, and the hermitage began to be the responsibility of its propertyowners. The change in patron came from In\u00e1cio Toste Parreira, who did not permit the transference of the image of Our Lady of Mercy to the new church. At the time of its inauguration, therefore, Maria Lu\u00edsa Guedes Sampaio (widow of Diogo Labatt) donated the image of Our Lady of Consolation. Consequently, the church obtain its patron, while the ecclesiastical parish retained the Nossa Senhora das Merc\u00eas, since the Vatican did not authorize the change. The Church of Nossa Senhora da Consola\u00e7\u00e3o was officially inaugurated on 20 May 1968, but had to be repaired after damage from the [[1980 Azores earthquake|1980 earthquake]].<ref name=JFSomos/>\n\nThere were approximately 403 homes in 1991.<ref name=JFSomos/>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Praia da Feteira, concelho da Horta, ilha do Faial, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG|thumb|235px|left|A view of the southern border of Feteria at the beach of the same name]]\nThe rural parish is located {{convert|7|km|mi}} from the municipal seat of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo.

That way, the limit coincided with the parish of Ribeirinha (until 1906) and the territory was part of Angra. Many of the references to ''Marco'' refers to the diverse points in the parish, that ''marked'' and demarcated the captaincy's boundaries. This situation changed in 1565, when experienced geographers through a 1565 accord of the ''Tribunal da Rela\u00e7\u00e3o da Corte'' (who had long opposed the Donatary-Captains Ant\u00e3o Martins and Manuel Corte-Real),<ref>Francisco Ferreira Drummond, [[s:Anais da Ilha Terceira/I/VIII|''Anais da Ilha Terceira'', vol.

Angra do Hero\u00edsmo, 1974.</ref> By 1568, the parish of S\u00e3o Pedro da Ribeirinha was already created, and included the territory of Feteira. In this context, when they structured the municipalities of Terceira, the limit of Ribeirinha, which extended to the edge of the volcanic fields of Feteira, began to be the border between Angra and S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o. The area east of the volcanic fields, between ''Canada do Marco'' and the parish limits, was part of the region of Porto Judeu (and by extension the municipality of Vila de S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o). This explains the successive changes east of the parish, that occurred between 1911 and 1928.\n\nLocated on the peripheral area, with little potable water, the settlement was late in developing and, then, slow to grow. The original settlement developed from the small nuclei that sprang around the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Merc\u00eas, a small temple constructed at the top of ''Caminho das Vinhas''. Yet, at the beginning of the 18th century, two centuries and a half after its settlement, only included six permanent residences. That hermitage, which maintained its architectural design, was constructed in 1590, through the initiative of Father Manuel Martins Coelho Bai\u00e3o, then vicar of the parish of Ribeirinha, whose territory included Feteira.<ref name=\"Merelim\"/> The locality included few residents, and the priest constructed the hermitage at his own expense, to celebrated mass during the period of grape cultivation and winemaking, and included an improvised building so that the priest could overnight during the harvest. The selection of the invocation, to Our Lady of Mercy, originated in Spain, and was popularized by the monks of the Order of Our Lady of Mercy, founded by [[S\u00e3o Pedro Nolasco]]. The image was considered a protector of captive Christians in North Africa, and specifically to those captured by [[Saracen]] raiders. The invocation was also a patron of various brotherhoods, formed by slaves, who considered the image as vestige of liberation.<ref>Augusto de Lima J\u00fanior, ''Hist\u00f3ria de Nossa Senhora em Minas Gerais: origens das principais invoca\u00e7\u00f5es''. Belo Horizonte: Editora Aut\u00eantica, 2008, p. 117.</ref>\n\nWithout any consistent source of potable water, the area continued to be sparsely populated until the beginning of the 19th century, when the expansion of cistern construction, growth in the winemaking industry and the opening of the ''Royal Roadway'' facilities the settlement of families and the place began to take on a life of its own. At this time, the hermitage, which became the property of the Toste Parreira family, became the centre of village life and embryo for the parish of Feteira.\n\nOn 10 September 1863 Feteira was elevated to the status of suffrage of the parish of S\u00e3o Pedro da Ribeirinha, transforming the small hermitage into local cult. At the time there were 300 permanent inhabitants.<ref name=\"Merelim\"/> It first cura was Father Domingos Correia de \u00c1vila. The hermitage, which was owned by In\u00e1cio Toste Parreira, was too small install the Holy Sacrament, meaning the parish of Ribeirinha still retained its importance. As a consequence, after its elevation, there was an upswell of interest in constructing a new church of adequate dimensions, therein the intention to expand the hermitage. Yet, the propertyowner opposed the idea, and did not cede any land for its construction. Following his obstruction, the townsfolk decided to construct the new temple along the Royal Road linking Angra and Vila de S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, along the ''Caminho das Vinhas'' (today ''Canada das Merc\u00eas'').\n\nAs a consequence of this decision, the new Church of Nossa Senhora da Consola\u00e7\u00e3o was inaugurated in 1868, and the hermitage began to be the responsibility of its propertyowners. The change in patron came from In\u00e1cio Toste Parreira, who did not permit the transference of the image of Our Lady of Mercy to the new church. At the time of its inauguration, therefore, Maria Lu\u00edsa Guedes Sampaio (widow of Diogo Labatt) donated the image of Our Lady of Consolation. Consequently, the church obtain its patron, while the ecclesiastical parish retained the Nossa Senhora das Merc\u00eas, since the Vatican did not authorize the change. The Church of Nossa Senhora da Consola\u00e7\u00e3o was officially inaugurated on 20 May 1968, but had to be repaired after damage from the [[1980 Azores earthquake|1980 earthquake]].<ref name=JFSomos/>\n\nThere were approximately 403 homes in 1991.<ref name=JFSomos/>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Praia da Feteira, concelho da Horta, ilha do Faial, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG|thumb|235px|left|A view of the southern border of Feteria at the beach of the same name]]\nThe rural parish is located {{convert|7|km|mi}} from the municipal seat of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo.
