An other change from SpaceX is studying the addition of a sunshade, or visor, to unfurl like an umbrella on Starlink satellites to reduce the amount of sunlight glinting off the spacecraft. Musk tweeted Wednesday that SpaceX is taking \"key steps to reduce satellite brightness\". He wrote that the satellites \"should be much less noticeable\" when they are flying at lower altitudes soon after launch. SpaceX is changing the angle of each satellite's solar panel, and all of the Starlink satellites will have sunshades beginning with the ninth launch of the fleet.

By 1917, when both Russian revolutions took place the territory of the actual Azerbaijan had been part of the empire's Transcaucasian administrative region for more than 100 years, alongside the rest of the Transcaucasus, ever since Iran's cession. It was a multinational region of the Russian Empire, where 3 independent states were born later: Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. The population of the latter was in major part Muslims and that is why it is often referred to as Muslim territory when talking about this period of history. After the February revolution of 1917 in Russia on March 22, 1917, the [[Special Transcaucasian Committee]] ''Ozakom'' (short for ''Osobyi Zakavkazskii Komitet'', \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0439 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442) was established  to fill the administrative gap following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|abdication of the Tsar]]. The members of Ozakom were the members of the State Council and representatives of the Armenian, Georgian and Azerbaijan political elite.  Ozakom announced that in the following months the most important issues, i.e. national, religious, agrarian and social, were to be solved by the Transcaucasian Constituent Assembly. In the course of April and May 1917 several Muslim Assemblies took place. Like many ethnic minorities of Transcaucasia, Azeris aimed at secession from Russia after the February Revolution. Two general opinions were expressed by the representatives of the Muslim community (Mammad Hasan Hajinski, [[Mammad Amin Rasulzade]], [[Alimardan Topchubashov]], [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]], and other founders of the future Azerbaijan Democratic Republic): pan-Turkish, meaning joining with Turkey, and federalization (expressed by M. Rasulzade). The Transcaucasian region got an opportunity to decide its destiny, taking the course of federalization. In accordance with the new structure, the Transcaucasian region was to have a fully independent internal policy, leaving to the new Russian government only foreign policy, defense and army, and custom.\n\nAfter the October revolution of 1917 the Transcaucaisan government had to change its policy as Russia was now involved in the Civil War. The Transcaucausians did not accept the Bolshevik revolution. In February, 1918 the Transcaucasian Council (\u201cSejm\u201d) started its work in Tbilisi, and this was the first serious step towards complete independence of the Caucasian nations. The \u201cSejm\u201d consisted of 125 deputies and represented 3 leading parties: Georgian mensheviks (32 deputies), Azerbaijan Muslims (\u201cMussavat\u201d, 30 deputies) and Armenian \u201cdashnaks\u201d (27 deputies). Bolsheviks refused to join the Sejm and established their own government of the local [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] in Baku: the so-called Baku Commune (November 1917{{spaced ndash}}31 July 1918). The Commune was formed by 85 [[Social Revolutionaries]] and [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries|Left Social Revolutionaries]], 48 [[Bolsheviks]], 36 [[Dashnaks]], 18 [[Musavat]]ists and 13 [[Mensheviks]]. [[Stepan Shaumyan]], a Bolshevik, and  [[Prokopius Dzhaparidze]], a leftist SR, were elected Chairmen of the Council of People's Commissioners of the Commune of Baku. \n[[File:Mammad Amin Rasulzade.jpg|left|180px|thumb|A founder and Speaker of the Republic, [[Mammad Amin Rasulzade]] is widely regarded as the national leader of [[Azerbaijan]].]]\n\nThe [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] was degrading after the collapse of the Russian Empire. The Russian forces were substituted by new Armenian bodies, which were not prepared to the war. Given the circumstances, the Transcaucasian Sejm signed the [[Armistice of Erzincan]] with the [[Ottoman Empire]] on December 5, 1917.  On March 3, 1918, the Bolshevik government in Russia signed the Brest-Litovsk Treaty with Germany. One of the terms was the loss of the regions of [[Kars]], [[Batumi]] and [[Ardahan]] to the Ottoman Empire.

However, Parliament was in complicated circumstance, education, the enlightenment of population was crucial factors in its policy. New schools for girls, hospitals in villages, libraries, courses for teachers were founded in different parts of the country by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The foundation of Baku State University on September 1, 1919, demonstrates that education was an essential factor in the policy of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Although the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic collapsed, Baku State University played great in gaining freedom again in the future. Parliament started to create an opportunity for a young generation to study abroad in order to increase the number of educated people. 100 students were sent abroad with the help of state fund.http://www.ebooks.az/view/uSjb49G5.pdf\n\n===Domestic===\nPolitical life in the ADR was dominated by the [[Musavat]] Party, the local winner of the [[Constituent Assembly]] elections of 1917.

Throughout its existence from 1918 to 1920, the Republic of Azerbaijan had diplomatic relations with a number of states.

That diplomatic relations be established between the United States of America and the Republic of Azerbaijan.<ref name=\"Bulletin d 1919, pp. 6\"/>\n\nPresident Wilson granted the delegation an audience, at which he displayed a cold and rather unsympathetic attitude.  As the Azerbaijani delegation reported to its Government, Wilson had stated that the Conference did not want to partition the world into small pieces.  Wilson advised Azerbaijan that it would be better for them to develop a spirit of confederation, and that such a confederation of all the peoples of Transcaucasia could receive the protection of some Power on the basis of a mandate granted by the League of Nations.  The Azerbaijani question, Wilson concluded, could not be solved prior to the general settlement of the Russian question.<ref>''Report of the Delegation'', No. 7, June, 1919, Fund of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dossier No. 3, p. 7, as cited in Raevskii, ''\u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u041c\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e'', p. 53</ref>\n\n[[File:FireTemple1919.jpg|thumb|right|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic postage stamp, 1919]]\nHowever, despite Wilson's attitude, on January 12, 1920, the [[Allied Supreme Council]] extended ''de facto'' recognition to Azerbaijan, along with Georgia, and Armenia.<ref>Prof. Avtandil Menteshashvili, \"From the history of relations of Georgian democratic Republic with Soviet Russia and Entente\". 1918\u20131921.

In particular, these included disputes with the [[First Republic of Armenia]] ([[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], Zangezur (today the Armenian province of [[Syunik Province|Syunik]]), and [[Qazakh]]) and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] ([[Balak\u0259n|Balakan]], [[Zaqatala (rayon)|Zaqatala]], and [[Qakh]]).  The ADR also claimed territories of the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]] ([[Derbent]]), but they were not as persistent about these claims as they were about the territories they disputed between Armenia and Georgia.\n\n=== Armenian-Azerbaijani war ===\n[[File:Army of Azerbaijan in 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers and officers of the army of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918]]\n[[File:Mexmandarov 1.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Samad bey Mehmandarov]] was a General of the Artillery in Imperial Russian Army before becoming the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic's Minister of Defense.]]\n{{Main|Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani War|Battle of Baku}}\n\nIn the summer of 1918, the Dashnaks, together with the SRs and the Mensheviks, expelled the [[Bolsheviks]], who refused to ask for British support, and founded the [[Centro Caspian Dictatorship]] (1 August 1918{{spaced ndash}}15 September 1918). The CCD was supported by the [[United Kingdom|British]] who sent an expeditionary force to Baku to help the Armenians and the [[Mensheviks]]. The purpose of the British forces (led by  [[Major General]] [[Lionel Dunsterville]], who arrived from [[Persian Empire|Persia]]'s [[Enzeli]] at the head of a 1,000-strong elite force) was to seize the oil fields in Baku ahead of [[Enver Pasha]]'s advancing Turkish troops ([[Army of Islam (Ottoman Empire)|Army of Islam]]) or the [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser]]'s [[German peoples|German]] troops (who were in neighboring Georgia) and to block a Bolshevik consolidation in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]].\n\n[[File:bakuroad.jpg|left|thumb|North Staffords, a contingent of the [[Dunsterforce]], during the [[Battle of Baku]]]]\nThe city of [[Baku]] only became the capital of the Republic in September 1918.\n\nUnable to resist advancing Turkish troops during the [[Battle of Baku]], Dunsterville ordered the evacuation of the city on September 14, after six weeks of occupation, and withdrew to Iran; most of the Armenian population escaped with the British forces. The Ottoman Army of Islam and its Azeri allies, led by [[Nuri Pasha]], entered Baku on September 15 and slaughtered between 10,000 \u2013 20,000 Armenians in retaliation for the March massacre of Muslims.<ref name=\"Swietochowski\"/><ref name=\"hrw\"/><ref name=\"Croissant-15\">Croissant. ''Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict'', p. 15.</ref> The capital of the ADR was finally moved from Ganja to Baku. However, after the [[Armistice of Mudros]] between Great Britain and Turkey on October 30, Turkish troops were replaced by the [[Allies of World War I]]. Headed by British general [[William Montgomery Thomson]], who had declared himself the military governor of Baku, 5,000 [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] soldiers arrived in Baku on November 17, 1918. By General Thomson's order, [[martial law]] was implemented in Baku.\n\n=== Fight for survival ===\n[[File:SV100190-azeri genocide.jpg|thumb|200px|Memorial to Turkish soldiers killed in the Battle of Baku]]\n[[File:1 march days 1918.jpg|thumb|200px|Remains of the editorial offices of the ''Kaspi'' newspaper on [[Baku]]'s Nikolayevskaya Street (modern-day Istiqlaliyyet Street), ruined during the [[March Days]] in 1918]]\n\nThe ADR found itself in a difficult position, hemmed in from the north by advancing [[Denikin]] forces, unfriendly Iran in the south; the British administration was not hostile but indifferent to the plight of Muslims. General Thomson initially did not recognize the Republic {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but tacitly cooperated with it. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On April 25, 1919, a violent protest organized by [[Talysh people|Talysh]] workers of pro-Bolshevik orientation exploded in [[Lankaran]] and deposed the [[Provisional Military Dictatorship of Mughan|Mughan Territorial Administration]], a military dictatorship led by Russian colonel T. P. Sukhorukov. On May 15, the Extraordinary Congress of the \"Councils of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies\" of Lankaran district proclaimed the ''[[Mughan Soviet Republic]]''. By mid-1919 the situation in Azerbaijan had more or less stabilized, and British forces left on August 19, 1919.\n\nThis made the ADR pursue a neutral policy with regards to the Russian Civil War. On June 16, 1919, the ADR and Georgia signed a defensive treaty against the White troops of General [[Anton Denikin]]'s [[Volunteer Army]] who were threatening to start an offensive on their borders. Denikin concluded a secret military pact with Armenia. The Republic of Armenia with its forces formed the 7th corps of Denikin's army and gained military support from the White Movement. This fact increased the tension between the ADR and Armenia. However, the war never materialized as by January 1920, Denikin's army was completely defeated by the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|XI Red Army]], which later started to concentrate its troops on Azerbaijan's borders.\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan were engaged in [[Armenian-Azeri war 1918|fighting over Karabakh]] for some part of 1919. The fighting increased in intensity by February 1920 and martial law was introduced in Karabakh, which was enforced by the newly formed National Army, led by general [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]].\n\n== Fall of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (April 1920) ==\n{{Main|Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan SSR}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe Baku secession in 1918 was a sensitive strike for Soviet Russia, and it caused heavy consequences during the economic warfare.  Moscow's intention to regain control of the vitally necessary region was strong and coherent, and on its way the Soviet government was ready to accept any concession.\n\nIn 1918 and 1919 Soviet Russia rejected all attempts made by the ADR to establish diplomatic relations between the two.  1920 was marked by a diplomatic dispatch which started with a radiogram sent by Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Georgy Chicherin]], which said: \u201cThe government of the Russian Socialist Federative Republic reverts to Azerbaijan with an initiative to immediately launch talks with the Soviet government aiming at acceleration and finishing of the White army bodies in the South of Russia\u201d. In his response, [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]], the head of the Azerbaijan government, insisted on non-interference in the internal affairs of the country. The Soviets considered this position as support rendered by Azerbaijan to the White army led by Denikin, and lobby of the British interests on the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn 1919 the Azerbaijan left parties including the Baku organization of the Russian communist party, \u201cGummet\u201d and \u201cAdalet\u201d, started consolidating and by the end of the year the Azerbaijan Communist Party (ACP) was created.  The ACP held an active agitation campaign in Baku and its region and was supported by Russia.\n\nIn 1920 the Soviet government established a strong relationship with the new Turkish government headed by Mustafa Kemal. The Soviets were ready to supply Turkey with armaments in exchange for Turkish military support in Azerbaijan. Turkey particularly suggested using military bodies formed in Dagestan to occupy Baku and to avoid exploding its petrol storage reservoirs. Turkish support played an important role and attracted to the Bolsheviks the sympathies of the Muslim population in Azerbaijan.\n\nBy March 1920, it was obvious that the economic and political situation in the ADR had reached a crucial point. In accordance with the analysis made by the Bolsheviks the ADR government received weak support from the people and this should have provided success to the operation. [[Vladimir Lenin]] said that the invasion was justified by the fact that [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] could not survive without Baku oil.<ref>[http://www.globalrus.ru/print_this/134413/ Lenin and Caucasus oil] on GlobalRus.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref>[http://www.window2baku.com/001history_3.htm Deliveries of Baku oil to Russia in April-May 1920] \"History of the City of Baku\" {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nAfter a major political crisis, the Fifth Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic resigned on April 1, 1920. In the beginning of April 1920 the [[Russia]]n [[11th Army (RSFSR)|XI Red Army]] reached the border of Azerbaijan and prepared to attack. The official date of the operation is considered April 25, 1920, when the Azerbaijan Communist Party transformed the party's cells into military bodies, which were to take part in the attack. On April 27, 1920, the Provisional Revolutionary Committee with [[Nariman Narimanov]] as chairman was established and issued the ADR Government an ultimatum. The labor military detachments managed to occupy oilfields, state offices, post offices. Police regiments defected to the rebels. To avoid bloodshed, the deputies complied with the demand and the ADR officially ceased to exist on April 28, 1920, giving way to the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Azerbaijan SSR) as its successor state.\n \nThe Red Army, which entered Baku by April 30, 1920, met very little resistance in Baku from Azerbaijani forces, which were tied up on the Karabakh front. The first [[Communist]] government of Azerbaijan consisted almost entirely of native Azerbaijanis from the left factions of the ''Hummat'' and ''Adalat'' parties.<ref name=\"Pipes\">Richard Pipes.

The uprising was crushed by government troops by May 31. Leaders of the ADR either fled to the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], Turkey and Iran, or were captured by the Bolsheviks and executed, including Gen. Selimov, Gen. Sulkevich, Gen.

Other prominent ADR military figures like former Minister of Defense General [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]] and deputy defense minister General [[Ali-Agha Shikhlinski]] (who was called \"the God of Artillery\" ) were at first arrested, but then released two months later thanks to efforts of [[Nariman Narimanov]]. Gen. Mehmandarov and Gen. Shikhlinsky spent their last years teaching in the Azerbaijan SSR military school.\n\nIn the end, \"the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918-20 quickly or easily.

By 1917, when both Russian revolutions took place the territory of the actual Azerbaijan had been part of the empire's Transcaucasian administrative region for more than 100 years, alongside the rest of the Transcaucasus, ever since Iran's cession. It was a multinational region of the Russian Empire, where 3 independent states were born later: Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. The population of the latter was in major part Muslims and that is why it is often referred to as Muslim territory when talking about this period of history. After the February revolution of 1917 in Russia on March 22, 1917, the [[Special Transcaucasian Committee]] ''Ozakom'' (short for ''Osobyi Zakavkazskii Komitet'', \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0439 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442) was established  to fill the administrative gap following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|abdication of the Tsar]]. The members of Ozakom were the members of the State Council and representatives of the Armenian, Georgian and Azerbaijan political elite.  Ozakom announced that in the following months the most important issues, i.e. national, religious, agrarian and social, were to be solved by the Transcaucasian Constituent Assembly. In the course of April and May 1917 several Muslim Assemblies took place. Like many ethnic minorities of Transcaucasia, Azeris aimed at secession from Russia after the February Revolution. Two general opinions were expressed by the representatives of the Muslim community (Mammad Hasan Hajinski, [[Mammad Amin Rasulzade]], [[Alimardan Topchubashov]], [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]], and other founders of the future Azerbaijan Democratic Republic): pan-Turkish, meaning joining with Turkey, and federalization (expressed by M. Rasulzade). The Transcaucasian region got an opportunity to decide its destiny, taking the course of federalization. In accordance with the new structure, the Transcaucasian region was to have a fully independent internal policy, leaving to the new Russian government only foreign policy, defense and army, and custom.\n\nAfter the October revolution of 1917 the Transcaucaisan government had to change its policy as Russia was now involved in the Civil War. The Transcaucausians did not accept the Bolshevik revolution. In February, 1918 the Transcaucasian Council (\u201cSejm\u201d) started its work in Tbilisi, and this was the first serious step towards complete independence of the Caucasian nations. The \u201cSejm\u201d consisted of 125 deputies and represented 3 leading parties: Georgian mensheviks (32 deputies), Azerbaijan Muslims (\u201cMussavat\u201d, 30 deputies) and Armenian \u201cdashnaks\u201d (27 deputies). Bolsheviks refused to join the Sejm and established their own government of the local [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] in Baku: the so-called Baku Commune (November 1917{{spaced ndash}}31 July 1918). The Commune was formed by 85 [[Social Revolutionaries]] and [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries|Left Social Revolutionaries]], 48 [[Bolsheviks]], 36 [[Dashnaks]], 18 [[Musavat]]ists and 13 [[Mensheviks]]. [[Stepan Shaumyan]], a Bolshevik, and  [[Prokopius Dzhaparidze]], a leftist SR, were elected Chairmen of the Council of People's Commissioners of the Commune of Baku. \n[[File:Mammad Amin Rasulzade.jpg|left|180px|thumb|A founder and Speaker of the Republic, [[Mammad Amin Rasulzade]] is widely regarded as the national leader of [[Azerbaijan]].]]\n\nThe [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] was degrading after the collapse of the Russian Empire. The Russian forces were substituted by new Armenian bodies, which were not prepared to the war. Given the circumstances, the Transcaucasian Sejm signed the [[Armistice of Erzincan]] with the [[Ottoman Empire]] on December 5, 1917.  On March 3, 1918, the Bolshevik government in Russia signed the Brest-Litovsk Treaty with Germany. One of the terms was the loss of the regions of [[Kars]], [[Batumi]] and [[Ardahan]] to the Ottoman Empire. The terms of the Treaty revealed a deep conflict between Georgians and Armenians on one side and the Muslims on another.  The peace talks between the Sejm and Turkey started in March, 1918, in Trapezond did not have any results.  \nThe Ottoman Empire delivered an ultimatum to the Sejm with requirements to accept the terms of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty and initiated an attack to occupy the territories of [[Kars]], [[Batumi]] and [[Ardahan]].\n\n[[File:Flag of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan (1918).svg|thumb|First flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic adopted on June 21, 1918, with reference number 144<ref>[http://aghsu.cls.az/front/files/libraries/2374/books/177531451388440.pdf \u0410\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 (1918\u20151920). \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b].

The Musavat and Ittihad parties were accused of [[Pan-Turkism]] by the Bolsheviks and their allies. The Armenian and Muslim militias engaged in armed confrontation, with the formally neutral Bolsheviks tacitly supporting the Armenian side. All the non-Azeri political groups of the city joined the Bolsheviks against the Muslims: Bolsheviks, [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]], Social Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and even the anti-Bolshevik [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]] found themselves for the first time on the same side of the barricade because they were all fighting \"for the Russian cause\".

Following the Moslem rising of 18 March, it had to introduce a dictatorship. This rising, instigated by the Mussavat, set the Tartar and Turkish population, led by their reactionary bourgeoisie, against the Soviet, which consisted of Russians with support from the Armenians.

Despite the objections of [[Mammad Amin Rasulzadeh]], Shafi bey Rustambayli, and others, the Parliament decided to surrender the government in order not to cause bloodshed.

However, Parliament was in complicated circumstance, education, the enlightenment of population was crucial factors in its policy. New schools for girls, hospitals in villages, libraries, courses for teachers were founded in different parts of the country by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The foundation of Baku State University on September 1, 1919, demonstrates that education was an essential factor in the policy of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Although the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic collapsed, Baku State University played great in gaining freedom again in the future.

Upon its arrival, the Azerbaijani delegation addressed a note to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]], making the following requests:\n::1. That the independence of Azerbaijan be recognized,\n::2. That Wilsonian principles be applied to Azerbaijan,\n::3. That the Azerbaijani delegation be admitted to the Paris Peace Conference,\n::4. That Azerbaijan be admitted to the League of Nations,\n::5. That the United States War Department extend military help to Azerbaijan, and\n::6. That diplomatic relations be established between the United States of America and the Republic of Azerbaijan.<ref name=\"Bulletin d 1919, pp. 6\"/>\n\nPresident Wilson granted the delegation an audience, at which he displayed a cold and rather unsympathetic attitude.  As the Azerbaijani delegation reported to its Government, Wilson had stated that the Conference did not want to partition the world into small pieces.  Wilson advised Azerbaijan that it would be better for them to develop a spirit of confederation, and that such a confederation of all the peoples of Transcaucasia could receive the protection of some Power on the basis of a mandate granted by the League of Nations.  The Azerbaijani question, Wilson concluded, could not be solved prior to the general settlement of the Russian question.<ref>''Report of the Delegation'', No. 7, June, 1919, Fund of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dossier No. 3, p. 7, as cited in Raevskii, ''\u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u041c\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e'', p. 53</ref>\n\n[[File:FireTemple1919.jpg|thumb|right|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic postage stamp, 1919]]\nHowever, despite Wilson's attitude, on January 12, 1920, the [[Allied Supreme Council]] extended ''de facto'' recognition to Azerbaijan, along with Georgia, and Armenia.<ref>Prof. Avtandil Menteshashvili, \"From the history of relations of Georgian democratic Republic with Soviet Russia and Entente\". 1918\u20131921.

In addition, the consulates of Azerbaijan started operating in Tabriz, Khoy, Anzali, Rasht, Ahar, Mashhad, Batumi, Kiev, Crimea, Ashgabat and elsewhere. Baku, Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Denmark, Italy, France, Sweden, Switzerland, England, USA, Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland, Finland and other countries have official representations at different levels.\n\n==== Persia ====\nThe name of \"Azerbaijan\" which the leading [[Musavat]] party adopted, for political reasons,<ref name=\"Routledge\"/><ref name=\"Sochineniya, vol II/1\"/> was prior to the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918 exclusively used to identify the [[Iranian Azerbaijan|adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran]].<ref name=\"I.B.Tauris\"/><ref name=\"I.B.

If so, they said, it should be stated clearly, otherwise Iranians would be opposed to calling that republic Azerbaijan.  Consequently, to allay Iranian fears, the Azerbaijani government would accommodatingly use the term Caucasian Azerbaijan in its documents for circulation abroad.}}\n\nOn 16 July 1919, the Council of Ministers [of ADR] appointed Adil Khan Ziatkhan, who had up to that time served as Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, diplomatic representative of Azerbaijan to the court of the Persian King of Kings.<ref>\"\u0412\u043d\u0435\u0448\u043d\u044f\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432 \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435 1919-\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\", ''\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0432'', No. 6 (37), 1929, p. 94.</ref>  A Persian delegation headed by Seyed Ziaed-Din Tabatai came to Baku, to negotiate transit, tariff, mail, customs, and other such agreements.

In particular, these included disputes with the [[First Republic of Armenia]] ([[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], Zangezur (today the Armenian province of [[Syunik Province|Syunik]]), and [[Qazakh]]) and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] ([[Balak\u0259n|Balakan]], [[Zaqatala (rayon)|Zaqatala]], and [[Qakh]]).  The ADR also claimed territories of the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]] ([[Derbent]]), but they were not as persistent about these claims as they were about the territories they disputed between Armenia and Georgia.\n\n=== Armenian-Azerbaijani war ===\n[[File:Army of Azerbaijan in 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers and officers of the army of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918]]\n[[File:Mexmandarov 1.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Samad bey Mehmandarov]] was a General of the Artillery in Imperial Russian Army before becoming the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic's Minister of Defense.]]\n{{Main|Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani War|Battle of Baku}}\n\nIn the summer of 1918, the Dashnaks, together with the SRs and the Mensheviks, expelled the [[Bolsheviks]], who refused to ask for British support, and founded the [[Centro Caspian Dictatorship]] (1 August 1918{{spaced ndash}}15 September 1918). The CCD was supported by the [[United Kingdom|British]] who sent an expeditionary force to Baku to help the Armenians and the [[Mensheviks]]. The purpose of the British forces (led by  [[Major General]] [[Lionel Dunsterville]], who arrived from [[Persian Empire|Persia]]'s [[Enzeli]] at the head of a 1,000-strong elite force) was to seize the oil fields in Baku ahead of [[Enver Pasha]]'s advancing Turkish troops ([[Army of Islam (Ottoman Empire)|Army of Islam]]) or the [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser]]'s [[German peoples|German]] troops (who were in neighboring Georgia) and to block a Bolshevik consolidation in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]].\n\n[[File:bakuroad.jpg|left|thumb|North Staffords, a contingent of the [[Dunsterforce]], during the [[Battle of Baku]]]]\nThe city of [[Baku]] only became the capital of the Republic in September 1918.\n\nUnable to resist advancing Turkish troops during the [[Battle of Baku]], Dunsterville ordered the evacuation of the city on September 14, after six weeks of occupation, and withdrew to Iran; most of the Armenian population escaped with the British forces. The Ottoman Army of Islam and its Azeri allies, led by [[Nuri Pasha]], entered Baku on September 15 and slaughtered between 10,000 \u2013 20,000 Armenians in retaliation for the March massacre of Muslims.<ref name=\"Swietochowski\"/><ref name=\"hrw\"/><ref name=\"Croissant-15\">Croissant. ''Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict'', p. 15.</ref> The capital of the ADR was finally moved from Ganja to Baku. However, after the [[Armistice of Mudros]] between Great Britain and Turkey on October 30, Turkish troops were replaced by the [[Allies of World War I]]. Headed by British general [[William Montgomery Thomson]], who had declared himself the military governor of Baku, 5,000 [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] soldiers arrived in Baku on November 17, 1918. By General Thomson's order, [[martial law]] was implemented in Baku.\n\n=== Fight for survival ===\n[[File:SV100190-azeri genocide.jpg|thumb|200px|Memorial to Turkish soldiers killed in the Battle of Baku]]\n[[File:1 march days 1918.jpg|thumb|200px|Remains of the editorial offices of the ''Kaspi'' newspaper on [[Baku]]'s Nikolayevskaya Street (modern-day Istiqlaliyyet Street), ruined during the [[March Days]] in 1918]]\n\nThe ADR found itself in a difficult position, hemmed in from the north by advancing [[Denikin]] forces, unfriendly Iran in the south; the British administration was not hostile but indifferent to the plight of Muslims. General Thomson initially did not recognize the Republic {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but tacitly cooperated with it. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On April 25, 1919, a violent protest organized by [[Talysh people|Talysh]] workers of pro-Bolshevik orientation exploded in [[Lankaran]] and deposed the [[Provisional Military Dictatorship of Mughan|Mughan Territorial Administration]], a military dictatorship led by Russian colonel V.T. Sukhorukov. On May 15, the Extraordinary Congress of the \"Councils of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies\" of Lankaran district proclaimed the ''[[Mughan Soviet Republic]]''. By mid-1919 the situation in Azerbaijan had more or less stabilized, and British forces left on August 19, 1919.\n\nThis made the ADR pursue a neutral policy with regards to the Russian Civil War. On June 16, 1919, the ADR and Georgia signed a defensive treaty against the White troops of General [[Anton Denikin]]'s [[Volunteer Army]] who were threatening to start an offensive on their borders. Denikin concluded a secret military pact with Armenia. The Republic of Armenia with its forces formed the 7th corps of Denikin's army and gained military support from the White Movement. This fact increased the tension between the ADR and Armenia. However, the war never materialized as by January 1920, Denikin's army was completely defeated by the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|XI Red Army]], which later started to concentrate its troops on Azerbaijan's borders.\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan were engaged in [[Armenian-Azeri war 1918|fighting over Karabakh]] for some part of 1919. The fighting increased in intensity by February 1920 and martial law was introduced in Karabakh, which was enforced by the newly formed National Army, led by general [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]].\n\n== Fall of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (April 1920) ==\n{{Main|Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan SSR}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe Baku secession in 1918 was a sensitive strike for Soviet Russia, and it caused heavy consequences during the economic warfare.  Moscow's intention to regain control of the vitally necessary region was strong and coherent, and on its way the Soviet government was ready to accept any concession.\n\nIn 1918 and 1919 Soviet Russia rejected all attempts made by the ADR to establish diplomatic relations between the two.  1920 was marked by a diplomatic dispatch which started with a radiogram sent by Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Georgy Chicherin]], which said: \u201cThe government of the Russian Socialist Federative Republic reverts to Azerbaijan with an initiative to immediately launch talks with the Soviet government aiming at acceleration and finishing of the White army bodies in the South of Russia\u201d. In his response, [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]], the head of the Azerbaijan government, insisted on non-interference in the internal affairs of the country. The Soviets considered this position as support rendered by Azerbaijan to the White army led by Denikin, and lobby of the British interests on the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn 1919 the Azerbaijan left parties including the Baku organization of the Russian communist party, \u201cGummet\u201d and \u201cAdalet\u201d, started consolidating and by the end of the year the Azerbaijan Communist Party (ACP) was created.  The ACP held an active agitation campaign in Baku and its region and was supported by Russia.\n\nIn 1920 the Soviet government established a strong relationship with the new Turkish government headed by Mustafa Kemal. The Soviets were ready to supply Turkey with armaments in exchange for Turkish military support in Azerbaijan. Turkey particularly suggested using military bodies formed in Dagestan to occupy Baku and to avoid exploding its petrol storage reservoirs. Turkish support played an important role and attracted to the Bolsheviks the sympathies of the Muslim population in Azerbaijan.\n\nBy March 1920, it was obvious that the economic and political situation in the ADR had reached a crucial point. In accordance with the analysis made by the Bolsheviks the ADR government received weak support from the people and this should have provided success to the operation. [[Vladimir Lenin]] said that the invasion was justified by the fact that [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] could not survive without Baku oil.<ref>[http://www.globalrus.ru/print_this/134413/ Lenin and Caucasus oil] on GlobalRus.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref>[http://www.window2baku.com/001history_3.htm Deliveries of Baku oil to Russia in April-May 1920] \"History of the City of Baku\" {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nAfter a major political crisis, the Fifth Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic resigned on April 1, 1920. In the beginning of April 1920 the [[Russia]]n [[11th Army (RSFSR)|XI Red Army]] reached the border of Azerbaijan and prepared to attack. The official date of the operation is considered April 25, 1920, when the Azerbaijan Communist Party transformed the party's cells into military bodies, which were to take part in the attack. On April 27, 1920, the Provisional Revolutionary Committee with [[Nariman Narimanov]] as chairman was established and issued the ADR Government an ultimatum. The labor military detachments managed to occupy oilfields, state offices, post offices. Police regiments defected to the rebels. To avoid bloodshed, the deputies complied with the demand and the ADR officially ceased to exist on April 28, 1920, giving way to the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Azerbaijan SSR) as its successor state.\n \nThe Red Army, which entered Baku by April 30, 1920, met very little resistance in Baku from Azerbaijani forces, which were tied up on the Karabakh front. The first [[Communist]] government of Azerbaijan consisted almost entirely of native Azerbaijanis from the left factions of the ''Hummat'' and ''Adalat'' parties.<ref name=\"Pipes\">Richard Pipes.

The uprising was crushed by government troops by May 31. Leaders of the ADR either fled to the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], Turkey and Iran, or were captured by the Bolsheviks and executed, including Gen. Selimov, Gen. Sulkevich, Gen. Agalarov: a total of over 20 generals ([[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]] was later allowed to emigrate),<ref name=\"zerbaijan.com\">[http://www.zerbaijan.com/azgenerals.htm List of Azerbaijani Generals and Admirals, Military Leaders and Heroes, May 2006]</ref> or assassinated by Armenian militants like [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]] and Behbudagha Javanshir.<ref name=\"azer.com\">[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/73_folder/73_articles/73_parliamentfate.htm \"The Fate of some of the ADR Parliament Members\", Azerbaijan International (7.3) Autumn 1999]</ref> Most students and citizens travelling abroad remained in those countries, never to return. Other prominent ADR military figures like former Minister of Defense General [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]] and deputy defense minister General [[Ali-Agha Shikhlinski]] (who was called \"the God of Artillery\" ) were at first arrested, but then released two months later thanks to efforts of [[Nariman Narimanov]].

With the retirement of ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' in 2008, ''Queen Mary 2'' is the only transatlantic ocean liner in regular service between [[Southampton]], England, and [[New York City]], United States. The ship is also used for cruising, including an annual world cruise.<ref>[http://www.cunard.com/Ships/Queen-Mary-2/ Queen Mary 2 Cruises] ''Cunard'' Retrieved 21 January 2012</ref>\n\nShe was designed by a team of British naval architects led by [[Stephen Payne (naval architect)|Stephen Payne]], and was constructed in France by [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]].

Diesel engines, augmented by [[gas turbine]]s, are used to generate electricity for electric motors for propulsion and for on-board use.\n\n''Queen Mary 2'''s facilities include fifteen restaurants and bars, five swimming pools, a casino, a ballroom, a theatre, and the first [[planetarium]] at sea.\n\n==Characteristics==\n''Queen Mary 2'' is the flagship of Cunard Line. She was constructed to replace the then  ageing ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'', which was the Cunard flagship from 1969 to 2004 and the last major ocean liner built before ''Queen Mary 2''. ''Queen Mary 2'' had the [[Royal Mail Ship]] (RMS) prefix conferred on her by the [[Royal Mail]] when she entered service in 2004, as a gesture to Cunard's history.<ref>{{cite news | title = Royal Mail employee's Courier newspaper | publisher = Royal Mail | date = August 2007}}</ref>\n\n''Queen Mary 2'' is not a [[steamship]] like many of her predecessors, but is powered primarily by four [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel engine]]s, with two additional [[gas turbine]]s providing extra power when required; this [[integrated electric propulsion]] configuration is used to produce the power to drive her four electric propulsion pods as well as the ship's hotel services.<ref name = \"Queen Mary 2 Technical\"/> The spaces for these prime movers are also split, and controls are also backed up, with the intention of preventing a single failure from disabling the ship.<ref name = Mathisen/>\n\nLike her predecessor ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' she is built for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and is also regularly used for cruising.

The plants' energy is supplied primarily by steam and cooling water from the ship's gas turbines and diesel engines, or if needed by steam from the ship's two oil-fired boilers. The traditional [[multiple-effect distillation]] technology has been improved for the ship's plant, so that [[Fouling#Micro fouling|scaling]] of plates is reduced, vastly reducing maintenance required. The desalinated water has a very low salt content of less than five parts per million. Average total water production is {{convert|1100000|L|USgal}} per day with a capacity of {{convert|1890000|L|USgal}} so that there is ample spare capacity.

It may be cheaper, therefore, to buy water in a particular port than to produce it on board. The seawater intakes are located in the hull of the ship.

It discharges waste into the sea only in areas more than {{convert|12|nmi|mi|abbr=on}} from any coast, even though MARPOL allows discharge of treated organic waste and treated bilge water closer to the shore. Discharges of potentially harmful substances, in particular the residual oil content of treated bilge water and air emissions, are monitored regularly to ensure compliance with environmental standards.<ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/> In areas where air pollution from [[sulfur dioxide]], which causes [[acid rain]], is a concern, the ship switches to low-sulfur fuel to minimise air pollution.<ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[carbon offset]] company [[Climate Care]], passenger ships release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per passenger mile than long haul flights. Cunard attempted to reduce the [[carbon footprint]] of ''Queen Mary 2'' by improving engine efficiency and reducing friction while the ship is in motion.

''Queen Mary'' had in turn been named after [[Mary of Teck]], consort of [[George V|King George V]]. With the retirement of ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' in 2008, ''Queen Mary 2'' is the only transatlantic ocean liner in regular service between [[Southampton]], England, and [[New York City]], United States. The ship is also used for cruising, including an annual world cruise.<ref>[http://www.cunard.com/Ships/Queen-Mary-2/ Queen Mary 2 Cruises] ''Cunard'' Retrieved 21 January 2012</ref>\n\nShe was designed by a team of British naval architects led by [[Stephen Payne (naval architect)|Stephen Payne]], and was constructed in France by [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]]. At the time of her construction, ''Queen Mary 2'' was the longest, at {{convert|345.03|m|ft|2|order=flip|abbr=on}}, and largest, with a [[gross tonnage]] of {{GT|148,528}}, [[passenger ship]] ever built. She no longer holds these records after the construction of [[Royal Caribbean International]]'s {{GT|154,407}} {{MS|Freedom of the Seas|3=2}} (a [[cruise ship]]) in April 2006, but remains the largest [[ocean liner]] ever built.\n\n''Queen Mary 2'' was intended for regular scheduled crossings of the Atlantic Ocean, the final cost was approximately $300,000 per berth. The cost was increased by the high quality of materials; having been designed as an ocean liner, she required 40% more steel than a standard cruise ship.<ref name=\"Sealetter Travel Inc\">{{cite web | url = http://www.sealetter.com/Jun-04/qm2.html | title = The History, Construction and Design of ''Queen Mary 2'' | publisher = Sealetter Travel Inc | access-date = 26 March 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110516115948/http://www.sealetter.com/Jun-04/qm2.html | archive-date = 16 May 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref> ''Queen Mary 2'' has a maximum speed of just over {{convert|30|kn|km/h mph|lk=in}} and a cruising speed of {{convert|26|kn|km/h mph|lk=in}}, which is faster than a contemporary cruise ship. Instead of the common [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] configuration, ''Queen Mary 2'' uses [[integrated electric propulsion]] to achieve her top speed. Diesel engines, augmented by [[gas turbine]]s, are used to generate electricity for electric motors for propulsion and for on-board use.\n\n''Queen Mary 2'''s facilities include fifteen restaurants and bars, five swimming pools, a casino, a ballroom, a theatre, and the first [[planetarium]] at sea.\n\n==Characteristics==\n''Queen Mary 2'' is the flagship of Cunard Line. She was constructed to replace the then  ageing ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'', which was the Cunard flagship from 1969 to 2004 and the last major ocean liner built before ''Queen Mary 2''. ''Queen Mary 2'' had the [[Royal Mail Ship]] (RMS) prefix conferred on her by the [[Royal Mail]] when she entered service in 2004, as a gesture to Cunard's history.<ref>{{cite news | title = Royal Mail employee's Courier newspaper | publisher = Royal Mail | date = August 2007}}</ref>\n\n''Queen Mary 2'' is not a [[steamship]] like many of her predecessors, but is powered primarily by four [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel engine]]s, with two additional [[gas turbine]]s providing extra power when required; this [[integrated electric propulsion]] configuration is used to produce the power to drive her four electric propulsion pods as well as the ship's hotel services.<ref name = \"Queen Mary 2 Technical\"/> The spaces for these prime movers are also split, and controls are also backed up, with the intention of preventing a single failure from disabling the ship.<ref name = Mathisen/>\n\nLike her predecessor ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' she is built for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and is also regularly used for cruising.

The contract was finally signed with Chantiers de l'Atlantique, a subsidiary of [[Alstom]], on 6 November 2000.

There are indoor pools on Deck 7, in the Canyon Ranch Spa Club, and on Deck 12.\n\nIn common with liners such as {{RMS|Queen Mary}}, there is a continuous wrap-around [[promenade deck]] (Deck 7). This passes behind the bridge screen and allows passengers to circumnavigate the deck while protected from the winds; one circuit is  {{convert|620|m|-1|abbr=on}} long. The flanking promenades are created by the need to step the [[Superstructure#Ships|superstructure]] to allow space for [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s. By [[SOLAS Convention|SOLAS]] standards, these should have been lower on the hull ({{convert|15|m|0|abbr=on}} above the waterline), but for the sake of appearance as well as to avoid the danger of large waves damaging the boats, Payne convinced SOLAS officials to exempt ''Queen Mary 2'' from this requirement, and the boats are {{convert|25|m|0|abbr=on}} above the waterline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cybercruises.com/queenmary2two.htm |title=''Queen Mary 2'' |author=Arturo Paniagua Mazorra  |date=14 September 2004 |publisher= |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>\n\nPayne's original intention was for a stern profile with a spoon shape, similar to most previous liners, but the mounting of the [[azimuth thruster|propeller pods]] required a flat [[transom (nautical)|transom]].

The plants' energy is supplied primarily by steam and cooling water from the ship's gas turbines and diesel engines, or if needed by steam from the ship's two oil-fired boilers. The traditional [[multiple-effect distillation]] technology has been improved for the ship's plant, so that [[Fouling#Micro fouling|scaling]] of plates is reduced, vastly reducing maintenance required. The desalinated water has a very low salt content of less than five parts per million. Average total water production is {{convert|1100000|L|USgal}} per day with a capacity of {{convert|1890000|L|USgal}} so that there is ample spare capacity.

In that case steam from oil-fired boilers is used to heat the sea water. This is uneconomical as generating steam is expensive. It may be cheaper, therefore, to buy water in a particular port than to produce it on board. The seawater intakes are located in the hull of the ship. Concentrated salt solution ([[brine]]) is discharged to the sea closer to the ship's stern together with cooling water from the engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infotechfrance.com/cgi-local/affichage_signet_secteur.pl?UNI_ID=8&RUB_ID=54&SS_ID=6746&SEC_ID=25 |title=UBIFRANCE Orelis' technology to recycle Queen Mary 2's waste water |date=16 April 2004  |publisher= |accessdate=26 November 2009}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> An additional plant was added during the 2016 refit.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Environmental performance===\n{{See also|Environmental impact of shipping}}\n\nWhen designing ''Queen Mary 2'', the designers considered that tighter environmental regulations would be implemented while the ship was in service, such as energy efficiency, the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses and zero discharge of solid waste into the sea.<ref name=\"professional mariner\"/><ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/>\n\nAccording to Cunard, the ship exceeds some requirements of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships ([[MARPOL 73/78]]) of the [[International Maritime Organization]]. It discharges waste into the sea only in areas more than {{convert|12|nmi|mi|abbr=on}} from any coast, even though MARPOL allows discharge of treated organic waste and treated bilge water closer to the shore. Discharges of potentially harmful substances, in particular the residual oil content of treated bilge water and air emissions, are monitored regularly to ensure compliance with environmental standards.<ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/> In areas where air pollution from [[sulfur dioxide]], which causes [[acid rain]], is a concern, the ship switches to low-sulfur fuel to minimise air pollution.<ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[carbon offset]] company [[Climate Care]], passenger ships release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per passenger mile than long haul flights. Cunard attempted to reduce the [[carbon footprint]] of ''Queen Mary 2'' by improving engine efficiency and reducing friction while the ship is in motion.

It includes planetary probes, solar probes, and probes to asteroids and comets, but excludes lunar missions, which are listed separately at [[List of lunar probes]] and [[List of Apollo missions]]. Flybys (such as [[Gravitational slingshot|gravity assists]]) that were incidental to the main purpose of the mission are also included. Flybys of Earth are listed separately at [[List of Earth flybys]]. Confirmed future probes are included, but missions that are still at the concept stage, or which never progressed beyond the concept stage, are not.\n\n==Key==\nColour key:\n{|\n|-\n|{{Color box|#EFE7B8;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; Mission or flyby '''completed successfully''' (or partially successfully)\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|{{Color box|#F2F2F2;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; '''Failed or cancelled''' mission\n|-\n|{{Color box|#CCFFD9;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; Mission '''en route or in progress''' (including mission extensions)\n|\n|{{Color box|#FFFFFF;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; '''Planned''' mission\n|\n|}\n\n* <sup>\u2020</sup> means \"tentatively identified\", as classified by NASA.<ref name=tentative>{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/tent_launch.html |title=Tentatively Identified Missions and Launch Failures |author=NSSDC |publisher=[[NASA]] |date= |accessdate=27 August 2016|author-link=NSSDC }}</ref> These are Cold War-era Soviet missions, mostly failures, about which few or no details have been officially released.
