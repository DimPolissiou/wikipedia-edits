The announcement sparked protests by those opposed to Nkurunziza seeking a third term in office.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/27/burundi-crackdown-protesters Burundi: Crackdown on Protesters] Human Rights Watch, April 27, 2015</ref> Widespread demonstrations in the then-capital, [[Bujumbura]], lasted for over three weeks. As a result of the protests, the government also shut down the country's Internet and telephone network, closed all of the country's universities, and publicly referred to the protesters as \"terrorists\". Tens of thousands of people fled the country, hundreds of people were arrested, and several protesters and police were killed. On May 13, 2015, a coup d'etat was announced, led by Major General [[Godefroid Niyombare]], while President Nkurunziza was in [[Tanzania]] attending an emergency conference about the situation in the country. By the next day the coup collapsed and government forces reasserted control. At least 240 people were killed over the next few months, and on December 11, 87 people were killed in attacks on state targets. The violence has raised fears of a return to worsening ethnic tension between Hutus and Tutsis. Nkurunziza had led a Hutu rebel group against the then Tutsi-dominated army during the civil war that followed the killing of Hutu President Melchior Ndadaye in 1993.<ref>{{citation|title=Burundi crisis: Army says 87 killed in day of violence|date=December 12, 2015|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35083823|website=BBC News}}</ref> Violence continued through 2017.<ref>[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/killed-burundi-grenade-attacks-bars-170818140040303.html Three killed in Burundi grenade attacks at bars] Al Jazeera, August 18, 2017</ref>\n\n=====Cameroon=====\n{{Main|Anglophone Crisis}}\nThe Anglophone Crisis (French: Crise anglophone), is a conflict in the [[Southern Cameroons]] region of Cameroon, part of the long-standing [[Anglophone problem]] pitting English-speakers against French-speakers; English-speakers make up about one-fifth of the population.<ref name=\"foreign\">{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/27/cameroon-must-make-concessions-to-end-the-anglophone-crisis-paul-biya/|title=Cameroon Must Make Concessions to End the Anglophone Crisis|date=September 27, 2019|website=Foreign Affairs}}</ref> In September 2017, separatists in the Anglophone territories of Northwest Region and Southwest Region declared the independence of [[Ambazonia]] and began fighting against the Government of Cameroon.

Millions of protesters from a range of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Violent clashes between security forces and protesters resulted in at least 846 people killed and over 6,000 injured. Protesters retaliated by burning over 90 police stations across the country. The protesters' grievances focused on legal and political issues, including police brutality, state-of-emergency laws, lack of political freedom, civil liberty, freedom of speech, corruption, high unemployment, food-price inflation, and low wages. The protesters' primary demands were the end of the Mubarak regime and emergency law. Strikes by labour unions added to the pressure on government officials. In February 2011 Vice President [[Omar Suleiman]] announced that had Mubarak resigned as president, turning power over to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF).<ref>{{citation|title=Egypt Revolution: 18 days of people power|date=January 24, 2016|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2016/01/egypt-revolution-160124191716737.html|website=Al Jareeza}}</ref> The military junta, headed by [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]], announced on February 13 that the constitution was suspended, both houses of parliament dissolved, and the military would govern until elections could be held.

On January 16, 2012, several insurgent groups began fighting a campaign against the Malian government for independence or greater autonomy for northern Mali, an area of northern Mali they called [[Azawad]]. The [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad|National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA)]], an organization fighting to make this area of Mali an independent homeland for the [[Tuareg people]], had taken control of the region by April 2012. The MNLA were initially backed by the Islamist group [[Ansar Dine]]. After the Malian military was driven from northern Mali, Ansar Dine and a number of smaller Islamist groups began imposing strict [[Sharia]] law, and the Tuareg group broke away from them. [[French Armed Forces]] and members of the [[African Union]] helped the government regain control of the area, and a peace agreement was signed in February 2015.<ref>[https://news.un.org/en/story/2015/03/493062#.VQE-cPnF9Fw Deploring ongoing violence, UN rights expert urges Malian parties to work together towards lasting peace] U.N.

amendment bill]] by the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695 The Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words], bbc.com, November 28, 2019.</ref>\nIf enacted, the bill would have empowered local authorities to detain and extradite criminal fugitives who are wanted in territories with which Hong Kong does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Taiwan]] and [[mainland China]]. This led to concerns that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jursidiction and legal system of mainland China, which would undermine [[One country, two systems|the region's autonomy]] and Hong Kong people's civil liberties.As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, which were the withdrawal of the bill, investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of arrested protesters, a complete retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and Chief Executive [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"nbc_1061086\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-police-defend-shooting-protester-lawful-reasonable-n1061086|title=Hong Kong police defend shooting protester as 'lawful and reasonable'|first=Veta|last=Chan|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=October 2, 2019|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nbc_1067466\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/chinese-mainlanders-living-hong-kong-feel-stuck-between-rock-hard-ncna1067466|title=Opinion &#124; Mainland Chinese like me are stuck between a rock and a hard place in Hong Kong|publisher=NBC News}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nbc_1090206\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-turns-out-huge-numbers-vote-viewed-referendum-protests-n1090206|title=Pro-democracy candidates win big in election viewed as referendum on protests|publisher=NBC News|access-date=November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"now_340955\">{{Cite news|url=https://news.now.com/home/local/player?newsId=340955|script-title=zh:\u773e\u5fd7\u885d\u5165\u653f\u7e3d\u975c\u5750\u4fc3\u64a4\u56de\u9003\u72af\u689d\u4f8b\u4fee\u8a02|language=zh|trans-title=Demosist\u014d got to HK Govt.

UPA had won a majority in 2009 for a second term which was marred by corruption allegations. Taking advantage of the UPA's growing unpopularity, The [[Bhartiya Janata Party]] (BJP) led by former Gujarat Chief Minister [[Narendra Modi]] swept the polls in the 2014 general elections.\n\nRiding high on the wave of nationalism in the wake of attacks claimed by Indian authorities to have been orchestrated by Pakistan the Modi government relied heavily on anti-Pakistan rhetoric in successive elections. In 2016, a hard line Hindu monk associated with the BJP was elected chief minister of India's largest state who in turn pursued a policy of changing names of places with Muslim names to Hindu ones.\n\nThe Indian government, during this time also massively increased its defense budget and enhanced defense ties with the United States and Israel. The relationship with Israel continued to bloom as Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit the Jewish state.\n\nCritics of the Modi government continued to level criticism at him for polarizing minorities, especially Muslims and changing the fabric of the Indian state by relentlessly pursuing the Hindutva ideology. In its second term in power, the BJP led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) became even more ideological in its pursuit of the Hindutva agenda. On August 5, 2019, the newly elected Indian government under a presidential order revoked Article 370 of the Indian constitution, thereby terminating the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and placed it under curfew. This move triggered widespread international condemnation and further aggravated relations with neighboring Pakistan. Later that year, the Supreme Court also delivered a verdict on the controversial Ram janam bhoomi case which called for a temple to be built on the disputed site while granting land to the Sunni Waqf Board for the establishment of a mosque elsewhere.\n\n===Middle East===\nStarting in 2010, [[Arab Spring]] led to major political upheaval across the region, leading to the violent repression of the [[Arab Winter]]. A [[Arab protests (2018\u2013present)|Second Arab Spring]] started in the later part of the decade.\n\n====Iran====\nThe [[2019 Iranian protests]] are a series of civil protests occurring in multiple cities across [[Iran]], initially from the 200% increase in fuel prices but later extended to an outcry against the [[Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran|current government in Iran]] and [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Khamenei|Ali Khamenei]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/06/at-least-7000-people-reportedly-arrested-in-iran-protests-says-un At least 7,000 people reportedly arrested in Iran protests, says UN], Agence France-Presse, Fri December 6, 2019.</ref><ref name=\"auto1b\">{{Cite web|url=https://iranintl.com/%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/%DA%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B6%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B2%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B4-%D9%82%DB%8C%D9%85%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%B2%DB%8C%D9%86-%DB%8C%DA%A9-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%B4%D9%84%DB%8C%DA%A9-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%B4%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%B4%D8%AF|title=\u06af\u0633\u062a\u0631\u0634 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0636\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0641\u0632\u0627\u06cc\u0634 \u0642\u06cc\u0645\u062a \u0628\u0646\u0632\u06cc\u0646: \u06cc\u06a9 \u0645\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0636 \u062f\u0631 \u0633\u06cc\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627 \u0634\u0644\u06cc\u06a9 \u0645\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0634\u062f |date=November 15, 2019 |website=[[Iran International]] |language=fa|access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":0b\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50444429|title=Protests erupt over Iran petrol rationing|date=November 16, 2019|access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref> The protests commenced in the evening of November 15 and within hours spread to 21 cities as videos of the protest began to circulate online.<ref>{{cite web |title=Amnesty International: Over 100 Killed in 21 Cities in Iran Protests |url=https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran/amnesty-international-over-100-killed-in-21-cities-in-iran-protests-1.8153333 |work=Haaretz}}</ref><ref name=\"veconomist1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/11/17/hikes-in-the-cost-of-petrol-are-fuelling-unrest-in-iran|title=Hikes in the cost of petrol are fuelling unrest in Iran|date=November 17, 2019|work=[[The Economist]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiofarda.com/a/iran-protests-fuel-price-hike/30274328.html|title=\u0627\u0641\u0632\u0627\u06cc\u0634 \u0642\u06cc\u0645\u062a \u0628\u0646\u0632\u06cc\u0646\u061b \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0635\u062d\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0636\u0627\u062a \u0634\u062f|website=\u0631\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0648 \u0641\u0631\u062f\u0627}}</ref> Images of the violent protests were shared on the internet with protests reaching international levels.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/world/middleeast/iran-protests.html|title=Iran's 'Iron Fist': Rights Group Says More Than 100 Protesters Are Dead|last=Fassihi|first=Farnaz|date=November 19, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 21, 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the protests began as peaceful gatherings, government crackdowns prompted a revolt against the entire [[Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Iranian government]].<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web |last1=Fassihi |first1=Farnaz |title=Iran Declares Protests Are Over, but the Evidence Suggests Otherwise |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/world/middleeast/iran-protests-internet.html}}</ref>  The Iranian government employed lethal tactics in order to shut down the protests including a nationwide internet shutdown, shooting protesters dead from rooftops, helicopters, and at close range with machine gun fire.<ref name=\"With Brutal Crackdown, Iran Is Conv\">{{cite web |last1=Gladstone |first1=Rick |title=With Brutal Crackdown, Iran Is Convulsed by Worst Unrest in 40 Years |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/world/middleeast/iran-protests-deaths.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Swert |first1=Mia |title=Amnesty says at least 208 killed in Iran protests |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/amnesty-208-killed-iran-protests-191130151227593.html}}</ref> Although there is currently no conclusive casualty count current estimates suspect the government killed well over 1,000 [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] citizens.<ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-says-iran-may-have-killed-1-000-protesters-n1096666 U.S. says Iran may have killed up to 1,000 protesters] \n</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=McKenzie |first1=Sheena |title=One of the worst crackdowns in decades is happening in Iran.

As a result of the protests, the government also shut down the country's Internet and telephone network, closed all of the country's universities, and publicly referred to the protesters as \"terrorists\". Tens of thousands of people fled the country, hundreds of people were arrested, and several protesters and police were killed. On May 13, 2015, a coup d'etat was announced, led by Major General [[Godefroid Niyombare]], while President Nkurunziza was in [[Tanzania]] attending an emergency conference about the situation in the country. By the next day the coup collapsed and government forces reasserted control. At least 240 people were killed over the next few months, and on December 11, 87 people were killed in attacks on state targets.

Violent clashes between security forces and protesters resulted in at least 846 people killed and over 6,000 injured. Protesters retaliated by burning over 90 police stations across the country. The protesters' grievances focused on legal and political issues, including police brutality, state-of-emergency laws, lack of political freedom, civil liberty, freedom of speech, corruption, high unemployment, food-price inflation, and low wages. The protesters' primary demands were the end of the Mubarak regime and emergency law. Strikes by labour unions added to the pressure on government officials.

On January 16, 2012, several insurgent groups began fighting a campaign against the Malian government for independence or greater autonomy for northern Mali, an area of northern Mali they called [[Azawad]]. The [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad|National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA)]], an organization fighting to make this area of Mali an independent homeland for the [[Tuareg people]], had taken control of the region by April 2012. The MNLA were initially backed by the Islamist group [[Ansar Dine]]. After the Malian military was driven from northern Mali, Ansar Dine and a number of smaller Islamist groups began imposing strict [[Sharia]] law, and the Tuareg group broke away from them. [[French Armed Forces]] and members of the [[African Union]] helped the government regain control of the area, and a peace agreement was signed in February 2015.<ref>[https://news.un.org/en/story/2015/03/493062#.VQE-cPnF9Fw Deploring ongoing violence, UN rights expert urges Malian parties to work together towards lasting peace] U.N.

UPA had won a majority in 2009 for a second term which was marred by corruption allegations. Taking advantage of the UPA's growing unpopularity, The [[Bhartiya Janata Party]] (BJP) led by former Gujarat Chief Minister [[Narendra Modi]] swept the polls in the 2014 general elections.\n\nRiding high on the wave of nationalism in the wake of attacks claimed by Indian authorities to have been orchestrated by Pakistan the Modi government relied heavily on anti-Pakistan rhetoric in successive elections. In 2016, a hard line Hindu monk associated with the BJP was elected chief minister of India's largest state who in turn pursued a policy of changing names of places with Muslim names to Hindu ones.\n\nThe Indian government, during this time also massively increased its defense budget and enhanced defense ties with the United States and Israel. The relationship with Israel continued to bloom as Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit the Jewish state.\n\nCritics of the Modi government continued to level criticism at him for polarizing minorities, especially Muslims and changing the fabric of the Indian state by relentlessly pursuing the Hindutva ideology. In its second term in power, the BJP led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) became even more ideological in its pursuit of the Hindutva agenda. On August 5, 2019, the newly elected Indian government under a presidential order revoked Article 370 of the Indian constitution, thereby terminating the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and placed it under curfew. This move triggered widespread international condemnation and further aggravated relations with neighboring Pakistan. Later that year, the Supreme Court also delivered a verdict on the controversial Ram janam bhoomi case which called for a temple to be built on the disputed site while granting land to the Sunni Waqf Board for the establishment of a mosque elsewhere.\n\n===Middle East===\nStarting in 2010, [[Arab Spring]] led to major political upheaval across the region, leading to the violent repression of the [[Arab Winter]].
