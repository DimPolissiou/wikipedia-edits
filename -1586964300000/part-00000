Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\".

Some think the town was named after [[Greenville, North Carolina]], which had been named after [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general [[Nathanael Greene]].  Others say that Greenville was named by early settler Thomas White because it was \"so green and nice.\"  A third possibility is that Greenville was named after Green P.

The Scene is meant to be hidden from the public, only being shared with those within the community. However, as files were commonly leaked outside the community and their popularity grew, some individuals from The Scene began leaking files and uploading them to filehosts, [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrents]] and [[EDonkey network|ed2k]].\n\nThe Scene has no central leadership, location, or other organizational conventions. The groups themselves create a [[Standard (warez)|ruleset]] for each Scene category (for example, MP3 or TV) that then becomes the active rules for encoding material. These rulesets include a rigid set of requirements that [[warez group]]s (grps) must follow in releasing and managing material. The groups must follow these rules when uploading material, and if the release has a technical error or breaks a rule, other groups may \"[[Nuke (warez)|nuke]]\" (flag as bad content) the release. Groups are in constant competition to get releases up as fast as possible, even though there are no real \"rewards\" for their work (except for access to The Scene). First appearing around the time of [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]es, The Scene is composed primarily of people dealing with and distributing media content for which special skills and advanced software are required.\n\n==History==\nThe warez scene started emerging in the 1970s, used by predecessors of [[software cracking]] and reverse engineering groups. Their work was made available on privately run bulletin board systems (BBSes).<ref name=\"TheWarezSceneHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.defacto2.net/wayback/apollo-x-demo-resources-1999-december-17/wrzhst.htm |title=The History of the Warez Scene (unfinished) |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> The first BBSes were located in the U.S., but similar boards started appearing in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and mainland Europe. At the time, setting up a machine capable of distributing data was not trivial and required a certain amount of technical skill.  The reason it was usually done was for technical challenge. The BBSes typically hosted several megabytes of material. The best boards had multiple phone lines and up to one hundred megabytes of storage space, which was very expensive at the time.<ref name=\"WarezWars\">{{cite news |first=David |last=McCandless |title=Warez Wars |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.04/ff_warez.html |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date = April 1997|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> Releases were mostly games and later software.\n\nAs the world of software development evolved to counter the distribution of material and as the software and hardware needed for distribution became readily available to anyone, The Scene adapted to the changes and turned from simple distribution to actual cracking of the protections and non-commercial reverse engineering.<ref name=\"TheWarezSceneHistory\" /> As many groups of people who wanted to do this emerged, a requirement for promotion of individual groups became evident, which prompted the evolution of the [[Artscene]], which specialized in the creation of graphical [[art]] associated with individual groups.<ref name=\"DefactoSceneHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.defacto2.net/includes/documentsweb/df2web99/scene-archive/history.html | title=scene history | accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> The groups would promote their abilities with ever more sophisticated and advanced software, graphical art, and later also music ([[demoscene]]).<ref>[http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/ The BBS Documentary \u2013 MOVIE]</ref>\n\nThe subcommunities (artscene, demoscene, etc.), which were doing nothing illegal, eventually branched off. The programs containing the group promotional material (coding/graphical/musical presentations) evolved to become separate programs distributed through The Scene and were nicknamed [[demo (computer programming)|Intro]]s and later [[Cracktro]]s.\n\nThe [[demoscene]] grew especially strong in [[Scandinavia]], where annual gatherings are hosted.<ref>{{cite web |\ntitle=ASSEMBLY Summer 2011 \u2013 Finland's largest computer festival in Helsinki |\nurl=http://www.assembly.org |\nyear=2011}}</ref>\n\n==Release procedure==\nWhen releasing material, groups must first encode properly so as not to be nuked, which shows up as a cautionary flag to potential users. After encoding, they upload the files to a [[Topsite (warez)|topsite]] that is a [[FTP]] server where all the files originate. When the upload is complete, they execute a command that causes the name and category of the release to be announced in the topsite's [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel. New releases are also announced 0sec (meaning seconds to minutes after official scene pre) on various public websites.<ref>{{cite web |title=NFORush.net \u2013 Pre Announces |url=http://nforush.net/new-scene-releases.html}}</ref> This is called a \"pre\" release. Once this is done, all other releases for the same material are nuked as duplicates (\"dupes\"). However, if there is a technical error or the file breaks the ruleset for the category, the original \"pre\" release will be nuked. Other groups then encode the same material and release it with a \"PROPER\" tag in the filename. The same group may re-encode the file, with the new release marked as \"REPACK\". This FTP server and IRC are hidden and closed to the public.\n\nEach release in The Scene consists of a folder containing the material (sometimes split into [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] pieces), plus an [[.nfo|NFO]] and [[.sfv|SFV]] file. The NFO is a text file which has essential information about the files encoded, including a reason for the nuke if the file is a PROPER or REPACK release. A robust NFO file may contain a group's mission statement, recruitment requirements, greetings, and contact info; many groups have a standard [[ASCII art]] template for the file, with the most prolific exhibiting elaborate artistic examples. The SFV file uses [[checksums]] to ensure that the files of a release are working properly and have not been damaged or tampered with. This is typically done with the aid of an external executable like QuickSFV or SFV Checker. Failure to include an NFO or SFV file in the release will generally result in a nuke, as these are essential components of the [[standard (warez)|warez standard]] to which The Scene adheres.\n\nIn 2012, the Scene had over 100 active groups releasing material. Over 1,000 releases are made each day, with a cumulative total of more than five million releases through 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=PreDB.in |url=http://predb.in/doku/index.htm#stats}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Database.with.5.million.Releases-YUNOLEECH |date=2012-06-03 |author=YUNOLEECH |quote=pre database with about 5 million releases |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2110 |work=SceneNotice.org}}</ref>\n\n==Crackers and reverse engineers==\n{{Main|Software cracking}}\nCracking has been the core element of The Scene since its beginning.

The Scene is meant to be hidden from the public, only being shared with those within the community. However, as files were commonly leaked outside the community and their popularity grew, some individuals from The Scene began leaking files and uploading them to filehosts, [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrents]] and [[EDonkey network|ed2k]].\n\nThe Scene has no central leadership, location, or other organizational conventions. The groups themselves create a [[Standard (warez)|ruleset]] for each Scene category (for example, MP3 or TV) that then becomes the active rules for encoding material. These rulesets include a rigid set of requirements that [[warez group]]s (grps) must follow in releasing and managing material. The groups must follow these rules when uploading material, and if the release has a technical error or breaks a rule, other groups may \"[[Nuke (warez)|nuke]]\" (flag as bad content) the release. Groups are in constant competition to get releases up as fast as possible, even though there are no real \"rewards\" for their work (except for access to The Scene). First appearing around the time of [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]es, The Scene is composed primarily of people dealing with and distributing media content for which special skills and advanced software are required.\n\n==History==\nThe warez scene started emerging in the 1970s, used by predecessors of [[software cracking]] and reverse engineering groups. Their work was made available on privately run bulletin board systems (BBSes).<ref name=\"TheWarezSceneHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.defacto2.net/wayback/apollo-x-demo-resources-1999-december-17/wrzhst.htm |title=The History of the Warez Scene (unfinished) |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> The first BBSes were located in the U.S., but similar boards started appearing in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and mainland Europe. At the time, setting up a machine capable of distributing data was not trivial and required a certain amount of technical skill.  The reason it was usually done was for technical challenge. The BBSes typically hosted several megabytes of material. The best boards had multiple phone lines and up to one hundred megabytes of storage space, which was very expensive at the time.<ref name=\"WarezWars\">{{cite news |first=David |last=McCandless |title=Warez Wars |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.04/ff_warez.html |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date = April 1997|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> Releases were mostly games and later software.\n\nAs the world of software development evolved to counter the distribution of material and as the software and hardware needed for distribution became readily available to anyone, The Scene adapted to the changes and turned from simple distribution to actual cracking of the protections and non-commercial reverse engineering.<ref name=\"TheWarezSceneHistory\" /> As many groups of people who wanted to do this emerged, a requirement for promotion of individual groups became evident, which prompted the evolution of the [[Artscene]], which specialized in the creation of graphical [[art]] associated with individual groups.<ref name=\"DefactoSceneHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.defacto2.net/includes/documentsweb/df2web99/scene-archive/history.html | title=scene history | accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> The groups would promote their abilities with ever more sophisticated and advanced software, graphical art, and later also music ([[demoscene]]).<ref>[http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/ The BBS Documentary \u2013 MOVIE]</ref>\n\nThe subcommunities (artscene, demoscene, etc.), which were doing nothing illegal, eventually branched off. The programs containing the group promotional material (coding/graphical/musical presentations) evolved to become separate programs distributed through The Scene and were nicknamed [[demo (computer programming)|Intro]]s and later [[Cracktro]]s.\n\nThe [[demoscene]] grew especially strong in [[Scandinavia]], where annual gatherings are hosted.<ref>{{cite web |\ntitle=ASSEMBLY Summer 2011 \u2013 Finland's largest computer festival in Helsinki |\nurl=http://www.assembly.org |\nyear=2011}}</ref>\n\n==Release procedure==\nWhen releasing material, groups must first encode properly so as not to be nuked, which shows up as a cautionary flag to potential users. After encoding, they upload the files to a [[Topsite (warez)|topsite]] that is a [[FTP]] server where all the files originate. When the upload is complete, they execute a command that causes the name and category of the release to be announced in the topsite's [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel. New releases are also announced 0sec (meaning seconds to minutes after official scene pre) on various public websites.<ref>{{cite web |title=NFORush.net \u2013 Pre Announces |url=http://nforush.net/new-scene-releases.html}}</ref> This is called a \"pre\" release. Once this is done, all other releases for the same material are nuked as duplicates (\"dupes\"). However, if there is a technical error or the file breaks the ruleset for the category, the original \"pre\" release will be nuked. Other groups then encode the same material and release it with a \"PROPER\" tag in the filename. The same group may re-encode the file, with the new release marked as \"REPACK\". This FTP server and IRC are hidden and closed to the public.\n\nEach release in The Scene consists of a folder containing the material (sometimes split into [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] pieces), plus an [[.nfo|NFO]] and [[.sfv|SFV]] file. The NFO is a text file which has essential information about the files encoded, including a reason for the nuke if the file is a PROPER or REPACK release. A robust NFO file may contain a group's mission statement, recruitment requirements, greetings, and contact info; many groups have a standard [[ASCII art]] template for the file, with the most prolific exhibiting elaborate artistic examples. The SFV file uses [[checksums]] to ensure that the files of a release are working properly and have not been damaged or tampered with. This is typically done with the aid of an external executable like QuickSFV or SFV Checker. Failure to include an NFO or SFV file in the release will generally result in a nuke, as these are essential components of the [[standard (warez)|warez standard]] to which The Scene adheres.\n\nIn 2012, the Scene had over 100 active groups releasing material. Over 1,000 releases are made each day, with a cumulative total of more than five million releases through 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=PreDB.in |url=http://predb.in/doku/index.htm#stats}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Database.with.5.million.Releases-YUNOLEECH |date=2012-06-03 |author=YUNOLEECH |quote=pre database with about 5 million releases |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2110 |work=SceneNotice.org}}</ref>\n\n==Crackers and reverse engineers==\n{{Main|Software cracking}}\nCracking has been the core element of The Scene since its beginning.
