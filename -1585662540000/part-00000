From 1911 to 1912 he was Oxford Scholar on the [[D'Entrecasteaux Islands]] in eastern [[Papua New Guinea]], studying a little-known group of aboriginal people.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Richling|first1=Barnett|date=1991-11-01|title=Diamond Jenness and 'useful anthropology' in Canada 1930\u20131950|url=http://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/jnzs/article/view/251/178|format=PDF|journal=The Journal of New Zealand Studies|volume=2|issue=1|page=2|accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref>\n\nJenness then served as an [[Ethnology|ethnologist]] with the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u201316|Canadian Arctic Expedition]] from 1913 to 1916 under the leadership of both [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]] and Dr [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|Rudolph M. Anderson]]. His detailed studies of the [[Copper Inuit]], sometimes called the [[Blond Eskimos]], around [[Coronation Gulf]], and of other [[Arctic]] native people, helped establish him. Although most of his time thereafter was devoted to [[First Nations|Indian]] studies (and administrative duties), he soon identified two very important prehistoric [[Eskimo]] cultures: the [[Dorset culture]] in Canada (in 1925)<ref>Jenness, D., 1925. \"A new Eskimo culture in Hudson Bay\".

During the intervening years, although hampered by the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], he sought to expand the National Museum's exhibits, anthropological collections, and reputation, as well as to improve the recognition, understanding, and living conditions of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canada's native peoples]]. In 1939 he became president of the [[American Anthropological Association]].<ref>[http://www.aaanet.org/about/Governance/Leadership/pastpresidents.cfm Past Presidents]</ref>\n\nIn 1941, eager to contribute to the war effort, he was seconded to the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], where he served until 1944 as civilian Deputy Director of Special Intelligence.

He retired in April 1948.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1970, Jenness authored more than 100 works on Canada's [[Inuit]] and [[First Nations]] people. Chief among these are his scholarly government report, ''Life of the Copper Eskimos'' (published 1922), his ever-popular account of two years with the Copper Inuit, ''The People of the Twilight'' (published 1928), his definitive and durable ''The Indians of Canada'' (published 1932 and now in its seventh edition), and four scholarly reports on Eskimo Administration in Alaska, Canada, [[Labrador]], and [[Greenland]], plus a fifth report providing an analysis and overview of the four government systems (published between 1962 and 1968). He also published a popular account of the one year (1913 to 1914) he spent among the [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] of Northern Alaska, ''Dawn in Arctic Alaska'' (published 1957 and 1985).\n\nIn 1953 Jenness was awarded a [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1953|Guggenheim Fellowship]]. In 1962, Jenness was awarded the [[Massey Medal]] by the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]], and in 1968 he was made a [[Order of Canada|Companion of the Order of Canada]]. Between 1935 and 1968, he was awarded five honorary doctorate degrees.

He was the visionary, promoter and co-founder of the [[Red Cross]]. \n\nDuring a business trip in 1859, Dunant was witness to the aftermath of the [[Battle of Solferino]] in modern-day Italy. He recorded his memories and experiences in the book ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]'' which inspired the creation of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) in 1863. The 1864 [[Geneva Convention]] was based on Dunant's idea for an independent organisation to care for wounded soldiers. \n\nDunant was the founder of the Swiss branch of the Young Men's Christian Association [[YMCA]].\n\nIn 1901 he received the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] together with [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy]], making Dunant the first Swiss Nobel laureate. Chin \nI am peppa pigs dad\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:Henry Dunant 1855.jpg|left|thumb|Henry Dunant in 1855]]\nDunant was born in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1828 as the first son of businessman Jean-Jacques Dunant and Antoinette Dunant-Colladon. His family was devoutly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and had significant influence in Geneva society. His parents stressed the value of social work, and his father was active helping orphans and parolees, while his mother worked with the sick and poor.\n\nDunant grew up during the period of religious awakening known as the ''[[R\u00e9veil]]'', and at age 18 he joined the Geneva Society for Alms giving. In the following year, together with friends, he founded the so-called \"Thursday Association\", a loose band of young men that met to study the Bible and help the poor, and he spent much of his free time engaged in prison visits and social work. On 30 November 1852, he founded the Geneva chapter of the [[YMCA]] and three years later he took part in the Paris meeting devoted to the founding of its international organization.\n\nIn 1849, at age 21, Dunant left the [[Coll\u00e8ge Calvin|Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve]] due to poor grades, and he began an apprenticeship with the money-changing firm ''Lullin et Sautter''. After its successful conclusion, he remained as an employee of the bank.\n\n== Algeria ==\nIn 1853, Dunant visited Algeria, Tunisia, and [[Sicily]], on assignment with a company devoted to the \"colonies of Setif\" (''Compagnie genevoise des Colonies de S\u00e9tif''). Despite little experience, he successfully fulfilled the assignment. Inspired by the trip, he wrote his first book with the title ''An Account of the Regency in Tunis'' (''Notice sur la R\u00e9gence de Tunis''), published in 1858.\n\nIn 1856, he created a business to operate in foreign colonies, and, after being granted a land concession by French-occupied Algeria, a corn-growing and trading company called the Financial and Industrial Company of Mons-Dj\u00e9mila Mills (''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 financi\u00e8re et industrielle des Moulins des Mons-Dj\u00e9mila''). However, the land and water rights were not clearly assigned, and the colonial authorities were not especially cooperative. As a result, Dunant decided to appeal directly to French emperor [[Napol\u00e9on III]], who was with his army in [[Lombardy]] at the time. France was fighting on the side of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], who had occupied much of today's Italy. Napoleon's headquarters were located in the small city of [[Solferino]]. Dunant wrote a flattering book full of praise for Napoleon III with the intention to present it to the emperor, and then traveled to Solferino to meet with him personally.\n\n== Battle of Solferino ==\n[[File:Battaglia di Solferino (Henry Dunant).jpg|thumb|Henry Dunant at Solferino]]\nDunant arrived in [[Solferino]] on the evening of 24 June 1859, on the same day a [[Battle of Solferino|battle]] between the two sides had occurred nearby. Twenty-three thousand wounded, dying and dead remained on the battlefield, and there appeared to be little attempt to provide care. Shocked, Dunant himself took the initiative to organize the civilian population, especially the women and girls, to provide assistance to the injured and sick soldiers. They lacked sufficient materials and supplies, and Dunant himself organized the purchase of needed materials and helped erect makeshift hospitals. He convinced the population to service the wounded without regard to their side in the conflict as per the slogan \"''Tutti fratelli''\" (All are brothers) coined by the women of nearby city [[Castiglione delle Stiviere]]. He also succeeded in gaining the release of Austrian doctors captured by the French.\n\n== Red Cross founding history ==\nAfter returning to [[Geneva]] early in July, Dunant decided to write a book about his experiences, which he titled ''Un Souvenir de Solferino'' (''[[A Memory of Solferino]]''). It was published in 1862 in an edition of 1,600 copies and was printed at Dunant's own expense. In the book, he described the battle, its costs, and the chaotic circumstances afterwards. He also developed the idea that in the future a neutral organization should exist to provide care to wounded soldiers. He distributed the book to many leading political and military figures in Europe.\n[[Image:Committee of Five Geneva 1863.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of the five founders of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Committee]].]]\n\nDunant also began to travel through Europe to promote his ideas. His book was largely positively received, and the President of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, jurist [[Gustave Moynier]], made the book and its suggestions the topic of the 9 February 1863 meeting of the organization. Dunant's recommendations were examined and positively assessed by the members. They created a five-person Committee to further pursue the possibility of their implementation and made Dunant one of the members. The others were Moynier, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] army general [[Henri Dufour]], and doctors [[Louis Appia]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Maunoir]]. Their first meeting on 17 February 1863 is now considered the founding date of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].\n\nFrom early on, Moynier and Dunant had increasing disagreements and conflicts regarding their respective visions and plans. Moynier considered Dunant's idea to establish neutrality protections for care providers unfeasible and advised Dunant not to insist upon this concept. However, Dunant continued to advocate this position in his travels and conversations with high-ranking political and military figures. This intensified the personal conflict between Moynier, who took a rather pragmatic approach to the project, and Dunant, who was the idealist among the five.\n\nIn October 1863, 14 states took part in a meeting in Geneva organized by the committee to discuss the improvement of care for wounded soldiers. Dunant was a protocol leader during the meeting. A year later on 22 August 1864, a diplomatic conference organized by the [[Swiss Parliament]] led to the signing of the [[First Geneva Convention]] by 12 states. Dunant was in charge of organizing accommodation for the attendees.\n\n== Forgotten period ==\n[[File:Henry dunant.jpg|thumb]]\nDunant's businesses in Algeria had suffered. In April 1867, the bankruptcy of the financial firm ''Cr\u00e9dit Genevois'' led to a scandal involving Dunant. He declared bankruptcy and was condemned by the Geneva Trade Court on 17 August 1868 for deceptive practices in the bankruptcies. Due to their investments in the firm, his family and many of his friends were also heavily affected by the downfall of the company. The social outcry in Geneva, a city deeply rooted in Calvinist traditions, also led to calls for him to separate himself from the International Committee. On 25 August 1868, he resigned as Secretary and, on 8 September, he was fully removed from the Committee. Moynier, became President of the Committee in 1864.\n\nIn February 1868, Dunant's mother died. Later that year he was expelled from the YMCA.{{why|date=July 2017}} In March 1867, he left his home city Geneva and would not return for the rest of his life. In the following years, Moynier likely used his influence to attempt to ensure that Dunant would not receive assistance and support from his friends. For example, the gold medal prize of ''Sciences Morales'' at the Paris World's Fair did not go to Dunant as originally planned but to Moynier, Dufour, and Dunant together so that the prize money would only go to the Committee as a whole. Napol\u00e9on III's offer to take over half of Dunant's debts if Dunant's friends would secure the other half was also thwarted by Moynier's efforts.\n\nDunant moved to Paris, where he lived in meager conditions. However, he continued to pursue his humanitarian ideas and plans. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), he founded the Common Relief Society (''Allgemeine F\u00fcrsorgegesellschaft'') and soon after the Common Alliance for Order and Civilization (''[[Allgemeine Allianz f\u00fcr Ordnung und Zivilisation]]''). He argued for disarmament negotiations and for the erection of an international court to mediate international conflicts. Later he worked for the creation of a world library, an idea which had echoes in future projects such as [[UNESCO]].\n\nIn his continued pursuit and advocacy of his ideas, he further neglected his personal situation and income, falling further in [[debt]] and being shunned by his acquaintances. Despite being appointed an honorary member of the national Red Cross societies of Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, [[Prussia]] and Spain, he was nearly forgotten in the official discourse of the Red Cross Movement, even as it was rapidly expanding to new countries. He lived in poverty, moving to various places between 1874 and 1886, including [[Stuttgart]], Rome, [[Corfu]], [[Basel]], and [[Karlsruhe]]. In Stuttgart he met the [[T\u00fcbingen University]] student Rudolf M\u00fcller with whom he would have a close friendship. In 1881, together with friends from Stuttgart, he went to the small Swiss resort village [[Heiden AR|Heiden]] for the first time. In 1887 while living in London, he began to receive some monthly financial support from some distant family members. This enabled him to live a somewhat more secure existence, and he moved to Heiden in July. He spent the rest of his life there, and after 30 April 1892 he lived in a hospital and nursing home led by Dr. Hermann Altherr.\n\nIn Heiden, he met the young teacher Wilhelm Sonderegger and his wife Susanna; they encouraged him to record his life experiences. Sonderegger's wife founded a branch of the Red Cross in Heiden and in 1890 Dunant became its honorary president. With Sonderegger, Dunant hoped to further promote his ideas, including publishing a new edition of his book. However, their friendship later was strained by Dunant's unjustified accusations that Sonderegger, with Moynier in Geneva, was somehow conspiring against Dunant. Sonderegger died in 1904 at age 42. Despite their strained relationship, Dunant was deeply moved by the unexpected death. Wilhelm and Susanna Sonderegger's admiration for Dunant, felt by both even after Dunant's allegations, was passed on to their children. In 1935, their son Ren\u00e9 published a compilation of letters from Dunant to his father.\n\n== Return to public memory ==\nIn September 1895, Georg Baumberger, the chief editor of the [[St. Gallen|St. Gall]] newspaper ''[[Die Ostschweiz]]'', wrote an article about the Red Cross founder, whom he had met and conversed with during a walk in Heiden a month earlier. The article entitled \"Henri Dunant, the founder of the Red Cross\", appeared in the German Illustrated Magazine ''\u00dcber Land und Meer'', and the article was soon reprinted in other publications throughout Europe. The article struck a chord, and he received renewed attention and support. He received the Swiss Binet-Fendt Prize and a note from Pope [[Leo XIII]]. Because of support from Russian [[tsar]]ist widow [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Feodorovna]] and other donations, his financial situation improved remarkably.\n\nIn 1897, Rudolf M\u00fcller, who was now working as a teacher in Stuttgart, wrote a book about the origins of the Red Cross, altering the official history to stress Dunant's role. The book also contained the text of ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]''. Dunant began an exchange of correspondence with [[Bertha von Suttner]] and wrote numerous articles and writings. He was especially active in writing about women's rights, and in 1897 facilitated the founding of a \"Green Cross\" women's organization whose only section was briefly active in Brussels.\n\n== Nobel Peace Prize ==\n[[File:Jean Henri Dunant.jpg|right|thumb|Dunant in 1901]]\nIn 1901, Dunant was awarded the first-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his role in founding the International Red Cross Movement and initiating the Geneva Convention. By public and private means, M\u00fcller, and later Norwegian military physician [[Hans Daae]] (who had received a copy of M\u00fcller's book), advocated Dunant's case to the Nobel committee over the course of 4 years.<ref name=\"Daae\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=ny77bPwKxaUC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates: An Illustrated Biographical History | publisher=Science History Publications/USA | author=Abrams, Irwin | authorlink=Irwin Abrams | year=2001 | page=48 | isbn=978-0-8813-5388-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Heudtlass\">{{cite journal | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/RC_Jun-1964.pdf | title=J. Henry Dunant and the events leading to the award of the first Nobel Peace Prize | author=Heudtlass, Willy | journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]] | date=June 1964 | volume=4 | issue=39 | pages=287\u2013}}</ref> The award was jointly given to French pacifist [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy]], founder of the Peace League and active with Dunant in the Alliance for Order and Civilization. The official congratulations which he received from the International Committee finally represented the rehabilitation of Dunant's reputation:\n\n<blockquote>\"There is no man who more deserves this honour, for it was you, forty years ago, who set on foot the international organization for the relief of the wounded on the battlefield. Without you, the Red Cross, the supreme humanitarian achievement of the nineteenth century would probably have never been undertaken.\"</blockquote>\n\nMoynier and the International Committee as a whole had also been nominated for the prize. Although Dunant was supported by a broad spectrum in the selection process, he was still a controversial candidate. Some argued that the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention had made war more attractive and imaginable by eliminating some of its suffering. Therefore, M\u00fcller, in a letter to the committee, argued that the prize should be divided between Dunant and Passy, who for some time in the debate had been the leading candidate to be the sole recipient of the prize. M\u00fcller also suggested that if a prize were to be warranted for Dunant, it should be given immediately because of his advanced age and ill health.\n\nBy dividing the prize between Passy, a pacifist, and Dunant, a humanitarian, the Nobel Committee set a precedent for the conditions of the Nobel Peace Prize selection which would have significant consequences in later years. A section of Nobel's will had indicated that the prize should go to an individual who had worked to reduce or eliminate standing armies, or directly to promote peace conferences, which made Passy a natural choice for his peace work. On the other hand, the arguably distinct bestowal for humanitarian effort alone was seen by some as a wide interpretation of Nobel's will. However, another part of Nobel's testament marked the prize for the individual who had best enhanced the \"brotherhood of people,\" which could be interpreted more generally as seeing humanitarian work like Dunant's as connected to peacemaking as well. Many recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize in later years can be assigned to either of these two categories first roughly established by the Nobel committee's decision in 1901.\n\nHans Daae succeeded in placing Dunant's part of the prize money, 104,000 Swiss Francs, in a Norwegian Bank and preventing access by his creditors. Dunant himself never spent any of the money during his lifetime, continuing to live simply and reserving it for bequests in his will to those who cared for him and charitable causes.<ref name=\"Daae\"/>\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n[[Image:Grab Henry Dunant02.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Henry Dunant.]]\n[[Image:Jean Henri Dunant Monument.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry Dunant Monument in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], Australia]]\n\nAmong several other awards in the following years, in 1903 Dunant was given an honorary doctorate by the medical faculty of the [[University of Heidelberg]]. He lived in the nursing home in Heiden until his death. In the final years of his life, he suffered from depression and [[paranoia]] about pursuit by his creditors and Moynier. There were even days when Dunant insisted that the cook of the nursing home first taste his food before his eyes to protect him against possible poisoning. In his final years, he spurned and attacked Calvinism and [[organized religion]] generally. He was said to be agnostic.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought |date=2007 |publisher=Vantage Press, Inc |isbn=9780533155972 |author=Oscar Riddle |page=343 |quote=The first Nobel Peace Prize went, in 1901, to Henri Dunant. Dunant was the founder of the Red Cross, but he could not become its first elective head\u2013so it is widely believed\u2013because of his agnostic views.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to his nurses, the final act of his life was to send a copy of M\u00fcller's book to the Italian queen with a personal dedication. He died on 30 October 1910, and his final words were \"Where has humanity gone?\" \n\nAccording to his wishes, he was buried without ceremony in the [[Sihlfeld]] Cemetery in [[Zurich]]. In his will, he donated funds to secure a \"free bed\" in the Heiden nursing home always to be available for a poor citizen of the region and deeded some money to friends and charitable organizations in Norway and Switzerland. The remaining funds went to his creditors partially relieving his debt; his inability to fully erase his debts was a major burden to him until his death.\n\nHis birthday, 8 May, is celebrated as the World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day. The former nursing home in Heiden now houses the [[Henry Dunant Museum]]. In Geneva and other places there are numerous streets, squares, and schools named after him. The [[Henry Dunant Medal]], awarded every two years by the standing commission of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is its highest decoration.\n\nHis life is represented, with some fictional elements, in the film ''[[D'homme \u00e0 hommes]]'' (1948), starring [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], and the period of his life when the Red Cross was founded in the international film coproduction ''[http://www.dunant-themovie.com/ Henry Dunant: Red on the Cross]'' (2006). In 2010 the [[Takarazuka Revue]] staged a musical based on his time in Solferino and the founding of the Red Cross entitled ''Dawn at Solferino, or Where has Humanity Gone?''.\n\nIn honour of Henry Dunant, the second highest peak in Switzerland was renamed to [[Dunantspitze]] (Peak Dunant<ref>{{cite map |publisher=Swiss Federal Office of Topography, swisstopo |title=Dunantspitze |map=National Map 1:25 000 |mapurl=http://www.toposhop.admin.ch/en/shop/products/maps/national/n25 |date=23 July 2014 |url=http://map.geo.admin.ch/?topic=ech&lang=en&X=87338.00&Y=633295.00&zoom=9&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&crosshair=bowl |scale=1:25'000 |series=\"National Map 1:25 000: 247 sheets and 17 composites\" |section=\"1348 Zermatt\" |location=Bern, Switzerland |isbn=978-3-302-01348-0 |accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref>) by Swiss Federal President Didier Burkhalter on 6 October 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/recent/media/single.html?id=54725 |title=Der Sch\u00f6nste Berg der Schweiz |trans-title=The most beautiful mountain of Switzerland |author=[[Didier Burkhalter]] |publisher=Swiss Federal Department for Foreign Affairs |date=6 October 2014 |type=presidential speech |location=Bern, Switzerland |language=German |accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref>\n\n[[Henry Dunant Hospital]] is a general hospital in [[Athens, Greece]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunant.gr|title=\u0395\u03c1\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03c4\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd Hospital Center {{!}} \u0395\u03c1\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03c4\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd|website=www.dunant.gr|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\nThe road where the headquarters of the [[Thai Red Cross Society]] is located is named Henri Dunant Road.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/346253/where-the-streets-have-strange-names|title=Where the streets have strange names|last=Biggs|first=Andrew|date=21 April 2013|work=Bangkok Post|access-date=21 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]]\n* [[Dunantist]]\n\n==Fictional adaptation==\n* ''Henry Dunant: Red on the Cross'' (fr.

He was the visionary, promoter and co-founder of the [[Red Cross]]. \n\nDuring a business trip in 1859, Dunant was witness to the aftermath of the [[Battle of Solferino]] in modern-day Italy. He recorded his memories and experiences in the book ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]'' which inspired the creation of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) in 1863. The 1864 [[Geneva Convention]] was based on Dunant's idea for an independent organisation to care for wounded soldiers. \n\nDunant was the founder of the Swiss branch of the Young Men's Christian Association [[YMCA]].\n\nIn 1901 he received the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] together with [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy]], making Dunant the first Swiss Nobel laureate.\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:Henry Dunant 1855.jpg|left|thumb|Henry Dunant in 1855]]\nDunant was born in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1828 as the first son of businessman Jean-Jacques Dunant and Antoinette Dunant-Colladon. His family was devoutly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and had significant influence in Geneva society. His parents stressed the value of social work, and his father was active helping orphans and parolees, while his mother worked with the sick and poor.\n\nDunant grew up during the period of religious awakening known as the ''[[R\u00e9veil]]'', and at age 18 he joined the Geneva Society for Alms giving. In the following year, together with friends, he founded the so-called \"Thursday Association\", a loose band of young men that met to study the Bible and help the poor, and he spent much of his free time engaged in prison visits and social work. On 30 November 1852, he founded the Geneva chapter of the [[YMCA]] and three years later he took part in the Paris meeting devoted to the founding of its international organization.\n\nIn 1849, at age 21, Dunant left the [[Coll\u00e8ge Calvin|Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve]] due to poor grades, and he began an apprenticeship with the money-changing firm ''Lullin et Sautter''. After its successful conclusion, he remained as an employee of the bank.\n\n== Algeria ==\nIn 1853, Dunant visited Algeria, Tunisia, and [[Sicily]], on assignment with a company devoted to the \"colonies of Setif\" (''Compagnie genevoise des Colonies de S\u00e9tif''). Despite little experience, he successfully fulfilled the assignment. Inspired by the trip, he wrote his first book with the title ''An Account of the Regency in Tunis'' (''Notice sur la R\u00e9gence de Tunis''), published in 1858.\n\nIn 1856, he created a business to operate in foreign colonies, and, after being granted a land concession by French-occupied Algeria, a corn-growing and trading company called the Financial and Industrial Company of Mons-Dj\u00e9mila Mills (''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 financi\u00e8re et industrielle des Moulins des Mons-Dj\u00e9mila''). However, the land and water rights were not clearly assigned, and the colonial authorities were not especially cooperative. As a result, Dunant decided to appeal directly to French emperor [[Napol\u00e9on III]], who was with his army in [[Lombardy]] at the time. France was fighting on the side of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], who had occupied much of today's Italy. Napoleon's headquarters were located in the small city of [[Solferino]]. Dunant wrote a flattering book full of praise for Napoleon III with the intention to present it to the emperor, and then traveled to Solferino to meet with him personally.\n\n== Battle of Solferino ==\n[[File:Battaglia di Solferino (Henry Dunant).jpg|thumb|Henry Dunant at Solferino]]\nDunant arrived in [[Solferino]] on the evening of 24 June 1859, on the same day a [[Battle of Solferino|battle]] between the two sides had occurred nearby. Twenty-three thousand wounded, dying and dead remained on the battlefield, and there appeared to be little attempt to provide care. Shocked, Dunant himself took the initiative to organize the civilian population, especially the women and girls, to provide assistance to the injured and sick soldiers. They lacked sufficient materials and supplies, and Dunant himself organized the purchase of needed materials and helped erect makeshift hospitals. He convinced the population to service the wounded without regard to their side in the conflict as per the slogan \"''Tutti fratelli''\" (All are brothers) coined by the women of nearby city [[Castiglione delle Stiviere]]. He also succeeded in gaining the release of Austrian doctors captured by the French.\n\n== Red Cross founding history ==\nAfter returning to [[Geneva]] early in July, Dunant decided to write a book about his experiences, which he titled ''Un Souvenir de Solferino'' (''[[A Memory of Solferino]]''). It was published in 1862 in an edition of 1,600 copies and was printed at Dunant's own expense. In the book, he described the battle, its costs, and the chaotic circumstances afterwards. He also developed the idea that in the future a neutral organization should exist to provide care to wounded soldiers. He distributed the book to many leading political and military figures in Europe.\n[[Image:Committee of Five Geneva 1863.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of the five founders of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Committee]].]]\n\nDunant also began to travel through Europe to promote his ideas. His book was largely positively received, and the President of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, jurist [[Gustave Moynier]], made the book and its suggestions the topic of the 9 February 1863 meeting of the organization. Dunant's recommendations were examined and positively assessed by the members. They created a five-person Committee to further pursue the possibility of their implementation and made Dunant one of the members. The others were Moynier, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] army general [[Henri Dufour]], and doctors [[Louis Appia]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Maunoir]]. Their first meeting on 17 February 1863 is now considered the founding date of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].\n\nFrom early on, Moynier and Dunant had increasing disagreements and conflicts regarding their respective visions and plans. Moynier considered Dunant's idea to establish neutrality protections for care providers unfeasible and advised Dunant not to insist upon this concept. However, Dunant continued to advocate this position in his travels and conversations with high-ranking political and military figures. This intensified the personal conflict between Moynier, who took a rather pragmatic approach to the project, and Dunant, who was the idealist among the five.\n\nIn October 1863, 14 states took part in a meeting in Geneva organized by the committee to discuss the improvement of care for wounded soldiers. Dunant was a protocol leader during the meeting. A year later on 22 August 1864, a diplomatic conference organized by the [[Swiss Parliament]] led to the signing of the [[First Geneva Convention]] by 12 states. Dunant was in charge of organizing accommodation for the attendees.\n\n== Forgotten period ==\n[[File:Henry dunant.jpg|thumb]]\nDunant's businesses in Algeria had suffered. In April 1867, the bankruptcy of the financial firm ''Cr\u00e9dit Genevois'' led to a scandal involving Dunant. He declared bankruptcy and was condemned by the Geneva Trade Court on 17 August 1868 for deceptive practices in the bankruptcies. Due to their investments in the firm, his family and many of his friends were also heavily affected by the downfall of the company. The social outcry in Geneva, a city deeply rooted in Calvinist traditions, also led to calls for him to separate himself from the International Committee. On 25 August 1868, he resigned as Secretary and, on 8 September, he was fully removed from the Committee. Moynier, became President of the Committee in 1864.\n\nIn February 1868, Dunant's mother died. Later that year he was expelled from the YMCA.{{why|date=July 2017}} In March 1867, he left his home city Geneva and would not return for the rest of his life. In the following years, Moynier likely used his influence to attempt to ensure that Dunant would not receive assistance and support from his friends. For example, the gold medal prize of ''Sciences Morales'' at the Paris World's Fair did not go to Dunant as originally planned but to Moynier, Dufour, and Dunant together so that the prize money would only go to the Committee as a whole. Napol\u00e9on III's offer to take over half of Dunant's debts if Dunant's friends would secure the other half was also thwarted by Moynier's efforts.\n\nDunant moved to Paris, where he lived in meager conditions. However, he continued to pursue his humanitarian ideas and plans. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), he founded the Common Relief Society (''Allgemeine F\u00fcrsorgegesellschaft'') and soon after the Common Alliance for Order and Civilization (''[[Allgemeine Allianz f\u00fcr Ordnung und Zivilisation]]''). He argued for disarmament negotiations and for the erection of an international court to mediate international conflicts. Later he worked for the creation of a world library, an idea which had echoes in future projects such as [[UNESCO]].\n\nIn his continued pursuit and advocacy of his ideas, he further neglected his personal situation and income, falling further in [[debt]] and being shunned by his acquaintances. Despite being appointed an honorary member of the national Red Cross societies of Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, [[Prussia]] and Spain, he was nearly forgotten in the official discourse of the Red Cross Movement, even as it was rapidly expanding to new countries. He lived in poverty, moving to various places between 1874 and 1886, including [[Stuttgart]], Rome, [[Corfu]], [[Basel]], and [[Karlsruhe]]. In Stuttgart he met the [[T\u00fcbingen University]] student Rudolf M\u00fcller with whom he would have a close friendship. In 1881, together with friends from Stuttgart, he went to the small Swiss resort village [[Heiden AR|Heiden]] for the first time. In 1887 while living in London, he began to receive some monthly financial support from some distant family members. This enabled him to live a somewhat more secure existence, and he moved to Heiden in July. He spent the rest of his life there, and after 30 April 1892 he lived in a hospital and nursing home led by Dr. Hermann Altherr.\n\nIn Heiden, he met the young teacher Wilhelm Sonderegger and his wife Susanna; they encouraged him to record his life experiences. Sonderegger's wife founded a branch of the Red Cross in Heiden and in 1890 Dunant became its honorary president. With Sonderegger, Dunant hoped to further promote his ideas, including publishing a new edition of his book. However, their friendship later was strained by Dunant's unjustified accusations that Sonderegger, with Moynier in Geneva, was somehow conspiring against Dunant. Sonderegger died in 1904 at age 42. Despite their strained relationship, Dunant was deeply moved by the unexpected death. Wilhelm and Susanna Sonderegger's admiration for Dunant, felt by both even after Dunant's allegations, was passed on to their children. In 1935, their son Ren\u00e9 published a compilation of letters from Dunant to his father.\n\n== Return to public memory ==\nIn September 1895, Georg Baumberger, the chief editor of the [[St. Gallen|St. Gall]] newspaper ''[[Die Ostschweiz]]'', wrote an article about the Red Cross founder, whom he had met and conversed with during a walk in Heiden a month earlier. The article entitled \"Henri Dunant, the founder of the Red Cross\", appeared in the German Illustrated Magazine ''\u00dcber Land und Meer'', and the article was soon reprinted in other publications throughout Europe. The article struck a chord, and he received renewed attention and support. He received the Swiss Binet-Fendt Prize and a note from Pope [[Leo XIII]]. Because of support from Russian [[tsar]]ist widow [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Feodorovna]] and other donations, his financial situation improved remarkably.\n\nIn 1897, Rudolf M\u00fcller, who was now working as a teacher in Stuttgart, wrote a book about the origins of the Red Cross, altering the official history to stress Dunant's role. The book also contained the text of ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]''. Dunant began an exchange of correspondence with [[Bertha von Suttner]] and wrote numerous articles and writings. He was especially active in writing about women's rights, and in 1897 facilitated the founding of a \"Green Cross\" women's organization whose only section was briefly active in Brussels.\n\n== Nobel Peace Prize ==\n[[File:Jean Henri Dunant.jpg|right|thumb|Dunant in 1901]]\nIn 1901, Dunant was awarded the first-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his role in founding the International Red Cross Movement and initiating the Geneva Convention. By public and private means, M\u00fcller, and later Norwegian military physician [[Hans Daae]] (who had received a copy of M\u00fcller's book), advocated Dunant's case to the Nobel committee over the course of 4 years.<ref name=\"Daae\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=ny77bPwKxaUC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates: An Illustrated Biographical History | publisher=Science History Publications/USA | author=Abrams, Irwin | authorlink=Irwin Abrams | year=2001 | page=48 | isbn=978-0-8813-5388-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Heudtlass\">{{cite journal | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/RC_Jun-1964.pdf | title=J.

The official congratulations which he received from the International Committee finally represented the rehabilitation of Dunant's reputation:\n\n<blockquote>\"There is no man who more deserves this honour, for it was you, forty years ago, who set on foot the international organization for the relief of the wounded on the battlefield. Without you, the Red Cross, the supreme humanitarian achievement of the nineteenth century would probably have never been undertaken.\"</blockquote>\n\nMoynier and the International Committee as a whole had also been nominated for the prize. Although Dunant was supported by a broad spectrum in the selection process, he was still a controversial candidate. Some argued that the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention had made war more attractive and imaginable by eliminating some of its suffering. Therefore, M\u00fcller, in a letter to the committee, argued that the prize should be divided between Dunant and Passy, who for some time in the debate had been the leading candidate to be the sole recipient of the prize. M\u00fcller also suggested that if a prize were to be warranted for Dunant, it should be given immediately because of his advanced age and ill health.\n\nBy dividing the prize between Passy, a pacifist, and Dunant, a humanitarian, the Nobel Committee set a precedent for the conditions of the Nobel Peace Prize selection which would have significant consequences in later years. A section of Nobel's will had indicated that the prize should go to an individual who had worked to reduce or eliminate standing armies, or directly to promote peace conferences, which made Passy a natural choice for his peace work. On the other hand, the arguably distinct bestowal for humanitarian effort alone was seen by some as a wide interpretation of Nobel's will. However, another part of Nobel's testament marked the prize for the individual who had best enhanced the \"brotherhood of people,\" which could be interpreted more generally as seeing humanitarian work like Dunant's as connected to peacemaking as well. Many recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize in later years can be assigned to either of these two categories first roughly established by the Nobel committee's decision in 1901.\n\nHans Daae succeeded in placing Dunant's part of the prize money, 104,000 Swiss Francs, in a Norwegian Bank and preventing access by his creditors. Dunant himself never spent any of the money during his lifetime, continuing to live simply and reserving it for bequests in his will to those who cared for him and charitable causes.<ref name=\"Daae\"/>\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n[[Image:Grab Henry Dunant02.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Henry Dunant.]]\n[[Image:Jean Henri Dunant Monument.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry Dunant Monument in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], Australia]]\n\nAmong several other awards in the following years, in 1903 Dunant was given an honorary doctorate by the medical faculty of the [[University of Heidelberg]]. He lived in the nursing home in Heiden until his death. In the final years of his life, he suffered from depression and [[paranoia]] about pursuit by his creditors and Moynier. There were even days when Dunant insisted that the cook of the nursing home first taste his food before his eyes to protect him against possible poisoning. In his final years, he spurned and attacked Calvinism and [[organized religion]] generally. He was said to be agnostic.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought |date=2007 |publisher=Vantage Press, Inc |isbn=9780533155972 |author=Oscar Riddle |page=343 |quote=The first Nobel Peace Prize went, in 1901, to Henri Dunant.

He died on 30 October 1910, and his final words were \"Where has humanity gone?\" \n\nAccording to his wishes, he was buried without ceremony in the [[Sihlfeld]] Cemetery in [[Zurich]]. In his will, he donated funds to secure a \"free bed\" in the Heiden nursing home always to be available for a poor citizen of the region and deeded some money to friends and charitable organizations in Norway and Switzerland. The remaining funds went to his creditors partially relieving his debt; his inability to fully erase his debts was a major burden to him until his death.\n\nHis birthday, 8 May, is celebrated as the World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day. The former nursing home in Heiden now houses the [[Henry Dunant Museum]]. In Geneva and other places there are numerous streets, squares, and schools named after him. The [[Henry Dunant Medal]], awarded every two years by the standing commission of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is its highest decoration.\n\nHis life is represented, with some fictional elements, in the film ''[[D'homme \u00e0 hommes]]'' (1948), starring [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], and the period of his life when the Red Cross was founded in the international film coproduction ''[http://www.dunant-themovie.com/ Henry Dunant: Red on the Cross]'' (2006).

Skorzeny led [[Operation Greif]], in which German soldiers infiltrated Allied lines by using their opponents' uniforms, equipment, language and customs. For this he was charged at the [[Dachau Trials|Dachau Military Tribunal]] with breaching the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|1907 Hague Convention]], but was acquitted after a former British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agent testified that he and his operatives had worn German uniforms behind enemy lines.\n\nSkorzeny escaped from an internment camp in 1948, hiding out on a Bavarian farm for 18 months, then spent time in Paris and Salzburg before eventually settling in [[Francoist Spain]].

While recuperating from his injuries he was given a staff role in [[Berlin]], where he developed his ideas on unconventional commando warfare.<ref name=williamson/> Skorzeny's proposals were to develop units specialized in such warfare, including partisan-like fighting deep behind enemy lines, fighting in enemy uniform, sabotage attacks, etc. In April 1943 Skorzeny's name was put forward by [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], the new head of the [[Reich Main Security Office|RSHA]], and Skorzeny met with [[Walter Schellenberg]], head of Amt VI, Ausland-SD (the SS foreign intelligence service department of the RSHA). Schellenberg charged Skorzeny with command of the schools organized to train operatives in sabotage, espionage, and paramilitary techniques. Skorzeny was appointed commander of the recently created ''Waffen [[Sonder Lehrgang Oranienburg|Sonderverband z.b.V.

Skorzeny sent a group by parachute into Iran to make contact with the dissident mountain tribes to encourage them to sabotage Allied supplies of material being sent to the Soviet Union via the [[Trans-Iranian Railway]]. However, commitment among the rebel tribes was suspect, and Operation Fran\u00e7ois was deemed a failure.<ref>Skorzeny, Otto (1950), ''Skorzeny's Secret Missions'', New York: EP Dutton and Company Inc.</ref>\n\n{{Cquote|Skorzeny arranged a meeting with the leaders of the former administration in Byelorussia [''[[Wei\u00dfruthenien]]''], all of whom had beat a hasty retreat to Berlin in June and July 1944. These men, [[Radislaw Ostrowsky]], V.I. Rodko and [[Mikola Abramchyk]], agreed to cooperate in finding recruits and staff for several sabotage schools that could train infiltrators. Such line-crossers, it was felt, could serve as rallying points for partisans who had already fled to the woods. Two SD facilities were established, one at Dahlwitz, near Berlin, and a second at Walbuze, in East Prussia. Radio communications, encoding, demolitions and assassination techniques were taught at these schools. FAK 203 also established a Byelorussian camp at [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]], which was run by Major Gerullis. This facility was later evacuated to Boitzenburg, in Pomerania, and was eventually transferred to Jagdverband Ost.<br/> \nIn the late summer and autumn of 1944, FAK 203 sent several teams into Soviet-liberated area of Byelorussia, and these detachments were followed by a thirty-man paratroop unit codenamed the '[[Belarusian Black Cats|Black Cats]]' and led by [[Micha\u0142 Vitu\u0161ka|Michael Vitushka]]. A number of groups with radio transmitters were also air-dropped into the area east of Vilna, where they operated so effectively that the Germans made plans for large-scale parachute drops in the region, although such operations were impossible to execute because of the shortage of aircraft.

So he ordered Skorzeny to track Mussolini, and simultaneously ordered the paratroop General Kurt Student to execute the liberation.\n\nMussolini was being transported around [[Italy]] by his captors (first to [[Ponza]], then to [[La Maddalena]], both small islands in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]).\nIntercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used the reconnaissance provided by the agents and informants (counterfeit British [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|bank notes]] with a face value of \u00a3100,000 forged under [[Operation Bernhard]] were used to help obtain information) of ''SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer'' [[Herbert Kappler]] to determine that Mussolini was being imprisoned at Campo Imperatore Hotel, a ski resort at [[Campo Imperatore]] in Italy's Gran Sasso massif, high in the Apennine Mountains.\n\nOn 12 September 1943, Skorzeny and 16 SS troopers joined the ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' to rescue Mussolini in a high-risk glider mission. Ten [[DFS 230]] gliders, each carrying nine soldiers and a pilot, towed by [[Henschel Hs 126]] planes started between 13:05 and 13:10 from the [[Pratica di Mare Air Base]] near Rome. The leader of the airborne operation, paratrooper-[[Oberleutnant]] Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch entered the first glider, Skorzeny and his SS troopers sat in the fourth and fifth glider. To gain height before crossing the close by [[Alban Hills]] the leading three glider-towing plane units flew an additional loop. All following units considered this manoeuvre unnecessary and preferred not to endanger the given time of arrival at the target. This led to the situation that Skozeny's two units arrived first over the target.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez\">{{cite book|author=\u00d3scar Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez|title=Fallschirmj\u00e4ger at the Gran Sasso|publisher=AF Editores |place=Valladolid |year=2007 |isbn=978-84-96935-00-6}}</ref> Meanwhile, the valley station of the funicular railway leading to the Campo Imperatore was captured at 14:00 in a ground attack by two paratrooper companies led by Major [[Harald Mors|Otto-Harald Mors]], who was commander-in-chief of the whole raid. They also cut all telephone lines. At 14:05 the airborne commandos landed their ten DFS 230 gliders on the mountain near the hotel; only one crashed, causing injuries. The ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' and Skorzeny's special troopers overwhelmed Mussolini's captors (200 well-equipped ''[[Carabinieri]]'' guards) without a single shot being fired; this was also due to the fact that General {{ill|Fernando Soleti|it}} of the ''Polizia dell' Africa Italiana'', who flew in with Skorzeny, told them to stand down. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment and stormed into the hotel, being followed by his SS troopers and the paratroopers. Ten minutes after the beginning of the raid, Mussolini left the hotel, accompanied by the German soldiers. At 14:45 Major Mors accessed the Hotel via the funicular railway and introduced himself to Mussolini.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-567-1503C-04, Gran Sasso, Fieseler Fi 156 \u00bbStorch\u00ab.jpg|thumb|[[Fieseler Fi 156]] [[Storch]] used to rescue Mussolini]]\nSubsequently, Mussolini was to be flown out by a meanwhile arrived [[Fieseler Fi 156]] [[STOL]] plane. Although under the given circumstances the small plane was overloaded, Skorzeny insisted to accompany Mussolini, thus endangering the success of the mission. After an extremely dangerous but successful lift-off, they flew to Pratica di Mare. There they continued immediately, flying in a [[Heinkel He 111]] to Vienna, where Mussolini stayed overnight at the [[Hotel Imperial]].

Friedenthal'' was re-designated SS-J\u00e4ger-Bataillon 502 with Skorzeny staying on as commander. They were assigned to ''Operation R\u00f6sselsprung'', known subsequently as the [[Raid on Drvar]]. ''R\u00f6sselsprung'' was a commando operation meant to capture the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] commander-in-chief, Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], who had also recently been recognized by the Allies as the [[Yugoslav prime minister]]. Marshal Tito led the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan]] resistance army from his headquarters near the [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnian]] town of [[Drvar]], in the center of a large area held by the Partisans.<ref>Eyre, Wayne D. ''Operation R\u00f6sselsprung and the Elimination of Tito, 25 May 1944: A Failure in Planning and Intelligence Support.'' http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a403840.pdf, p. 6</ref>\n\nHitler knew Tito was receiving Allied support and was aware that either British or American troops might land in [[Dalmatia]] along the [[Adriatic]] coastline with support from the Partisans. Killing or capturing Tito would not only hinder this, it would give a badly needed boost to the morale of Axis forces engaged in [[occupied Yugoslavia]]. Skorzeny was involved in planning ''R\u00f6sselsprung'' and was intended to command it. However, he argued against implementation after he visited [[Zagreb]] and discovered that the operation had been compromised through the carelessness of German agents in the Nazi-affiliated [[Independent State of Croatia]] in occupied Yugoslav territory.\n\n''R\u00f6sselsprung'' was put into action nonetheless, but it was a complete disaster. The first wave of paratroopers, following heavy bombardment by the Luftwaffe, jumped between Tito's hideout in a cave and the town of Drvar; they landed on open ground and many were promptly shot by members of the [[Tito Escort Battalion]], a unit numbering fewer than a hundred soldiers. The second wave of paratroopers missed their target and landed several miles out of town. Tito was gone long before paratroopers reached the cave; a trail at the back of the cave led to the railway tracks where Tito boarded a train that took him safely to [[Jajce]]. In the meantime, the Partisan 1st Brigade, from the 6th ''Lika'' Partisan Division, arrived after a twelve-mile (nineteen-kilometer) forced march and attacked the Waffen-SS paratroopers, inflicting heavy casualties.\n\n===Hungary and Operation Panzerfaust===\n{{main|Operation Panzerfaust}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-680-8283A-30A, Budapest, Otto Skorzeny, Adrian v.

The surrender of Hungary would have cut off the million German troops still fighting in the [[Balkan peninsula]].\n\nSkorzeny, in a daring \"snatch\" codenamed [[Operation Panzerfaust]] (known as ''Operation Eisenfaust'' in Germany), kidnapped Horthy's son [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy Jr.]] and forced his father to resign as [[head of state]]. A pro-Nazi government under dictator [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]] was then installed in Hungary. In April 1945, after German and Hungarian forces had already been driven out of Hungary, Sz\u00e1lasi and his [[Arrow Cross Party]]-based forces continued the fight in [[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovakia]].

He and nine officers of the Panzerbrigade 150 were tried before a US [[Military Tribunal]] in Dachau on 18 August 1947. They faced charges of improper use of US military insignia, theft of US uniforms, and theft of [[Red Cross parcel]]s from U.S. POWs. The trial lasted over three weeks. The charge of stealing [[Red Cross]] parcels was dropped for lack of evidence. Skorzeny admitted to ordering his men to wear US uniforms, but his defence argued that as long as enemy uniforms were discarded before combat started, such a tactic was a legitimate ''[[ruse de guerre]]''.\n\nOn the final day of the trial, 9 September, [[F.

He rarely visited after 1963 and sold Martinstown House in 1971. At 6&nbsp;ft 4 in and weighing {{convert|18|st|kg lb}}, along with his scar, he was easily recognizable and caused speculation among the English and Irish press as to why he was in Ireland.

While recuperating from his injuries he was given a staff role in [[Berlin]], where he developed his ideas on unconventional commando warfare.<ref name=williamson/> Skorzeny's proposals were to develop units specialized in such warfare, including partisan-like fighting deep behind enemy lines, fighting in enemy uniform, sabotage attacks, etc. In April 1943 Skorzeny's name was put forward by [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], the new head of the [[Reich Main Security Office|RSHA]], and Skorzeny met with [[Walter Schellenberg]], head of Amt VI, Ausland-SD (the SS foreign intelligence service department of the RSHA). Schellenberg charged Skorzeny with command of the schools organized to train operatives in sabotage, espionage, and paramilitary techniques. Skorzeny was appointed commander of the recently created ''Waffen [[Sonder Lehrgang Oranienburg|Sonderverband z.b.V. Friedenthal]]'' stationed near Berlin (the unit was later renamed [[SS-J\u00e4ger-Bataillon 502|SS Jagdverband 502]], and in November 1944 again to SS Combat Unit \"Center\", expanding ultimately to five battalions).<ref name=mitcham>{{cite book |last=Mitcham|first=Samuel W. |title=Panzers in Winter: Hitler's Army and the Battle of the Bulge |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|page=29|isbn=0-275-97115-5}}</ref>\n\nThe unit's first mission was in mid-1943, [[Operation Fran\u00e7ois]]. Skorzeny sent a group by parachute into Iran to make contact with the dissident mountain tribes to encourage them to sabotage Allied supplies of material being sent to the Soviet Union via the [[Trans-Iranian Railway]]. However, commitment among the rebel tribes was suspect, and Operation Fran\u00e7ois was deemed a failure.<ref>Skorzeny, Otto (1950), ''Skorzeny's Secret Missions'', New York: EP Dutton and Company Inc.</ref>\n\n{{Cquote|Skorzeny arranged a meeting with the leaders of the former administration in Byelorussia [''[[Wei\u00dfruthenien]]''], all of whom had beat a hasty retreat to Berlin in June and July 1944. These men, [[Radislaw Ostrowsky]], V.I. Rodko and [[Mikola Abramchyk]], agreed to cooperate in finding recruits and staff for several sabotage schools that could train infiltrators. Such line-crossers, it was felt, could serve as rallying points for partisans who had already fled to the woods. Two SD facilities were established, one at Dahlwitz, near Berlin, and a second at Walbuze, in East Prussia. Radio communications, encoding, demolitions and assassination techniques were taught at these schools. FAK 203 also established a Byelorussian camp at [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]], which was run by Major Gerullis. This facility was later evacuated to Boitzenburg, in Pomerania, and was eventually transferred to Jagdverband Ost.<br/> \nIn the late summer and autumn of 1944, FAK 203 sent several teams into Soviet-liberated area of Byelorussia, and these detachments were followed by a thirty-man paratroop unit codenamed the '[[Belarusian Black Cats|Black Cats]]' and led by [[Micha\u0142 Vitu\u0161ka|Michael Vitushka]]. A number of groups with radio transmitters were also air-dropped into the area east of Vilna, where they operated so effectively that the Germans made plans for large-scale parachute drops in the region, although such operations were impossible to execute because of the shortage of aircraft. Other detachments filtered through the dense Bielavieza Forest, near Byalistok, and such squads had considerable success in rousing the 'forest fugitives' to greater levels of insurgency.<ref>{{cite book|title=The SS Hunter Battalions: The Hidden History of the Nazi Resistance Movement 1944-45|author=Alexander Perry Biddiscombe|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=EeYhAQAAIAAJ&q=V.+I.+Rodko|publisher=Tempus|year=2006|pages=65\u201366|isbn=0752439383}}</ref>}}\n\n==Operations by Skorzeny==\n* [[Operation Fran\u00e7ois]] \u2013 Co-ordination of guerrilla operations in [[Imperial State of Iran|Iran]].\n* [[Gran Sasso raid|Operation Oak]] (''Unternehmen Eiche'', September 1943) \u2013 rescue of Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]].\n* [[Operation Long Jump]] \u2013 A planned operation to assassinate the \"Big Three\" (Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt) during the 1943 Tehran Conference.

So he ordered Skorzeny to track Mussolini, and simultaneously ordered the paratroop General Kurt Student to execute the liberation.\n\nMussolini was being transported around [[Italy]] by his captors (first to [[Ponza]], then to [[La Maddalena]], both small islands in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]).\nIntercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used the reconnaissance provided by the agents and informants (counterfeit British [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|bank notes]] with a face value of \u00a3100,000 forged under [[Operation Bernhard]] were used to help obtain information) of ''SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer'' [[Herbert Kappler]] to determine that Mussolini was being imprisoned at Campo Imperatore Hotel, a ski resort at [[Campo Imperatore]] in Italy's Gran Sasso massif, high in the Apennine Mountains.\n\nOn 12 September 1943, Skorzeny and 16 SS troopers joined the ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' to rescue Mussolini in a high-risk glider mission. Ten [[DFS 230]] gliders, each carrying nine soldiers and a pilot, towed by [[Henschel Hs 126]] planes started between 13:05 and 13:10 from the [[Pratica di Mare Air Base]] near Rome. The leader of the airborne operation, paratrooper-[[Oberleutnant]] Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch entered the first glider, Skorzeny and his SS troopers sat in the fourth and fifth glider. To gain height before crossing the close by [[Alban Hills]] the leading three glider-towing plane units flew an additional loop. All following units considered this manoeuvre unnecessary and preferred not to endanger the given time of arrival at the target. This led to the situation that Skozeny's two units arrived first over the target.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez\">{{cite book|author=\u00d3scar Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez|title=Fallschirmj\u00e4ger at the Gran Sasso|publisher=AF Editores |place=Valladolid |year=2007 |isbn=978-84-96935-00-6}}</ref> Meanwhile, the valley station of the funicular railway leading to the Campo Imperatore was captured at 14:00 in a ground attack by two paratrooper companies led by Major [[Harald Mors|Otto-Harald Mors]], who was commander-in-chief of the whole raid. They also cut all telephone lines. At 14:05 the airborne commandos landed their ten DFS 230 gliders on the mountain near the hotel; only one crashed, causing injuries. The ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' and Skorzeny's special troopers overwhelmed Mussolini's captors (200 well-equipped ''[[Carabinieri]]'' guards) without a single shot being fired; this was also due to the fact that General {{ill|Fernando Soleti|it}} of the ''Polizia dell' Africa Italiana'', who flew in with Skorzeny, told them to stand down. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment and stormed into the hotel, being followed by his SS troopers and the paratroopers. Ten minutes after the beginning of the raid, Mussolini left the hotel, accompanied by the German soldiers. At 14:45 Major Mors accessed the Hotel via the funicular railway and introduced himself to Mussolini.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-567-1503C-04, Gran Sasso, Fieseler Fi 156 \u00bbStorch\u00ab.jpg|thumb|[[Fieseler Fi 156]] [[Storch]] used to rescue Mussolini]]\nSubsequently, Mussolini was to be flown out by a meanwhile arrived [[Fieseler Fi 156]] [[STOL]] plane. Although under the given circumstances the small plane was overloaded, Skorzeny insisted to accompany Mussolini, thus endangering the success of the mission. After an extremely dangerous but successful lift-off, they flew to Pratica di Mare. There they continued immediately, flying in a [[Heinkel He 111]] to Vienna, where Mussolini stayed overnight at the [[Hotel Imperial]].

Friedenthal'' was re-designated SS-J\u00e4ger-Bataillon 502 with Skorzeny staying on as commander. They were assigned to ''Operation R\u00f6sselsprung'', known subsequently as the [[Raid on Drvar]]. ''R\u00f6sselsprung'' was a commando operation meant to capture the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] commander-in-chief, Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], who had also recently been recognized by the Allies as the [[Yugoslav prime minister]]. Marshal Tito led the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan]] resistance army from his headquarters near the [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnian]] town of [[Drvar]], in the center of a large area held by the Partisans.<ref>Eyre, Wayne D. ''Operation R\u00f6sselsprung and the Elimination of Tito, 25 May 1944: A Failure in Planning and Intelligence Support.'' http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a403840.pdf, p. 6</ref>\n\nHitler knew Tito was receiving Allied support and was aware that either British or American troops might land in [[Dalmatia]] along the [[Adriatic]] coastline with support from the Partisans. Killing or capturing Tito would not only hinder this, it would give a badly needed boost to the morale of Axis forces engaged in [[occupied Yugoslavia]]. Skorzeny was involved in planning ''R\u00f6sselsprung'' and was intended to command it. However, he argued against implementation after he visited [[Zagreb]] and discovered that the operation had been compromised through the carelessness of German agents in the Nazi-affiliated [[Independent State of Croatia]] in occupied Yugoslav territory.\n\n''R\u00f6sselsprung'' was put into action nonetheless, but it was a complete disaster. The first wave of paratroopers, following heavy bombardment by the Luftwaffe, jumped between Tito's hideout in a cave and the town of Drvar; they landed on open ground and many were promptly shot by members of the [[Tito Escort Battalion]], a unit numbering fewer than a hundred soldiers. The second wave of paratroopers missed their target and landed several miles out of town. Tito was gone long before paratroopers reached the cave; a trail at the back of the cave led to the railway tracks where Tito boarded a train that took him safely to [[Jajce]]. In the meantime, the Partisan 1st Brigade, from the 6th ''Lika'' Partisan Division, arrived after a twelve-mile (nineteen-kilometer) forced march and attacked the Waffen-SS paratroopers, inflicting heavy casualties.\n\n===Hungary and Operation Panzerfaust===\n{{main|Operation Panzerfaust}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-680-8283A-30A, Budapest, Otto Skorzeny, Adrian v.

The surrender of Hungary would have cut off the million German troops still fighting in the [[Balkan peninsula]].\n\nSkorzeny, in a daring \"snatch\" codenamed [[Operation Panzerfaust]] (known as ''Operation Eisenfaust'' in Germany), kidnapped Horthy's son [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy Jr.]] and forced his father to resign as [[head of state]]. A pro-Nazi government under dictator [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]] was then installed in Hungary. In April 1945, after German and Hungarian forces had already been driven out of Hungary, Sz\u00e1lasi and his [[Arrow Cross Party]]-based forces continued the fight in [[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovakia]].

They faced charges of improper use of US military insignia, theft of US uniforms, and theft of [[Red Cross parcel]]s from U.S. POWs. The trial lasted over three weeks. The charge of stealing [[Red Cross]] parcels was dropped for lack of evidence. Skorzeny admitted to ordering his men to wear US uniforms, but his defence argued that as long as enemy uniforms were discarded before combat started, such a tactic was a legitimate ''[[ruse de guerre]]''.\n\nOn the final day of the trial, 9 September, [[F.

In late 1958, he qualified for an Austrian passport and in 1959, he purchased Martinstown House, a {{convert|165|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm in [[County Kildare]]. Although Skorzeny could not be refused entry without due cause, he was refused a residency visa by the Irish government and had to limit his stays to six weeks at a time, and he was monitored by [[G2 (Republic of Ireland)|G2]]. He rarely visited after 1963 and sold Martinstown House in 1971. At 6&nbsp;ft 4 in and weighing {{convert|18|st|kg lb}}, along with his scar, he was easily recognizable and caused speculation among the English and Irish press as to why he was in Ireland. One Kildare resident recalled Skorzeny as someone who \"wasn't particularly friendly and [who] didn't really mix with local people\".<ref name=BBC/><ref>{{cite book|last=Terence|first=O'Reilly|title=Hitler's Irishmen|year=2008|publisher=Mercier Press|isbn=978-1-85635-589-6}}</ref> Skorzeny also owned property on [[Majorca]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Snyder|first=Louis Leo|title=Hitler's Henchmen: The Nazis who Shaped the Third Reich|publisher=David & Charles|year=2005|page=315|isbn=0-7153-2033-5}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Skorzeny set up the [[Paladin Group (fascist private military contractor)|Paladin Group]], which he envisioned as \"an international directorship of strategic assault personnel <nowiki>[</nowiki>that would<nowiki>]</nowiki> straddle the watershed between paramilitary operations carried out by troops in uniform and the political warfare which is conducted by civilian agents\".

Two tumours were later removed while he was staying at a hospital in [[Hamburg]], but the surgery left him paralyzed from the waist down. Vowing to walk again, Skorzeny spent long hours with a physical therapist; and, within six months, he was back on his feet. Skorzeny died of [[lung cancer]] on 5 July 1975 in Madrid. He was 67 years old.<ref>''[[Deutsche Biographische Enzyklop\u00e4die]]'', volume 9 Schmidt - Theyer, K.G.
