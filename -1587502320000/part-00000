Those numbers changed in 1994 to 110, 112 and 113 respectively.<ref>[[Telephone numbers in Norway]]</ref>\n\nCalls to the emergency number can be made even if a phone is locked, no SIM is required, and calls must be forwarded by service providers even if the subscriber is barred from making calls due to billing issues.<ref name=tpg/>\n\nFor calls to the [[State Emergency Service]] about non\u2013life-threatening situations, the Australia-wide number 132 500 can be used (except in the Northern Territory).\n\n== History ==\nBefore 1969, Australia did not have a national number for emergency services; the police, fire and ambulance services had many phone numbers, one for each local unit. In 1961, the office of the [[Postmaster-General's Department|Postmaster General]] (PMG) introduced the 000 number in major population centres and near the end of the 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number 000 was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the dialling system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an automatic trunk line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a main centre; thus dialling 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is also the closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones. This made it quick and easy to dial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |title=History of the Emergency Call Services |website=ACMA |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090515052220/http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |archive-date=15 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is now well established nationally throughout Australia that persons requiring emergency assistance dial 000.\n\n== Calling 000 ==\nWithin Australia, 000 is a free call from most telephones. Dialling 000 (or 112) on most Australian GSM mobile phones will override any keypad lock, and if the caller's home network is out of range, the phone will attempt to use other carriers' networks to relay the call. A [[SIM card]] is not required to connect a mobile phone to Emergency Services. Interpreter services may be available once connected to Emergency Services.\n\nDue to special configuration in their firmware, some [[3G]] or [[GSM]] mobile phones sold in Australia will redirect other emergency numbers, such as [[9-1-1]] and [[999 (emergency telephone number)|9-9-9]], to 000. These calls are sent out by the handset as an emergency flag to the network and as such are treated in the same way as a call to 000.\n\n== Answering ==\nExcept for Victoria (see below), calling 000 greets the caller with a recorded message stating \"You have dialed emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" then connects the caller to a [[Telstra]] operator who will then connect the caller to the emergency service organisation call taker. Telstra operators will ask the caller if they require \"Police, Fire, Ambulance?\", and their location if not calling from a phone with fixed location (landline). The caller is then connected to the emergency service requested by the caller.\n\nAs soon as the emergency service call taker answers the call, any available caller location information is transferred to the emergency service; however, the emergency service call taker will still question the caller to obtain correct location details in order to dispatch the correct response.\n\nThe caller's address is usually available to Telstra operators for fixed services in Australia even if the number is \"private\". However, emergency service organisation call takers will always ask for the address of the emergency to be stated whenever possible to ensure an accurate location is provided<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esta.vic.gov.au/?id=71 |title=ESTA Frequently Asked Questions |website=Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (Victoria) |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> \u2013 this is especially relevant in the case of \"third-party\" callers who are not personally on the scene of the incident (e.g. relatives or alarm monitoring corporations). When calling from a telephone not at a fixed location (mobile), it is necessary for the caller to specify the location.\n\n=== Victoria ===\nIn the state of Victoria, answering 000 as well as emergency service dispatch and call taking for [[Victoria Police]], [[Ambulance Victoria]], the [[Country Fire Authority]] and the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]], is handled by the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA).  ESTA operates three State Emergency Communications Centres, located in the [[Melbourne]] CBD, [[East Burwood]], and [[Ballarat]].\n\nWhen a person calls 000 for emergency response within Victoria, the call is automatically directed to the relevant ESTA facility where it will be answered by the next available trained call taker, who will collect information from the caller, and enter this into the [[Computer Aided Dispatch]] (CAD) system. Using this information, a dispatcher will identify and dispatch the appropriate emergency services or resources. Emergency crews are often already being notified by the relevant services' dispatchers while the call taker is still obtaining further information or giving advice, such as guiding the caller through [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|CPR]], obtaining details of a possible offender, or receiving further details about the exact location or situation - an initial response may be made to details as vague as a town or suburb, while the call taker continues to get more specific location information.\n\nESTA is also responsible for Victorian [[State Emergency Service]] call-taking and dispatch, although this service cannot be contacted by dialling 000 as SES calls are not considered to be life-threatening. The number for SES calls is 132&nbsp;500, but police or another service dialled inappropriately will notify SES.\n\nMany ESTA practices and protocols are standardised across all emergency services agencies, and all agencies use the same computer network. The result is complete and instantaneous information sharing between emergency services.<ref>{{cite news | title=Centralised service for triple-0 calls |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-30/centralised-service-for-triple-zero-calls/4400394 |accessdate=1 December 2012 |website=[[ABC Online]] |date=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== 2009 Victorian bushfires ===\n\nOn 7 February 2009, catastrophic bushfires occurred in Victoria, otherwise known as [[Black Saturday bushfires]]. Over 18,000 calls to the Triple Zero Emergency Service on that day were left unanswered and the majority of calls took much longer to be answered than usual. Owing to the unprecedented numbers of calls coming through, Telstra decided to isolate all Victorian emergency calls which were answered by the Melbourne emergency call centre with all the remaining calls answered by the Sydney emergency call centre. Telstra also activated the generic extreme event recorded voice announcement ''\"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero. If you require police, fire or ambulance please stay on the line. If you require your local State Emergency Service please hang up and dial 1223 \u2014 that\u2019s 1223 \u2014 as this service cannot be connected through Triple Zero\"'' which temporarily replaced their front end announcement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96781/20100923-0223/www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |format=PDF |page=293}}</ref> While Telstra records show 95 emergency call centre employees rostered during the 24-hour period on 7 February 2009, call pick up delays were evident due to lengthy delays at the SECC level, being ESTA. Telstra agents were left tied up on phone calls with callers, waiting for emergency services to answer, thus calls in the 000 queue were unable to be answered. Callers in a queue waiting for a Telstra agent to answer the phone were played an RVA every 30 seconds in the following terms, \"You have dialled the Emergency Triple Zero number. Due to an unprecedented high volume of calls being received by Triple Zero, we are experiencing short delays in answering. Please stay on the line and you will be answered by the next available operator\". This reassures callers that an extreme emergency was occurring and their call would be answered.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/index.php/component/content/article/22-html/867-2009-victorian-bushfires-royal-commission |title=Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission |website=Victoria Department of Premier and Cabinet|accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 2003 overload in Melbourne ===\nOn 3 December 2003, floods and storms in [[Melbourne]] caused a large influx of 000 calls, which prevented some calls from being answered immediately.

A subsequent investigation recommended that a temporary recorded announcement be implemented during extreme events to assure callers that their calls were being connected and a delay may occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/Document-data/Exhibits/WIT-5003-001-0151 |title=Telstra's handling of calls to 000 on the morning of 3 December 2003 |website=[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |date=February 2004 |page=28}}</ref> This is not to be confused with the standard \"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" RVA, which was introduced in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014|format=PDF |page=288}}</ref>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nEmergency services and Australia's communications regulator prefer the phrase \"triple zero\" over \"triple oh\" because of potential confusion and misunderstanding over keying the number when using alpha-numeric keypads, on which the letter \"O\" is typically located on the same key as the number \"6\".\n\n=== Remote locations ===\nOne major obstacle in earlier 2009<ref name=overington2009>{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Overington |author-link=Caroline Overington |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/biker-mates-rue-calling-triple-0/story-e6frg6no-1225703296424 |title=Biker mates rue calling Triple-0 |date=25 April 2009 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref> is that operators of triple-0 could not use GPS within GSM or CDMA systems to accurately locate distressed or injured persons using mobile phones visibly away from roads. Presently, operators must ask the caller exactly where they are. The answer to this may need to correspond to an existing road name (which may be practically impossible for distressed person(s) some kilometres away from a road) until the Emergency Service Organisation operator can dispatch an emergency service vehicle.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) began researching options that may provide improved location information for mobile services when dialing 000. \n\nIn 2013, an emergency service smartphone app was  produced and developed by [[Fire and Rescue NSW]] and the Triple Zero Awareness Working Group.<ref>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threesixtyentertainment.nesn</ref> Australians in remote locations are encouraged to use this app to contact emergency services as it uses phones GPS data to display the caller's location on the screen.

Those numbers changed in 1994 to 110, 112 and 113 respectively.<ref>[[Telephone numbers in Norway]]</ref>\n\nCalls to the emergency number can be made even if a phone is locked, no SIM is required, and calls must be forwarded by service providers even if the subscriber is barred from making calls due to billing issues.<ref name=tpg/>\n\nFor calls to the [[State Emergency Service]] about non\u2013life-threatening situations, the Australia-wide number 132 500 can be used (except in the Northern Territory).\n\n== History ==\nBefore 1969, Australia did not have a national number for emergency services; the police, fire and ambulance services had many phone numbers, one for each local unit. In 1961, the office of the [[Postmaster-General's Department|Postmaster General]] (PMG) introduced the 000 number in major population centres and near the end of the 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number 000 was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the dialling system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an automatic trunk line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a main centre; thus dialling 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is also the closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones. This made it quick and easy to dial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |title=History of the Emergency Call Services |website=ACMA |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090515052220/http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |archive-date=15 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is now well established nationally throughout Australia that persons requiring emergency assistance dial 000.\n\n== Calling 000 ==\nWithin Australia, 000 is a free call from most telephones. Dialling 000 (or 112) on most Australian GSM mobile phones will override any keypad lock, and if the caller's home network is out of range, the phone will attempt to use other carriers' networks to relay the call. A [[SIM card]] is not required to connect a mobile phone to Emergency Services. Interpreter services may be available once connected to Emergency Services.\n\nDue to special configuration in their firmware, some [[3G]] or [[GSM]] mobile phones sold in Australia will redirect other emergency numbers, such as [[9-1-1]] and [[999 (emergency telephone number)|9-9-9]], to 000. These calls are sent out by the handset as an emergency flag to the network and as such are treated in the same way as a call to 000.\n\n== Answering ==\nExcept for Victoria (see below), calling 000 greets the caller with a recorded message stating \"You have dialed emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" then connects the caller to a [[Telstra]] operator who will then connect the caller to the emergency service organisation call taker. Telstra operators will ask the caller if they require \"Police, Fire, Ambulance?\", and their location if not calling from a phone with fixed location (landline). The caller is then connected to the emergency service requested by the caller.\n\nAs soon as the emergency service call taker answers the call, any available caller location information is transferred to the emergency service; however, the emergency service call taker will still question the caller to obtain correct location details in order to dispatch the correct response.\n\nThe caller's address is usually available to Telstra operators for fixed services in Australia even if the number is \"private\". However, emergency service organisation call takers will always ask for the address of the emergency to be stated whenever possible to ensure an accurate location is provided<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esta.vic.gov.au/?id=71 |title=ESTA Frequently Asked Questions |website=Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (Victoria) |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> \u2013 this is especially relevant in the case of \"third-party\" callers who are not personally on the scene of the incident (e.g. relatives or alarm monitoring corporations). When calling from a telephone not at a fixed location (mobile), it is necessary for the caller to specify the location.\n\n=== Victoria ===\nIn the state of Victoria, answering 000 as well as emergency service dispatch and call taking for [[Victoria Police]], [[Ambulance Victoria]], the [[Country Fire Authority]] and the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]], is handled by the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA).  ESTA operates three State Emergency Communications Centres, located in the [[Melbourne]] CBD, [[East Burwood]], and [[Ballarat]].\n\nWhen a person calls 000 for emergency response within Victoria, the call is automatically directed to the relevant ESTA facility where it will be answered by the next available trained call taker, who will collect information from the caller, and enter this into the [[Computer Aided Dispatch]] (CAD) system. Using this information, a dispatcher will identify and dispatch the appropriate emergency services or resources. Emergency crews are often already being notified by the relevant services' dispatchers while the call taker is still obtaining further information or giving advice, such as guiding the caller through [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|CPR]], obtaining details of a possible offender, or receiving further details about the exact location or situation - an initial response may be made to details as vague as a town or suburb, while the call taker continues to get more specific location information.\n\nESTA is also responsible for Victorian [[State Emergency Service]] call-taking and dispatch, although this service cannot be contacted by dialling 000 as SES calls are not considered to be life-threatening. The number for SES calls is 132&nbsp;500, but police or another service dialled inappropriately will notify SES.\n\nMany ESTA practices and protocols are standardised across all emergency services agencies, and all agencies use the same computer network. The result is complete and instantaneous information sharing between emergency services.<ref>{{cite news | title=Centralised service for triple-0 calls |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-30/centralised-service-for-triple-zero-calls/4400394 |accessdate=1 December 2012 |website=[[ABC Online]] |date=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== 2009 Victorian bushfires ===\n\nOn 7 February 2009, catastrophic bushfires occurred in Victoria, otherwise known as [[Black Saturday bushfires]]. Over 18,000 calls to the Triple Zero Emergency Service on that day were left unanswered and the majority of calls took much longer to be answered than usual. Owing to the unprecedented numbers of calls coming through, Telstra decided to isolate all Victorian emergency calls which were answered by the Melbourne emergency call centre with all the remaining calls answered by the Sydney emergency call centre. Telstra also activated the generic extreme event recorded voice announcement ''\"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero. If you require police, fire or ambulance please stay on the line. If you require your local State Emergency Service please hang up and dial 1223 \u2014 that\u2019s 1223 \u2014 as this service cannot be connected through Triple Zero\"'' which temporarily replaced their front end announcement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96781/20100923-0223/www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |format=PDF |page=293}}</ref> While Telstra records show 95 emergency call centre employees rostered during the 24-hour period on 7 February 2009, call pick up delays were evident due to lengthy delays at the SECC level, being ESTA. Telstra agents were left tied up on phone calls with callers, waiting for emergency services to answer, thus calls in the 000 queue were unable to be answered. Callers in a queue waiting for a Telstra agent to answer the phone were played an RVA every 30 seconds in the following terms, \"You have dialled the Emergency Triple Zero number. Due to an unprecedented high volume of calls being received by Triple Zero, we are experiencing short delays in answering. Please stay on the line and you will be answered by the next available operator\". This reassures callers that an extreme emergency was occurring and their call would be answered.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/index.php/component/content/article/22-html/867-2009-victorian-bushfires-royal-commission |title=Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission |website=Victoria Department of Premier and Cabinet|accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 2003 overload in Melbourne ===\nOn 3 December 2003, floods and storms in [[Melbourne]] caused a large influx of 000 calls, which prevented some calls from being answered immediately.

A subsequent investigation recommended that a temporary recorded announcement be implemented during extreme events to assure callers that their calls were being connected and a delay may occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/Document-data/Exhibits/WIT-5003-001-0151 |title=Telstra's handling of calls to 000 on the morning of 3 December 2003 |website=[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |date=February 2004 |page=28}}</ref> This is not to be confused with the standard \"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" RVA, which was introduced in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014|format=PDF |page=288}}</ref>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nEmergency services and Australia's communications regulator prefer the phrase \"triple zero\" over \"triple oh\" because of potential confusion and misunderstanding over keying the number when using alpha-numeric keypads, on which the letter \"O\" is typically located on the same key as the number \"6\".\n\n=== Remote locations ===\nOne major obstacle in earlier 2009<ref name=overington2009>{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Overington |author-link=Caroline Overington |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/biker-mates-rue-calling-triple-0/story-e6frg6no-1225703296424 |title=Biker mates rue calling Triple-0 |date=25 April 2009 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref> is that operators of triple-0 could not use GPS within GSM or CDMA systems to accurately locate distressed or injured persons using mobile phones visibly away from roads. Presently, operators must ask the caller exactly where they are.

On 22 April 1945, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops occupied the airfield as part of the [[Battle of Berlin]]. In 1946, the headquarters of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved to Sch\u00f6nefeld from [[Johannisthal Air Field]].\n\nDuring the following years Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport became the most important civilian airport in the newly-founded German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]), with national flag carrier [[Interflug]] based there. In 1976, the modern passenger terminal, currently known as Terminal A, opened.\n\n===Plans for a new Berlin Airport===\n[[File:Map Berlin-Schoenefeld Airport SFX with planed BBI.png|thumb|Map showing the infrastructure of the Sch\u00f6nefeld area and the relationship between the new and old airports]]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and following the [[German reunification]] in 1990, Berlin once again became the German federal capital; leaders made plans to recognize the city's increased importance by constructing a large commercial airport. Existing airports [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Tegel Airport]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport]] and [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] were aging and becoming increasingly congested due to rising passenger numbers. To ensure the economic viability of the project, they pursued the ''single airport concept'', meaning that the new airport would become the sole commercial airport for Berlin and Brandenburg. They planned to close Tegel, Sch\u00f6nefeld and Tempelhof upon opening the new airport, then ban commercial aviation from any other airport in Brandenburg.\n\nOn 2 May 1991, the ''[[Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH|Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding GmbH]]'' (BBF) was founded, owned by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (37 percent each) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the remaining 26 percent). [[Eberhard Diepgen]], Mayor of Berlin, became the first chairman of the supervisory board.  The holding company announced on 20 June 1993 that [[Sperenberg Airfield]], [[J\u00fcterbog Airfield]] and the area south of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, where the evaluation of the locations Sperenberg, J\u00fcterbog East, J\u00fcterbog West, Tietzow, Michelsdorf, Borkheide and Sch\u00f6nefeld South was carried out according to 5 criteria with different weighting.

Economic considerations favoured an airport located near the city center, with existing road and rail links (as it is the case with Sch\u00f6nefeld).<ref name=\"timeline\"/><ref>{{cite book| title=Missed Opportunities: The Restructuring of Berlin's Airport System and the City's Position in International Airline Networks| last1=Alberts| first1=Heike C.| last2=Bowen Jr.| first2=John T.| last3=Cidell| first3=Julie L.| url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/54558/FinalFinal.pdf?sequence=2| publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]| date=12 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 May 1996 Mayor Diepgen, Minister-President of Brandenburg [[Manfred Stolpe]] and [[Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development|Federal Minister for Transport]] [[Matthias Wissmann]] committed to Sch\u00f6nefeld as the site for the new airport.

They called for proposals, which led to two bidding consortia emerging as serious contenders. One was led by [[Hochtief]] through its [[Hochtief Airport]] subsidiary and included [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Fraport]] and [[Landesbank Berlin Holding|Bankengesellschaft Berlin]] as partners.  The other consortium comprised [[IVG Immobilien|IVG]], [[Vienna Airport|Flughafen Wien AG]], Dorsch-Consult, [[Commerzbank]] and [[Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et consignations|Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts]]. On 19 September 1998, BBF announced that the Hochtief consortium were the successful bidder.

In the terminal building, the system was not built according to the [[construction permit]] and failed the [[Technischer \u00dcberwachungsverein|mandatory acceptance test]] necessary to open the airport. FBB proposed an interim solution employing up to 700 human fire spotters, which the building supervision department of the local [[Dahme-Spreewald]] district rejected.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joshua Hammer Reprints |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-07-23/how-berlin-s-futuristic-airport-became-a-6-billion-embarrassment |title=How Berlin's Futuristic Airport Became a $6 Billion Embarrassment |publisher=Bloomberg |date=23 July 2015}}</ref> Inspectors uncovered flaws in the wiring, programming and implementation of the highly complex system designed by [[Siemens]] and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]].

Inspectors have uncovered many examples of poor workmanship due to a lack of proper supervision and documentation, most notably concerning the wiring. Reports have surfaced about cable conduits that hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of {{convert|60|km|mi}} of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary. Furthermore, exterior vents appear to be in improper locations, allowing rainwater from the western facade to enter them.<ref name=\"failures\" /> The {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} long exhaust system to remove smoke from a fire is leaking.<ref name=\"leaking\">{{cite news| url=https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/zeitung-brandschutzanlage-am-ber-undicht-091259096.html |title=Zeitung: Brandschutzanlage am BER undicht| date=18 May 2014| work=Yahoo!

The underground railway station needs a redesign for the underground part of the fire exhaustion system. Incoming or departing trains may suck smoke into the station. As such, air flow guidance is needed to avoid this effect. However, the airport cannot decide upon the method by itself, as permission is needed from the [[Federal Railway Authority]] (''Eisenbahnbundesamt''). The construction authority of the district of [[Dahme-Spreewald]], Eisenbahnbundesamt and the airport thus need to take part in the redesign effort. The plans on how to rebuild the underground part would not be finished before June. Thus, with no plans, the district could not grant the redesign permission. As such, the airport could not start the redesign effort before the beginning of July (assuming that the district would promptly check on the plans). As such, the construction process was delayed by at least 8 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-ber-liegt-acht-monate-hinter-dem-zeitplan/13423488.html |date=9 April 2016 |title=BER liegt acht Monate hinter dem Zeitplan |trans-title=BER is 8 months behind schedule |work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 2016, it became clear that the district would check on the plans intensively.

They are the same company which designed the hexagonal Terminal A at Tegel Airport which opened in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} At BER the terminal sits between the two runways, creating a so-called ''midfield airport'' above the underground train station. The terminal has four public levels designated 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n\nThe [[Airport check-in|check-in area]] is located in the public area at Level 1 and houses 118 counters organised in eight clusters, called ''check-in isles''. Planners anticipate that a significant number of passengers will use the more than 100 self check-in machines that will be installed. Additionally, by May 2015 two extensions had been added to both sides of the main check-in area containing 12 more check-in counters and eight security lanes each to avoid overcrowding of the main hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/pavillons-hauptstadtflughafen-ber/35849 |title=Pavillons am neuen Hauptstadtflughafen BER sind fertig |publisher=airliners.de |accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe airside area will be accessible only to ticketed and [[Airport security|screened]] passengers. [[Securitas (Swedish security company)|Securitas Germany]] will staff the 35 screening stations. BER is equipped with 25 [[jet bridge]]s with another 85 aircraft stands on the apron. The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier {{convert|715|m|ft|sigfig=3}} long and the north and south piers at {{convert|350|m|ft|sigfig=3}} each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges, all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for [[Schengen Area|Schengen passengers]] (gates A01\u2013A20, B01\u2013B20), while Level 2 (gates C01\u2013C19, D01\u2013D17) is for non-Schengen passengers.<ref name=presskit/>{{rp|8\u201310}}  Eight of the gates can accommodate [[wide-body aircraft]] and one gate has been designed to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]]. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21\u201322 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]]. Lufthansa and [[Air France]]/[[KLM]] will operate [[airport lounge]]s in the main pier which will also be open for passengers of the respective [[airline alliance|alliance partners]].<ref name=\"Handbuch\">{{cite book|url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/DE/GeschaeftskundenUndPartner/Touristik/Handbuch_Flughafen_Berlin_Brandenburg_deutsch.pdf |title=Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg Handbuch |publisher=Berliner Flughafen-Gesellschaft mbH |accessdate=6 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417010130/http://www.berlin-airport.de/DE/GeschaeftskundenUndPartner/Touristik/Handbuch_Flughafen_Berlin_Brandenburg_deutsch.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:120513-BER-innen.JPG|thumb|The main hall of the terminal]]\nThe south pier was reserved for near-exclusive use of defunct [[Air Berlin]] and its [[Oneworld]] partners.

The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 96|highway 96a]] along the north side of the airport is being expanded to four lanes towards [[Potsdam]].\n\nFour car parks and a car rental centre will be completed by the opening of BER. Around 10,000 parking spaces will be available in four [[multi-storey car park]]s.\n\nA study released in September 2016 attested that BER will double the amount of vehicular traffic, causing frequent traffic jams on the [[Autobahn]] once the airport opens. The A100 and A113 do not have enough lanes to support the expected volume of traffic. The approach to BER was deemed insufficient for the expected traffic and will lead to heavy congestion on the highways throughout south-central Berlin.

However, so far there are no definite plans for the future use of this area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Controversies==\nIn September 2010 [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] published aircraft arrival and departure paths for Berlin Brandenburg Airport which significantly differ from earlier ones used in the court decision for the construction permit. In the original maps, aircraft were expected to take off and land in a path parallel with the runway. The new plans saw flight paths that deviate from the runway direction by 15 degrees. Therefore, aircraft would now fly over areas in southern Berlin ([[Lichtenrade]], [[Steglitz]] and [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]]) and adjacent Brandenburg ([[Teltow]], [[Stahnsdorf]], [[Kleinmachnow]] and [[Potsdam]]) to the surprise of local residents.

The ''B\u00fcrgerverein Brandenburg-Berlin e.V.'' represents local residents who protest an expansion of air traffic to and from the south of Berlin. Also, traffic and environmental experts criticise the late completion dates for the fast connection to the [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]. Still, Berlin Hauptbahnhof will be only a 30-minute journey with trains departing every 15 minutes upon inauguration. At the time of the originally planned opening date of BER, in 2011, this was expected to be reduced to 20 minutes after reconstruction of the Berlin section of the [[Berlin\u2013Dresden railway]], which was planned to be finished by 2020.<ref name=dresdnerbahn>{{cite news| title=Reisezeitverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr Airport-Express-Reisende| url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/reisezeitverlaengerungen-fuer-airport-express-reisende,10917074,10928694.html| work=Berliner Zeitung| date=26 August 2011| trans-title=Longer travel times for Airport Express travelers| language=German}}</ref> However, delays in both the BER construction and the construction of the railway meant that the travel time will be more than 50 minutes until at least 2025.

On 22 April 1945, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops occupied the airfield as part of the [[Battle of Berlin]]. In 1946, the headquarters of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved to Sch\u00f6nefeld from [[Johannisthal Air Field]].\n\nDuring the following years Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport became the most important civilian airport in the newly-founded German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]), with national flag carrier [[Interflug]] based there. In 1976, the modern passenger terminal, currently known as Terminal A, opened.\n\n===Plans for a new Berlin Airport===\n[[File:Map Berlin-Schoenefeld Airport SFX with planed BBI.png|thumb|Map showing the infrastructure of the Sch\u00f6nefeld area and the relationship between the new and old airports]]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and following the [[German reunification]] in 1990, Berlin once again became the German federal capital; leaders made plans to recognize the city's increased importance by constructing a large commercial airport. Existing airports [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Tegel Airport]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport]] and [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] were aging and becoming increasingly congested due to rising passenger numbers. To ensure the economic viability of the project, they pursued the ''single airport concept'', meaning that the new airport would become the sole commercial airport for Berlin and Brandenburg. They planned to close Tegel, Sch\u00f6nefeld and Tempelhof upon opening the new airport, then ban commercial aviation from any other airport in Brandenburg.\n\nOn 2 May 1991, the ''[[Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH|Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding GmbH]]'' (BBF) was founded, owned by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (37 percent each) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the remaining 26 percent). [[Eberhard Diepgen]], Mayor of Berlin, became the first chairman of the supervisory board.  The holding company announced on 20 June 1993 that [[Sperenberg Airfield]], [[J\u00fcterbog Airfield]] and the area south of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, where the evaluation of the locations Sperenberg, J\u00fcterbog East, J\u00fcterbog West, Tietzow, Michelsdorf, Borkheide and Sch\u00f6nefeld South was carried out according to 5 criteria with different weighting.

They called for proposals, which led to two bidding consortia emerging as serious contenders. One was led by [[Hochtief]] through its [[Hochtief Airport]] subsidiary and included [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Fraport]] and [[Landesbank Berlin Holding|Bankengesellschaft Berlin]] as partners.  The other consortium comprised [[IVG Immobilien|IVG]], [[Vienna Airport|Flughafen Wien AG]], Dorsch-Consult, [[Commerzbank]] and [[Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et consignations|Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts]]. On 19 September 1998, BBF announced that the Hochtief consortium were the successful bidder. This saw them granted exclusive authority to negotiate the terms and conditions for an acquisition of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport holding and the construction and operation of the new airport for 50 years.<ref name=\"welt\">{{cite news| url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article630849/Hochtief-baut-in-Schoenefeld.html| work=[[Die Welt]]| title=Hochtief baut in Sch\u00f6nefeld| date=19 September 1998| last=Sch\u00fcmann| first=Timm| language=German| trans-title=Hochtief expands in Sch\u00f6nefeld}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 March 1999, BBF officially commissioned Hochtief and its partners to construct the new airport, causing IVG to file a lawsuit. The Brandenburg [[Oberlandesgericht]] acknowledged the concerns voiced by IVG. In its review, it found that in certain points the assessment of the applications had been biased towards Hochtief.

It became clear on 8 May 2012 that the building could not open on schedule, officially due to the failure of the fire protection system. In reality, according to a Brandenburg State Audit report in February 2016 the usability of the airport was at 56.2% (there were no ticket counters, the escalators did not work, etc.).

On the retail side of the airport, shops and restaurants prepared for the opening. As the airports in Tegel and Sch\u00f6nefeld were to close once the last flights of 2 June had been serviced, a major logistics operation for moving the airports' infrastructure was launched. Vehicles, equipment and supplies that were needed at Tegel until the final moments would have been transported to BER during the night of 2\u20133 June. To allow this, the authorities planned to restrict the highways linking the two airports ([[Bundesautobahn 113|A113]], [[Bundesautobahn 100|A100]] and parts of [[Bundesautobahn 111|A111]]) to airport traffic only.<ref name=\"megamove\">{{cite news| url=http://www.thelocal.de/national/20120411-41867.html| title=Mega move to new Berlin Airport begins|date=11 April 2012| work=[[The Local]]}}</ref> [[Rundfunk Berlin Brandenburg]], the national broadcaster for Berlin and Brandenburg, scheduled 24 hours of continuous live coverage of the airport move.<ref name=\"rbb\">{{cite press release| title=24 h Airport \u2013 Der Flughafenumzug live| trans-title=24 h Airport: The Airport Move Live| date=30 April 2012| publisher=RBB| url=http://www.rbb-online.de/themen/flughafen-ber/flughafen_ber/programmtipp/24_stunden_live.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217064110/http://www.rbb-online.de/themen/flughafen-ber/flughafen_ber/programmtipp/24_stunden_live.html| url-status=dead|archive-date=17 February 2013| language=German}}</ref> A special Lufthansa flight to [[Frankfurt Airport]], operated with an [[Airbus A380]], was scheduled as the first departure from the new airport on 3 June at 06:00.<ref name=\"rbb\" />\n\nOn 8 May 2012 just 26 days before the move, FBB again postponed the opening date.

Reports have surfaced about cable conduits that hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of {{convert|60|km|mi}} of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary. Furthermore, exterior vents appear to be in improper locations, allowing rainwater from the western facade to enter them.<ref name=\"failures\" /> The {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} long exhaust system to remove smoke from a fire is leaking.<ref name=\"leaking\">{{cite news| url=https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/zeitung-brandschutzanlage-am-ber-undicht-091259096.html |title=Zeitung: Brandschutzanlage am BER undicht| date=18 May 2014| work=Yahoo!

The underground railway station needs a redesign for the underground part of the fire exhaustion system. Incoming or departing trains may suck smoke into the station. As such, air flow guidance is needed to avoid this effect. However, the airport cannot decide upon the method by itself, as permission is needed from the [[Federal Railway Authority]] (''Eisenbahnbundesamt''). The construction authority of the district of [[Dahme-Spreewald]], Eisenbahnbundesamt and the airport thus need to take part in the redesign effort. The plans on how to rebuild the underground part would not be finished before June. Thus, with no plans, the district could not grant the redesign permission. As such, the airport could not start the redesign effort before the beginning of July (assuming that the district would promptly check on the plans). As such, the construction process was delayed by at least 8 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-ber-liegt-acht-monate-hinter-dem-zeitplan/13423488.html |date=9 April 2016 |title=BER liegt acht Monate hinter dem Zeitplan |trans-title=BER is 8 months behind schedule |work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 2016, it became clear that the district would check on the plans intensively.

They are the same company which designed the hexagonal Terminal A at Tegel Airport which opened in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} At BER the terminal sits between the two runways, creating a so-called ''midfield airport'' above the underground train station. The terminal has four public levels designated 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n\nThe [[Airport check-in|check-in area]] is located in the public area at Level 1 and houses 118 counters organised in eight clusters, called ''check-in isles''. Planners anticipate that a significant number of passengers will use the more than 100 self check-in machines that will be installed. Additionally, by May 2015 two extensions had been added to both sides of the main check-in area containing 12 more check-in counters and eight security lanes each to avoid overcrowding of the main hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/pavillons-hauptstadtflughafen-ber/35849 |title=Pavillons am neuen Hauptstadtflughafen BER sind fertig |publisher=airliners.de |accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe airside area will be accessible only to ticketed and [[Airport security|screened]] passengers. [[Securitas (Swedish security company)|Securitas Germany]] will staff the 35 screening stations. BER is equipped with 25 [[jet bridge]]s with another 85 aircraft stands on the apron. The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier {{convert|715|m|ft|sigfig=3}} long and the north and south piers at {{convert|350|m|ft|sigfig=3}} each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges, all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for [[Schengen Area|Schengen passengers]] (gates A01\u2013A20, B01\u2013B20), while Level 2 (gates C01\u2013C19, D01\u2013D17) is for non-Schengen passengers.<ref name=presskit/>{{rp|8\u201310}}  Eight of the gates can accommodate [[wide-body aircraft]] and one gate has been designed to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]]. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21\u201322 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].

The issue is complicated by the fact that the line would have to cross the state border and it is unclear who would have to pay for which parts of construction operations and maintenance.

The road carries traffic into Berlin to the [[Bundesautobahn 100|A100]] and out to the [[Bundesautobahn 10|A10]] where it continues south as the [[Bundesautobahn 13|A13]] in the direction of Dresden. The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 96|highway 96a]] along the north side of the airport is being expanded to four lanes towards [[Potsdam]].\n\nFour car parks and a car rental centre will be completed by the opening of BER. Around 10,000 parking spaces will be available in four [[multi-storey car park]]s.\n\nA study released in September 2016 attested that BER will double the amount of vehicular traffic, causing frequent traffic jams on the [[Autobahn]] once the airport opens. The A100 and A113 do not have enough lanes to support the expected volume of traffic. The approach to BER was deemed insufficient for the expected traffic and will lead to heavy congestion on the highways throughout south-central Berlin. There are also concerns at increased accidents and air pollution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/neues-verkehrsgutachten-zum-hauptstadtflughafen-der-ber-koennte-die-stadtautobahn-lahmlegen/14535896.html |title=Der BER k\u00f6nnte die Stadtautobahn lahmlegen|trans-title=BER could cripple traffic on city highways |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref> The traffic volumes would also cause frequent closings of the Britz tunnel on the A100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/kolumne/wenn-der-flughafen-ber-oeffnet-dann-schliesst-der-tunnel-britz-2|title=Wenn der Flughafen BER \u00f6ffnet, dann schlie\u00dft der Tunnel Britz|trans-title=if BER opens tunnel Britz closes}}\n</ref>\n\nOver 10% of passengers are expected to come from [[Poland]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/verkehr/hauptstadtflughafen-landkreis-warnt-vor--verkehrsinfarkt--am-ber-29614178| title=Hauptstadtflughafen Landkreis warnt vor \"Verkehrsinfarkt\" am BER |accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> also thanks to upgraded highways on the Polish side of the border.

The X11 bus continues to [[Lichterfelde-West]] and to [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]].

A further ''Business Park North'' was proposed as a future use of the area of the old Sch\u00f6nefeld terminal. However, so far there are no definite plans for the future use of this area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Controversies==\nIn September 2010 [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] published aircraft arrival and departure paths for Berlin Brandenburg Airport which significantly differ from earlier ones used in the court decision for the construction permit. In the original maps, aircraft were expected to take off and land in a path parallel with the runway. The new plans saw flight paths that deviate from the runway direction by 15 degrees. Therefore, aircraft would now fly over areas in southern Berlin ([[Lichtenrade]], [[Steglitz]] and [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]]) and adjacent Brandenburg ([[Teltow]], [[Stahnsdorf]], [[Kleinmachnow]] and [[Potsdam]]) to the surprise of local residents. This prompted a wave of protests and a lawsuit that the courts rejected.<ref name=warner>{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-749894.html| work=Der Spiegel| title=Resistance Builds to Planned Flight Paths at New Berlin Airport| date=3 November 2011| first=Mary Beth| last=Warner}}</ref>\n\nBoth the expansion of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport into BER and the quality of the connection to the railway network are the subject of public debate. The ''B\u00fcrgerverein Brandenburg-Berlin e.V.'' represents local residents who protest an expansion of air traffic to and from the south of Berlin. Also, traffic and environmental experts criticise the late completion dates for the fast connection to the [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]. Still, Berlin Hauptbahnhof will be only a 30-minute journey with trains departing every 15 minutes upon inauguration. At the time of the originally planned opening date of BER, in 2011, this was expected to be reduced to 20 minutes after reconstruction of the Berlin section of the [[Berlin\u2013Dresden railway]], which was planned to be finished by 2020.<ref name=dresdnerbahn>{{cite news| title=Reisezeitverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr Airport-Express-Reisende| url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/reisezeitverlaengerungen-fuer-airport-express-reisende,10917074,10928694.html| work=Berliner Zeitung| date=26 August 2011| trans-title=Longer travel times for Airport Express travelers| language=German}}</ref> However, delays in both the BER construction and the construction of the railway meant that the travel time will be more than 50 minutes until at least 2025.

The beast is a rapacious, squat,  sex fiend which she uses to torture and molest female prisoners while the [[Nazi]]s watch. The [[Dwarfism|dwarf]]ish beast is kept on a diet of mega-[[aphrodisiac]]s.

The battle ended in a Dano-Norwegian defeat, and marked the end of the [[Kingdom of Denmark-Norway]]'s involvement in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. \n\n==Background==\n[[Denmark-Norway]]\u2019s attempt to remain neutral in the struggle between France and the United Kingdom and their respective allies early in the 19th century came to an end after the United Kingdom\u2019s pre-emptive naval actions of 1807, in which the entire Danish fleet was captured, the British operating under the possibility that [[Denmark-Norway]] was planning to join the [[Napoleonic Wars]] on the side of the French. The British imposed a [[blockade]] on supply lines between [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] in the [[Skagerrak]] sound, except for Norwegian ships transporting lumber bound for Britain.  The resulting blockade isolated Norway from both Denmark and from the market and economically impacted Norway. Most exports were stopped, as well as grain imports from Denmark. The blockade resulted in an economic crisis for [[Denmark-Norway]].\n\nThe Norwegians preferred to limit military operations to coastal defence. Nevertheless, what was left of the [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegian]] fleet after the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)]] fleet was committed to trying to break the blockade. After years of skirmishes, the Dano-Norwegian fleet was reduced to one major ship, the frigate ''[[HDMS Najaden (1811)|''Najaden'']]'', which they had finished construction in 1811 with material salvaged from a ship-of-the-line destroyed in earlier battles. ''Najaden'' was under the command of Danish naval officer Hans Peter Holm.<ref>[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Hans_Peter_Holm/utdypning ''Hans Peter Holm'' ( Steinar Sandvold. Store norske leksikon)]</ref> Three brigs \u2013 ''Kiel'' (under the command of Otto Frederick Rasch),<ref>Translated from the Danish website [http://runeberg.org/dbl/13/0489.html].</ref> ''Lolland'', and ''Sams\u00f8e'' \u2013 accompanied ''Najaden''.\n\nThe British saw an opportunity to end the blockade and finish what remained of Dano-Norwegian seapower. They therefore sent the 64-gun [[Third-rate|Third Rate]] ship-of-the-line {{HMS|Dictator|1783|2}} and three brigs, the 18-gun [[Cruizer class brig-sloop]] {{HMS|Calypso|1805|2}}, 14-gun [[brig-sloop]] {{HMS|Podargus|1808|2}} and the 14-gun brig ''Flamer'' to seek out the last remnants of the Dano-Norwegian fleet.\n\n==Battle plans==\n\nCaptain Steward's plan was to chase down ''Najaden'' and sink it, thereby giving Britain total control over the trade routes across the [[Skagerrak]] between Norway and Denmark, and effectively ending Danish involvement in the Napoleonic Wars. In a pitched battle, his ship-of-the-line would easily defeat the frigate. As a consequence, Steward, a Scotsman known in the Royal Navy as \"Mad Jim\", was looking for a naval confrontation.\n\nCaptain Holm's plan was to avoid engaging the British ships. He relied on his superior knowledge of the local waters to attempt to evade Steward's pursuit. The group of Dano-Norwegian naval forces based in Norway was utilizing a sheltered but weakly defended anchorage on the coast of Norway as a base of operations. If attacked by a superior naval force, the Dano-Norwegian warships would be trapped, cornered in a geographic death trap in the skerries from which there was no apparent escape, except through the one entrance, which was inadequately protected by Dano-Norwegian coastal batteries.\n<ref>[http://www.milhist.dk/soldaten/holm/holm.htm ''Hans Peter Holm, Captain of the Frigate Najaden at the Battle of Lyngor'' (Danish Military Historie)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306011137/http://www.milhist.dk/soldaten/holm/holm.htm |date=6 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Minnesmerke Lyng\u00f8rslaget (3).jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to the fallen in the battle.]]\n[[File:Kanonjolla 2005.JPG|thumb|right|Replica of the small rowed gunboats participating in the battle.]]\n''Najaden'' had anchored near the island of Sand\u00f8ya near [[Tvedestrand]], where the captain felt secure. His premise was that no British ship would risk running ashore in the unfamiliar and craggy archipelago. He accepted an invitation to dine with the captain of the''Sams\u00f8e'' and even went ashore on the island after his meal. From the hills above, he saw that the British ships were inside the archipelago and headed in his direction.\n\nRushing back to his ships, he ordered the ships along an inner route north-east, toward [[Lyng\u00f8r]]. ''Podargus'' was in the van of the British squadron, apparently with a pilot on board who was familiar with the waters. Still, she ran aground at Buskj\u00e6rsteinen and Steward ordered ''Flamer'' to stay behind and assist the stricken brig.<ref name=LG/> Several smaller Dano-Norwegian boats immediately attacked ''Podargus'' and ''Flamer''. Among them were Lieutenant Parnemann with the armed launch ''Ki\u00f8ge Bugt'' and gunboat No.3 under the command of Lieutenant Ring. Four additional gunboats from the Arendal Division, commanded by Captain-Lieutenant Dietrichson, subsequently reinforced them. Lastly, the battery at Digernes (on the seaward side of Bor\u00f8ya island, which is three miles southwest of Lyng\u00f8r), also fired on the two British brigs. Although ''Podargus'' and ''Flamer'' sustained damage, they were eventually able to rejoin ''Dictator'' after the main battle was over.<ref name=LG/>\n\n''Najaden'' went into the narrow sound of [[Lyng\u00f8r]] where she anchored between Holmen and Odden, detaching most of her supporting vessels to fight ''Podargus'' and ''Flamer''. Captain Holm assumed that the ''Dictator'' could not follow down the narrow sound, and assumed that the attack would come from smaller vessels and over Holmen, and set his broadside towards Holmen.<ref>Heidem, Knut. ''Slaget i Lyng\u00f8r 1812''. Bokbyen forlag. 2012</ref> However, Steward sailed into the sound, dropped an anchor behind him, and ran ashore with his broadside perpendicular to the sound.<ref name=LG>{{London Gazette|issue=16623|date=14 July 1812|pages=1361\u20131364}}</ref> Using his anchor line for leverage, he positioned ''Dictator'' to set its broadside against ''Najaden'' at a range of 35\u201340 meters. Unable to turn, ''Najaden'' had its broadside pointing away from the opposing ship and was dead in the water.\n\nAt about 9:30 pm, ''Dictator'' unleashed a 15-minute barrage against ''Najaden'' that amounted to some four tons of ordnance. The barrage broke her main mast almost immediately and caused a fire on the ship and the Danish brigs anchored nearby. Within 45 minutes, ''Najaden'' had sunk, having suffered 133 dead and 82 wounded. Captain Holm survived, only to drown in an accident a few months later.\n\nThe battle resumed as the Norwegian gunboats found their way into Lyng\u00f8r. At 2 a.m. on 7 July, ''Dictator'' pulled herself off and departed from the battlefield.<ref name=LG/>\n\nThe British captured ''Laaland'' and ''Kiel'' as prizes but abandoned them after the two vessels grounded. The British did not set fire to either as they still had their crews and wounded aboard.<ref name=LG/>\n\nThe action cost ''Dictator'' five killed and 24 wounded, ''Calypso'' three killed, one wounded and two missing, and ''Flamer'' one killed and one wounded.<ref name=LG/> Overall, the Danes recorded their losses as 300 men killed or wounded. Commander Weir of ''Calypso'' was immediately, and Commander Robilliard of ''Podargus'' in the ensuing December, promoted to [[post-captain]]; ''Dictator''{{'}}s first lieutenant, William Buchanan, was made a commander. In 1847 the surviving British participants were authorized to apply for the clasp \"Off Mardoe 6 July 1812\" to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=20939|page=244|date=26 Jan 1849}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nThe Battle of Lyng\u00f8r effectively ended Denmark's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars. In the [[Treaty of Kiel]], Denmark ceded dominion over [[Norway]], setting the stage for Norway's independence movement, which finally achieved its aims in 1905. The battle also freed up British naval resources to continue fighting the French navy in the Napoleonic Wars. \n\n==Bicentenial==\nFor the 200th anniversary of the battle in 2012, a replica gunboat named ''\u00d8ster Riis\u00f8er III'' was constructed.<ref>\nPer Lunden: [http://www.aaks.no/FullStory.aspx?m=283 Kanonjolla - et viktig stykke kysthistorie] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922065509/http://www.aaks.no/FullStory.aspx?m=283 |date=22 September 2011 }} Aust-Agder kulturhistoriske senter, retrieved 16 December 2012</ref> A cannon, possibly from ''Najaden'', was recovered from the harbour in 1995.<ref>Hans Petter Madsen: [http://www.maritimt.net/kanoner/artikler/kanonen_fra_lyngor.pdf Kanonen fra Lyng\u00f8r havn] Maritimt.net,  retrieved 16 December 2012</ref><br>\nThe battle is commemorated by a play in Lyng\u00f8r each year, and the wreck is a popular site for diving.<ref>[https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/southern-norway/arendal/lyngoer/ Lyng\u00f8r website]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050204151952/http://www.cronab.demon.co.uk/D1.HTM Sailing ships of the Royal Navy]\n* {{in lang|da}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20041229065525/http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~oddharry/dsfmc/etext/najaden.html Report of Captain Hans Peter Holm]\n* [https://www.lyngor.heime.net/history/Najaden.jpg Model of Najaden] and picture labelled [https://www.lyngor.heime.net/history/dictator.jpg Dictator] from [https://www.lyngor.heime.net/history/ Lyng\u00f8r history] website\n{{coord|58|38|N|9|08|E|region:NO_type:city|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battle of Lyngor}}\n[[Category:Tvedestrand]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Gunboat War|Lyngor]]\n[[Category:1812 in Norway]]\n[[Category:1812 in Denmark]]\n[[Category:July 1812 events]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1812]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Battle of Lyng\u00f8r\n| image       = Battle of Lyng\u00f8r.jpg\n| image_size  = 300\n| caption     = Artist's rendition of the Battle of Lyng\u00f8r\n| partof      = the [[Gunboat War]]\n| date        = 6 July 1812\n| place       = [[Lyng\u00f8r]]\n| result      = British victory\n* Effective end of Danish involvement in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\n| combatant1  = {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]\n| combatant2  = {{flagicon|Denmark}} [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]\n| commander1  = {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} James Steward\n| commander2  = {{flagicon|Denmark}} [[Hans Peter Holm (1772 - 1812)|Hans Holm]]\n| strength1   = 1 [[ship of the line]] <br />3 [[brig]]s\n| strength2   = 1 [[frigate]] <br />3 [[brig]]s\n| casualties1 = 9 killed <br /> 26 wounded <br /> 2 missing\n| casualties2 = 1 frigate sunk <br />133 killed <br />88 wounded\n| campaignbox =\n{{Campaignbox English Wars}}\n{{Campaignbox Gunboat War}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Lyng\u00f8r''' was a naval action fought between Denmark-Norway and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1812 on the southern coast of Norway.

If attacked by a superior naval force, the Dano-Norwegian warships would be trapped, cornered in a geographic death trap in the skerries from which there was no apparent escape, except through the one entrance, which was inadequately protected by Dano-Norwegian coastal batteries.\n<ref>[http://www.milhist.dk/soldaten/holm/holm.htm ''Hans Peter Holm, Captain of the Frigate Najaden at the Battle of Lyngor'' (Danish Military Historie)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306011137/http://www.milhist.dk/soldaten/holm/holm.htm |date=6 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Minnesmerke Lyng\u00f8rslaget (3).jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to the fallen in the battle.]]\n[[File:Kanonjolla 2005.JPG|thumb|right|Replica of the small rowed gunboats participating in the battle.]]\n''Najaden'' had anchored near the island of Sand\u00f8ya near [[Tvedestrand]], where the captain felt secure. His premise was that no British ship would risk running ashore in the unfamiliar and craggy archipelago. He accepted an invitation to dine with the captain of the''Sams\u00f8e'' and even went ashore on the island after his meal. From the hills above, he saw that the British ships were inside the archipelago and headed in his direction.\n\nRushing back to his ships, he ordered the ships along an inner route north-east, toward [[Lyng\u00f8r]]. ''Podargus'' was in the van of the British squadron, apparently with a pilot on board who was familiar with the waters. Still, she ran aground at Buskj\u00e6rsteinen and Steward ordered ''Flamer'' to stay behind and assist the stricken brig.<ref name=LG/> Several smaller Dano-Norwegian boats immediately attacked ''Podargus'' and ''Flamer''. Among them were Lieutenant Parnemann with the armed launch ''Ki\u00f8ge Bugt'' and gunboat No.3 under the command of Lieutenant Ring. Four additional gunboats from the Arendal Division, commanded by Captain-Lieutenant Dietrichson, subsequently reinforced them. Lastly, the battery at Digernes (on the seaward side of Bor\u00f8ya island, which is three miles southwest of Lyng\u00f8r), also fired on the two British brigs. Although ''Podargus'' and ''Flamer'' sustained damage, they were eventually able to rejoin ''Dictator'' after the main battle was over.<ref name=LG/>\n\n''Najaden'' went into the narrow sound of [[Lyng\u00f8r]] where she anchored between Holmen and Odden, detaching most of her supporting vessels to fight ''Podargus'' and ''Flamer''. Captain Holm assumed that the ''Dictator'' could not follow down the narrow sound, and assumed that the attack would come from smaller vessels and over Holmen, and set his broadside towards Holmen.<ref>Heidem, Knut. ''Slaget i Lyng\u00f8r 1812''. Bokbyen forlag. 2012</ref> However, Steward sailed into the sound, dropped an anchor behind him, and ran ashore with his broadside perpendicular to the sound.<ref name=LG>{{London Gazette|issue=16623|date=14 July 1812|pages=1361\u20131364}}</ref> Using his anchor line for leverage, he positioned ''Dictator'' to set its broadside against ''Najaden'' at a range of 35\u201340 meters. Unable to turn, ''Najaden'' had its broadside pointing away from the opposing ship and was dead in the water.\n\nAt about 9:30 pm, ''Dictator'' unleashed a 15-minute barrage against ''Najaden'' that amounted to some four tons of ordnance. The barrage broke her main mast almost immediately and caused a fire on the ship and the Danish brigs anchored nearby. Within 45 minutes, ''Najaden'' had sunk, having suffered 133 dead and 82 wounded. Captain Holm survived, only to drown in an accident a few months later.\n\nThe battle resumed as the Norwegian gunboats found their way into Lyng\u00f8r. At 2 a.m. on 7 July, ''Dictator'' pulled herself off and departed from the battlefield.<ref name=LG/>\n\nThe British captured ''Laaland'' and ''Kiel'' as prizes but abandoned them after the two vessels grounded. The British did not set fire to either as they still had their crews and wounded aboard.<ref name=LG/>\n\nThe action cost ''Dictator'' five killed and 24 wounded, ''Calypso'' three killed, one wounded and two missing, and ''Flamer'' one killed and one wounded.<ref name=LG/> Overall, the Danes recorded their losses as 300 men killed or wounded. Commander Weir of ''Calypso'' was immediately, and Commander Robilliard of ''Podargus'' in the ensuing December, promoted to [[post-captain]]; ''Dictator''{{'}}s first lieutenant, William Buchanan, was made a commander. In 1847 the surviving British participants were authorized to apply for the clasp \"Off Mardoe 6 July 1812\" to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=20939|page=244|date=26 Jan 1849}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nThe Battle of Lyng\u00f8r effectively ended Denmark's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars. In the [[Treaty of Kiel]], Denmark ceded dominion over [[Norway]], setting the stage for Norway's independence movement, which finally achieved its aims in 1905. The battle also freed up British naval resources to continue fighting the French navy in the Napoleonic Wars. \n\n==Bicentenial==\nFor the 200th anniversary of the battle in 2012, a replica gunboat named ''\u00d8ster Riis\u00f8er III'' was constructed.<ref>\nPer Lunden: [http://www.aaks.no/FullStory.aspx?m=283 Kanonjolla - et viktig stykke kysthistorie] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922065509/http://www.aaks.no/FullStory.aspx?m=283 |date=22 September 2011 }} Aust-Agder kulturhistoriske senter, retrieved 16 December 2012</ref> A cannon, possibly from ''Najaden'', was recovered from the harbour in 1995.<ref>Hans Petter Madsen: [http://www.maritimt.net/kanoner/artikler/kanonen_fra_lyngor.pdf Kanonen fra Lyng\u00f8r havn] Maritimt.net,  retrieved 16 December 2012</ref><br>\nThe battle is commemorated by a play in Lyng\u00f8r each year, and the wreck is a popular site for diving.<ref>[https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/southern-norway/arendal/lyngoer/ Lyng\u00f8r website]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050204151952/http://www.cronab.demon.co.uk/D1.HTM Sailing ships of the Royal Navy]\n* {{in lang|da}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20041229065525/http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~oddharry/dsfmc/etext/najaden.html Report of Captain Hans Peter Holm]\n* [https://www.lyngor.heime.net/history/Najaden.jpg Model of Najaden] and picture labelled [https://www.lyngor.heime.net/history/dictator.jpg Dictator] from [https://www.lyngor.heime.net/history/ Lyng\u00f8r history] website\n{{coord|58|38|N|9|08|E|region:NO_type:city|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battle of Lyngor}}\n[[Category:Tvedestrand]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Gunboat War|Lyngor]]\n[[Category:1812 in Norway]]\n[[Category:1812 in Denmark]]\n[[Category:July 1812 events]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1812]]\n", "name_user": "Snagemit", "label": "safe", "comment": "Infobox changes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lyng%C3%B8r"}

In some sectors, the seats and backrests are upholstered with or without arms. The chairs are composed of three shades of green, giving rise to a geometric design inspired by [[arecaceae]] leaves.\n\nThe changing rooms have similar dimensions: a 355&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> room to the home team, and a 270&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> to the visiting team. The biggest has wooden cabinet with identification of athletes and a \"community\" cabinet to hold large numbers of objects.

The new building has about 10&nbsp;thousand square meters, spread over 4 floors and is served by three elevators. Downstairs, there is a gymnasium with seating for approximately 1,500 fans built to host [[basketball]], [[futsal]] and [[volleyball]] games. Two intermediate floors with about 2&nbsp;thousand square meters each other were designed to receive multisport activities. On the rooftop, there is a synthetic grass pitch for football practice, with an area of almost 2,000 meters to over 48 meters high. An unprecedented architectural solution in Brazil allows the visitors to enjoy the outside scenery, good ventilation and lots of natural light.\n\nThere is also a Multipurpose Building, designed based on the architectural concept developed by [[architect]] [[Tom\u00e1s Taveira]]. It has approximately 13&nbsp;thousand m<sup>2</sup>, spread over 6 floors plus ground floor. The building offers 8 changing rooms, 12 toilets and 6 elevators. The building facilities are for the use of club management, besides the indoor sports like [[judo]] and [[gymnastics]]; there is even a noble space on the top floor, which offers panoramic views of the club and the region.\n\nThe attractions of Allianz Parque are open to the general public.

The models feature white LED structure and shun conventional standards, with a resolution (16&nbsp;mm) 20% higher compared to others. Thus, in all the seats of the stadium there is a good view of the images.\n\nA solution developed by architect Edo Rocha, responsible for the arena project, was to coat the entire facade with drilled [[stainless steel]] that causes an [[Op art|optical art]] effect,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steelsul.com.br/allianz-parque-o-mais-moderno-estadio-do-pais-tem-280-toneladas-de-inox-em-sua-fachada/ |title=Allianz Parque, o mais moderno est\u00e1dio do pa\u00eds, tem 280 toneladas de inox em sua fachada |publisher=SteelSul.com.br |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> with hollow spaces that resemble a [[wicker]] basket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galeriadaarquitetura.com.br/projeto/edo-rocha-arquiteturas_/allianz-parque/395 |title=Allianz Parque - Esporte |publisher=Galeriadaarquitetura.com.br |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The use of stainless steel ensures the best use of natural ventilation and lighting, in addition to functioning as a passive solar control element in order to moderate the temperature in the environment. The material is highly durable, low maintenance and cleaning, because it is washed in the rain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hunterdouglas.com.br/ap/br/enews/controle-solar/elementos-de-protecao-solar/7f-stripweave/hunter-douglas-e-allianz-parque |title=Hunter Douglas e Allianz Parque |publisher=Hunterdouglas.com.br |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128112523/http://www.hunterdouglas.com.br/ap/br/enews/controle-solar/elementos-de-protecao-solar/7f-stripweave/hunter-douglas-e-allianz-parque |archive-date=January 28, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Furthermore, the use of that material aims to make outdoor advertising and serves to impact both visitors and [[pedestrian]]s.\n\n[[File:Allianz Parque - Placas de A\u00e7o Inox.JPG|thumb|240px|left|Facade coated with drilled stainless steel]]\nThe arena roof is fully integrated into the facade, i.e., without the pillars, increasing the space for visitors. There are 33 meters vertically between the floor and the ceiling of the stadium, which protects 100% of the bleachers. Developed by [[Usiminas]], a tubular metal frame and zipped thermo tiles provide the most pleasant sensations to the public, reducing the temperature by 2&nbsp;\u00b0C between the level of the field and the upper seats and also the outside noises of the streets.\n\nAround the playing field was installed a transparent polycarbonate cover to allow the maximum amount of sunlight to reach the ground. The [[Aviva Stadium]] in [[Dublin]], and the [[City of Manchester Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] in [[Manchester]] are some of the few in the world that use this technology.\n\nRegarding environmental issues, the Allianz Parque has a system to capture rainwater that falls on the roof of the stadium, which has 23&nbsp;thousand square meters. Thus, the collected water can be reused in different sectors of the arena, preventing stormwater is overloaded.\n\n== Accessibility ==\nAccording to the builder, in the arena there are 889 spaces for wheelchair users, 778 seats for the handicapped, 122 seats for obese, 63 accessible bathrooms distributed in all sectors: lower and upper stands and cabins. Furthermore, there are 15 elevators, 26 escalators, ramps and special box office. In the parking lot, there are forty-nine vacancies for people with special needs (PSN) located near to the elevators and 78 places for the elderly. Thus, the adjustments exceed the recommendations of the Brazilian standard and also FIFA.\n\nIn June 2017, the arena was the first in Brazil to be qualified by its architectural accessibility, receiving the \"Selo guiaderodas\" award, which evaluates premises and services for people with mobility issues. The qualification was based in analyses by specialized architects, practical tests by people with mobility issues and capacitation training for the staff of the stadium and the club.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://espn.uol.com.br/noticia/704904_allianz-parque-recebe-certificado-por-acessibilidade|title=Allianz Parque recebe certificado por acessibilidade|work=ESPN|access-date=2017-06-28|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/palmeiras/noticia/arena-do-palmeiras-recebe-selo-de-qualificacao-por-acessibilidade.ghtml|title=Arena do Palmeiras recebe selo de qualifica\u00e7\u00e3o por acessibilidade|work=Globoesporte|access-date=2017-06-28|language=pt-BR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://guiaderodas.com/allianz-parque-conquista-qualificacao/|title=Allianz Parque conquista Qualifica\u00e7\u00e3o guiaderodas - guiaderodas|date=2017-06-23|work=guiaderodas|access-date=2017-06-28|language=pt-BR}}</ref>\n\n== Visibility ==\n[[File:SEPvsCAP Allianz Parque 2014.jpg|thumb|240px|Allianz Parque in December 2014]]\nThe Allianz Parque has received much praise from the world's media, such as the Spanish site Elgoldigital.com, which considered it the most spectacular arena in the world,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.elgoldigital.com/1-allianz-parque-palmeiras-2/ |title=1-Allianz Parque, Palmeiras |publisher=Elfoldigital.com |date=December 14, 2014 |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> and the site Goal.com by Italian version, which defined it as the new contemporary architectural jewel of S\u00e3o Paulo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/it/news/2/serie-a/2014/06/10/4872443/supercoppa-italiana-fra-juventus-e-napoli-prende-quota |title=Supercoppa, San Paolo ipotesi concreta |language=it|publisher=Goal.com |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn February 19, 2015, the Allianz Parque was named by popular vote the Stadium of The Year 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadiumdb.com/news/2015/02/stadium_of_the_year_public_vote_winner_allianz_parque |title=Stadium of The Year Public Vote: Winner \u2013 Allianz Parque! \u2013 |publisher=Stadiumdb.com |date=February 19, 2015 |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The leading competition was organized by Stadiony.net and StadiumDB.com, two websites dedicated to sports stadia.

Multiple events such as shows and concerts, can receive up to 55,000 spectators.\n\nAiming to facilitate the goers movement, as well as cleaning the bleachers, chairs are not fixed to the floor, but on metal rails, the same model used in [[Wembley Stadium]]. In some sectors, the seats and backrests are upholstered with or without arms. The chairs are composed of three shades of green, giving rise to a geometric design inspired by [[arecaceae]] leaves.\n\nThe changing rooms have similar dimensions: a 355&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> room to the home team, and a 270&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> to the visiting team. The biggest has wooden cabinet with identification of athletes and a \"community\" cabinet to hold large numbers of objects.

The new building has about 10&nbsp;thousand square meters, spread over 4 floors and is served by three elevators. Downstairs, there is a gymnasium with seating for approximately 1,500 fans built to host [[basketball]], [[futsal]] and [[volleyball]] games. Two intermediate floors with about 2&nbsp;thousand square meters each other were designed to receive multisport activities. On the rooftop, there is a synthetic grass pitch for football practice, with an area of almost 2,000 meters to over 48 meters high. An unprecedented architectural solution in Brazil allows the visitors to enjoy the outside scenery, good ventilation and lots of natural light.\n\nThere is also a Multipurpose Building, designed based on the architectural concept developed by [[architect]] [[Tom\u00e1s Taveira]]. It has approximately 13&nbsp;thousand m<sup>2</sup>, spread over 6 floors plus ground floor. The building offers 8 changing rooms, 12 toilets and 6 elevators. The building facilities are for the use of club management, besides the indoor sports like [[judo]] and [[gymnastics]]; there is even a noble space on the top floor, which offers panoramic views of the club and the region.\n\nThe attractions of Allianz Parque are open to the general public. Access to club facilities, however, remains restricted to members of the Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras.\n\n== Implementations ==\n[[File:Allianz Parque - Detalhe da Cobertura.JPG|thumb|240px|Allianz Parque coverage details, November 2014]]\nOn March 12, 2013, WTorre announced the acquisition of 64 high definition security cameras. The equipment, valued at R$15&nbsp;million, is capable of performing face recognition of all visitors. The technology, which is used in high-traffic venues, such as airports in [[Europe]] and [[United States|USA]], is able to immediately identify non-standard behaviors, i.e., fights and vandalism acts. The security software can archive images of faces to compare them later, even people using caps and goggles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/ultimas-noticias/2013/03/12/empresa-gasta-r-15-milhoes-em-cameras-de-seguranca-para-arena-palestra.htm?abrefoto=17#fotoNavId=pr12520661 |title=Empresa gasta R$ 15 milh\u00f5es em c\u00e2meras de seguran\u00e7a para Arena Palestra |publisher=Esporte.uol.com.br |date=March 12, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2014, the WTorre announced the acquisition of two high-definition video screens to be installed inside the stadium. With costs estimated at R$7&nbsp;million, the equipment has a {{convert|13.44|x|7.68|m|ft|abbr=on}} format, each with more than {{convert|103|m2}} area. The screens are installed at the ends of lawns, behind the goals, enabling the display of any content without the need for adaptation. The models feature white LED structure and shun conventional standards, with a resolution (16&nbsp;mm) 20% higher compared to others. Thus, in all the seats of the stadium there is a good view of the images.\n\nA solution developed by architect Edo Rocha, responsible for the arena project, was to coat the entire facade with drilled [[stainless steel]] that causes an [[Op art|optical art]] effect,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steelsul.com.br/allianz-parque-o-mais-moderno-estadio-do-pais-tem-280-toneladas-de-inox-em-sua-fachada/ |title=Allianz Parque, o mais moderno est\u00e1dio do pa\u00eds, tem 280 toneladas de inox em sua fachada |publisher=SteelSul.com.br |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> with hollow spaces that resemble a [[wicker]] basket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galeriadaarquitetura.com.br/projeto/edo-rocha-arquiteturas_/allianz-parque/395 |title=Allianz Parque - Esporte |publisher=Galeriadaarquitetura.com.br |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The use of stainless steel ensures the best use of natural ventilation and lighting, in addition to functioning as a passive solar control element in order to moderate the temperature in the environment. The material is highly durable, low maintenance and cleaning, because it is washed in the rain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hunterdouglas.com.br/ap/br/enews/controle-solar/elementos-de-protecao-solar/7f-stripweave/hunter-douglas-e-allianz-parque |title=Hunter Douglas e Allianz Parque |publisher=Hunterdouglas.com.br |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128112523/http://www.hunterdouglas.com.br/ap/br/enews/controle-solar/elementos-de-protecao-solar/7f-stripweave/hunter-douglas-e-allianz-parque |archive-date=January 28, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Furthermore, the use of that material aims to make outdoor advertising and serves to impact both visitors and [[pedestrian]]s.\n\n[[File:Allianz Parque - Placas de A\u00e7o Inox.JPG|thumb|240px|left|Facade coated with drilled stainless steel]]\nThe arena roof is fully integrated into the facade, i.e., without the pillars, increasing the space for visitors. There are 33 meters vertically between the floor and the ceiling of the stadium, which protects 100% of the bleachers. Developed by [[Usiminas]], a tubular metal frame and zipped thermo tiles provide the most pleasant sensations to the public, reducing the temperature by 2&nbsp;\u00b0C between the level of the field and the upper seats and also the outside noises of the streets.\n\nAround the playing field was installed a transparent polycarbonate cover to allow the maximum amount of sunlight to reach the ground. The [[Aviva Stadium]] in [[Dublin]], and the [[City of Manchester Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] in [[Manchester]] are some of the few in the world that use this technology.\n\nRegarding environmental issues, the Allianz Parque has a system to capture rainwater that falls on the roof of the stadium, which has 23&nbsp;thousand square meters. Thus, the collected water can be reused in different sectors of the arena, preventing stormwater is overloaded.\n\n== Accessibility ==\nAccording to the builder, in the arena there are 889 spaces for wheelchair users, 778 seats for the handicapped, 122 seats for obese, 63 accessible bathrooms distributed in all sectors: lower and upper stands and cabins. Furthermore, there are 15 elevators, 26 escalators, ramps and special box office. In the parking lot, there are forty-nine vacancies for people with special needs (PSN) located near to the elevators and 78 places for the elderly. Thus, the adjustments exceed the recommendations of the Brazilian standard and also FIFA.\n\nIn June 2017, the arena was the first in Brazil to be qualified by its architectural accessibility, receiving the \"Selo guiaderodas\" award, which evaluates premises and services for people with mobility issues. The qualification was based in analyses by specialized architects, practical tests by people with mobility issues and capacitation training for the staff of the stadium and the club.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://espn.uol.com.br/noticia/704904_allianz-parque-recebe-certificado-por-acessibilidade|title=Allianz Parque recebe certificado por acessibilidade|work=ESPN|access-date=2017-06-28|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/palmeiras/noticia/arena-do-palmeiras-recebe-selo-de-qualificacao-por-acessibilidade.ghtml|title=Arena do Palmeiras recebe selo de qualifica\u00e7\u00e3o por acessibilidade|work=Globoesporte|access-date=2017-06-28|language=pt-BR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://guiaderodas.com/allianz-parque-conquista-qualificacao/|title=Allianz Parque conquista Qualifica\u00e7\u00e3o guiaderodas - guiaderodas|date=2017-06-23|work=guiaderodas|access-date=2017-06-28|language=pt-BR}}</ref>\n\n== Visibility ==\n[[File:SEPvsCAP Allianz Parque 2014.jpg|thumb|240px|Allianz Parque in December 2014]]\nThe Allianz Parque has received much praise from the world's media, such as the Spanish site Elgoldigital.com, which considered it the most spectacular arena in the world,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.elgoldigital.com/1-allianz-parque-palmeiras-2/ |title=1-Allianz Parque, Palmeiras |publisher=Elfoldigital.com |date=December 14, 2014 |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> and the site Goal.com by Italian version, which defined it as the new contemporary architectural jewel of S\u00e3o Paulo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/it/news/2/serie-a/2014/06/10/4872443/supercoppa-italiana-fra-juventus-e-napoli-prende-quota |title=Supercoppa, San Paolo ipotesi concreta |language=it|publisher=Goal.com |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn February 19, 2015, the Allianz Parque was named by popular vote the Stadium of The Year 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadiumdb.com/news/2015/02/stadium_of_the_year_public_vote_winner_allianz_parque |title=Stadium of The Year Public Vote: Winner \u2013 Allianz Parque! \u2013 |publisher=Stadiumdb.com |date=February 19, 2015 |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The leading competition was organized by Stadiony.net and StadiumDB.com, two websites dedicated to sports stadia.

However, there is no discussion as to the amounts to be collected from the box office, which are 100% of the club, but today the marketing impasse to sell the seats is still being discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lancenet.com.br/palmeiras/Discussao-Palmeiras-WTorre-arbitragem_0_1088291294.html |title=Discuss\u00e3o entre Palmeiras e WTorre vai para a arbitragem |publisher=lancenet.com.br |date=February 20, 2014 |accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Est\u00e1dio Palestra It\u00e1lia|Palestra It\u00e1lia Stadium]]\n* [[Pacaembu Stadium]]\n* [[Est\u00e1dio do Morumbi|Morumbi Stadium]]\n* [[Est\u00e1dio do Canind\u00e9|Canind\u00e9 Stadium]]\n* [[Arena Corinthians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal box|Brazil|Association football|Architecture}}\n* {{Commonscat-inline|Allianz Parque}}\n* [http://www.palmeiras.com.br Palmeiras' official website]\n* [http://www.allianzparque.com.br/ Allianz Parque official website]\n* [http://www.wtorre.com.br/Projetos/allianz-parque/242?lang=en-US Allianz Parque project informations at WTorre official website]\n* [https://www.allianz.com/en/about_us/sports-culture/stadiums/ International sports arenas sponsored by Allianz]\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras}}\n{{Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A venues}}\n{{Campeonato Paulista venues}}\n{{Visitor attractions in S\u00e3o Paulo}}\n\n[[Category:Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras]]\n[[Category:Football venues in S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 2014]]\n", "name_user": "Anomalocaris", "label": "safe", "comment": "properly close table (|})", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Parque"}
{"title_page": "Area (LDS Church)", "text_new": "In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), an '''area''' is an administrative unit which typically is composed of multiple [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]] and [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]]. These areas are the primary church administrative unit between individual stakes or missions and the church as a whole.\n\n==History==\nThe areas as they now exist were formed in January 1984.<ref>[[James B. Allen (historian)|Allen, James B.]] and [[Glen M. Leonard]]. ''[[The Story of the Latter-day Saints]]'' 2nd Edition, p. 654.</ref> Prior to that time, [[general authorities]] served as \"area supervisors\" and at times resided outside of [[Salt Lake City]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Mehr | first = Kahlile | title = Area Supervision: Administration of the Worldwide Church, 1960-2002 | journal = [[Journal of Mormon History]] | date = Spring 2001 | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 192\u2013214 | url = http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/jmh,17512}}</ref> In 1984, 13 initial areas were created; by 1992 there were 22, and by early 2007 there were 31. As of August 2019 there are 21 areas.\n\n===Future area division===\nOn June 28, 2019, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] announced a future area division which will go into effect in August 2020, when the nations comprising the current Africa Southeast Area will be split between the new Africa Central Area and the renamed Africa South Area.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.co.za/article/africa-southeast-area-to-be-divided-into-two-areas Africa Southeast Area to be Divided into Two Areas], ''South African Newsroom'', 28 June 2019. Retrieved 30 July 2019.</ref>  \n\nOn August 19, 2019, while on assignment in the Africa Southeast Area, W. Christopher Waddell, Second Counselor in the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]], announced that the headquarters for the new Africa Central Area will be based in Nairobi Kenya, and identified by name the nations that will constitute the new area in August 2020.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.co.za/article/africa-central-area-office-to-be-in-nairobi--kenya Africa Central Area Office to be in Nairobi Kenya], ''South African Newsroom'', 19 August 2019. Retrieved 19 August 2019.</ref> As a result of the planned area division, effective August 2020, there will be 22 geographical areas of the church.\n\n==Administration==\nUntil 2003, each area had a president and two counselors, all of whom were typically [[general authorities]] ([[area seventy|area seventies]] were sometimes asked to be counselors). This three-man body was known as the ''area presidency''.  In that year, the church eliminated area presidencies for areas located in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], which were all then placed under the direct supervision of one of the members of the [[Seventy (LDS Church)#Presidency of the Seventy|Presidency of the Seventy]], thus freeing more general authorities from specific area assignments. Since these areas were previously administered by area presidencies located at church headquarters in [[Salt Lake City]], the administrative change was not as drastic as it might seem.\n\nIn April 2018, the church announced that, effective August 1, areas in the United States and Canada would once again be supervised by a three-man presidency.  This will enable members of the Presidency of the Seventy to more fully assist the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in their duties, and to fill other assignments as needed.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/2018-area-presidency-assignments First Presidency Announces 2018 Area Leadership Assignments], ''Mormon Newsroom'', 5 April 2018. Retrieved 8 April 2018.</ref> \n\nRoughly one year later, in 2019, church leaders clarified that the 10 North American areas would be merged into 6 (with the Idaho and North America Central areas being consolidated into the North America Central, the North America Northwest, and North America West areas being consolidated into the North America West Area, and the Utah North, Utah Salt Lake City, and Utah South areas being consolidated into a single Utah Area.<ref name=\"Aug 2019 changes\" >[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/first-presidency-announces-2019-area-leadership-assignments?lang=eng&_r=1 First Presidency Announces 2019 Area Leadership Assignments], churchofjesuschrist.org, 26 April 2019. Retrieved 5 May 2019.</ref> \n\nAlso unique to the 2019 assignments was a change in the administration of the Middle East/Africa North Area. In prior years, two General Authority Seventies were assigned oversight for that area, which was administered from headquarters. However, beginning in August 2019, a three-man area presidency will serve the needs of that area. While the president and first counselor are General Authority Seventies who will continue their oversight from headquarters, the second counselor, an area seventy who lives and works within the boundaries of the area, will continue to do so and serve as a member of the area presidency. \n\nThe areas outside the United States and Canada continue to be governed by area presidencies that are typically composed of general authorities and area seventies. Rather than living in Salt Lake City, the area presidency members in these areas usually reside in a headquarters city that is located within the geographic boundaries of the area. Area seventies who serve in the area presidencies reside in their own homes, which may or may not be in the area headquarters city. \n\nThe church now has 15 areas outside North America and 6 areas inside North America for a total of 21. Area presidency assignments are generally filled by General Authority Seventies or area seventies.<ref>Although area seventies may serve in an area presidency.  In limited cases in the past, area seventies have comprised the whole presidency, but in recent years only a few area seventies have served in an area presidency. As of August 2019, the church has two area seventies serving in area presidencies: the Second Counselors in the Europe East and Middle East/Africa North Areas.</ref>Area assignments are typically announced in the spring each year, with changes effective that year on August 1.<ref>For several years, the assignments were effective on August 15, but August 1 has been the effective date since 2007.</ref>\n\n==List==\nThe following is an alphabetical list of the areas of the church and related leadership assignments as of 1 August 2019.<ref name=\"Aug 2019 changes\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n!

typically is composed of multiple [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]] and [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]]. These areas are the primary church administrative unit between individual stakes or missions and the church as a whole.\n\n==History==\nThe areas as they now exist were formed in January 1984.<ref>[[James B. Allen (historian)|Allen, James B.]] and [[Glen M. Leonard]].

As of August 2019 there are 21 areas.\n\n===Future area division===\nOn June 28, 2019, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] announced a future area division which will go into effect in August 2020, when the nations comprising the current Africa Southeast Area will be split between the new Africa Central Area and the renamed Africa South Area.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.co.za/article/africa-southeast-area-to-be-divided-into-two-areas Africa Southeast Area to be Divided into Two Areas], ''South African Newsroom'', 28 June 2019. Retrieved 30 July 2019.</ref>  \n\nOn August 19, 2019, while on assignment in the Africa Southeast Area, W. Christopher Waddell, Second Counselor in the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]], announced that the headquarters for the new Africa Central Area will be based in Nairobi Kenya, and identified by name the nations that will constitute the new area in August 2020.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.co.za/article/africa-central-area-office-to-be-in-nairobi--kenya Africa Central Area Office to be in Nairobi Kenya], ''South African Newsroom'', 19 August 2019. Retrieved 19 August 2019.</ref> As a result of the planned area division, effective August 2020, there will be 22 geographical areas of the church.\n\n==Administration==\nUntil 2003, each area had a president and two counselors, all of whom were typically [[general authorities]] ([[area seventy|area seventies]] were sometimes asked to be counselors). This three-man body was known as the ''area presidency''.  In that year, the church eliminated area presidencies for areas located in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], which were all then placed under the direct supervision of one of the members of the [[Seventy (LDS Church)#Presidency of the Seventy|Presidency of the Seventy]], thus freeing more general authorities from specific area assignments. Since these areas were previously administered by area presidencies located at church headquarters in [[Salt Lake City]], the administrative change was not as drastic as it might seem.\n\nIn April 2018, the church announced that, effective August 1, areas in the United States and Canada would once again be supervised by a three-man presidency.  This will enable members of the Presidency of the Seventy to more fully assist the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in their duties, and to fill other assignments as needed.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/2018-area-presidency-assignments First Presidency Announces 2018 Area Leadership Assignments], ''Mormon Newsroom'', 5 April 2018. Retrieved 8 April 2018.</ref> \n\nRoughly one year later, in 2019, church leaders clarified that the 10 North American areas would be merged into 6 (with the Idaho and North America Central areas being consolidated into the North America Central, the North America Northwest, and North America West areas being consolidated into the North America West Area, and the Utah North, Utah Salt Lake City, and Utah South areas being consolidated into a single Utah Area.<ref name=\"Aug 2019 changes\" >[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/first-presidency-announces-2019-area-leadership-assignments?lang=eng&_r=1 First Presidency Announces 2019 Area Leadership Assignments], churchofjesuschrist.org, 26 April 2019. Retrieved 5 May 2019.</ref> \n\nAlso unique to the 2019 assignments was a change in the administration of the Middle East/Africa North Area. In prior years, two General Authority Seventies were assigned oversight for that area, which was administered from headquarters. However, beginning in August 2019, a three-man area presidency will serve the needs of that area. While the president and first counselor are General Authority Seventies who will continue their oversight from headquarters, the second counselor, an area seventy who lives and works within the boundaries of the area, will continue to do so and serve as a member of the area presidency. \n\nThe areas outside the United States and Canada continue to be governed by area presidencies that are typically composed of general authorities and area seventies. Rather than living in Salt Lake City, the area presidency members in these areas usually reside in a headquarters city that is located within the geographic boundaries of the area. Area seventies who serve in the area presidencies reside in their own homes, which may or may not be in the area headquarters city. \n\nThe church now has 15 areas outside North America and 6 areas inside North America for a total of 21. Area presidency assignments are generally filled by General Authority Seventies or area seventies.<ref>Although area seventies may serve in an area presidency.  In limited cases in the past, area seventies have comprised the whole presidency, but in recent years only a few area seventies have served in an area presidency. As of August 2019, the church has two area seventies serving in area presidencies: the Second Counselors in the Europe East and Middle East/Africa North Areas.</ref>Area assignments are typically announced in the spring each year, with changes effective that year on August 1.<ref>For several years, the assignments were effective on August 15, but August 1 has been the effective date since 2007.</ref>\n\n==List==\nThe following is an alphabetical list of the areas of the church and related leadership assignments as of 1 August 2019.<ref name=\"Aug 2019 changes\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n!

Incoterms inform sales contracts defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved in the delivery of goods from the seller to the buyer, but they do not themselves conclude a contract, determine the price payable, currency or credit terms, govern [[contract law]] or define where title to goods transfers.\n\nThe Incoterms rules are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the interpretation of most commonly used terms in international trade. They are intended to reduce or remove altogether uncertainties arising from the differing interpretations of the rules in different countries. As such they are regularly incorporated into sales contracts<ref>{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/icc-guide-to-incoterms-2010 | title = ICC Guide to Incoterms\u00ae 2010 | access-date = March 14, 2014 | publisher = ICC}}</ref> worldwide.\n\n\"Incoterms\" is a registered [[trademark]] of the ICC.\n\nThe first work published by the ICC on international trade terms was issued in 1923, with the first edition known as Incoterms published in 1936. The Incoterms rules were amended in 1953,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts_endorsed/INCOTERMS1953_e.pdf |title = Incoterms\u00ae 1953 | accessdate = October 13, 2016 | publisher = UNCITRAL}}</ref> 1967, 1976, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 with the ninth version\u2014 '''Incoterms 2020''' <ref>{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/incoterms-2020 |title = Incoterms\u00ae 2020 | publisher = ICC}}</ref> \u2014 having been published on September 10, 2019.\n\n==Incoterms 2020==\n[[File:Incoterms map.png|thumb|right|350px|National Incoterms chambers]]\n''[https://hscodess.com/incoterms/ Incoterms 2020]'' is the ninth set of international contract terms published by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], with the first set having been published in 1936. ''Incoterms 2020'' defines 11 rules, the same number as defined by ''Incoterms 2010''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/incoterms-2010 | title = Incoterms\u00ae 2010| publisher = ICC}}</ref> One rule of the 2010 version (\"Delivered at Terminal\"; DAT)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://iccwbo.org/publication/incoterms-rules-2020/ | title = From the introduction of Incoterms 2020 | publisher = ICC}}</ref> was removed, and is replaced by a new rule (\"Delivered at Place Unloaded\"; DPU) in the 2020 rules.\n\nThe insurance to be provided under terms CIF and CIP has also changed, increasing from Institute Cargo Clauses(C) to Institute Cargo Clauses(A). \n\nIn prior versions, the rules were divided into four categories, but the 11 pre-defined terms of ''Incoterms 2020'' are subdivided into two categories ''based only on method of delivery''. The larger group of seven rules may be used regardless of the method of transport, with the smaller group of four being applicable only to sales that solely involve transportation by water where the condition of the goods can be verified at the point of loading on board ship. They are therefore not to be used for containerized freight, other combined transport methods, or for transport by road, air or rail.\n\nIncoterms 2020 also formally defines delivery. Previously, the term had been defined informally but it is now defined as the point in the transaction where \"the risk of loss or damage [to the goods] passes from the seller to the buyer.\"<ref>Incoterms\u00ae 2020 English Edition</ref>\n\n==Incoterms in government regulations==\nIn some jurisdictions, the duty costs of the goods may be calculated against a specific Incoterm: for example in [[India]], duty is calculated against the CIF value of the goods,<ref>[http://www.dov.gov.in/newsite3/brief_on_customs_valuation.asp Brief on Customs Valuation<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305033924/http://www.dov.gov.in/newsite3/brief_on_customs_valuation.asp |date=5 March 2018 }} Directorate General of Valuation</ref> and in [[South Africa]] the duty is calculated against the FOB value of the goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sars.gov.za/ClientSegments/Customs-Excise/Processing/Assessment/Pages/Valuation.aspx|title=Valuation<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=sars.gov.za|access-date=18 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426074735/http://www.sars.gov.za/ClientSegments/Customs-Excise/Processing/Assessment/Pages/Valuation.aspx|archive-date=26 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Because of this it is common for contracts for exports to these countries to use these Incoterms, even when they are not suitable for the chosen mode of transport. If this is the case then great care must be exercised to ensure that the points at which costs and risks pass are clarified with the customer.\n\n==Defined terms in Incoterms==\nThere are certain terms that have special meaning within Incoterms, and some of the more important ones are defined below:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Ray August; with revisions by Don|last2=Bixby|first2=Michael|title=International business law : text, cases, and readings|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Harlow [etc.]|isbn=978-0273768616|edition=6th ed., international}}</ref>\n* Delivery: The point in the transaction where the risk of loss or damage to the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer \n* Arrival: The point named in the Incoterm to which carriage has been paid\n* Free: Seller has an obligation to deliver the goods to a named place for transfer to a carrier\n* Carrier: Any person who, in a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or to procure the performance of transport by rail, road, air, sea, inland waterway or by a combination of such modes\n* [[Freight forwarder]]: A firm that makes or assists in the making of shipping arrangements;\n* Terminal: Any place, whether covered or not, such as a dock, warehouse, container yard or road, rail or air cargo terminal\n* To clear for export: To file Shipper\u2019s Export Declaration and get export permit\n\n==Variation of Incoterms==\nParties adopting Incoterms should be wary about their intention and variations. The desire of the parties should be expressed clearly and casual adoption should be refrained. Also, making additions or variations to the meaning of a certain term should be carefully done as parties' failure to use any trade term at all can produce unexpected results.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Rules for any mode of transport==\n\n==={{anchor|EXW|Ex Works}}EXW \u2013 Ex Works (named place of delivery)===\nThe seller makes the goods available at their premises, or at another named place. This term places the maximum obligation on the buyer and minimum obligations on the seller. The Ex Works term is often used while making an initial quotation for the sale of goods without any costs included.\n\nEXW means that a buyer incurs the risks for bringing the goods to their final destination. Either the seller does not load the goods on collecting vehicles and does not clear them for export, or if the seller does load the goods, he does so at buyer's risk and cost. If the parties agree that the seller should be responsible for the loading of the goods on departure and to bear the risk and all costs of such loading, this must be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale.\n\nThere is no obligation for the seller to make a contract of carriage, but there is also no obligation for the buyer to arrange one either - the buyer may sell the goods on to their own customer for collection from the original seller's warehouse. However, in common practice the buyer arranges the collection of the freight from the designated location, and is responsible for clearing the goods through Customs. The buyer is also responsible for completing all the export documentation, although the seller does have an obligation to obtain information and documents at the buyer's request and cost.\n\nThese documentary requirements may result in two principal issues. Firstly, the stipulation for the buyer to complete the export declaration can be an issue in certain jurisdictions (not least the European Union) where the customs regulations require the declarant to be either an individual or corporation resident within the jurisdiction. If the buyer is based outside of the customs jurisdiction they will be unable to clear the goods for export, meaning that the goods may be declared in the name of the seller by the buyer, even though the export formalities are the buyer's responsibility under the EXW term.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thamesvalleychamber.co.uk/uploads/Export_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf | title = Customs Information Paper (11) 89 | accessdate = December 13, 2016 | publisher = HMRC | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220180504/http://www.thamesvalleychamber.co.uk/uploads/Export_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf | archive-date = 20 December 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nSecondly, most jurisdictions require companies to provide proof of export for tax purposes. In an EXW shipment, the buyer is under no obligation to provide such proof to the seller, or indeed to even export the goods. In a customs jurisdiction such as the European Union, this would leave the seller liable to a sales tax bill as if the goods were sold to a domestic customer. It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another Incoterm, such as FCA ''seller's premises'', may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the seller, which provides for more control over the export process.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.strongandherd.co.uk/faqs/incoterms-rules/inco-question-7/ |title = Evidence of export | accessdate = December 13, 2016 | publisher = Strong & Herd}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|FCA|Free Carrier}}FCA \u2013 Free Carrier (named place of delivery)===\n\nThe seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, at a named place (possibly including the seller's own premises). The goods can be delivered to a carrier nominated by the buyer, or to another party nominated by the buyer.\n\nIn many respects this Incoterm has replaced FOB in modern usage, although the critical point at which the risk passes moves from loading aboard the vessel to the named place. The chosen place of delivery affects the obligations of loading and unloading the goods at that place.\n\nIf delivery occurs at the seller's premises, or at any other location that is under the seller's control, the seller is responsible for loading the goods on to the buyer's carrier. However, if delivery occurs at any other place, the seller is deemed to have delivered the goods once their transport has arrived at the named place; the buyer is responsible for both unloading the goods and loading them onto their own carrier.\n\n=== {{anchor|CPT|Carriage Paid To}}CPT \u2013 Carriage Paid To (named place of destination) ===\n\nCPT replaces the  C&F (cost and freight) and CFR terms for all shipping modes outside of non-containerized seafreight.\n\nThe seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named place of destination. However, the goods are considered to be delivered when the goods have been handed over to the first or main carrier, so that the risk transfers to buyer upon handing goods over to that carrier at the place of shipment in the country of Export.\n\nThe seller is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to the named place of destination (either the final destination such as the buyer's facilities or a port of destination. This has to be agreed to by seller and buyer, however).\n\nIf the buyer requires the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIP should be considered instead.\n\n==={{anchor|CIP|Carriage and Insurance Paid to}}CIP \u2013 Carriage and Insurance Paid to (named place of destination)===\n\nThis term is broadly similar to the above CPT term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under Institute Cargo Clauses (A) of the Institute of London Underwriters (which is a change from Incoterms 2010 where the minimum was Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses, unless specifically agreed by both parties. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract, and should allow the buyer, the seller, and anyone else with an insurable interest in the goods to be able to make a claim.\n\nCIP can be used for all modes of transport, whereas the Incoterm CIF should only be used for non-containerized sea-freight.\n\n==={{anchor|DPU|Delivered At Place Unloaded}}DPU \u2013 Delivered At Place Unloaded (named place of destination)===\n\nThis Incoterm requires that the seller delivers the goods, unloaded, at the named place of destination. The seller covers all the costs of transport (export fees, carriage, unloading from main carrier at destination port and destination port charges) and assumes all risk until arrival at the destination port or terminal.\n\nThe terminal can be a Port, Airport, or inland freight interchange, but must be a facility with the capability to receive the shipment. If the seller is not able to organize unloading, they should consider shipping under DAP terms instead.\n\nAll charges after unloading (for example, Import duty, taxes, customs and on-carriage) are to be borne by buyer. However, it is important to note that any delay or demurrage charges at the terminal will generally be for the seller's account.\n\n==={{anchor|DAP|Delivered At Place}}DAP \u2013 Delivered At Place (named place of destination)===\n\nIncoterms 2010 defines DAP as 'Delivered at Place' \u2013 the seller delivers when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination. Under DAP terms, the risk passes from seller to buyer from the point of destination mentioned in the contract of delivery.\n\nOnce goods are ready for shipment, the necessary packing is carried out by the seller at his own cost, so that the goods reach their final destination safely. All necessary legal formalities in the exporting country are completed by the seller at his own cost and risk to clear the goods for export.\n\nAfter arrival of the goods in the country of destination, the customs clearance in the importing country needs to be completed by the buyer, e.g. import permit, documents required by customs and etc., including all customs duties and taxes.\n\nUnder DAP terms, all carriage expenses with any terminal expenses are paid by seller up to the agreed destination point. The necessary unloading cost at final destination has to be borne by buyer under DAP terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/incoterms-2010/the-incoterms-rules/|title=Incoterms\u00ae rules 2010 - ICC - International Chamber of Commerce|author=|date=|website=iccwbo.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.export.gov/faq/eg_main_043740.asp|title=Exporting FAQs - Expor.gov - export.gov|author=|date=|website=www.export.gov}}</ref>\n\n==={{Anchor|DDP|Delivered Duty Paid}}DDP \u2013 Delivered Duty Paid (named place of destination)===\n\nSeller is responsible for delivering the  goods to the named place in the country of the buyer, and pays all costs in bringing the goods to the destination including import duties and taxes. The seller is not responsible for unloading. This term is often used in place of the non-Incoterm \"Free In Store (FIS)\". This term places the maximum obligations on the seller and minimum obligations on the buyer. No risk or responsibility is transferred to the buyer until delivery of the goods at the named place of destination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.incotermsexplained.com/the-incoterms-rules/the-eleven-rules-in-brief/delivered-duty-paid/|title=Delivered Duty Paid - Incoterms Explained|author=|date=|website=incotermsexplained.com}}</ref>\n\nThe most important consideration for DDP terms is that the seller is responsible for clearing the goods through customs in the buyer's country, including both paying the duties and taxes, and obtaining the necessary authorizations and registrations from the authorities in that country. Unless the rules and regulations in the buyer's country are very well understood, DDP terms can be a very big risk both in terms of delays and in unforeseen extra costs, and should be used with caution.\n\n==Rules for sea and inland waterway transport==\n\nTo determine if a location qualifies for these four rules, please refer to 'United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations ([[UN/LOCODE]])'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/service/location.html|title=UN/LOCODE Code List by Country - Trade - UNECE|author=|date=|website=www.unece.org}}</ref>\n\nThe four rules defined by Incoterms 2010 for international trade where transportation is entirely conducted by water are as per the below. It is important to note that these terms are generally not suitable for shipments in shipping containers; the point at which risk and responsibility for the goods passes is when the goods are loaded on board the ship, and if the goods are sealed into a shipping container it is impossible to verify the condition of the goods at this point.\n\nAlso of note is that the point at which risk passes under these terms has shifted from previous editions of Incoterms, where the risk passed at the ship's rail.\n\n==={{anchor|Free Alongside Ship}}FAS \u2013 Free Alongside Ship (named port of shipment)===\nThe seller delivers when the goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the named port of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. The FAS term requires the seller to clear the goods for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required the buyer to arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish the buyer to clear the goods for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term should be used only for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport.\n\n==={{anchor|Free on Board}}FOB \u2013 Free on Board (named port of shipment)===\n\n{{Main|FOB_(shipping)|label 1=FOB (Shipping)}}\n\nUnder FOB terms the seller bears all costs and risks up to the point the goods are loaded on board the vessel. The seller's responsibility does not end at that point unless the goods are \"appropriated to the contract\" that is, they are \"clearly set aside or otherwise identified as the contract goods\".<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0132718979|title=International Business Law 6th Edition}}</ref> Therefore, FOB contract requires a seller to deliver goods on board a vessel that is to be designated by the buyer in a manner customary at the particular port. In this case, the seller must also arrange for export clearance. On the other hand, the buyer pays cost of marine freight transportation, bill of lading fees, insurance, unloading and transportation cost from the arrival port to destination. Since Incoterms 1980 introduced the Incoterm FCA, FOB should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport. However, FOB is commonly used incorrectly for all modes of transport despite the contractual risks that this can introduce. In some [[common law countries]] such as the [[United States|United States of America]], FOB is not only connected with the carriage of goods by sea but also used for inland carriage aboard any \"vessel, car or other vehicle.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Day|title=The law of international trade|date=2003|publisher=Butterworths|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0406921830|edition=3.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/lawofinternation0000grif}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Cost and Freight}}CFR \u2013 Cost and Freight (named port of destination)===\nThe seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named port of destination. Risk transfers to buyer when the goods have been loaded on board the ship in the country of Export. The Shipper is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to named port. The shipper is not responsible for delivery to the final destination from the port (generally the buyer's facilities), or for buying insurance. If the buyer requires the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIF should be considered. CFR should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CPT.\n\n==={{anchor|Cost, Insurance and Freight}}CIF \u2013 Cost, Insurance & Freight (named port of destination)===\nThis term is broadly similar to the above CFR term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under Institute Cargo Clauses (A) of the Institute of London Underwriters (which is a change from Incoterms 2010 where the minimum was Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses, unless specifically agreed by both parties. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the [[bill of lading]]. These three documents represent the cost, insurance, and freight of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized sea freight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.\n\n==Allocations of costs to buyer/seller according to Incoterms 2020==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Incoterm 2020\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Loading at origin\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Export customs declaration\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Carriage to port of export\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Unloading of truck in port of export\n| align=\"center\"| Loading on vessel/airplane in port of export\n| align=\"center\"| Carriage (sea/air) to port of import\n| align=\"center\"| Insurance\n| align=\"center\"| Unloading in port of import\n| align=\"center\"| Loading on truck in port of import\n| align=\"center\"| Carriage to place of destination\n| align=\"center\"| Import customs clearance\n| align=\"center\"| Import duties and taxes\n| align=\"center\"| Unloading at destination\n\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|EXW|Ex Works}} \n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|FCA|Free Carrier}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|FAS|Free Alongside Ship}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|FOB|Free On Board}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CPT|Carriage Paid To}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CFR|Cost and Freight}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CIF|Cost, Insurance and Freight}} \n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CIP|Carriage and Insurance Paid to}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{Maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|DPU|Delivered At Place Unloaded}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|DAP|Delivered At Place}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|DDP|Delivered Duty Paid}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|}\n\nnb.

Incoterms inform sales contracts defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved in the delivery of goods from the seller to the buyer, but they do not themselves conclude a contract, determine the price payable, currency or credit terms, govern [[contract law]] or define where title to goods transfers.\n\nThe Incoterms rules are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the interpretation of most commonly used terms in international trade. They are intended to reduce or remove altogether uncertainties arising from the differing interpretations of the rules in different countries. As such they are regularly incorporated into sales contracts<ref>{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/icc-guide-to-incoterms-2010 | title = ICC Guide to Incoterms\u00ae 2010 | access-date = March 14, 2014 | publisher = ICC}}</ref> worldwide.\n\n\"Incoterms\" is a registered [[trademark]] of the ICC.\n\nThe first work published by the ICC on international trade terms was issued in 1923, with the first edition known as Incoterms published in 1936.

The larger group of seven rules may be used regardless of the method of transport, with the smaller group of four being applicable only to sales that solely involve transportation by water where the condition of the goods can be verified at the point of loading on board ship. They are therefore not to be used for containerized freight, other combined transport methods, or for transport by road, air or rail.\n\nIncoterms 2020 also formally defines delivery. Previously, the term had been defined informally but it is now defined as the point in the transaction where \"the risk of loss or damage [to the goods] passes from the seller to the buyer.\"<ref>Incoterms\u00ae 2020 English Edition</ref>\n\n==Incoterms in government regulations==\nIn some jurisdictions, the duty costs of the goods may be calculated against a specific Incoterm: for example in [[India]], duty is calculated against the CIF value of the goods,<ref>[http://www.dov.gov.in/newsite3/brief_on_customs_valuation.asp Brief on Customs Valuation<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305033924/http://www.dov.gov.in/newsite3/brief_on_customs_valuation.asp |date=5 March 2018 }} Directorate General of Valuation</ref> and in [[South Africa]] the duty is calculated against the FOB value of the goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sars.gov.za/ClientSegments/Customs-Excise/Processing/Assessment/Pages/Valuation.aspx|title=Valuation<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=sars.gov.za|access-date=18 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426074735/http://www.sars.gov.za/ClientSegments/Customs-Excise/Processing/Assessment/Pages/Valuation.aspx|archive-date=26 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Because of this it is common for contracts for exports to these countries to use these Incoterms, even when they are not suitable for the chosen mode of transport. If this is the case then great care must be exercised to ensure that the points at which costs and risks pass are clarified with the customer.\n\n==Defined terms in Incoterms==\nThere are certain terms that have special meaning within Incoterms, and some of the more important ones are defined below:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Ray August; with revisions by Don|last2=Bixby|first2=Michael|title=International business law : text, cases, and readings|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Harlow [etc.]|isbn=978-0273768616|edition=6th ed., international}}</ref>\n* Delivery: The point in the transaction where the risk of loss or damage to the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer \n* Arrival: The point named in the Incoterm to which carriage has been paid\n* Free: Seller has an obligation to deliver the goods to a named place for transfer to a carrier\n* Carrier: Any person who, in a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or to procure the performance of transport by rail, road, air, sea, inland waterway or by a combination of such modes\n* [[Freight forwarder]]: A firm that makes or assists in the making of shipping arrangements;\n* Terminal: Any place, whether covered or not, such as a dock, warehouse, container yard or road, rail or air cargo terminal\n* To clear for export: To file Shipper\u2019s Export Declaration and get export permit\n\n==Variation of Incoterms==\nParties adopting Incoterms should be wary about their intention and variations. The desire of the parties should be expressed clearly and casual adoption should be refrained. Also, making additions or variations to the meaning of a certain term should be carefully done as parties' failure to use any trade term at all can produce unexpected results.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Rules for any mode of transport==\n\n==={{anchor|EXW|Ex Works}}EXW \u2013 Ex Works (named place of delivery)===\nThe seller makes the goods available at their premises, or at another named place. This term places the maximum obligation on the buyer and minimum obligations on the seller. The Ex Works term is often used while making an initial quotation for the sale of goods without any costs included.\n\nEXW means that a buyer incurs the risks for bringing the goods to their final destination. Either the seller does not load the goods on collecting vehicles and does not clear them for export, or if the seller does load the goods, he does so at buyer's risk and cost. If the parties agree that the seller should be responsible for the loading of the goods on departure and to bear the risk and all costs of such loading, this must be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale.\n\nThere is no obligation for the seller to make a contract of carriage, but there is also no obligation for the buyer to arrange one either - the buyer may sell the goods on to their own customer for collection from the original seller's warehouse. However, in common practice the buyer arranges the collection of the freight from the designated location, and is responsible for clearing the goods through Customs. The buyer is also responsible for completing all the export documentation, although the seller does have an obligation to obtain information and documents at the buyer's request and cost.\n\nThese documentary requirements may result in two principal issues. Firstly, the stipulation for the buyer to complete the export declaration can be an issue in certain jurisdictions (not least the European Union) where the customs regulations require the declarant to be either an individual or corporation resident within the jurisdiction. If the buyer is based outside of the customs jurisdiction they will be unable to clear the goods for export, meaning that the goods may be declared in the name of the seller by the buyer, even though the export formalities are the buyer's responsibility under the EXW term.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thamesvalleychamber.co.uk/uploads/Export_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf | title = Customs Information Paper (11) 89 | accessdate = December 13, 2016 | publisher = HMRC | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220180504/http://www.thamesvalleychamber.co.uk/uploads/Export_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf | archive-date = 20 December 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nSecondly, most jurisdictions require companies to provide proof of export for tax purposes. In an EXW shipment, the buyer is under no obligation to provide such proof to the seller, or indeed to even export the goods. In a customs jurisdiction such as the European Union, this would leave the seller liable to a sales tax bill as if the goods were sold to a domestic customer. It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another Incoterm, such as FCA ''seller's premises'', may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the seller, which provides for more control over the export process.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.strongandherd.co.uk/faqs/incoterms-rules/inco-question-7/ |title = Evidence of export | accessdate = December 13, 2016 | publisher = Strong & Herd}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|FCA|Free Carrier}}FCA \u2013 Free Carrier (named place of delivery)===\n\nThe seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, at a named place (possibly including the seller's own premises). The goods can be delivered to a carrier nominated by the buyer, or to another party nominated by the buyer.\n\nIn many respects this Incoterm has replaced FOB in modern usage, although the critical point at which the risk passes moves from loading aboard the vessel to the named place. The chosen place of delivery affects the obligations of loading and unloading the goods at that place.\n\nIf delivery occurs at the seller's premises, or at any other location that is under the seller's control, the seller is responsible for loading the goods on to the buyer's carrier. However, if delivery occurs at any other place, the seller is deemed to have delivered the goods once their transport has arrived at the named place; the buyer is responsible for both unloading the goods and loading them onto their own carrier.\n\n=== {{anchor|CPT|Carriage Paid To}}CPT \u2013 Carriage Paid To (named place of destination) ===\n\nCPT replaces the  C&F (cost and freight) and CFR terms for all shipping modes outside of non-containerized seafreight.\n\nThe seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named place of destination. However, the goods are considered to be delivered when the goods have been handed over to the first or main carrier, so that the risk transfers to buyer upon handing goods over to that carrier at the place of shipment in the country of Export.\n\nThe seller is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to the named place of destination (either the final destination such as the buyer's facilities or a port of destination. This has to be agreed to by seller and buyer, however).\n\nIf the buyer requires the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIP should be considered instead.\n\n==={{anchor|CIP|Carriage and Insurance Paid to}}CIP \u2013 Carriage and Insurance Paid to (named place of destination)===\n\nThis term is broadly similar to the above CPT term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under Institute Cargo Clauses (A) of the Institute of London Underwriters (which is a change from Incoterms 2010 where the minimum was Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses, unless specifically agreed by both parties. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract, and should allow the buyer, the seller, and anyone else with an insurable interest in the goods to be able to make a claim.\n\nCIP can be used for all modes of transport, whereas the Incoterm CIF should only be used for non-containerized sea-freight.\n\n==={{anchor|DPU|Delivered At Place Unloaded}}DPU \u2013 Delivered At Place Unloaded (named place of destination)===\n\nThis Incoterm requires that the seller delivers the goods, unloaded, at the named place of destination. The seller covers all the costs of transport (export fees, carriage, unloading from main carrier at destination port and destination port charges) and assumes all risk until arrival at the destination port or terminal.\n\nThe terminal can be a Port, Airport, or inland freight interchange, but must be a facility with the capability to receive the shipment. If the seller is not able to organize unloading, they should consider shipping under DAP terms instead.\n\nAll charges after unloading (for example, Import duty, taxes, customs and on-carriage) are to be borne by buyer. However, it is important to note that any delay or demurrage charges at the terminal will generally be for the seller's account.\n\n==={{anchor|DAP|Delivered At Place}}DAP \u2013 Delivered At Place (named place of destination)===\n\nIncoterms 2010 defines DAP as 'Delivered at Place' \u2013 the seller delivers when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination. Under DAP terms, the risk passes from seller to buyer from the point of destination mentioned in the contract of delivery.\n\nOnce goods are ready for shipment, the necessary packing is carried out by the seller at his own cost, so that the goods reach their final destination safely. All necessary legal formalities in the exporting country are completed by the seller at his own cost and risk to clear the goods for export.\n\nAfter arrival of the goods in the country of destination, the customs clearance in the importing country needs to be completed by the buyer, e.g. import permit, documents required by customs and etc., including all customs duties and taxes.\n\nUnder DAP terms, all carriage expenses with any terminal expenses are paid by seller up to the agreed destination point. The necessary unloading cost at final destination has to be borne by buyer under DAP terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/incoterms-2010/the-incoterms-rules/|title=Incoterms\u00ae rules 2010 - ICC - International Chamber of Commerce|author=|date=|website=iccwbo.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.export.gov/faq/eg_main_043740.asp|title=Exporting FAQs - Expor.gov - export.gov|author=|date=|website=www.export.gov}}</ref>\n\n==={{Anchor|DDP|Delivered Duty Paid}}DDP \u2013 Delivered Duty Paid (named place of destination)===\n\nSeller is responsible for delivering the  goods to the named place in the country of the buyer, and pays all costs in bringing the goods to the destination including import duties and taxes. The seller is not responsible for unloading. This term is often used in place of the non-Incoterm \"Free In Store (FIS)\". This term places the maximum obligations on the seller and minimum obligations on the buyer. No risk or responsibility is transferred to the buyer until delivery of the goods at the named place of destination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.incotermsexplained.com/the-incoterms-rules/the-eleven-rules-in-brief/delivered-duty-paid/|title=Delivered Duty Paid - Incoterms Explained|author=|date=|website=incotermsexplained.com}}</ref>\n\nThe most important consideration for DDP terms is that the seller is responsible for clearing the goods through customs in the buyer's country, including both paying the duties and taxes, and obtaining the necessary authorizations and registrations from the authorities in that country. Unless the rules and regulations in the buyer's country are very well understood, DDP terms can be a very big risk both in terms of delays and in unforeseen extra costs, and should be used with caution.\n\n==Rules for sea and inland waterway transport==\n\nTo determine if a location qualifies for these four rules, please refer to 'United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations ([[UN/LOCODE]])'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/service/location.html|title=UN/LOCODE Code List by Country - Trade - UNECE|author=|date=|website=www.unece.org}}</ref>\n\nThe four rules defined by Incoterms 2010 for international trade where transportation is entirely conducted by water are as per the below. It is important to note that these terms are generally not suitable for shipments in shipping containers; the point at which risk and responsibility for the goods passes is when the goods are loaded on board the ship, and if the goods are sealed into a shipping container it is impossible to verify the condition of the goods at this point.\n\nAlso of note is that the point at which risk passes under these terms has shifted from previous editions of Incoterms, where the risk passed at the ship's rail.\n\n==={{anchor|Free Alongside Ship}}FAS \u2013 Free Alongside Ship (named port of shipment)===\nThe seller delivers when the goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the named port of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. The FAS term requires the seller to clear the goods for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required the buyer to arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish the buyer to clear the goods for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term should be used only for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport.\n\n==={{anchor|Free on Board}}FOB \u2013 Free on Board (named port of shipment)===\n\n{{Main|FOB_(shipping)|label 1=FOB (Shipping)}}\n\nUnder FOB terms the seller bears all costs and risks up to the point the goods are loaded on board the vessel. The seller's responsibility does not end at that point unless the goods are \"appropriated to the contract\" that is, they are \"clearly set aside or otherwise identified as the contract goods\".<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0132718979|title=International Business Law 6th Edition}}</ref> Therefore, FOB contract requires a seller to deliver goods on board a vessel that is to be designated by the buyer in a manner customary at the particular port. In this case, the seller must also arrange for export clearance. On the other hand, the buyer pays cost of marine freight transportation, bill of lading fees, insurance, unloading and transportation cost from the arrival port to destination. Since Incoterms 1980 introduced the Incoterm FCA, FOB should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport. However, FOB is commonly used incorrectly for all modes of transport despite the contractual risks that this can introduce. In some [[common law countries]] such as the [[United States|United States of America]], FOB is not only connected with the carriage of goods by sea but also used for inland carriage aboard any \"vessel, car or other vehicle.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Day|title=The law of international trade|date=2003|publisher=Butterworths|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0406921830|edition=3.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/lawofinternation0000grif}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Cost and Freight}}CFR \u2013 Cost and Freight (named port of destination)===\nThe seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named port of destination. Risk transfers to buyer when the goods have been loaded on board the ship in the country of Export. The Shipper is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to named port. The shipper is not responsible for delivery to the final destination from the port (generally the buyer's facilities), or for buying insurance. If the buyer requires the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIF should be considered. CFR should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CPT.\n\n==={{anchor|Cost, Insurance and Freight}}CIF \u2013 Cost, Insurance & Freight (named port of destination)===\nThis term is broadly similar to the above CFR term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under Institute Cargo Clauses (A) of the Institute of London Underwriters (which is a change from Incoterms 2010 where the minimum was Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses, unless specifically agreed by both parties. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the [[bill of lading]]. These three documents represent the cost, insurance, and freight of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized sea freight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.\n\n==Allocations of costs to buyer/seller according to Incoterms 2020==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Incoterm 2020\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Loading at origin\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Export customs declaration\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Carriage to port of export\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Unloading of truck in port of export\n| align=\"center\"| Loading on vessel/airplane in port of export\n| align=\"center\"| Carriage (sea/air) to port of import\n| align=\"center\"| Insurance\n| align=\"center\"| Unloading in port of import\n| align=\"center\"| Loading on truck in port of import\n| align=\"center\"| Carriage to place of destination\n| align=\"center\"| Import customs clearance\n| align=\"center\"| Import duties and taxes\n| align=\"center\"| Unloading at destination\n\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|EXW|Ex Works}} \n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|FCA|Free Carrier}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|FAS|Free Alongside Ship}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|FOB|Free On Board}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CPT|Carriage Paid To}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CFR|Cost and Freight}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CIF|Cost, Insurance and Freight}} \n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CIP|Carriage and Insurance Paid to}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{Maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|DPU|Delivered At Place Unloaded}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|DAP|Delivered At Place}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|DDP|Delivered Duty Paid}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|}\n\nnb.

This album went gold and gained the band commercial success thanks to the success of singles \"Praise\" and \"Angel's Son\", which peaked at 15 and 11, respectively, on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]]. In 2002 they covered the theme song of [[Chris Jericho]] for [[WWF Forceable Entry]].

The album debuted at No.&nbsp;14 in the US, selling around 68,000 copies in its first week. This was one of the band's best received albums and to date features their highest charting single (tied with \"Driven\"), \"Enemy\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;10 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. \"Enemy\" was made the official theme song for ''[[Unforgiven (2003)|WWE Unforgiven 2003]]''. Other singles released from the album, \"Broken Down\" and \"Face to Face\", met with more moderate success charting at 20 and 22, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, for the first time in the band's career, they released a live album on a CD/DVD double disk package titled ''[[Southside Double-Wide: Acoustic Live]]''. Both the CD and the DVD include a cover of \"[[Hurt (Johnny Cash song)|Hurt]]\" by [[Nine Inch Nails]] which is dedicated to Johnny Cash. This concert showcased a mellower side to the band with an acoustic performance.\n\nOn December 11, 2004, after playing a show in Columbus, Ohio, it was announced that [[Clint Lowery]] had left the band mid-tour, because he wanted to play with his brother Corey Lowery in his new band [[Dark New Day]], who had reportedly just signed with Warner Bros. Records. A temporary guitarist was found for the rest of the dates, and Lowery was eventually replaced by [[Sonny Mayo]] (from Snot and [[Amen (American band)|Amen]]).<ref name=\"amg\"/> At roughly the same time, Sevendust and TVT Records parted ways.\n\nOn October 11, 2005, Sevendust joined forces with good friend Producer/Engineer Shawn Grove and released their fifth studio album, ''[[Next (Sevendust album)|Next]]'', on the WineDark Records label, distributed by [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]]. In the process, Sevendust also created their own record label, 7Bros Records.

WineDark Records had imploded, leaving them without distribution, tour support, or promised advance payments. The band owed money to crew members and other staffers and had a mounting credit card debt. In April, they expected that a tax refund from the US government would help ease the burden. Then, they found out their accountant hadn't paid their taxes and they owed $120,000 to the government. \"We were beyond broke\", says drummer and lyricist Morgan Rose. \"We had a debt load close to a million dollars, and we were in a position where, no matter how much money we thought we were making, we were still having to pay and pay.\"<ref name=\"RM200704\" />\n\nSevendust (with Shawn Grove again serving as producer and engineer), released their sixth full-length studio album, entitled ''[[Alpha (Sevendust album)|Alpha]]'', on March 6, 2007. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;14 in the US, the band's highest chart position yet, selling over 42,000 copies of the album in its first week of sale. The disc contained the album's preceding internet track \"[[Deathstar (song)|Deathstar]]\", the Hot Mainstream Rock top 10 smash \"[[Driven (Sevendust song)|Driven]]\" and a further Active Rock radio top 40 hit in the form of \"[[Beg to Differ (song)|Beg to Differ]]\". Alpha is the band's second album featuring [[Sonny Mayo]] on rhythm guitar and the first with him as part of the writing process. Alpha is also the first album by the band to be released under the Warner-affiliated [[Asylum Records]], making Sevendust the first rock band on that label. The band also headlined a 57-date tour from February 8, 2007 to April 28, 2007.

John Connolly, a drummer, left his then band and joined Snake Nation as a guitarist. They recorded their first demo. Not happy with vocals, however, Snake Nation spent a year searching for a new singer before finding Lajon Witherspoon. Six months passed, Clint Lowery joined the band, and they renamed themselves Rumblefish.<ref name=\"RM200704\" />\n[[File:Clint Lowery performing in 1998 as Sevendust guitarist.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|Clint Lowery performing in 1998.

They renamed themselves Crawlspace, and released \"My Ruin\" on the ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' soundtrack album entitled ''[[Mortal Kombat: More Kombat|More Kombat]]'' through [[TVT Records]] in 1996. Shortly after, another band named Crawlspac' sent notice that they wanted $2,500 for the rights to their name. Rather than purchase the rights, the band members chose to rename themselves Sevendust, a name inspired by the commercial [[insecticide]] brand \"[[Carbaryl|Sevin]] Dust\".<ref name=\"RM200704\" /> The song Rumble Fish was included on the band's second album, ''Home''.\n\nSevendust released their [[Sevendust (album)|self-titled debut]], in-part produced by former [[Twisted Sister]] guitarist [[Jay Jay French]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Connif|title=Starting a rebellion: Jay jay french performs double duty as twisted sister's guitarist and manager|journal=Billboard - The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|date=2006|volume=118|page=52}}</ref> on April 15, 1997, known for its heavy riffs, angry vocals and thrash-like drumming, as in the songs \"Black\" and \"Bitch\".<ref name=\"debut review\">\nHenderson, Alex.

In the same year they released a compilation called ''[[Live & Loud (Sevendust)|Live and Loud]]'' which featured live footage of the band's performance of September 16, 1998 at Chicago's Metro.\n\n===''Home'' and ''Animosity'' (1999\u20132002)===\nOn August 24, 1999, they released their second album, ''[[Home (Sevendust album)|Home]]''. The album peaked at 19 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and featured [[Skin (musician)|Skin]] from [[Skunk Anansie]] and [[Chino Moreno]] from [[Deftones]] as guest vocalists. The two singles from the album, \"Denial\" and \"Waffle\", gave the band moderate chart success, and the latter of which was played on the ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' show. They appeared in [[Woodstock 1999]] and have toured with many bands such as [[Korn]], [[Staind]], [[Nonpoint]], [[Reveille (band)|Reveille]], [[Godsmack]], [[Mudvayne]], [[Mushroomhead]], [[Powerman 5000]], [[Creed (band)|Creed]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], and [[Metallica]]. In 1999, they gained European exposure by opening for Skunk Anansie at various shows in Germany. Skin from Skunk Anansie provided guest vocals on the track \"[[Licking Cream]]\" off ''Home''. They also opened with Kid Rock and Ted Nugent for Metallica on New Year's Eve in 1999 at the Pontiac Silverdome near Detroit, Michigan. They also joined [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Coal Chamber]] and other bands on the ''[[Tattoo the Earth]] Tour'' in June 2000. Also in 2000, the song \"Fall\" was recorded by producer [[Sylvia Massy]] in 1998 at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. \"Fall\" appears on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Scream 3]]''.\n\nIn November 2001, the band released their third album, ''[[Animosity (Sevendust album)|Animosity]]''. This album went gold and gained the band commercial success thanks to the success of singles \"Praise\" and \"Angel's Son\", which peaked at 15 and 11, respectively, on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]]. In 2002 they covered the theme song of [[Chris Jericho]] for [[WWF Forceable Entry]]. The song was never used as an official entry theme for him though.  \"Angel's Son\" was a tribute to [[Lynn Strait]], the lead singer of the band [[Snot (band)|Snot]], whom the members of Sevendust were friends with. Strait had died in a car accident in 1998. In addition to being included on ''Animosity'', the song was included on the compilation album ''[[Strait Up]]''. The band made an appearance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' playing an acoustic version of \"[[Angel's Son]]\" featuring [[Paul Shaffer]] on keyboards.\n\nIn the same year Sevendust was seen in the [[Chris Rock]] movie ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]'' as a partial clip of \"Waffle\" is played.\n\nAnother friend of the band, [[Dave Williams (singer)|Dave Williams]], the lead singer of [[Drowning Pool]], died in 2002.

The album debuted at No.&nbsp;14 in the US, selling around 68,000 copies in its first week. This was one of the band's best received albums and to date features their highest charting single (tied with \"Driven\"), \"Enemy\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;10 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. \"Enemy\" was made the official theme song for ''[[Unforgiven (2003)|WWE Unforgiven 2003]]''. Other singles released from the album, \"Broken Down\" and \"Face to Face\", met with more moderate success charting at 20 and 22, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, for the first time in the band's career, they released a live album on a CD/DVD double disk package titled ''[[Southside Double-Wide: Acoustic Live]]''. Both the CD and the DVD include a cover of \"[[Hurt (Johnny Cash song)|Hurt]]\" by [[Nine Inch Nails]] which is dedicated to Johnny Cash. This concert showcased a mellower side to the band with an acoustic performance.\n\nOn December 11, 2004, after playing a show in Columbus, Ohio, it was announced that [[Clint Lowery]] had left the band mid-tour, because he wanted to play with his brother Corey Lowery in his new band [[Dark New Day]], who had reportedly just signed with Warner Bros. Records. A temporary guitarist was found for the rest of the dates, and Lowery was eventually replaced by [[Sonny Mayo]] (from Snot and [[Amen (American band)|Amen]]).<ref name=\"amg\"/> At roughly the same time, Sevendust and TVT Records parted ways.\n\nOn October 11, 2005, Sevendust joined forces with good friend Producer/Engineer Shawn Grove and released their fifth studio album, ''[[Next (Sevendust album)|Next]]'', on the WineDark Records label, distributed by [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]]. In the process, Sevendust also created their own record label, 7Bros Records.

And it had already been out for five months\", Rose grumbles. \"Basically, the main person that was in charge of the whole thing fell off the face of the earth.

WineDark Records had imploded, leaving them without distribution, tour support, or promised advance payments. The band owed money to crew members and other staffers and had a mounting credit card debt. In April, they expected that a tax refund from the US government would help ease the burden. Then, they found out their accountant hadn't paid their taxes and they owed $120,000 to the government. \"We were beyond broke\", says drummer and lyricist Morgan Rose. \"We had a debt load close to a million dollars, and we were in a position where, no matter how much money we thought we were making, we were still having to pay and pay.\"<ref name=\"RM200704\" />\n\nSevendust (with Shawn Grove again serving as producer and engineer), released their sixth full-length studio album, entitled ''[[Alpha (Sevendust album)|Alpha]]'', on March 6, 2007. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;14 in the US, the band's highest chart position yet, selling over 42,000 copies of the album in its first week of sale. The disc contained the album's preceding internet track \"[[Deathstar (song)|Deathstar]]\", the Hot Mainstream Rock top 10 smash \"[[Driven (Sevendust song)|Driven]]\" and a further Active Rock radio top 40 hit in the form of \"[[Beg to Differ (song)|Beg to Differ]]\". Alpha is the band's second album featuring [[Sonny Mayo]] on rhythm guitar and the first with him as part of the writing process. Alpha is also the first album by the band to be released under the Warner-affiliated [[Asylum Records]], making Sevendust the first rock band on that label. The band also headlined a 57-date tour from February 8, 2007 to April 28, 2007.

The record was originally slated for a release of March 4, 2008, but was later pushed back to April 1.

The band launched a newly designed website, promoting the new album. During the recording process the band posted daily videos on their official site and their YouTube channel; with updates on the new album, recording sessions in the studio and recording sessions from their new house.

It can be used for household, commercial, or industrial applications. Large dehumidifiers are used in commercial buildings such as indoor [[ice rink]]s and [[swimming pool]]s, as well as manufacturing plants or storage warehouses.<ref>{{cite book|title=Technical Guidelines of an Ice Rink|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|chapter-url=http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Sport/Chapter3.pdf|accessdate=13 February 2015|chapter=3}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nDehumidifiers extract water from air that passes through the unit. There are two types of dehumidifiers - condensate dehumidifiers and desiccant dehumidifiers.\n\nCondensate dehumidifiers use a refrigerator to collect water known as [[Condensation reaction|condensate]], which is normally [[greywater]] but may at times be reused for industrial purposes. Some manufacturers offer reverse osmosis filters to turn the condensate into potable water.<ref>{{cite book|last=Frigidaire|title=All about the Use & Care of your Dehumidifier|year=2009|publisher=Electrolux Home Products, Inc.|page=7}}</ref> Some designs, such as the ionic membrane dehumidifier, dispose off water as a vapor rather than liquid.\n\n[[Desiccant]] dehumidifiers (known also as absorption dehumidifiers) bond moisture with hydrophilic materials such as [[silica gel]]. Cheap domestic units contain single-use hydrophilic substance cartridges, gel, and powder. Larger commercial units contain hot air recovery systems in order to remove humid air from outside the room.\n\nThe [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of dehumidifiers can vary widely.\n\n==History==\nThe first dehumidifier was created by American inventor [[Willis Carrier]] in 1902 to dehumidify a [[Brooklyn]] printing plant.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harriman|first=L. G. Iii|last2=Plager|first2=D.|last3=Kosar|first3=D.|date=1 November 1997|title=Dehumidification and cooling loads from ventilation air|journal=ASHRAE Journal|language=English|volume=39|issue=11|osti=563883}}</ref> Carrier cited the discovery as later motivating further discoveries in air conditioning.<ref>{{Cite document|title=100 Years of Air Conditioning|last=Nagengast|first=Bernard|date=|citeseerx = 10.1.1.545.9425}}</ref>\n\n==Thermal condensation dehumidification==\nThese methods rely on drawing air across a cold surface. Since the [[saturation vapor pressure]] of water decreases with decreasing temperature, the water in the air [[condensation|condenses]] on the surface, separating the water from the air.\n\n===Refrigeration (electric)===\nElectric refrigeration dehumidifiers are the most common type of dehumidifiers. They work by drawing moist air over a [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] evaporator with a fan. There are 3 main types of evaporators. They are coiled tube, fin and tube, and [[Microchannel (microtechnology)|microchannel]] technology.\n\nThe cold [[evaporator coil]] of the refrigeration device condenses the water, which is removed, and then the air is reheated by the [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser coil]]. The now dehumidified, re-warmed air is released into the room. This process works most effectively at higher ambient temperatures with a high [[dew point]] temperature. In cold climates, the process is less effective. Highest efficiency is reached above {{convert|20|C|F}} and 45% relative humidity. This [[relative humidity]] value is higher if the temperature of the air is lower. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.\n\nThis type of dehumidifier differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.\n\nIn addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier will always warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity more directly, by condensing and removing water.\n\n[[File:Heat recovery.gif|center|Diagram showing airflow through a heat-recovering dehumidifier]]\n\nWarm, moist air is drawn into the unit at A in the diagram above. This air passes into a crossflow plate heat exchanger (B) where a substantial proportion of the sensible heat is transferred to a cool supply air stream. This process brings the extracted air close to saturation. The air then passes to the plenum chamber of the extract fan (C) where a portion of it may be rejected to outside. The amount that is rejected can be varied and is\ndetermined either by legislation on fresh air requirements, or by the requirement to maintain a fresh, odour free environment. The balance of the air then passes into the evaporator coil of the heat pump where it is cooled and the moisture is condensed. This process yields substantial amounts of latent energy to the refrigeration circuit. Fresh air is then introduced to replace the amount that was extracted and the mix is discharged by the supply fan (G) to the crossflow plate exchanger (B) where it is heated by the extract air from the pool. This pre-warmed air then passes through the heat pump condenser (F) where it is heated by the latent energy removed during the condensation process as well as the energy input to the compressor. The warm dry air is then discharged to the room.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warmdrypools.co.uk/Casestudies/CarbonGobblers|title=Warm & Dry dehumidifiers heat recovery in dehumidifiers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924023544/https://warmdrypools.co.uk/Casestudies/CarbonGobblers|archivedate=24 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Conventional air conditioners===\nA conventional [[Air conditioning|air conditioner]] is very similar to an electric dehumidifier and inherently acts as a dehumidifier when chilling the air.<ref>{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=How Hot Do You Feel?|url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/blog/138-how-hot-do-you-feel|accessdate=26 February 2016}}</ref> In an air conditioner, however, the air passes over the cold evaporator coils and then directly into the room. It is not re-heated by passing over the condenser, as in a refrigeration dehumidifier. Instead, the refrigerant is pumped by the compressor to a condenser which is located outside the room to be conditioned, and the heat is then released to the outside air. Conventional air conditioners use additional energy exhausting air outside, and new air can have more moisture than the room needs, such as a pool room that already holds a high amount of moisture in the air.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swimming Pool Room Dehumidifiers - Top Systems and Units|url=http://www.dehumidifiercorp.com/swimming-pool-dehumidifiers|website=Dehumidifier Corporation of America|publisher=Dehumidifier Corporation of America|accessdate=16 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe water that condenses on the evaporator in an air conditioner is usually routed to remove extracted water from the conditioned space. Newer high-efficiency window units use the condensed water to help cool the [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser coil]] by evaporating the water into the outdoor air, while older units simply allowed the water to drip outside.\n\n===Spray dehumidifiers===\nWhen water is chilled below the atmospheric [[dewpoint]], atmospheric water will condense onto it faster than water evaporates from it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.airconditioning-systems.com/dehumidifier.html|title=Dehumidifier|accessdate=|website=airconditioning-systems.com}}</ref> Spray dehumidifiers mix sprays of chilled water and air to capture atmospheric moisture. They also capture pollutants and contaminants like pollen, for which purpose they are sometimes called \"air washers\".\n\n===Makeshift dehumidifiers===\nBecause window air conditioner units have condensers and expansion units, some of them can be used as makeshift dehumidifiers by sending their heat exhaust back into the same room as the cooled air, instead of the outside environment. If the condensate from the cooling coils is drained away from the room as it drips off the cooling coils, the result will be room air that is drier but slightly warmer.\n\nHowever, many window air conditioners are designed to dispose of condensate water by re-evaporating it into the exhaust air stream, which cancels out the air humidity decrease caused by the condensation of moisture on the cooling coils. To be effective as a dehumidifier, an air conditioner must be designed or modified so that most or all of the water that condenses is drained away in liquid form, rather than re-evaporated. Even if condensate is drained, a modified air conditioner is still less efficient than a single-purpose appliance with a design optimized for dehumidification. Dehumidifiers are designed to pass air directly over the cooling coils and then the heating coils in a single efficient pass through the device.\n\nIn addition, most air conditioners are controlled by a [[thermostat]] which senses temperature, rather than a [[humidistat]] that senses humidity and is typically used to control a dehumidifier. A thermostat is not designed for the control of humidity, and controls it poorly if at all.\n\n===Ice buildup===\nUnder certain conditions of temperature and humidity, [[ice]] can form on a refrigeration dehumidifier's [[evaporator coil]]s. The ice buildup can impede airflow and eventually form a solid block encasing the coils. This buildup prevents the dehumidifier from operating effectively, and can cause water damage if condensed water drips off the accumulated ice and not into the collection tray. In extreme cases, the ice can deform or distort mechanical elements, causing permanent damage.\n\nBetter-quality dehumidifiers may have a frost or ice sensor. These will turn off the machine and allow the ice-covered coils to warm and defrost. Once defrosted, the machine will automatically restart. Most ice sensors are simple [[thermal switch]]es and do not directly sense the presence or absence of ice buildup. An alternative design senses the impeded airflow and shuts off the cooling coils in a similar manner.\n\n===Thermoelectric dehumidifiers===\nThermoelectric dehumidifiers use a [[Thermoelectric cooling|Peltier heat pump]] to cool a surface and condense water vapor from the air. The design is simpler and has the benefit of being quieter compared to a dehumidifier with a mechanical compressor. However, because of its [[Thermoelectric cooling#Performance|relatively poor]] [[Coefficient of Performance]], this design is mainly used for small dehumidifiers. Ice buildup may be a problem, similar to problems with refrigeration dehumidifiers.\n\n==Absorption/desiccant dehumidification==\n{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Adsorption - Desiccant dehumidifier TTK 55 S.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Mobile Adsorption dehumidifier|Portable [[adsorption]] dehumidifier (a Trotec TTK)]]\nThis process uses a special humidity-absorbing material called a [[desiccant]], which is exposed to the air to be conditioned. The humidity-saturated material is then moved to a different location, where it is \"recharged\" to drive off the humidity, typically by heating it. The desiccant can be mounted on a belt or other means of transporting it during a cycle of operation.\n\nDehumidifiers which work according to the absorption principle are especially suited for high humidity levels at low temperatures. They are often used in various sectors in industry so that humidity levels below 35% can be achieved.\n\nBecause of the lack of compressor parts desiccant dehumidifiers are often lighter and quieter than compressor dehumidifiers. Desiccant dehumidifiers can also operate at lower temperatures than compressor dehumidifiers as the unit does not rely on cooled coils for which the moisture condensing efficiency decreases at lower temperatures.\n\n==Ionic membrane dehumidification==\nAn ionic membrane can be used to move humidity into or out of a sealed enclosure, operating at a molecular level without involving visible liquid water.\n\nThe solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) membrane is a low power, steady-state dehumidifier for enclosed areas where maintenance is difficult. The electrolytic process delivers dehumidifying capacities up to 0.2 grams/day from a 0.2 m\u00b3 (7 cu ft) space to 58 grams/day from an 8m\u00b3 (280 cu ft). SPE systems generally do not have high dehydration capacities, but because the water vapor is removed through electrolysis, the process is maintenance free. The process also requires very little electrical energy to operate, using no moving parts, making the ionic membranes silent in operation and very reliable over long periods of time. SPE dehumidifiers are typically used to protect sensitive electrical components, medical equipment, museum specimens, or scientific apparatus from humid environments.\n\nThe SPE consists of a proton-conductive solid polymer electrolyte and porous electrodes with a catalytic layer composed of noble metal particles.<ref name=\"RosahlWorks\">{{cite web|title=How Rosahl works|url=https://www.micro-dehumidifier.com/rosahl/how-does-rosahl-work-3/|work=Rosahl (website)|publisher=Ryosai Technica Company (Japan)|accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref> When a voltage is applied to the porous electrode attached to the membrane, the moisture on the [[anode]] side (dehumidifying side) dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and oxygen. The hydrogen ions migrate through membrane to be discharged on the cathode (moisture discharging) side where they react with oxygen in the air, resulting in water molecules (vapor), being discharged.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Applied Electrochemistry|volume=40|issue=12|pages=2153\u20132160|doi=10.1007/s10800-010-0197-4|title=Estimation of dehumidifying performance of solid polymer electrolytic dehumidifier for practical application|first1=Shuichi|last1=Sakuma|first2=Shiro|last2=Yamauchi|first3=Osamu|last3=Takai|publisher=Springerlink|year=2010}}</ref> Oxygen is released from the dehumidifying side and if a large amount of water is introduced to an airtight enclosure then oxygen can build up inside the enclosure.\n\n==Condensate==\n[[File:Mitsubishi Electric Oasis MJ-E16VX dehumidifier partially in parts 20071022.jpg|thumb|upright|Partially disassembled portable dehumidifier (a [[Mitsubishi Electric]] Oasis), with condensate bucket and white-colored float sensor visible at center]]\n\n===Disposal===\nProducts using condensation technology has traditionally been using a cold surface where humidity in warm air is condensed. Today the warm condensation technology based on the concept of over-saturated steam inside a closed environment makes it possible to dehumidify air at sub-zero temperatures. This is a very energy efficient technology and equally efficient in all temperatures.\n\nMost portable dehumidifiers are equipped with a condensate collection receptacle, typically with a [[Float (liquid level)|float sensor]] that detects when the collection vessel is full, to shut off the dehumidifier and prevent an overflow of collected water. In a warm humid environment, these buckets will generally fill with water in 8\u201312 hours, and may need to be manually emptied and replaced several times per day to ensure continued operation.\n\nMany portable dehumidifiers can also be adapted to connect the condensate drip output directly to a drain via a hose. Some dehumidifier models can tie into plumbing drains or use a built-in water pump to empty themselves as they collect moisture. Alternatively, a separate [[condensate pump]] may be used to move collected water to a disposal location when gravity drainage is not possible.\n\n[[Air conditioning#Central (ducted) air conditioning|Central air conditioning]] units typically need to be connected to a drain, because the quantity of condensate water generated by such systems can be quite large over time. If the condensate water is directed into the sewer system, it should be suitably [[Trap (plumbing)|trapped]]. Otherwise, back pressure can allow smells or sewer gases to enter the building.

It can be used for household, commercial, or industrial applications. Large dehumidifiers are used in commercial buildings such as indoor [[ice rink]]s and [[swimming pool]]s, as well as manufacturing plants or storage warehouses.<ref>{{cite book|title=Technical Guidelines of an Ice Rink|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|chapter-url=http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Sport/Chapter3.pdf|accessdate=13 February 2015|chapter=3}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nDehumidifiers extract water from air that passes through the unit. There are two types of dehumidifiers - condensate dehumidifiers and desiccant dehumidifiers.\n\nCondensate dehumidifiers use a refrigerator to collect water known as [[Condensation reaction|condensate]], which is normally [[greywater]] but may at times be reused for industrial purposes. Some manufacturers offer reverse osmosis filters to turn the condensate into potable water.<ref>{{cite book|last=Frigidaire|title=All about the Use & Care of your Dehumidifier|year=2009|publisher=Electrolux Home Products, Inc.|page=7}}</ref> Some designs, such as the ionic membrane dehumidifier, dispose off water as a vapor rather than liquid.\n\n[[Desiccant]] dehumidifiers (known also as absorption dehumidifiers) bond moisture with hydrophilic materials such as [[silica gel]]. Cheap domestic units contain single-use hydrophilic substance cartridges, gel, and powder. Larger commercial units contain hot air recovery systems in order to remove humid air from outside the room.\n\nThe [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of dehumidifiers can vary widely.\n\n==History==\nThe first dehumidifier was created by American inventor [[Willis Carrier]] in 1902 to dehumidify a [[Brooklyn]] printing plant.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harriman|first=L. G. Iii|last2=Plager|first2=D.|last3=Kosar|first3=D.|date=1 November 1997|title=Dehumidification and cooling loads from ventilation air|journal=ASHRAE Journal|language=English|volume=39|issue=11|osti=563883}}</ref> Carrier cited the discovery as later motivating further discoveries in air conditioning.<ref>{{Cite document|title=100 Years of Air Conditioning|last=Nagengast|first=Bernard|date=|citeseerx = 10.1.1.545.9425}}</ref>\n\n==Thermal condensation dehumidification==\nThese methods rely on drawing air across a cold surface. Since the [[saturation vapor pressure]] of water decreases with decreasing temperature, the water in the air [[condensation|condenses]] on the surface, separating the water from the air.\n\n===Refrigeration (electric)===\nElectric refrigeration dehumidifiers are the most common type of dehumidifiers. They work by drawing moist air over a [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] evaporator with a fan. There are 3 main types of evaporators. They are coiled tube, fin and tube, and [[Microchannel (microtechnology)|microchannel]] technology.\n\nThe cold [[evaporator coil]] of the refrigeration device condenses the water, which is removed, and then the air is reheated by the [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser coil]]. The now dehumidified, re-warmed air is released into the room. This process works most effectively at higher ambient temperatures with a high [[dew point]] temperature. In cold climates, the process is less effective. Highest efficiency is reached above {{convert|20|C|F}} and 45% relative humidity. This [[relative humidity]] value is higher if the temperature of the air is lower. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.\n\nThis type of dehumidifier differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.\n\nIn addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier will always warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity more directly, by condensing and removing water.\n\n[[File:Heat recovery.gif|center|Diagram showing airflow through a heat-recovering dehumidifier]]\n\nWarm, moist air is drawn into the unit at A in the diagram above. This air passes into a crossflow plate heat exchanger (B) where a substantial proportion of the sensible heat is transferred to a cool supply air stream. This process brings the extracted air close to saturation. The air then passes to the plenum chamber of the extract fan (C) where a portion of it may be rejected to outside. The amount that is rejected can be varied and is\ndetermined either by legislation on fresh air requirements, or by the requirement to maintain a fresh, odour free environment. The balance of the air then passes into the evaporator coil of the heat pump where it is cooled and the moisture is condensed. This process yields substantial amounts of latent energy to the refrigeration circuit. Fresh air is then introduced to replace the amount that was extracted and the mix is discharged by the supply fan (G) to the crossflow plate exchanger (B) where it is heated by the extract air from the pool. This pre-warmed air then passes through the heat pump condenser (F) where it is heated by the latent energy removed during the condensation process as well as the energy input to the compressor. The warm dry air is then discharged to the room.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warmdrypools.co.uk/Casestudies/CarbonGobblers|title=Warm & Dry dehumidifiers heat recovery in dehumidifiers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924023544/https://warmdrypools.co.uk/Casestudies/CarbonGobblers|archivedate=24 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Conventional air conditioners===\nA conventional [[Air conditioning|air conditioner]] is very similar to an electric dehumidifier and inherently acts as a dehumidifier when chilling the air.<ref>{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=How Hot Do You Feel?|url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/blog/138-how-hot-do-you-feel|accessdate=26 February 2016}}</ref> In an air conditioner, however, the air passes over the cold evaporator coils and then directly into the room. It is not re-heated by passing over the condenser, as in a refrigeration dehumidifier. Instead, the refrigerant is pumped by the compressor to a condenser which is located outside the room to be conditioned, and the heat is then released to the outside air. Conventional air conditioners use additional energy exhausting air outside, and new air can have more moisture than the room needs, such as a pool room that already holds a high amount of moisture in the air.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swimming Pool Room Dehumidifiers - Top Systems and Units|url=http://www.dehumidifiercorp.com/swimming-pool-dehumidifiers|website=Dehumidifier Corporation of America|publisher=Dehumidifier Corporation of America|accessdate=16 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe water that condenses on the evaporator in an air conditioner is usually routed to remove extracted water from the conditioned space. Newer high-efficiency window units use the condensed water to help cool the [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser coil]] by evaporating the water into the outdoor air, while older units simply allowed the water to drip outside.\n\n===Spray dehumidifiers===\nWhen water is chilled below the atmospheric [[dewpoint]], atmospheric water will condense onto it faster than water evaporates from it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.airconditioning-systems.com/dehumidifier.html|title=Dehumidifier|accessdate=|website=airconditioning-systems.com}}</ref> Spray dehumidifiers mix sprays of chilled water and air to capture atmospheric moisture. They also capture pollutants and contaminants like pollen, for which purpose they are sometimes called \"air washers\".\n\n===Makeshift dehumidifiers===\nBecause window air conditioner units have condensers and expansion units, some of them can be used as makeshift dehumidifiers by sending their heat exhaust back into the same room as the cooled air, instead of the outside environment. If the condensate from the cooling coils is drained away from the room as it drips off the cooling coils, the result will be room air that is drier but slightly warmer.\n\nHowever, many window air conditioners are designed to dispose of condensate water by re-evaporating it into the exhaust air stream, which cancels out the air humidity decrease caused by the condensation of moisture on the cooling coils. To be effective as a dehumidifier, an air conditioner must be designed or modified so that most or all of the water that condenses is drained away in liquid form, rather than re-evaporated. Even if condensate is drained, a modified air conditioner is still less efficient than a single-purpose appliance with a design optimized for dehumidification. Dehumidifiers are designed to pass air directly over the cooling coils and then the heating coils in a single efficient pass through the device.\n\nIn addition, most air conditioners are controlled by a [[thermostat]] which senses temperature, rather than a [[humidistat]] that senses humidity and is typically used to control a dehumidifier. A thermostat is not designed for the control of humidity, and controls it poorly if at all.\n\n===Ice buildup===\nUnder certain conditions of temperature and humidity, [[ice]] can form on a refrigeration dehumidifier's [[evaporator coil]]s. The ice buildup can impede airflow and eventually form a solid block encasing the coils. This buildup prevents the dehumidifier from operating effectively, and can cause water damage if condensed water drips off the accumulated ice and not into the collection tray. In extreme cases, the ice can deform or distort mechanical elements, causing permanent damage.\n\nBetter-quality dehumidifiers may have a frost or ice sensor. These will turn off the machine and allow the ice-covered coils to warm and defrost. Once defrosted, the machine will automatically restart. Most ice sensors are simple [[thermal switch]]es and do not directly sense the presence or absence of ice buildup. An alternative design senses the impeded airflow and shuts off the cooling coils in a similar manner.\n\n===Thermoelectric dehumidifiers===\nThermoelectric dehumidifiers use a [[Thermoelectric cooling|Peltier heat pump]] to cool a surface and condense water vapor from the air. The design is simpler and has the benefit of being quieter compared to a dehumidifier with a mechanical compressor. However, because of its [[Thermoelectric cooling#Performance|relatively poor]] [[Coefficient of Performance]], this design is mainly used for small dehumidifiers. Ice buildup may be a problem, similar to problems with refrigeration dehumidifiers.\n\n==Absorption/desiccant dehumidification==\n{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Adsorption - Desiccant dehumidifier TTK 55 S.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Mobile Adsorption dehumidifier|Portable [[adsorption]] dehumidifier (a Trotec TTK)]]\nThis process uses a special humidity-absorbing material called a [[desiccant]], which is exposed to the air to be conditioned. The humidity-saturated material is then moved to a different location, where it is \"recharged\" to drive off the humidity, typically by heating it. The desiccant can be mounted on a belt or other means of transporting it during a cycle of operation.\n\nDehumidifiers which work according to the absorption principle are especially suited for high humidity levels at low temperatures. They are often used in various sectors in industry so that humidity levels below 35% can be achieved.\n\nBecause of the lack of compressor parts desiccant dehumidifiers are often lighter and quieter than compressor dehumidifiers. Desiccant dehumidifiers can also operate at lower temperatures than compressor dehumidifiers as the unit does not rely on cooled coils for which the moisture condensing efficiency decreases at lower temperatures.\n\n==Ionic membrane dehumidification==\nAn ionic membrane can be used to move humidity into or out of a sealed enclosure, operating at a molecular level without involving visible liquid water.\n\nThe solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) membrane is a low power, steady-state dehumidifier for enclosed areas where maintenance is difficult. The electrolytic process delivers dehumidifying capacities up to 0.2 grams/day from a 0.2 m\u00b3 (7 cu ft) space to 58 grams/day from an 8m\u00b3 (280 cu ft). SPE systems generally do not have high dehydration capacities, but because the water vapor is removed through electrolysis, the process is maintenance free. The process also requires very little electrical energy to operate, using no moving parts, making the ionic membranes silent in operation and very reliable over long periods of time. SPE dehumidifiers are typically used to protect sensitive electrical components, medical equipment, museum specimens, or scientific apparatus from humid environments.\n\nThe SPE consists of a proton-conductive solid polymer electrolyte and porous electrodes with a catalytic layer composed of noble metal particles.<ref name=\"RosahlWorks\">{{cite web|title=How Rosahl works|url=https://www.micro-dehumidifier.com/rosahl/how-does-rosahl-work-3/|work=Rosahl (website)|publisher=Ryosai Technica Company (Japan)|accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref> When a voltage is applied to the porous electrode attached to the membrane, the moisture on the [[anode]] side (dehumidifying side) dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and oxygen. The hydrogen ions migrate through membrane to be discharged on the cathode (moisture discharging) side where they react with oxygen in the air, resulting in water molecules (vapor), being discharged.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Applied Electrochemistry|volume=40|issue=12|pages=2153\u20132160|doi=10.1007/s10800-010-0197-4|title=Estimation of dehumidifying performance of solid polymer electrolytic dehumidifier for practical application|first1=Shuichi|last1=Sakuma|first2=Shiro|last2=Yamauchi|first3=Osamu|last3=Takai|publisher=Springerlink|year=2010}}</ref> Oxygen is released from the dehumidifying side and if a large amount of water is introduced to an airtight enclosure then oxygen can build up inside the enclosure.\n\n==Condensate==\n[[File:Mitsubishi Electric Oasis MJ-E16VX dehumidifier partially in parts 20071022.jpg|thumb|upright|Partially disassembled portable dehumidifier (a [[Mitsubishi Electric]] Oasis), with condensate bucket and white-colored float sensor visible at center]]\n\n===Disposal===\nProducts using condensation technology has traditionally been using a cold surface where humidity in warm air is condensed. Today the warm condensation technology based on the concept of over-saturated steam inside a closed environment makes it possible to dehumidify air at sub-zero temperatures. This is a very energy efficient technology and equally efficient in all temperatures.\n\nMost portable dehumidifiers are equipped with a condensate collection receptacle, typically with a [[Float (liquid level)|float sensor]] that detects when the collection vessel is full, to shut off the dehumidifier and prevent an overflow of collected water. In a warm humid environment, these buckets will generally fill with water in 8\u201312 hours, and may need to be manually emptied and replaced several times per day to ensure continued operation.\n\nMany portable dehumidifiers can also be adapted to connect the condensate drip output directly to a drain via a hose. Some dehumidifier models can tie into plumbing drains or use a built-in water pump to empty themselves as they collect moisture. Alternatively, a separate [[condensate pump]] may be used to move collected water to a disposal location when gravity drainage is not possible.\n\n[[Air conditioning#Central (ducted) air conditioning|Central air conditioning]] units typically need to be connected to a drain, because the quantity of condensate water generated by such systems can be quite large over time. If the condensate water is directed into the sewer system, it should be suitably [[Trap (plumbing)|trapped]]. Otherwise, back pressure can allow smells or sewer gases to enter the building. The condensate should not be directed into a [[septic system]] of a house, because large central air conditioning systems discharge water that does not need to be treated by septic systems. If the height of the [[air handler]] (containing the evaporator) is above the ground level or in the attic of a house, condensate lines can also often be routed into rain gutters. Air handlers located in the basement of a house require [[condensate pump]]s to pump the water up to ground level.\n\n===Potability===\nGenerally, dehumidifier water is considered a rather clean kind of [[greywater]]: not suitable for drinking, but acceptable for watering plants, though not garden vegetables.<ref name=\"treehugger\">{{cite web|first=John|last=Laumer|date=29 July 2005|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/07/can_i_water_my.php|title=Can I Water My Plants With It?|publisher=TreeHugger.com|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> The health concerns are:<ref name=\"treehugger\"/>{{better source|date=December 2017}}\n*The water may contain trace metals from [[solder]] and other metallic parts, most significantly [[lead]] (which is quite dangerous), but also [[copper]], [[aluminum]], or [[zinc]].
