In 2020 a new away team was chosen from Ireland. But leah was definitely not 1 of the chosen. The new leader will be a pure ledge with the same runners but will have his sack intack. \n\nA native of Allen view heights  Applewhite attended several universities, and as a young man, served in the [[United States Army]]. After finishing school at the tec, he taught music at the [[University of Alabama]]. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as the chair of the music department at the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]] in [[Houston]]. He left the school in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father's death a year later brought on severe depression. In 1972, he developed a close friendship with [[Bonnie Nettles]], a nurse; together, they discussed [[mysticism]] at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while and then began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to spread their views. They only gained one convert. In 1975, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for 6 months. In jail, he further developed his theology.\n\nAfter Applewhite's release, he traveled to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers that they would be visited by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]s who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that his followers and he would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from [[Christian eschatology]], the [[New Age movement]], and American [[popular culture]].\n\nThe group received an influx of funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s, the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of [[Comet Hale\u2013Bopp]] and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members died by mass suicide in their mansion. A [[media circus]] followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to die by suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to their faith in the narrative that he constructed.\n\n==Early life and education==\nMarshall Herff Applewhite Jr. was born in [[Spur, Texas]],{{sfn|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}} on May&nbsp;17, 1931, to Marshall Herff Applewhite Sr. (1901\u20131971) and his wife Louise (n\u00e9e Winfield; 1901\u20131988).<ref>[http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=TXbirthindex&gss=angs-d&new=1&rank=1&msT=1&gsfn_x=1&gsln=applewhite&gsln_x=1&MSAV=0&uidh=ff5&gl=&gst=&hc=50&fh=50&fsk=BEFpYewIgAAiTQAHYtM-61- Texas Birth Index, online at ancestry.com]</ref> He had three siblings.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Steinberg|1997|Harris|1997}} The son of a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], Applewhite became very religious as a child.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Raine|2005|2pp=102\u20133}}\n\nApplewhite attended [[Roy Miller High School|Corpus Christi High School]] and Austin College;{{sfnm|Davis|2000|1p=244|Steinberg|1997}} at the latter school, he was active in several student organizations and was moderately religious.{{sfn|Steinberg|1997}} He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1952 and subsequently enrolled at [[Union Presbyterian Seminary]] to study [[theology]], hoping to become a minister.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Raine|2005|2p=103}} He married Anne Pearce around that time, and they later had two children, Mark and Lane.{{sfnm|Urban|2000|1p=275|Steinberg|1997}} <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gw.geneanet.org/tdowling?lang=en&n=applewhite&oc=1&p=marshall+herff|title=Family tree of Marshall Herff Applewhite|website=Geneanet|language=en|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref> Early in his seminary studies, he decided to leave the school to pursue a career in music, becoming the music director of a Presbyterian church in [[North Carolina]].{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Steinberg|1997}} He was a [[baritone]] singer and enjoyed [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] and the music of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]].{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=150}} In 1954, he was drafted by the [[United States Army]] and served in [[Austria]] and [[New Mexico]] as a member of the [[Army Signal Corps]].{{sfn|Steinberg|1997}} He left the military in 1956 and enrolled at the [[University of Colorado]], where he earned a master's degree in music{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Steinberg|1997}} and focused on [[musical theater]].{{sfn|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}}\n\n==Career==\nApplewhite moved to [[New York City]] in an unsuccessful attempt to launch a professional singing career upon finishing his education in Colorado.{{sfn|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}} He then taught at the [[University of Alabama]].{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=355}} He lost his position there after pursuing a sexual relationship with a male student;{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=210}} his religious education was likely not supportive of same-sex relationships and he was subsequently frustrated by his sexual desires.{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=210|2a1=Raine|2y=2005|2p=107\u20138}} He separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in 1965, and they divorced three years later.{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=103|Lewis|2003|2p=111}}\n\nAfter leaving the University of Alabama, Applewhite moved to [[Houston]], Texas, in 1965 to teach at the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]].{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=103|Chryssides|2005|2p=355|Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2010|p=39}} His students regarded him as an engaging speaker and a stylish dresser.{{sfnm|Zeller|2006|1p=77|Bearak|1997}} He served as chair of the music department; he also became a locally popular singer, serving as the choral director of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church and performing with the [[Houston Grand Opera]].{{sfnm|Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2010|1p=39|Davis|2000|2p=245|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}} In Texas, he was briefly [[coming out|openly gay]], but also pursued a relationship with a young woman, who left him under pressure from her family, greatly upsetting him.{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=103|Bearak|1997}} He resigned from the University of St. Thomas in 1970, citing depression and other emotional problems.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Urban|2000|2p=276}} [[Robert Balch]] and David Taylor, sociologists who studied Applewhite's group, speculate that this departure was prompted by another affair between Applewhite and a student.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2003|p=215}} The president of the university later recalled that he was often mentally jumbled and disorganized near the end of his employment.{{sfn|Hall|2000|pp=150\u20131}}\n\nIn 1971, Applewhite briefly moved to New Mexico, where he operated a [[delicatessen]].

Applewhite and Nettles then split their followers into small groups, which they referred to as \"Star Clusters\".{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=357}}\n\nFrom 1976 to 1979, the group lived in campgrounds, usually in the [[Rocky Mountains]] or Texas.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}} Applewhite and Nettles began to place greater demands on their followers' heretofore loosely structured lives, which improved membership retention.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=246}} They typically communicated with their disciples in writing or through assistants.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2003|p=230}} Increasingly, they emphasized that they were the only source of truth\u2014the idea that members could receive individual revelations was rejected in an attempt to prevent schisms.{{sfnm|1a1=Zeller|1y=2006|1p=84|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=226}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=137}} Applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers, fearing that this could lead to insubordination.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=257}} Applewhite and Nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as \"flexibility\" - strict obedience to their often shifting requests.{{sfn|Davis|2000|pp=246 & 255}} The two leaders limited the group's contacts with those outside the movement, even some who may have been interested in joining, ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties. In practice, this made their followers completely dependent upon them.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=248}} Applewhite instructed his disciples to be like children or pets in their submission\u2014their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders.{{sfn|Davis|2000|pp=251 & 7}} Members were encouraged to constantly seek Applewhite's advice and often ask themselves what their leaders would do when making a decision.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=216}} To his followers, he did not seem dictatorial:{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=259}} many of them found him laid back and fatherly.{{sfnm|Lifton|2000|1pp=309\u201310|Lalich, \"Using the Bounded Choice Model\"|2004|2pp=233\u20135}} In his 2000 study of the group, Winston Davis states that Applewhite mastered the \"fine art of religious entertainment\", noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=259}} Applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to instill a sense of discipline in his followers; he referred to these tasks as \"games\".{{sfn|Balch|1995|p=156}} He also watched science-fiction television programs with the rest of the group.{{sfn|Daniels|1999|p=210}} Rather than issue direct commands, he attempted to express his preferences and nominally offer his disciples a choice.{{sfn|Lalich, \"Using the Bounded Choice Model\"|2004|pp=232\u20135}} He emphasized that students were free to disobey if they chose, in what Lalich dubs the \"illusion of choice\".{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=83}}\n\n==Housing and control==\nIn the late 1970s, the group received a large sum of money, possibly an inheritance of a member or donations of followers' income.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=357|Bearak|1997}} This capital was used to rent houses, initially in [[Denver]] and later in [[Dallas]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} Applewhite and Nettles had about 40&nbsp;followers then and lived in two or three houses; the leaders usually had their own house.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}} The group was secretive about their lifestyle, covering their windows.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} Applewhite and Nettles arranged their followers' lifestyles as a [[Recruit training|boot camp]] that would prepare them for the Next Level. Referring to their house as a \"craft\", they regimented the lives of their disciples to the minute.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=216}} Students who were not committed to this lifestyle were encouraged to leave; departing members were given financial assistance.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=216}} Lifton states that Applewhite wanted \"quality over quantity\" in his followers, although he occasionally spoke about gaining many converts.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|pp=309 & 320}}\n\nApplewhite and Nettles sometimes made sudden, drastic changes to the group.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=365}} On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|pp=216\u20137}} Lalich sees this as a way that they increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=90}} Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|pp=308\u20139}}\n\nIn 1980, Applewhite and Nettles had about 80&nbsp;followers,{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=91}} many of whom held jobs, often working with computers or as car mechanics.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} In 1982, Applewhite and Nettles allowed their disciples to call their families.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}} They further relaxed their control in 1983, permitting their followers to visit relatives on [[Mother's Day]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} They were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell their families that they were studying computers at a [[monastery]]. These vacations were intended to placate families by demonstrating that the disciples remained with the group of their own accord.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}}\n\n==Nettles' death==\nIn 1983, Nettles had an eye surgically removed as a result of cancer diagnosed several years earlier. She lived for two more years, dying in 1985. Applewhite told their followers that she had \"traveled to the Next Level\" because she had \"too much energy to remain on Earth\", abandoning her body to make the journey.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}}{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}} His attempt to explain her death in the terms of the group's doctrine was successful, preventing the departure of all but one member. Applewhite became very depressed.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}} He claimed that Nettles still communicated with him, but he suffered from a crisis of faith. His students supported him during this time, greatly encouraging him.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=218}} He then organized a ceremony in which he symbolically married his followers; Lalich views this as an attempt to ensure unity.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=92}} Applewhite told his followers that he had been left behind by Nettles because he still had more to learn\u2014he felt that she occupied \"a higher spiritual role\" than he did.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=92}}{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=214}} He began identifying her as \"the Father\" and often referred to her with [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns|male pronouns]].{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=62}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=78}}\n\nApplewhite began to emphasize a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as he needed the guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured no possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die.{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=88}} A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation;{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=56}} he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=62}} Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator.{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=88}} Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=138}}\n\nAfter Nettles' death, Applewhite also altered his view of ascension; previously, he had taught that the group would physically ascend from the Earth and that death caused reincarnation, but her death\u2014which left behind an unchanged, corporeal body\u2014forced him to say that the ascension could be spiritual.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2003|1p=113|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=209}} He then concluded that her spirit had traveled to a spaceship and received a new body and that  his followers and he would do the same.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=113}} In his view, the Biblical heaven was actually a planet on which highly evolved beings dwelt, and physical bodies were required to ascend there.{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=209|2a1=Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2y=2010|2p=44}} Applewhite believed that once they reached the Next Level, they would facilitate evolution on other planets.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=233}} He emphasized that Jesus, whom he believed was an extraterrestrial, came to Earth, was killed, and bodily rose from the dead before being transported onto a spaceship.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=106}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=126}} According to Applewhite's doctrine, Jesus was a gateway to heaven, but had found humanity unready to ascend when he first came to the Earth.{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=106|Woodward|1997}} Applewhite then decided that an opportunity existed for humans to reach the Next Level \"every two millennia\", and the early 1990s would therefore provide the first opportunity to reach the Kingdom of Heaven since the time of Jesus.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=363}} Zeller notes that his beliefs were based on the Christian Bible, but were interpreted through the lens of belief in alien contact with humanity.{{sfn|Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2010|p=35}}\n\nApplewhite taught that he was a [[walk-in]], a concept that had gained popularity in the New Age movement during the late 1970s. Walk-ins were said to be higher beings who took control of adult bodies to teach humanity. This concept informed Applewhite's view of resurrection; he believed that his group's souls were to be transported to a spaceship, where they would enter other bodies.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=114\u20136}} Applewhite abandoned the metaphor of a butterfly in favor of describing the body as a mere container,{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=107}} a vehicle that souls could enter and exit.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=141}} This dualism may have been the product of the Christology that Applewhite learned as a young man;{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=59}} Lewis writes that the group's teachings had \"Christian elements [that] were basically grafted on to a New Age matrix\".{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=106}} In a profile of the group for ''[[Newsweek]]'', Kenneth Woodward compares his dualism to that of ancient [[Christian Gnosticism]], although Peters notes that his theology departs from Gnosticism by privileging the physical world.{{sfnm|Peters|2003|1p=247|Woodward|1997}}\n\nIn the wake of Nettles' death, Applewhite became increasingly paranoid, fearing a conspiracy against his group.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=226}} One member who joined in the mid-1980s recalled that Applewhite avoided new converts, worrying that they were infiltrators.{{sfn|Miller|1997}} He feared a government raid on their home and spoke highly of the Jewish defenders of [[Masada]] in ancient Israel who showed total resistance to the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Zeller|2011|p=186}} Increasingly, he began to discuss the Apocalypse,{{sfn|Zeller|2006|pp=85\u20136}} comparing the Earth to an overgrown garden that was to be recycled or [[Reboot (computing)|rebooted]] and humanity to a failed experiment.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1pp=358 & 366|Gr\u00fcnschlo\u00df|2003|2p=28}} In accordance with the garden metaphor, he stated that the Earth would be \"spaded under\".{{sfn|Goerman|2011|p=61}} Woodward notes that Applewhite's teaching about the Earth's recycling is similar to the cyclical perspective of time found in Buddhism.{{sfn|Woodward|1997}} Applewhite also used New Age concepts,{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=106}} but he differed from that movement by predicting that apocalyptic, rather than utopian, changes would soon occur on Earth.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=118}} He contended that most humans had been brainwashed by [[Lucifer]], but that his followers could break free of this control.{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=114|Davis|2000|2p=244}} He specifically cited sexual urges as the work of Lucifer.{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=108}} In addition, he stated that evil extraterrestrials, who he referred to as \"Luciferians\", sought to thwart his mission.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} He argued that many prominent moral teachers and advocates of [[political correctness]] were actually Luciferians.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=250}} This theme emerged in 1988, possibly in response to the lurid [[alien abduction]] stories that were proliferating at the time.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=218}}\n\n==Obscurity and evangelism==\nIn the late 1980s, the group kept a low profile; few people knew it still existed.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=218}} In 1988, they mailed a document that detailed their beliefs to a variety of New Age organizations.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=219}} The mailing contained information about their history and advised people to read several books, which primarily focused on Christian history and UFOs.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=143}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=102}} With the exception of the 1988 document, Applewhite's group remained inconspicuous until 1992,{{sfnm|Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2010|1p=41|Chryssides|2005|2p=358}} when they recorded a 12-part video series which was broadcast via satellite.{{sfnm|1a1=Zeller|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=219}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=149}} This series echoed many of the teachings of the 1988 update, although it introduced a \"universal mind\" of which its hearers could partake.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=150}}{{sfn|Peters|2003|p=247}}\n\nOver the course of the group's existence, several hundred people joined and left.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=42}} In the early 1990s, their membership dwindled, numbering as few as 26;{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} these defections gave Applewhite a sense of urgency.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=219}} In May 1993, the group took the name \"Total Overcomers Anonymous\". They then spent $30,000 to publish a full-page advertisement in ''[[USA Today]]'' that warned of catastrophic judgment to befall the Earth.{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', \"Heaven's Gate: A Timeline\"|1997}}{{sfnm|1a1=Chryssides|1y=2005|1p=358|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=219}} Its publication led about 20&nbsp;former members to rejoin the group.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} This, along with a series of public lectures in 1994, caused membership to double from its nadir at the beginning of the decade.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} By this time, Applewhite did not regiment his disciples' lives as strictly as he had and spent less time with them.{{sfn|Miller|1997}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=95}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, Applewhite posted some of his teachings on the Internet, but he was stung by the resulting criticism.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=260}} That year, he first spoke of the possibility of suicide as a way to reach the Next Level.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=238}} He explained that everything \"human\" had to be forsaken, including the human body, before one could ascend.{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=87}} The organization was then renamed Heaven's Gate.{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=113}} Davis speculates that this rejection may have encouraged him to attempt to leave Earth.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=260}}\n\nFrom June to October 1995, the group lived in a rural part of New Mexico.{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', \"Heaven's Gate: A Timeline\"|1997}}{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=113}} They purchased {{convert|40|acre|sqkm}} and built a compound\u2014which they referred to as the \"Earth ship\"\u2014using tires and lumber;{{sfnm|Urban|2000|1p=276|Raine|2005|2p=113}} Applewhite hoped to establish a monastery.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} This proved to be a difficult endeavor, particularly for the aging Applewhite:{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=113}} he was in poor health and, at one point, feared that he had cancer.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=221}} Lifton notes that Applewhite's active leadership of the group probably led to severe fatigue in his last years.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=311}} The winter was very cold, and they abandoned the plan.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} Afterwards, they lived in several houses in the [[San Diego]] area.{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', \"Heaven's Gate: A Timeline\"|1997}}\n\nThe group increasingly focused on the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for [[surgical castration]].{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} They initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon, but eventually found one in [[Mexico]].{{sfnm|Lifton|2000|p=305|Jones|2007}} In Applewhite's view, sexuality was one of the most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no [[reproductive organs]], but that Luciferian beings had [[gender]]s.{{sfnm|Urban|2000|1p=286|Gr\u00fcnschlo\u00df|2003|2p=26}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=145}} He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=239}}{{efn|name=angels}} In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a nonsexual family.{{sfn|Raine|2005|pp=109\u201310}}\n\n==Mass suicide==\n[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp Death Valley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Comet Hale\u2013Bopp]] over California in April 1997]]\nIn October 1996, the group rented a mansion in [[Rancho Santa Fe, California]].{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', \"Heaven's Gate: A Timeline\"|1997}}{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} That year, they recorded two video messages in which they offered their viewers a \"last chance to evacuate Earth\".{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=86}} Around the same time, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale\u2013Bopp.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} Applewhite now believed that Nettles was aboard a spaceship trailing the comet, and that she planned to rendezvous with them.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=60}} He told his followers that the vessel would transport them to an [[empyrean]] destination, and that a government conspiracy was attempting to suppress word of the craft.{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=209|2a1=Zeller|2y=2011|2p=177}} In addition, he stated that his deceased followers would be taken by the vessel, as well, a belief that resembled the Christian [[pretribulation rapture]] doctrine.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=61}} How he learned of the comet or why he believed that it was accompanied by extraterrestrials or why he should have believed the dead Nettles would be with them is not known.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}}{{efn|name=art}}\n\nIn late March 1997, the group isolated themselves and recorded farewell statements.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=359}} Many members praised Applewhite in their final messages;{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=98}} Davis describes their remarks as \"regurgitations of Do's gospel\".{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=243}} Applewhite recorded a video shortly before his death, in which he termed the suicides the \"final exit\" of the group and remarked, \"We do in all honesty hate this world\".{{sfnm|Urban|2000|1p=279|Partridge|2006|2p=55}} Lewis speculates that Applewhite settled on suicide because he had said that the group would ascend during his lifetime, so appointing a successor was unfeasible.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=113}}\n\nReligious scholar [[Catherine Wessinger]] posits that the suicides began on March&nbsp;22.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=230}} Most members took [[barbiturate]]s and alcohol and then placed bags over their heads. They wore [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes and black uniforms with patches that read \"Heaven's Gate [[Away team (Star Trek term)|Away Team]]\".{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=209|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|2p=27}} A bag that contained a few dollars and a form of identification was placed beside most bodies.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=27}} The deaths occurred over 3 days; Applewhite was one of the last four to die. Three assistants helped him die by suicide, then killed themselves.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=224}} An anonymous tip led the sheriff's department to search the mansion;{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=28}} they found 39 bodies there on March&nbsp;26.{{sfnm|Lewis|2003|p=103|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}} It was the largest group suicide involving U.S. citizens since the 1978 mass suicide of 920 Americans in [[Jonestown]], [[Guyana]].{{sfnm|Wessinger|2000|1p=229|Daniels|1999|2p=204}} Applewhite's body was found seated on the bed of the mansion's master bedroom.{{sfn|Jones|2007}} [[Medical examiner]]s determined that his fears of cancer had been unfounded, but that he suffered from [[coronary atherosclerosis]].{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=311}}\n\nThe deaths provoked a [[media circus]],{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=30}} and Applewhite's face was featured on the covers of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''Newsweek'' on April&nbsp;7.{{sfn|McCutcheon|2003|pp=104\u20135}} His final message was widely broadcast; Hugh Urban of [[Ohio State University]] describes his appearance in the video as \"wild-eyed [and] rather alarming\".{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=275}}\n\n==Analysis==\nAlthough many popular commentators, including psychologist [[Margaret Singer]],{{sfn|Monmaney|1997}} speculate that Applewhite brainwashed his followers, many academics have rejected the \"brainwashing\" label as an oversimplification that does not express the nuances of the process by which the followers were influenced.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=241}} Lalich speculates that they were willing to follow Applewhite in suicide because they had become totally dependent upon him, hence were poorly suited for life in his absence.{{sfn|Lalich, \"Using the Bounded Choice Model\"|2004|pp=237\u20139}} Davis attributes Applewhite's success in convincing his followers to die by suicide to two factors: He isolated them socially and cultivated an attitude of complete religious obedience in them.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=242}} Applewhite's students had made a long-term commitment to him, and Balch and Taylor infer that this is why his interpretations of events appeared coherent to them.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=227}} Most of the dead had been members for about 20&nbsp;years,{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=28}} although there were a few recent converts.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=42}}\n\nLewis argues that Applewhite effectively controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=126}} Richard Hecht of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], echoes this sentiment, arguing that members of the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them.{{sfn|Monmaney|1997}} In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to die by suicide because they saw it as a way to demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=181}}\n\nUrban writes that Applewhite's life displays \"the intense ambivalence and alienation shared by many individuals lost in late 20th-century capitalist society\".{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=270}} He notes that Applewhite's condemnations of contemporary culture bear similarities to those of [[Jean Baudrillard]] at times, particularly their shared nihilist views.{{sfn|Urban|2000|pp=291\u20132}} Urban posits that Applewhite found no way other than suicide to escape the society that surrounded him and states that death offered him a way to escape its \"endless circle of seduction and consumption\".{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=271}}\n\nWhile covering the suicides, several media outlets focused on Applewhite's sexuality;{{sfn|Dahir|1997|pp=35\u20137}} the ''[[New York Post]]'' dubbed him \"the Gay Guru\".{{sfn|Lippert|1997|p=31}} Gay rights activist [[Troy Perry]] argued that Applewhite's repression, and society's rejection, of same-sex relationships ultimately led to his suicide. This idea has failed to gain support among academics.{{sfn|Dahir|1997|pp=35\u20137}} Zeller argues that Applewhite's sexuality was not the primary driving force behind his asceticism, which he believes resulted from a variety of factors, though he grants sexuality a role.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=122}}\n\nLalich states that Applewhite fit \"the traditional view of a charismatic leader\",{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=43}} and [[Evan Thomas]] deems him a \"master manipulator\".{{sfn|Goerman|2011|p=58}} Lifton compares Applewhite to [[Shoko Asahara]], the founder of [[Aum Shinrikyo]], describing him as \"equally controlling, his paranoia and megalomania gentler yet ever present\".{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=306}} [[Christopher Partridge]] of [[Lancaster University]] states that Applewhite and Nettles were similar to [[John Reeve (religious leader)|John Reeve]] and [[Lodowicke Muggleton]], who founded [[Muggletonianism]], a millennialist movement in 17th century England.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=50}}\n\n==Lane Applewhite Saenz==\nMarshall Applewhite's daughter, Lane Applewhite Saenz, is the mother of Hannah Overton, the Corpus Christi woman who was accused of poisoning her adopted son Andrew Byrd.

After finishing school at [[Austin College]], he taught music at the [[University of Alabama]]. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as the chair of the music department at the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]] in [[Houston]]. He left the school in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father's death a year later brought on severe depression. In 1972, he developed a close friendship with [[Bonnie Nettles]], a nurse; together, they discussed [[mysticism]] at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while and then began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to spread their views. They only gained one convert. In 1975, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for 6 months. In jail, he further developed his theology.\n\nAfter Applewhite's release, he traveled to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers that they would be visited by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]s who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that his followers and he would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from [[Christian eschatology]], the [[New Age movement]], and American [[popular culture]].\n\nThe group received an influx of funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s, the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of [[Comet Hale\u2013Bopp]] and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members died by mass suicide in their mansion. A [[media circus]] followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to die by suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to their faith in the narrative that he constructed.\n\n==Early life and education==\nMarshall Herff Applewhite Jr. was born in [[Spur, Texas]],{{sfn|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}} on May&nbsp;17, 1931, to Marshall Herff Applewhite Sr. (1901\u20131971) and his wife Louise (n\u00e9e Winfield; 1901\u20131988).<ref>[http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=TXbirthindex&gss=angs-d&new=1&rank=1&msT=1&gsfn_x=1&gsln=applewhite&gsln_x=1&MSAV=0&uidh=ff5&gl=&gst=&hc=50&fh=50&fsk=BEFpYewIgAAiTQAHYtM-61- Texas Birth Index, online at ancestry.com]</ref> He had three siblings.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Steinberg|1997|Harris|1997}} The son of a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], Applewhite became very religious as a child.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Raine|2005|2pp=102\u20133}}\n\nApplewhite attended [[Roy Miller High School|Corpus Christi High School]] and Austin College;{{sfnm|Davis|2000|1p=244|Steinberg|1997}} at the latter school, he was active in several student organizations and was moderately religious.{{sfn|Steinberg|1997}} He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1952 and subsequently enrolled at [[Union Presbyterian Seminary]] to study [[theology]], hoping to become a minister.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Raine|2005|2p=103}} He married Anne Pearce around that time, and they later had two children, Mark and Lane.{{sfnm|Urban|2000|1p=275|Steinberg|1997}} <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gw.geneanet.org/tdowling?lang=en&n=applewhite&oc=1&p=marshall+herff|title=Family tree of Marshall Herff Applewhite|website=Geneanet|language=en|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref> Early in his seminary studies, he decided to leave the school to pursue a career in music, becoming the music director of a Presbyterian church in [[North Carolina]].{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Steinberg|1997}} He was a [[baritone]] singer and enjoyed [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] and the music of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]].{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=150}} In 1954, he was drafted by the [[United States Army]] and served in [[Austria]] and [[New Mexico]] as a member of the [[Army Signal Corps]].{{sfn|Steinberg|1997}} He left the military in 1956 and enrolled at the [[University of Colorado]], where he earned a master's degree in music{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Steinberg|1997}} and focused on [[musical theater]].{{sfn|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}}\n\n==Career==\nApplewhite moved to [[New York City]] in an unsuccessful attempt to launch a professional singing career upon finishing his education in Colorado.{{sfn|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}} He then taught at the [[University of Alabama]].{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=355}} He lost his position there after pursuing a sexual relationship with a male student;{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=210}} his religious education was likely not supportive of same-sex relationships and he was subsequently frustrated by his sexual desires.{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=210|2a1=Raine|2y=2005|2p=107\u20138}} He separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in 1965, and they divorced three years later.{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=103|Lewis|2003|2p=111}}\n\nAfter leaving the University of Alabama, Applewhite moved to [[Houston]], Texas, in 1965 to teach at the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]].{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=103|Chryssides|2005|2p=355|Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2010|p=39}} His students regarded him as an engaging speaker and a stylish dresser.{{sfnm|Zeller|2006|1p=77|Bearak|1997}} He served as chair of the music department; he also became a locally popular singer, serving as the choral director of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church and performing with the [[Houston Grand Opera]].{{sfnm|Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2010|1p=39|Davis|2000|2p=245|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}} In Texas, he was briefly [[coming out|openly gay]], but also pursued a relationship with a young woman, who left him under pressure from her family, greatly upsetting him.{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=103|Bearak|1997}} He resigned from the University of St. Thomas in 1970, citing depression and other emotional problems.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Urban|2000|2p=276}} [[Robert Balch]] and David Taylor, sociologists who studied Applewhite's group, speculate that this departure was prompted by another affair between Applewhite and a student.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2003|p=215}} The president of the university later recalled that he was often mentally jumbled and disorganized near the end of his employment.{{sfn|Hall|2000|pp=150\u20131}}\n\nIn 1971, Applewhite briefly moved to New Mexico, where he operated a [[delicatessen]].

Applewhite and Nettles then split their followers into small groups, which they referred to as \"Star Clusters\".{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=357}}\n\nFrom 1976 to 1979, the group lived in campgrounds, usually in the [[Rocky Mountains]] or Texas.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}} Applewhite and Nettles began to place greater demands on their followers' heretofore loosely structured lives, which improved membership retention.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=246}} They typically communicated with their disciples in writing or through assistants.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2003|p=230}} Increasingly, they emphasized that they were the only source of truth\u2014the idea that members could receive individual revelations was rejected in an attempt to prevent schisms.{{sfnm|1a1=Zeller|1y=2006|1p=84|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=226}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=137}} Applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers, fearing that this could lead to insubordination.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=257}} Applewhite and Nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as \"flexibility\" - strict obedience to their often shifting requests.{{sfn|Davis|2000|pp=246 & 255}} The two leaders limited the group's contacts with those outside the movement, even some who may have been interested in joining, ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties. In practice, this made their followers completely dependent upon them.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=248}} Applewhite instructed his disciples to be like children or pets in their submission\u2014their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders.{{sfn|Davis|2000|pp=251 & 7}} Members were encouraged to constantly seek Applewhite's advice and often ask themselves what their leaders would do when making a decision.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=216}} To his followers, he did not seem dictatorial:{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=259}} many of them found him laid back and fatherly.{{sfnm|Lifton|2000|1pp=309\u201310|Lalich, \"Using the Bounded Choice Model\"|2004|2pp=233\u20135}} In his 2000 study of the group, Winston Davis states that Applewhite mastered the \"fine art of religious entertainment\", noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=259}} Applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to instill a sense of discipline in his followers; he referred to these tasks as \"games\".{{sfn|Balch|1995|p=156}} He also watched science-fiction television programs with the rest of the group.{{sfn|Daniels|1999|p=210}} Rather than issue direct commands, he attempted to express his preferences and nominally offer his disciples a choice.{{sfn|Lalich, \"Using the Bounded Choice Model\"|2004|pp=232\u20135}} He emphasized that students were free to disobey if they chose, in what Lalich dubs the \"illusion of choice\".{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=83}}\n\n==Housing and control==\nIn the late 1970s, the group received a large sum of money, possibly an inheritance of a member or donations of followers' income.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=357|Bearak|1997}} This capital was used to rent houses, initially in [[Denver]] and later in [[Dallas]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} Applewhite and Nettles had about 40&nbsp;followers then and lived in two or three houses; the leaders usually had their own house.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}} The group was secretive about their lifestyle, covering their windows.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} Applewhite and Nettles arranged their followers' lifestyles as a [[Recruit training|boot camp]] that would prepare them for the Next Level. Referring to their house as a \"craft\", they regimented the lives of their disciples to the minute.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=216}} Students who were not committed to this lifestyle were encouraged to leave; departing members were given financial assistance.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=216}} Lifton states that Applewhite wanted \"quality over quantity\" in his followers, although he occasionally spoke about gaining many converts.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|pp=309 & 320}}\n\nApplewhite and Nettles sometimes made sudden, drastic changes to the group.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=365}} On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|pp=216\u20137}} Lalich sees this as a way that they increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=90}} Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|pp=308\u20139}}\n\nIn 1980, Applewhite and Nettles had about 80&nbsp;followers,{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=91}} many of whom held jobs, often working with computers or as car mechanics.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} In 1982, Applewhite and Nettles allowed their disciples to call their families.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}} They further relaxed their control in 1983, permitting their followers to visit relatives on [[Mother's Day]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} They were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell their families that they were studying computers at a [[monastery]]. These vacations were intended to placate families by demonstrating that the disciples remained with the group of their own accord.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}}\n\n==Nettles' death==\nIn 1983, Nettles had an eye surgically removed as a result of cancer diagnosed several years earlier. She lived for two more years, dying in 1985. Applewhite told their followers that she had \"traveled to the Next Level\" because she had \"too much energy to remain on Earth\", abandoning her body to make the journey.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}}{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}} His attempt to explain her death in the terms of the group's doctrine was successful, preventing the departure of all but one member. Applewhite became very depressed.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}} He claimed that Nettles still communicated with him, but he suffered from a crisis of faith. His students supported him during this time, greatly encouraging him.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=218}} He then organized a ceremony in which he symbolically married his followers; Lalich views this as an attempt to ensure unity.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=92}} Applewhite told his followers that he had been left behind by Nettles because he still had more to learn\u2014he felt that she occupied \"a higher spiritual role\" than he did.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=92}}{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=214}} He began identifying her as \"the Father\" and often referred to her with [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns|male pronouns]].{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=62}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=78}}\n\nApplewhite began to emphasize a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as he needed the guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured no possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die.{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=88}} A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation;{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=56}} he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=62}} Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator.{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=88}} Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=138}}\n\nAfter Nettles' death, Applewhite also altered his view of ascension; previously, he had taught that the group would physically ascend from the Earth and that death caused reincarnation, but her death\u2014which left behind an unchanged, corporeal body\u2014forced him to say that the ascension could be spiritual.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2003|1p=113|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=209}} He then concluded that her spirit had traveled to a spaceship and received a new body and that  his followers and he would do the same.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=113}} In his view, the Biblical heaven was actually a planet on which highly evolved beings dwelt, and physical bodies were required to ascend there.{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=209|2a1=Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2y=2010|2p=44}} Applewhite believed that once they reached the Next Level, they would facilitate evolution on other planets.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=233}} He emphasized that Jesus, whom he believed was an extraterrestrial, came to Earth, was killed, and bodily rose from the dead before being transported onto a spaceship.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=106}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=126}} According to Applewhite's doctrine, Jesus was a gateway to heaven, but had found humanity unready to ascend when he first came to the Earth.{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=106|Woodward|1997}} Applewhite then decided that an opportunity existed for humans to reach the Next Level \"every two millennia\", and the early 1990s would therefore provide the first opportunity to reach the Kingdom of Heaven since the time of Jesus.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=363}} Zeller notes that his beliefs were based on the Christian Bible, but were interpreted through the lens of belief in alien contact with humanity.{{sfn|Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2010|p=35}}\n\nApplewhite taught that he was a [[walk-in]], a concept that had gained popularity in the New Age movement during the late 1970s. Walk-ins were said to be higher beings who took control of adult bodies to teach humanity. This concept informed Applewhite's view of resurrection; he believed that his group's souls were to be transported to a spaceship, where they would enter other bodies.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=114\u20136}} Applewhite abandoned the metaphor of a butterfly in favor of describing the body as a mere container,{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=107}} a vehicle that souls could enter and exit.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=141}} This dualism may have been the product of the Christology that Applewhite learned as a young man;{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=59}} Lewis writes that the group's teachings had \"Christian elements [that] were basically grafted on to a New Age matrix\".{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=106}} In a profile of the group for ''[[Newsweek]]'', Kenneth Woodward compares his dualism to that of ancient [[Christian Gnosticism]], although Peters notes that his theology departs from Gnosticism by privileging the physical world.{{sfnm|Peters|2003|1p=247|Woodward|1997}}\n\nIn the wake of Nettles' death, Applewhite became increasingly paranoid, fearing a conspiracy against his group.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=226}} One member who joined in the mid-1980s recalled that Applewhite avoided new converts, worrying that they were infiltrators.{{sfn|Miller|1997}} He feared a government raid on their home and spoke highly of the Jewish defenders of [[Masada]] in ancient Israel who showed total resistance to the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Zeller|2011|p=186}} Increasingly, he began to discuss the Apocalypse,{{sfn|Zeller|2006|pp=85\u20136}} comparing the Earth to an overgrown garden that was to be recycled or [[Reboot (computing)|rebooted]] and humanity to a failed experiment.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1pp=358 & 366|Gr\u00fcnschlo\u00df|2003|2p=28}} In accordance with the garden metaphor, he stated that the Earth would be \"spaded under\".{{sfn|Goerman|2011|p=61}} Woodward notes that Applewhite's teaching about the Earth's recycling is similar to the cyclical perspective of time found in Buddhism.{{sfn|Woodward|1997}} Applewhite also used New Age concepts,{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=106}} but he differed from that movement by predicting that apocalyptic, rather than utopian, changes would soon occur on Earth.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=118}} He contended that most humans had been brainwashed by [[Lucifer]], but that his followers could break free of this control.{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=114|Davis|2000|2p=244}} He specifically cited sexual urges as the work of Lucifer.{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=108}} In addition, he stated that evil extraterrestrials, who he referred to as \"Luciferians\", sought to thwart his mission.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} He argued that many prominent moral teachers and advocates of [[political correctness]] were actually Luciferians.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=250}} This theme emerged in 1988, possibly in response to the lurid [[alien abduction]] stories that were proliferating at the time.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=218}}\n\n==Obscurity and evangelism==\nIn the late 1980s, the group kept a low profile; few people knew it still existed.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=218}} In 1988, they mailed a document that detailed their beliefs to a variety of New Age organizations.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=219}} The mailing contained information about their history and advised people to read several books, which primarily focused on Christian history and UFOs.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=143}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=102}} With the exception of the 1988 document, Applewhite's group remained inconspicuous until 1992,{{sfnm|Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2010|1p=41|Chryssides|2005|2p=358}} when they recorded a 12-part video series which was broadcast via satellite.{{sfnm|1a1=Zeller|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=219}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=149}} This series echoed many of the teachings of the 1988 update, although it introduced a \"universal mind\" of which its hearers could partake.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=150}}{{sfn|Peters|2003|p=247}}\n\nOver the course of the group's existence, several hundred people joined and left.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=42}} In the early 1990s, their membership dwindled, numbering as few as 26;{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} these defections gave Applewhite a sense of urgency.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=219}} In May 1993, the group took the name \"Total Overcomers Anonymous\". They then spent $30,000 to publish a full-page advertisement in ''[[USA Today]]'' that warned of catastrophic judgment to befall the Earth.{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', \"Heaven's Gate: A Timeline\"|1997}}{{sfnm|1a1=Chryssides|1y=2005|1p=358|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=219}} Its publication led about 20&nbsp;former members to rejoin the group.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} This, along with a series of public lectures in 1994, caused membership to double from its nadir at the beginning of the decade.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} By this time, Applewhite did not regiment his disciples' lives as strictly as he had and spent less time with them.{{sfn|Miller|1997}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=95}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, Applewhite posted some of his teachings on the Internet, but he was stung by the resulting criticism.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=260}} That year, he first spoke of the possibility of suicide as a way to reach the Next Level.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=238}} He explained that everything \"human\" had to be forsaken, including the human body, before one could ascend.{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=87}} The organization was then renamed Heaven's Gate.{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=113}} Davis speculates that this rejection may have encouraged him to attempt to leave Earth.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=260}}\n\nFrom June to October 1995, the group lived in a rural part of New Mexico.{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', \"Heaven's Gate: A Timeline\"|1997}}{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=113}} They purchased {{convert|40|acre|sqkm}} and built a compound\u2014which they referred to as the \"Earth ship\"\u2014using tires and lumber;{{sfnm|Urban|2000|1p=276|Raine|2005|2p=113}} Applewhite hoped to establish a monastery.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} This proved to be a difficult endeavor, particularly for the aging Applewhite:{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=113}} he was in poor health and, at one point, feared that he had cancer.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=221}} Lifton notes that Applewhite's active leadership of the group probably led to severe fatigue in his last years.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=311}} The winter was very cold, and they abandoned the plan.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} Afterwards, they lived in several houses in the [[San Diego]] area.{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', \"Heaven's Gate: A Timeline\"|1997}}\n\nThe group increasingly focused on the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for [[surgical castration]].{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} They initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon, but eventually found one in [[Mexico]].{{sfnm|Lifton|2000|p=305|Jones|2007}} In Applewhite's view, sexuality was one of the most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no [[reproductive organs]], but that Luciferian beings had [[gender]]s.{{sfnm|Urban|2000|1p=286|Gr\u00fcnschlo\u00df|2003|2p=26}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=145}} He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=239}}{{efn|name=angels}} In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a nonsexual family.{{sfn|Raine|2005|pp=109\u201310}}\n\n==Mass suicide==\n[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp Death Valley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Comet Hale\u2013Bopp]] over California in April 1997]]\nIn October 1996, the group rented a mansion in [[Rancho Santa Fe, California]].{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', \"Heaven's Gate: A Timeline\"|1997}}{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} That year, they recorded two video messages in which they offered their viewers a \"last chance to evacuate Earth\".{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=86}} Around the same time, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale\u2013Bopp.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} Applewhite now believed that Nettles was aboard a spaceship trailing the comet, and that she planned to rendezvous with them.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=60}} He told his followers that the vessel would transport them to an [[empyrean]] destination, and that a government conspiracy was attempting to suppress word of the craft.{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=209|2a1=Zeller|2y=2011|2p=177}} In addition, he stated that his deceased followers would be taken by the vessel, as well, a belief that resembled the Christian [[pretribulation rapture]] doctrine.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=61}} How he learned of the comet or why he believed that it was accompanied by extraterrestrials or why he should have believed the dead Nettles would be with them is not known.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}}{{efn|name=art}}\n\nIn late March 1997, the group isolated themselves and recorded farewell statements.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=359}} Many members praised Applewhite in their final messages;{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=98}} Davis describes their remarks as \"regurgitations of Do's gospel\".{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=243}} Applewhite recorded a video shortly before his death, in which he termed the suicides the \"final exit\" of the group and remarked, \"We do in all honesty hate this world\".{{sfnm|Urban|2000|1p=279|Partridge|2006|2p=55}} Lewis speculates that Applewhite settled on suicide because he had said that the group would ascend during his lifetime, so appointing a successor was unfeasible.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=113}}\n\nReligious scholar [[Catherine Wessinger]] posits that the suicides began on March&nbsp;22.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=230}} Most members took [[barbiturate]]s and alcohol and then placed bags over their heads. They wore [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes and black uniforms with patches that read \"Heaven's Gate [[Away team (Star Trek term)|Away Team]]\".{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=209|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|2p=27}} A bag that contained a few dollars and a form of identification was placed beside most bodies.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=27}} The deaths occurred over 3 days; Applewhite was one of the last four to die. Three assistants helped him die by suicide, then killed themselves.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=224}} An anonymous tip led the sheriff's department to search the mansion;{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=28}} they found 39 bodies there on March&nbsp;26.{{sfnm|Lewis|2003|p=103|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}} It was the largest group suicide involving U.S. citizens since the 1978 mass suicide of 920 Americans in [[Jonestown]], [[Guyana]].{{sfnm|Wessinger|2000|1p=229|Daniels|1999|2p=204}} Applewhite's body was found seated on the bed of the mansion's master bedroom.{{sfn|Jones|2007}} [[Medical examiner]]s determined that his fears of cancer had been unfounded, but that he suffered from [[coronary atherosclerosis]].{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=311}}\n\nThe deaths provoked a [[media circus]],{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=30}} and Applewhite's face was featured on the covers of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''Newsweek'' on April&nbsp;7.{{sfn|McCutcheon|2003|pp=104\u20135}} His final message was widely broadcast; Hugh Urban of [[Ohio State University]] describes his appearance in the video as \"wild-eyed [and] rather alarming\".{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=275}}\n\n==Analysis==\nAlthough many popular commentators, including psychologist [[Margaret Singer]],{{sfn|Monmaney|1997}} speculate that Applewhite brainwashed his followers, many academics have rejected the \"brainwashing\" label as an oversimplification that does not express the nuances of the process by which the followers were influenced.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=241}} Lalich speculates that they were willing to follow Applewhite in suicide because they had become totally dependent upon him, hence were poorly suited for life in his absence.{{sfn|Lalich, \"Using the Bounded Choice Model\"|2004|pp=237\u20139}} Davis attributes Applewhite's success in convincing his followers to die by suicide to two factors: He isolated them socially and cultivated an attitude of complete religious obedience in them.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=242}} Applewhite's students had made a long-term commitment to him, and Balch and Taylor infer that this is why his interpretations of events appeared coherent to them.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=227}} Most of the dead had been members for about 20&nbsp;years,{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=28}} although there were a few recent converts.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=42}}\n\nLewis argues that Applewhite effectively controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=126}} Richard Hecht of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], echoes this sentiment, arguing that members of the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them.{{sfn|Monmaney|1997}} In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to die by suicide because they saw it as a way to demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=181}}\n\nUrban writes that Applewhite's life displays \"the intense ambivalence and alienation shared by many individuals lost in late 20th-century capitalist society\".{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=270}} He notes that Applewhite's condemnations of contemporary culture bear similarities to those of [[Jean Baudrillard]] at times, particularly their shared nihilist views.{{sfn|Urban|2000|pp=291\u20132}} Urban posits that Applewhite found no way other than suicide to escape the society that surrounded him and states that death offered him a way to escape its \"endless circle of seduction and consumption\".{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=271}}\n\nWhile covering the suicides, several media outlets focused on Applewhite's sexuality;{{sfn|Dahir|1997|pp=35\u20137}} the ''[[New York Post]]'' dubbed him \"the Gay Guru\".{{sfn|Lippert|1997|p=31}} Gay rights activist [[Troy Perry]] argued that Applewhite's repression, and society's rejection, of same-sex relationships ultimately led to his suicide. This idea has failed to gain support among academics.{{sfn|Dahir|1997|pp=35\u20137}} Zeller argues that Applewhite's sexuality was not the primary driving force behind his asceticism, which he believes resulted from a variety of factors, though he grants sexuality a role.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=122}}\n\nLalich states that Applewhite fit \"the traditional view of a charismatic leader\",{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=43}} and [[Evan Thomas]] deems him a \"master manipulator\".{{sfn|Goerman|2011|p=58}} Lifton compares Applewhite to [[Shoko Asahara]], the founder of [[Aum Shinrikyo]], describing him as \"equally controlling, his paranoia and megalomania gentler yet ever present\".{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=306}} [[Christopher Partridge]] of [[Lancaster University]] states that Applewhite and Nettles were similar to [[John Reeve (religious leader)|John Reeve]] and [[Lodowicke Muggleton]], who founded [[Muggletonianism]], a millennialist movement in 17th century England.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=50}}\n\n==Lane Applewhite Saenz==\nMarshall Applewhite's daughter, Lane Applewhite Saenz, is the mother of Hannah Overton, the Corpus Christi woman who was accused of poisoning her adopted son Andrew Byrd.

The club colours are orange and black and the team currently plays in the [[Belgian Second Division]]. Their home stadium is the 7,515-capacity Burgemeester Van de Wiele Stadion.\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded on 12 March 1926. On 20 March, the recognition of the Belgian Football Association was received, the club was assigned SK number 818 as SK Deinze. Some important figures during the foundation were children's car manufacturer Emile Torck, his son Georges Torck and garage owner Albert Van Den Poel. They played on a site near Astenedreef. In the following years Deinze almost always played in the higher provincial series.\n\nIn 1940 the activities were interrupted, the site had been transformed into a junkyard. During the Second World War, the association was further expanded under President Georges Torck and Vice President Achiel De Clercq, as well as hockey, swimming and table tennis. From 1946 it was kept with football again.\n\nIn the following years, the club's rise continued, playing in the national promotion series or in the highest provincial series. In 1978 the team moved to the new Burgemeester Van de Wiele Stadium in De Brielmeersen, laid out by the city council. In 1982 Deinze last played in the provincial departments, that year another promotion to promotion was enforced. In 1988, Georges Torck retired as chairman, CEO Marc Hoste succeeded him.\n\nIn 1992 and 1993, Deinze celebrated two consecutive championship titles, making it second national. In 1997, the club reached the final round under the leadership of trainer Eddy Mestdagh, but a promotion to first class did not work. In 2001 Deinze only through additional sports grounds could ensure conservation in second class, when KFC Turnhout (become the second was) received a license from the Belgian FA and relegated.\n\nAt the end of the 2008\u201309 season, Deinze relegated to third division, where it spent six seasons. In the 2009\u201310 season, Deinze was allowed to participate in the final round for promotion, but lost to ROC de Charleroi-Marchienne. Three years later, Deinze also fought for promotion via the final round. The club had only finished thirteenth that season, but had won a period title. In the final round was lost to KRC Mechelen. A year later (season 2013\u201314) Deinze took part in the final round again, but lost to Union Saint-Gilloise. A year later, the promotion to second class finally followed.\n\nSince the league reform in 2016, Deinze played in the First Division amateurs.\n\nIn 2017, the club bought the Mayor Van de Wielestadion for \u20ac521,000 from the city.<ref>http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws-uit-deinze/sk-deinze-koopt-stadion-en-zoekt-nieuwe-naam-a3127068/ Artikel krant Het Laatste Nieuws op 07/04/2017</ref>\n\nFrom the 2020\u201321 season, Deinze will play in First Division B (football Belgium), after having been in first place when the competition came to an end in 2019\u201320.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kogel is door de kerk: Deinze komt volgend seizoen de profs vervoegen!|url=http://www.proximus-sports.be/nl/voetbal/proximus-league/artikel/2032404/kogel-is-door-de-kerk-deinze-komt-volgend-seizoen-de-profs-vervoegen|author=7 u geleden {{!}} Proximus|work=proximus-sports.be|accessdate=2020-03-27|language=nl}}</ref>\n\n==Current squad==\n{{updated|3 April 2020}}\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1 |pos=GK |nat=BEL |name=Gillian Verbrugge}}\n{{Fs player|no= 2 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=[[Bart Goossens]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 3 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=Viktor Boone}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=[[Arnaud De Greef]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=Gauthier Libbrecht}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6 |pos=MF |nat=FRA |name=[[Flavien Le Postollec]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=[[Alessio Staelens]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=[[Mehdi Tarfi]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9 |pos=FW |nat=BEL |name=Lennart Mertens}}\n{{Fs player|no=11 |pos=FW |nat=BEL |name=Youssef Challouk}}\n{{Fs player|no=12 |pos=FW |nat=BEL |name=Gert Van Walle}}\n{{Fs player|no=13 |pos=GK |nat=BEL |name=Jelle Merckx}}\n{{Fs player|no=14 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=[[Mathias Schils]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=15 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=Michiel De Looze}}\n{{Fs player|no=16 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=Seppe Brulmans}}\n{{Fs player|no=17 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=[[Jannes Vansteenkiste]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=18 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=Mauro Devos}}\n{{Fs player|no=19 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=Brendan Schoonbaert|other=<small>on loan from [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=20 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=Lennert De Smul}}\n{{Fs player|no=21 |pos=FW |nat=FRA |name=Jer\u00f4me Mezine}}\n{{Fs player|no=22 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=[[Mathieu De Smet]]|other=<small>on loan from [[S.V.

In 1982 Deinze last played in the provincial departments, that year another promotion to promotion was enforced. In 1988, Georges Torck retired as chairman, CEO Marc Hoste succeeded him.\n\nIn 1992 and 1993, Deinze celebrated two consecutive championship titles, making it second national . In 1997, the club reached the final round under the leadership of trainer Eddy Mestdagh, but a promotion to first class did not work. In 2001 Deinze only through additional sports grounds could ensure conservation in second class, when KFC Turnhout (become the second was) received a license from the Belgian FA and relegated.\n\nAt the end of the 2008-2009 season, Deinze relegated to third division , where it spent six seasons. In the 2009-2010 season , Deinze was allowed to participate in the final round for promotion, but lost to ROC de Charleroi-Marchienne . Three years later, Deinze also fought for promotion via the final round. The club had only finished thirteenth that season, but had won a period title. In the final round was lost to KRC Mechelen . A year later ( season 2013-2014 ) Deinze took part in the final round again, but lost to Union Saint-Gilloise . A year later, the promotion to second class finally followed.\n\nSince the league reform in 2016, Deinze played in the First Division amateurs .\n\nIn 2017, the club bought the Mayor Van de Wielestadion for 521,000 euros from the city.<ref>http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws-uit-deinze/sk-deinze-koopt-stadion-en-zoekt-nieuwe-naam-a3127068/ Artikel krant Het Laatste Nieuws op 07/04/2017</ref>\n\nFrom the 2020-2021 season, Deinze will play in First Division B (football Belgium) , after having been in first place when the competition came to an end in 2019-2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kogel is door de kerk: Deinze komt volgend seizoen de profs vervoegen!|url=http://www.proximus-sports.be/nl/voetbal/proximus-league/artikel/2032404/kogel-is-door-de-kerk-deinze-komt-volgend-seizoen-de-profs-vervoegen|author=7 u geleden {{!}} Proximus|work=proximus-sports.be|accessdate=2020-03-27|language=nl}}</ref>\n\n==Current squad==\n{{updated|3 April 2020}}\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1 |pos=GK |nat=BEL |name=Gillian Verbrugge}}\n{{Fs player|no= 2 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=[[Bart Goossens]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 3 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=Viktor Boone}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=[[Arnaud De Greef]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=Gauthier Libbrecht}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6 |pos=MF |nat=FRA |name=[[Flavien Le Postollec]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=[[Alessio Staelens]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=[[Mehdi Tarfi]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9 |pos=FW |nat=BEL |name=Lennart Mertens}}\n{{Fs player|no=11 |pos=FW |nat=BEL |name=Youssef Challouk}}\n{{Fs player|no=12 |pos=FW |nat=BEL |name=Gert Van Walle}}\n{{Fs player|no=13 |pos=GK |nat=BEL |name=Jelle Merckx}}\n{{Fs player|no=14 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=[[Mathias Schils]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=15 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=Michiel De Looze}}\n{{Fs player|no=16 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=Seppe Brulmans}}\n{{Fs player|no=17 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=[[Jannes Vansteenkiste]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=18 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=Mauro Devos}}\n{{Fs player|no=19 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=Brendan Schoonbaert|other=<small>on loan from [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=20 |pos=DF |nat=BEL |name=Lennert De Smul}}\n{{Fs player|no=21 |pos=FW |nat=FRA |name=Jer\u00f4me Mezine}}\n{{Fs player|no=22 |pos=MF |nat=BEL |name=[[Mathieu De Smet]]|other=<small>on loan from [[S.V.

Chelsea did not face Fulham between 1986 and 2001, and have played Brentford only twice since 1950. QPR did not face Brentford between 1966 and 2001, and did not play Chelsea between 1996 and 2008. The derby's most common match, Chelsea vs Fulham, has taken place 75 times. By contrast, the [[North London derby]] has been contested almost 200 times, and the [[Merseyside derby]] over 230 times. The 2011\u201312 campaign was the first instance of three of the west London clubs competing in the top flight in the same season: Chelsea, Fulham and QPR.\n\nAccording to the 2012 Football Rivalries Survey, Fulham regard Chelsea as their main rivals, QPR as their secondary rivals and then Brentford third. QPR fans identified Chelsea as their main rivals, Fulham second Brentford third and [[Cardiff City]]/[[Stoke City]] joint fourth. Brentford fans chose Fulham as their main rivals, QPR as their secondary rivals and Chelsea as their third. Chelsea fans did not list two of the West London sides only listing Fulham, instead selecting [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Manchester United]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thechriswhitingshow.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/2012-football-rivalry-census-results/ |title=2012\u201313 Football Rivalry Survey Results |last=Whiting |first=Chris |date=28 August 2012 |access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n{{Location map+|Greater London |width=370 |float=right |caption=Locations of the home stadiums of the four West London teams\n |places =\n {{location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.481667 |long=-0.191111 |mark=Blue 000080 pog.svg |label='''[[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]''' |label_size=20 |position=right}}\n {{location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.509167 |long=-0.232222 |mark=Blue 000080 pog.svg |label='''[[Loftus Road]]''' |label_size=20 |position=right}}\n {{location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.475000 |long=-0.221667 |mark=Steel pog.svg |label='''[[Craven Cottage]]''' |label_size=20 |position=bottom}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.488183 |long=-0.302639 |mark=Red pog.svg |label='''[[Griffin Park]]''' |label_size=20 |position=left}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.487826382 |long=-0.28655218712 |mark=Red pog.svg |label='''[[Brentford Community Stadium]]''' |label_size=20 |position=top}}\n}}\n===Brentford vs Chelsea derby===\nThere is very little rivalry between Brentford and Chelsea, mainly due to the fact that they have been in different divisions for over 60 years. The only time that the two clubs ever shared a division was in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]] between 1935 and 1947, but despite the fact that both clubs are local to each other, it was never seen as a big rivalry to either side, as Chelsea had been in the [[Football League]] for a longer period of time than Brentford and had stronger rivalries with the likes of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], whereas Brentford's main rivals are Fulham and QPR. Also Brentford developed a bigger sporting rivalry with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] during the 1930s as both clubs vied for the title of being London's number one club. \n\nThe only bad feeling between the clubs was soon after Chelsea's foundation and admission into the Football League in 1905, the other West London clubs, including Brentford, lost many supporters and potential supporters to the only professional Football League club in the area. Other than that, Brentford and Chelsea have always had fairly good relations, even amongst supporters. In fact, during the 1970s many Chelsea fans would come down to [[Griffin Park]] if their club were playing away. Chelsea reserves play their games at Griffin Park, and occasionally a pre season friendly is staged between the two clubs.\n\nBrentford and Chelsea met for the first time since 1950 on 27 January 2013 in an FA Cup 4th round tie at Griffin Park which ended in a 2\u20132 draw. Chelsea won the replay on 17 February 2013 at Stamford Bridge 4\u20130.\n\nTheir latest meeting was on 28 January 2017 when [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] won 4\u20130 in the [[2016\u201317 FA Cup]].\n\n===Brentford vs Fulham derby===\nFulham and Brentford have competed at the same level for a few periods in their history with the rivalry being fiercest during Fulham's descent to the lower leagues in the 1980s and early '90s. The two teams frequently competed between the [[1928\u201329 in English football|1920s]] and the [[1953\u201354 in English football|1950s]] in the Football League\u2018s various divisions. These games always drew bumper crowds and often caused tension on the pitch and the terraces. However, Fulham\u2019s fortunes on the pitch changed and they went on to play in the upper leagues for several decades until the two sides were to meet regularly again from [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980]] onwards, a time when the rivalry was most heated. Fulham later went on to win the London Derby cup.\n\nThe two clubs spent a majority of seasons in the same division until the [[1997\u201398 Football League Second Division|1997\u201398 Division Two]] campaign, which ended with Brentford suffering relegation to [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]]. Despite Brentford's promotion straight back to Division Two as Division Three champions in the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, Fulham were crowned Division Two champions and ascended to the [[Premier League]] as [[Football League Division One|Division One]] champions in 2001.\n\nThe [[2014\u201315 Football League Championship]] season brought Brentford and Fulham together in the same division for the first time since 1998, following Brentford's promotion from [[Football League One|League One]] and Fulham's relegation from the Premier League. On 21 November, Brentford won at home 2\u20131, sending them to within one point of the leaders of the Championship and Fulham to within three points of relegation to League One.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30048366|title=Brentford 2\u20131 Fulham|date=21 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nPrior to meeting in the league, the two sides were drawn together in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] second round on 26 August 2014, with Fulham winning 1\u20130 at Griffin Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentfordfc.co.uk/news/article/brentford-v-fulham-coc-26.08.14-1877031.aspx|title=Brentford v Fulham Capital One Cup Second Round team line-ups and match report|first=Chris|last=Wickham|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> It was the clubs' first meeting in any competitive fixture since a 2\u20130 league victory to Fulham on 11 April 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/brentford-v-fulham-11-april-1998-183065/|title=Brentford v Fulham, 11 April 1998|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nTheir latest meeting was on 29 April 2017 at Craven Cottage, resulting in a 1\u20131 draw.\n\nThe 2019/20 season will see the last derby at Griffin Park between these teams, after Fulham were relegated from the Premier League. The latest derby at Griffin Park was 3\u20131 to Brentford on 2 December 2017.\n\n=== Brentford vs QPR derby ===\nAs with Fulham, Brentford and [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] played each other frequently in local cup competitions and leagues from the foundation of both clubs. In [[1920\u201321 in English football|1920]], the Football League absorbed many clubs from the [[Southern Football League]], including Brentford and QPR, who competed in the old [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division (South)]] regularly in the 1920s, until Brentford\u2019s rise up the leagues in the 1930s. After the Second World War, they spent practically every season in the same division for the next 20 years. At the time, the fixture was each side\u2019s biggest game of the season and always attracted a big crowd. However, in [[1965\u201366 in English football|1966]], despite an opening day 6\u20131 thrashing of their local rivals, Brentford were ultimately relegated whilst QPR were promoted and went on to enjoy many seasons in the upper leagues.\n\nHowever, the bad feeling between the clubs runs deeper than just locality. In 1967, QPR attempted a takeover of Brentford, which would have resulted in QPR moving into Griffin Park and Brentford F.C. ceasing to exist. The story infamously broke in the London press but Brentford supporters rallied to save their club. Since then, relations between the clubs have been frosty. The rivalry resumed in [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001]] and continued for several seasons until Rangers were promoted. During this time, the rivalry was intensified by Brentford player [[Martin Rowlands]] leaving to join QPR. He then went on to kiss his badge on several occasions in front of the Brentford support when the two sides met in 2003 at [[Loftus Road]].\n\nThe most recent meeting between Brentford and Queens Park Rangers was in [[2019-20 in English football|2020]], with [[Brentford]] winning 3-1 at [[Griffin Park]] on 11 January 2020.\n\n===Chelsea vs Fulham derby===\n[[File:ChelseaFulhamQPRsat.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Few English football teams are as geographically close as neighbours as Fulham and Chelsea. This satellite image of West London shows Fulham's Craven Cottage (circled in white) and Chelsea's Stamford Bridge (blue), just 2.2 km apart. QPR's Loftus Road ground is also shown to the north (blue edged in white). Brentford's ground is just beyond the left (west) of the satellite image, above the bend in the River Thames.]]\nIn contrast to many rivalries in [[Football in England|English football]], such as the [[North London derby]] and the [[Merseyside derby]], Chelsea and Fulham have spent much of their existence in separate divisions \u2013 between 1968 and 2001, the two were in the same division only five times \u2013 and have rarely been rivals for the major honours or played in many high-profile matches. This has greatly limited the scope for it to develop and actually served to weaken it.\n\nIn 1904, businessman [[Gus Mears]] approached the Fulham chairman [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]] about moving the club from their [[Craven Cottage]] home to the nearby [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge Athletics Ground]] on the [[Fulham Road]], which he had recently acquired. Norris declined following a dispute over the rent; as a result, Mears formed his own club to occupy the ground, Chelsea. Fulham thus had an indirect role in Chelsea's foundation. It also ensured that, despite Chelsea's name, there were two clubs in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Fulham|Fulham Borough]].<ref>In 1965, the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham was merged with [[Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith]], making possible a \"[[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|borough]]\" derby with neighbouring [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].</ref> The geographical proximity of the teams is the basis for the rivalry, rather than religious or political reasons, as with other derbies.\n\nThe first competitive match between the sides took place on 3 December 1910 in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], with a crowd of 35,000 at Craven Cottage watching Fulham win 1\u20130. The peak of the rivalry was arguably during the inter-war years and just after, when matches between the sides were always among the most popular (and most highly attended) on the fixture calendar. While both clubs were largely unsuccessful until the 1960s, they have since drifted apart and the significance of matches between them has correspondingly declined. Chelsea enjoyed successful spells during the 1960s and 1970s, and again from the mid-1990s to the present day, while Fulham spent much of that period in the lower divisions of the Football League. As a caveat to that, when Chelsea and Fulham did meet in league games in the 1970s and 1980s, the attendances were always among the highest for the season, with the lack of regular matches often making the derby more eagerly anticipated.\n\nThe reduced number of encounters saw Chelsea fans develop rivalries with other teams, notably [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], other London clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. Fulham also formed rivalries with other teams from London like Brentford and QPR. All these reduced the prominence of the West London Derby. That is less true for Fulham fans, with the fact that their nearest neighbours have been more successful ensuring that matches against Chelsea retain a [[Goliath (Bible)|David vs Goliath]] factor. Fulham returned to the top division in 2001, putting the clubs in the same division for the first time since [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384]].\n\nOn 19 March 2006, Fulham beat Chelsea 1\u20130 for the first time in 27 years with a goal from [[Luis Boa Morte]]. The match was marred by controversy and crowd trouble and has arguably rekindled the derby somewhat. Chelsea gained revenge for this defeat on 23 September with a 2\u20130 win at Craven Cottage, in which [[Frank Lampard]] struck twice. Thankfully, there was little trouble before and after the game, due to appeals for calm from managers and players of both clubs and a much higher than normal police presence, to deter fans from entering the pitch after the game. Two of the last games to be played at Stamford Bridge have both been close contests.  On 30 December 2006, they played out a 2\u20132 draw, with [[Carlos Bocanegra]] getting a late equaliser for Fulham (earlier in the match [[Moritz Volz]] had scored the 15,000th goal in [[History of the Premier League|Premier League history]]. On 29 September 2007, they settled for a 0\u20130 draw.  This draw was [[Avram Grant]]'s first West London derby in charge of Chelsea and the same for [[Lawrie Sanchez]] of Fulham. During the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309 season]], Chelsea defeated Fulham 3\u20131 under [[Guus Hiddink]], with goals from [[Nicolas Anelka]], [[Florent Malouda]] and [[Didier Drogba]], with Anelka's goal coming after just 51 seconds. In the 2009\u201310 season, Chelsea defeated Fulham at Craven Cottage with a 2\u20130 win, thanks to goals from Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka. The win was [[Carlo Ancelotti|Carlo Ancelotti's]] first London derby. In the 2011\u201312 season, both teams drew their home and away fixtures. In the 2012\u201313 season, both sides played out a 0\u20130 draw at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea won the reverse fixture 3\u20130 away at Craven Cottage. Chelsea won the home clash 2\u20130 with goals from [[Oscar (footballer, born 1991)|Oscar]] and [[John Obi Mikel]] on 21 September 2013. On 1 March 2013, Chelsea won 3\u20131 at Craven Cottage with [[Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle]] netting a hat-trick for Chelsea. Fulham finished in 19th place at the end of the [[2013\u201314 Premier League]] season and were relegated to the Football League Championship for the 2014\u201315 season, meaning that the two sides would sit in different divisions again after 13 years in the same division.\n\nTheir latest result was on 3 March 2019 when [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] won 1\u20132 in a Premier League contest.\n\n===Chelsea vs QPR derby===\nDespite QPR being members of the Football League since 1920, the two sides did not meet in a competitive match until [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], when Rangers made their debut in the First Division. Their first match took place on 14 September 1968; Chelsea won 4\u20130. Since then, the sides have met a further 45 times, making it the most common West London derby since the 1960s. The clubs developed a rivalry in the 1960s and 1970s when both were playing top-flight football and competing to be among London's top sides, with Chelsea winning the FA Cup, Cup Winners' Cup and League Cup, and Rangers winning the League Cup and finishing as league runners-up by a single point.\n\nMany QPR fans favourite game against Chelsea was a 6\u20130 victory on Easter Monday in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queensparkrangersfc.com/macca.htm|title=Unofficial QPR Hall of Fame \u2013 Alan Mcdonald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717064942/http://www.queensparkrangersfc.com/macca.htm|archive-date=17 July 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref> Chelsea were second in the league table at the time, and the result all but ended their title challenge. During this period, the clubs were relatively evenly matched, although Chelsea were always considered the bigger club, with both occasionally dropping into the Second Division in the late 1970s and early 1980s, so they met in almost every season. The teams met in a competitive match for the first time since 1996, when drawn to face each other in the [[FA Cup]] 3rd Round on 5 January 2008.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7123366.stm | work=BBC News | title=FA Cup third round draw | date=11 December 2007}}</ref> Chelsea won 1\u20130 thanks to a first-half [[own goal]] by [[Lee Camp (footballer)|Lee Camp]].

The links between the two clubs have been maintained through numerous on-loan players; two of Chelsea's best youth team players joined QPR on loan for the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307 season]]. These players were [[Jimmy Smith (footballer, born 1987)|Jimmy Smith]] and [[Michael Mancienne]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://qprreport.blogspot.com/2007/06/smith-and-mancienne-supposedly.html |title=QPR REPORT: Smith and Mancienne Supposedly Returning to QPR on Loan |date=5 June 2007 |access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref> Mancienne renewed his loan for the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nQPR and Chelsea have competed in two pre-season friendlies since the turn of the century. The most recent was in 2003 when Chelsea thrashed a QPR Legends XI 7\u20130. On 28 July 2001. QPR stunned the \u00a350&nbsp;million Chelsea line-up by beating them 3\u20131. [[Jesper Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r]] gave Chelsea a first-half lead, but QPR got an equaliser from [[Leroy Griffiths]] and then took lead from a long range effort by [[Karl Connolly]].

The fact that the Mittal family, who own a 20% stake in the club, are reputed to be five times as rich as Abramovich has seen QPR fans dub themselves the world's richest club.\n\nOn 30 August 2009, Chelsea were drawn against QPR in the third round of the [[2009\u201310 Football League Cup]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,13864_5521985,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Carling Cup third-round draw | date=29 August 2009}}</ref> which saw Chelsea win the game 1\u20130 thanks to a goal from [[Salomon Kalou]].\n\nOn 23 October 2011, Chelsea lost 1\u20130 to a newly promoted QPR in the first Premier League match between the sides since 1996. In a feisty encounter during which the Chelsea players were unable to cope with the hostile atmosphere generated by the QPR fans, players clashed on several occasions, with nine Chelsea players and two QPR booked, with Chelsea's [[Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa]] and Didier Drogba being sent off. [[Hei\u00f0ar Helguson]] scored the only goal of the match through a penalty. Chelsea manager [[Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas]] was later charged by the [[The Football Association|FA]] for criticizing the performance of the referee [[Chris Foy (referee)|Chris Foy]], as he believed many of the big decisions made were incorrect. Chelsea were fined \u00a320,000 by the FA for not controlling their players, who picked up a record number of bookings in a single match in the Premier League era, and their manager was fined \u00a312,000 for his comments on the referee in addition to being cautioned for future conduct. In the aftermath of the match, a video was posted on YouTube showing Chelsea and England captain [[John Terry]] allegedly racially abusing [[Anton Ferdinand]], for which he has been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16284813 | work=BBC News | title=John Terry to be charged over Anton Ferdinand race row | date=21 December 2011}}</ref> Chelsea then drew QPR again in the FA Cup, winning 1\u20130 at Loftus Road thanks to a [[Juan Mata]] penalty.\n\nOn 29 April 2012, Chelsea exacted revenge on QPR in the reverse league fixture with a ruthless 6\u20131 victory, with four goals being scored in a nightmare opening 25 minutes for Rangers. [[Fernando Torres]] became the first player in over 20 years to score a hat-trick in this West London Derby. It was QPR, however, who had the last laugh. After holding Chelsea to a 0\u20130 draw at Loftus Road on 15 September 2012, they went on to beat Chelsea 1\u20130 in the reverse fixture on 2 January 2013 at Stamford Bridge, with the goal coming from former Chelsea player [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]], ending a 30-year wait for a win at the Bridge for Rangers. QPR finished the [[2012\u201313 Premier League]] season in last place, however, and were relegated to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. They were promoted to the Premier League again for the 2014\u201315 season after winning the [[2014 Football League Championship play-off Final]] 1\u20130 against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 24 May 2014. On 12 April 2015, Chelsea beat QPR 0\u20131 with [[Cesc F\u00e0bregas]] scoring the goal in the 88th minute. This sent Chelsea seven points clear at the top of the table ahead of Arsenal. QPR remained in the relegation zone, two points away from safety.\n\n===Fulham vs QPR derby===\nThe origins of a rivalry between Fulham and QPR date back before Chelsea were formed. In 1892 the two teams met at Kensal Rise to play in the West London Cup Final. QPR were 3\u20132 victors and won their first piece of silverware.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/club/history/potted-history/ |title=QPR: A POTTED HISTORY |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623055908/http://www.qpr.co.uk/club/history/potted-history/ |archive-date=23 June 2017 |url-status=dead |access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref> For the next few seasons QPR continued to win the cup, whilst Fulham won The [[West London League]]. In recent times, however, QPR and Fulham derbies are not common as both teams have been in different divisions for all but two seasons since the Premier League first started in 1992. As two very similar clubs in size, history and fan base, derbies, are at times, fiercer and more competitive than those against Chelsea.\n\nFrom 2002 until 2004, QPR and Fulham were closer than they had ever been when QPR and Fulham shared Loftus Road while Craven Cottage was being redeveloped. This added extra spice to a derby had they drawn each other in the cup, especially had QPR been the away team at their own ground.\n\nThe matches during the [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301]] season both ended up being 2\u20130 to Fulham. The game at Loftus Road saw [[Richard Langley]] and [[Clarke Carlisle]] \u2013 two of QPR's best players \u2013 seriously injured in the game and both were out for 18 months with [[cruciate ligament]] injuries; this was vital for QPR's descent into the third tier for the first time in 34 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/1144770.stm | work=BBC News | title=QPR 0\u20132 Fulham | date=31 January 2001}}</ref>\n \nQPR were promoted to the Premier League for the [[2011\u201312 Premier League|2011\u201312]] season, meaning the derby would take place for the first time in over ten years and in the Premier League for the first time. The match finished in a 6\u20130 victory for Fulham, with [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andy Johnson]] each bagging a hat-trick.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15051267.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fulham 6\u20130 QPR| date=2 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe return fixture between the two sides is sure to ignite the rivalry as QPR have recently come under the managerial guidance of [[Mark Hughes]], who was the manager of Fulham the previous season and left under controversial circumstances, citing the clubs' lack of ambition and stature as his reasons. With a last-minute controversial switch by [[Bobby Zamora]] to the Hoops, at the end of the [[January transfer window]], Fulham's first return to their temporary ground was a spicy affair. [[Samba Diakit\u00e9]] was sent off in the first half, and Zamora's replacement, [[Pavel Pogrebnyak]] scored the only goal of the game, meaning Fulham had done the double over QPR in the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/60482/qpr-vs-fulham/report|title=Queens Park Rangers 0 - 1 Fulham Match report - 25/02/2012 Premier League - Goal.com|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> The following season Rangers were on a dismal run of form without a win in seventeen games and looking certain for relegation. When the two side met on 15 December 2012 at Loftus Road, it was [[Adel Taarabt]] who took the Hoops to their first win of the season over their bitter rivals in a strong 2\u20131 victory. Fulham won the reverse fixture 3\u20132 when the two sides met on 1 April 2013 at Craven Cottage. In 2015\u201316, the clubs met once more in the Championship, and Fulham convincingly won both fixtures, in both cases being 3\u20130 up before half-time.\n\nAs of the 19/20 season, they are back in the same division since Fulham were relegated after finishing 19th in the [[2018-19 Premier League]]. The latest derby was a 2\u20131 victory for Fulham at Craven Cottage on 22 November 2019.\n\n==Results==\n\n===Aggregated results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! \n!

Fulham were favourites, but QPR were not to be underestimated. They were just beginning to establish themselves as one of West London's top sides. Fulham had firmly established themselves as the best team in the area, because they had won the West London League for two years running. Fulham raced into a 2\u20130 lead and held it at half-time. QPR somehow managed to pull it back and won their first piece of silverware. This is seen as the first famous derby.\n*'''Brentford 6\u20131 QPR''' (21 August 1965) \u2013 Brentford stormed to an opening day win at [[Griffin Park]], however fortunes for both clubs changed shortly after. It was the last meeting between the two sides at Griffin Park for 35 years in a season which resulted in the relegation of Brentford in spite of this great start. In early 1967, [[History of Brentford F.C. (1954\u20131986)#19 January 1967|QPR attempted and failed to take over Brentford]] and Griffin Park, which would have resulted in the closure of Brentford FC.\n*'''QPR 2\u20134 Chelsea''' (21 February 1970) \u2013 In 1970, Chelsea and QPR were drawn to face each other in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Chelsea's [[Alan Hudson]] described it as a \"fantastic draw\", owing to the rivalry between the two clubs. To add further spice, QPR were fielding two former Chelsea players, [[Terry Venables]] and [[Barry Bridges]], as well as their star striker, [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]]. In an entertaining match, despite the poor pitch, Chelsea were 2\u20130 up within eight minutes thanks to [[Peter Osgood]] and [[David Webb (footballer)|David Webb]], before a twice-taken Venables penalty put Rangers back in contention. As Rangers threatened to equalise, Osgood scored twice more to complete his hat-trick and put the result beyond doubt; Bridges grabbed a late consolation for his side. Chelsea would ultimately go on to win the cup that season.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Kings of the King's Road |last=Batty |first=Clive |publisher=Vision Sports Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-905326-22-8 |pages=101\u2013102}}</ref>\n*'''QPR 6\u20130 Chelsea''' (31 March 1986) \u2013 Chelsea had been title challengers for most of the season, but went into the match having lost 4\u20130 to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] two days previously; this result all but ended their title challenge. Rangers striker [[Gary Bannister]] grabbed a hat-trick and fellow striker [[John Byrne (footballer, born 1961)|John Byrne]] scored twice to secure their biggest ever win over Chelsea. Towards the end of the game Chelsea's [[David Speedie]] was sent off for punching a QPR player.\n*'''Brentford 4\u20130 Fulham''' (26 April 1992) \u2013 In a Sunday morning fixture, Brentford secured promotion to the second tier of English football for the first time since 1954. Brentford raced into a four-goal lead by half time, including two goals in a minute. As the commentator on the day quoted, it was \"raining goals at Griffin Park\".\n*'''Chelsea 1\u20130 Fulham''' (14 April 2002) \u2013 The most important match between the clubs in recent years, an FA Cup semi-final at [[Villa Park]]. Newly promoted Fulham went into the match as underdogs, attempting to reach their first major final since [[1975 FA Cup Final|1975]]. By contrast, Chelsea were aiming for their third final in five years. [[John Terry]]'s deflected shot just before half-time proved to be the difference between the sides, sending Chelsea into the final.\n*'''QPR 1\u20130 Brentford''' (11 November 2003) \u2013 A match steeped in controversy as throughout the game ex-Bee [[Martin Rowlands]] goaded the Brentford fans and at full-time, instead of celebrating with the home fans, he and several other QPR players walked over to the away end and made inciteful gestures and goaded the Brentford fans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/news/40868/birchams-stoppage-time-winner--history|title=Bircham's stoppage time winner \u2013 History \u2013 Queens Park Rangers News|work=Loft For Words|access-date=15 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n*'''Fulham 1\u20130 Chelsea''' (19 March 2006) \u2013 Fulham secured their first win over Chelsea since 1979 with a goal from [[Lu\u00eds Boa Morte]] in a heated and controversial match.

Much hype was made in the build-up, but an Andy Johnson hat-trick, goals from Clint Dempsey, Bobby Zamora and a Danny Murphy penalty annihilated Rangers. Adel Taarabt, who had been substituted at half-time, was famously seen waiting for a bus in Fulham Palace Road during the second half.\n* '''QPR 1\u20130 Chelsea''' (23 October 2011) \u2013 QPR secured a first victory over Chelsea since 1995, courtesy of an early [[Hei\u00f0ar Helguson]] penalty. Chelsea were down to nine men inside 40 minutes after [[Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa]] and Didier Drogba were both sent off, for denying a goalscoring opportunity and a reckless tackle respectively. Chelsea captain John Terry was accused of racially abusing QPR defender [[Anton Ferdinand]] during the match, for which he win stood trial in July 2012, being found not guilty. As a result of these allegations, Terry was stripped of the [[England national football team|England]] captaincy by the FA.

The only time that the two clubs ever shared a division was in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]] between 1935 and 1947, but despite the fact that both clubs are local to each other, it was never seen as a big rivalry to either side, as Chelsea had been in the [[Football League]] for a longer period of time than Brentford and had stronger rivalries with the likes of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]],[[Arsenal]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], whereas Brentford's main rivals are Fulham and QPR. Also Brentford developed a bigger sporting rivalry with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] during the 1930s as both clubs vied for the title of being London's number one club. \n\nThe only bad feeling between the clubs was soon after Chelsea's foundation and admission into the Football League in 1905, the other West London clubs, including Brentford, lost many supporters and potential supporters to the only professional Football League club in the area. Other than that, Brentford and Chelsea have always had fairly good relations, even amongst supporters. In fact, during the 1970s many Chelsea fans would come down to [[Griffin Park]] if their club were playing away. Chelsea reserves play their games at Griffin Park, and occasionally a pre season friendly is staged between the two clubs.\n\nBrentford and Chelsea met for the first time since 1950 on 27 January 2013 in an FA Cup 4th round tie at Griffin Park which ended in a 2\u20132 draw. Chelsea won the replay on 17 February 2013 at Stamford Bridge 4\u20130.\n\nTheir latest meeting was on 28 January 2017 when [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] won 4\u20130 in the [[2016\u201317 FA Cup]].\n\n===Brentford vs Fulham derby===\nFulham and Brentford have competed at the same level for a few periods in their history with the rivalry being fiercest during Fulham's descent to the lower leagues in the 1980s and early '90s. The two teams frequently competed between the [[1928\u201329 in English football|1920s]] and the [[1953\u201354 in English football|1950s]] in the Football League\u2018s various divisions. These games always drew bumper crowds and often caused tension on the pitch and the terraces. However, Fulham\u2019s fortunes on the pitch changed and they went on to play in the upper leagues for several decades until the two sides were to meet regularly again from [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980]] onwards, a time when the rivalry was most heated. Fulham later went on to win the London Derby cup.\n\nThe two clubs spent a majority of seasons in the same division until the [[1997\u201398 Football League Second Division|1997\u201398 Division Two]] campaign, which ended with Brentford suffering relegation to [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]]. Despite Brentford's promotion straight back to Division Two as Division Three champions in the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, Fulham were crowned Division Two champions and ascended to the [[Premier League]] as [[Football League Division One|Division One]] champions in 2001.\n\nThe [[2014\u201315 Football League Championship]] season brought Brentford and Fulham together in the same division for the first time since 1998, following Brentford's promotion from [[Football League One|League One]] and Fulham's relegation from the Premier League. On 21 November, Brentford won at home 2\u20131, sending them to within one point of the leaders of the Championship and Fulham to within three points of relegation to League One.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30048366|title=Brentford 2\u20131 Fulham|date=21 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nPrior to meeting in the league, the two sides were drawn together in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] second round on 26 August 2014, with Fulham winning 1\u20130 at Griffin Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentfordfc.co.uk/news/article/brentford-v-fulham-coc-26.08.14-1877031.aspx|title=Brentford v Fulham Capital One Cup Second Round team line-ups and match report|first=Chris|last=Wickham|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> It was the clubs' first meeting in any competitive fixture since a 2\u20130 league victory to Fulham on 11 April 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/brentford-v-fulham-11-april-1998-183065/|title=Brentford v Fulham, 11 April 1998|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nTheir latest meeting was on 29 April 2017 at Craven Cottage, resulting in a 1\u20131 draw.\n\nThe 2019/20 season will see the last derby at Griffin Park between these teams, after Fulham were relegated from the Premier League. The latest derby at Griffin Park was 3\u20131 to Brentford on 2 December 2017.\n\n=== Brentford vs QPR derby ===\nAs with Fulham, Brentford and [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] played each other frequently in local cup competitions and leagues from the foundation of both clubs. In [[1920\u201321 in English football|1920]], the Football League absorbed many clubs from the [[Southern Football League]], including Brentford and QPR, who competed in the old [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division (South)]] regularly in the 1920s, until Brentford\u2019s rise up the leagues in the 1930s. After the Second World War, they spent practically every season in the same division for the next 20 years. At the time, the fixture was each side\u2019s biggest game of the season and always attracted a big crowd. However, in [[1965\u201366 in English football|1966]], despite an opening day 6\u20131 thrashing of their local rivals, Brentford were ultimately relegated whilst QPR were promoted and went on to enjoy many seasons in the upper leagues.\n\nHowever, the bad feeling between the clubs runs deeper than just locality. In 1967, QPR attempted a takeover of Brentford, which would have resulted in QPR moving into Griffin Park and Brentford F.C. ceasing to exist. The story infamously broke in the London press but Brentford supporters rallied to save their club. Since then, relations between the clubs have been frosty. The rivalry resumed in [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001]] and continued for several seasons until Rangers were promoted. During this time, the rivalry was intensified by Brentford player [[Martin Rowlands]] leaving to join QPR. He then went on to kiss his badge on several occasions in front of the Brentford support when the two sides met in 2003 at [[Loftus Road]].\n\nThe most recent meeting between Brentford and Queens Park Rangers was in [[2019-20 in English football|2020]], with [[Brentford]] winning 3-1 at [[Griffin Park]] on 11 January 2020.\n\n===Chelsea vs Fulham derby===\n[[File:ChelseaFulhamQPRsat.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Few English football teams are as geographically close as neighbours as Fulham and Chelsea. This satellite image of West London shows Fulham's Craven Cottage (circled in white) and Chelsea's Stamford Bridge (blue), just 2.2 km apart. QPR's Loftus Road ground is also shown to the north (blue edged in white). Brentford's ground is just beyond the left (west) of the satellite image, above the bend in the River Thames.]]\nIn contrast to many rivalries in [[Football in England|English football]], such as the [[North London derby]] and the [[Merseyside derby]], Chelsea and Fulham have spent much of their existence in separate divisions \u2013 between 1968 and 2001, the two were in the same division only five times \u2013 and have rarely been rivals for the major honours or played in many high-profile matches. This has greatly limited the scope for it to develop and actually served to weaken it.\n\nIn 1904, businessman [[Gus Mears]] approached the Fulham chairman [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]] about moving the club from their [[Craven Cottage]] home to the nearby [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge Athletics Ground]] on the [[Fulham Road]], which he had recently acquired. Norris declined following a dispute over the rent; as a result, Mears formed his own club to occupy the ground, Chelsea. Fulham thus had an indirect role in Chelsea's foundation. It also ensured that, despite Chelsea's name, there were two clubs in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Fulham|Fulham Borough]].<ref>In 1965, the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham was merged with [[Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith]], making possible a \"[[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|borough]]\" derby with neighbouring [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].</ref> The geographical proximity of the teams is the basis for the rivalry, rather than religious or political reasons, as with other derbies.\n\nThe first competitive match between the sides took place on 3 December 1910 in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], with a crowd of 35,000 at Craven Cottage watching Fulham win 1\u20130. The peak of the rivalry was arguably during the inter-war years and just after, when matches between the sides were always among the most popular (and most highly attended) on the fixture calendar. While both clubs were largely unsuccessful until the 1960s, they have since drifted apart and the significance of matches between them has correspondingly declined. Chelsea enjoyed successful spells during the 1960s and 1970s, and again from the mid-1990s to the present day, while Fulham spent much of that period in the lower divisions of the Football League. As a caveat to that, when Chelsea and Fulham did meet in league games in the 1970s and 1980s, the attendances were always among the highest for the season, with the lack of regular matches often making the derby more eagerly anticipated.\n\nThe reduced number of encounters saw Chelsea fans develop rivalries with other teams, notably [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], other London clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. Fulham also formed rivalries with other teams from London like Brentford and QPR. All these reduced the prominence of the West London Derby. That is less true for Fulham fans, with the fact that their nearest neighbours have been more successful ensuring that matches against Chelsea retain a [[Goliath (Bible)|David vs Goliath]] factor. Fulham returned to the top division in 2001, putting the clubs in the same division for the first time since [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384]].\n\nOn 19 March 2006, Fulham beat Chelsea 1\u20130 for the first time in 27 years with a goal from [[Luis Boa Morte]]. The match was marred by controversy and crowd trouble and has arguably rekindled the derby somewhat. Chelsea gained revenge for this defeat on 23 September with a 2\u20130 win at Craven Cottage, in which [[Frank Lampard]] struck twice. Thankfully, there was little trouble before and after the game, due to appeals for calm from managers and players of both clubs and a much higher than normal police presence, to deter fans from entering the pitch after the game. Two of the last games to be played at Stamford Bridge have both been close contests.  On 30 December 2006, they played out a 2\u20132 draw, with [[Carlos Bocanegra]] getting a late equaliser for Fulham (earlier in the match [[Moritz Volz]] had scored the 15,000th goal in [[History of the Premier League|Premier League history]]. On 29 September 2007, they settled for a 0\u20130 draw.  This draw was [[Avram Grant]]'s first West London derby in charge of Chelsea and the same for [[Lawrie Sanchez]] of Fulham. During the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309 season]], Chelsea defeated Fulham 3\u20131 under [[Guus Hiddink]], with goals from [[Nicolas Anelka]], [[Florent Malouda]] and [[Didier Drogba]], with Anelka's goal coming after just 51 seconds. In the 2009\u201310 season, Chelsea defeated Fulham at Craven Cottage with a 2\u20130 win, thanks to goals from Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka. The win was [[Carlo Ancelotti|Carlo Ancelotti's]] first London derby. In the 2011\u201312 season, both teams drew their home and away fixtures. In the 2012\u201313 season, both sides played out a 0\u20130 draw at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea won the reverse fixture 3\u20130 away at Craven Cottage. Chelsea won the home clash 2\u20130 with goals from [[Oscar (footballer, born 1991)|Oscar]] and [[John Obi Mikel]] on 21 September 2013. On 1 March 2013, Chelsea won 3\u20131 at Craven Cottage with [[Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle]] netting a hat-trick for Chelsea. Fulham finished in 19th place at the end of the [[2013\u201314 Premier League]] season and were relegated to the Football League Championship for the 2014\u201315 season, meaning that the two sides would sit in different divisions again after 13 years in the same division.\n\nTheir latest result was on 3 March 2019 when [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] won 1\u20132 in a Premier League contest.\n\n===Chelsea vs QPR derby===\nDespite QPR being members of the Football League since 1920, the two sides did not meet in a competitive match until [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], when Rangers made their debut in the First Division. Their first match took place on 14 September 1968; Chelsea won 4\u20130. Since then, the sides have met a further 45 times, making it the most common West London derby since the 1960s. The clubs developed a rivalry in the 1960s and 1970s when both were playing top-flight football and competing to be among London's top sides, with Chelsea winning the FA Cup, Cup Winners' Cup and League Cup, and Rangers winning the League Cup and finishing as league runners-up by a single point.\n\nMany QPR fans favourite game against Chelsea was a 6\u20130 victory on Easter Monday in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queensparkrangersfc.com/macca.htm|title=Unofficial QPR Hall of Fame \u2013 Alan Mcdonald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717064942/http://www.queensparkrangersfc.com/macca.htm|archive-date=17 July 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref> Chelsea were second in the league table at the time, and the result all but ended their title challenge. During this period, the clubs were relatively evenly matched, although Chelsea were always considered the bigger club, with both occasionally dropping into the Second Division in the late 1970s and early 1980s, so they met in almost every season. The teams met in a competitive match for the first time since 1996, when drawn to face each other in the [[FA Cup]] 3rd Round on 5 January 2008.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7123366.stm | work=BBC News | title=FA Cup third round draw | date=11 December 2007}}</ref> Chelsea won 1\u20130 thanks to a first-half [[own goal]] by [[Lee Camp (footballer)|Lee Camp]].

The links between the two clubs have been maintained through numerous on-loan players; two of Chelsea's best youth team players joined QPR on loan for the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307 season]]. These players were [[Jimmy Smith (footballer, born 1987)|Jimmy Smith]] and [[Michael Mancienne]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://qprreport.blogspot.com/2007/06/smith-and-mancienne-supposedly.html |title=QPR REPORT: Smith and Mancienne Supposedly Returning to QPR on Loan |date=5 June 2007 |access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref> Mancienne renewed his loan for the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nQPR and Chelsea have competed in two pre-season friendlies since the turn of the century.

[[Jesper Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r]] gave Chelsea a first-half lead, but QPR got an equaliser from [[Leroy Griffiths]] and then took lead from a long range effort by [[Karl Connolly]].

The fact that the Mittal family, who own a 20% stake in the club, are reputed to be five times as rich as Abramovich has seen QPR fans dub themselves the world's richest club.\n\nOn 30 August 2009, Chelsea were drawn against QPR in the third round of the [[2009\u201310 Football League Cup]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,13864_5521985,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Carling Cup third-round draw | date=29 August 2009}}</ref> which saw Chelsea win the game 1\u20130 thanks to a goal from [[Salomon Kalou]].\n\nOn 23 October 2011, Chelsea lost 1\u20130 to a newly promoted QPR in the first Premier League match between the sides since 1996. In a feisty encounter during which the Chelsea players were unable to cope with the hostile atmosphere generated by the QPR fans, players clashed on several occasions, with nine Chelsea players and two QPR booked, with Chelsea's [[Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa]] and Didier Drogba being sent off. [[Hei\u00f0ar Helguson]] scored the only goal of the match through a penalty. Chelsea manager [[Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas]] was later charged by the [[The Football Association|FA]] for criticizing the performance of the referee [[Chris Foy (referee)|Chris Foy]], as he believed many of the big decisions made were incorrect. Chelsea were fined \u00a320,000 by the FA for not controlling their players, who picked up a record number of bookings in a single match in the Premier League era, and their manager was fined \u00a312,000 for his comments on the referee in addition to being cautioned for future conduct. In the aftermath of the match, a video was posted on YouTube showing Chelsea and England captain [[John Terry]] allegedly racially abusing [[Anton Ferdinand]], for which he has been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16284813 | work=BBC News | title=John Terry to be charged over Anton Ferdinand race row | date=21 December 2011}}</ref> Chelsea then drew QPR again in the FA Cup, winning 1\u20130 at Loftus Road thanks to a [[Juan Mata]] penalty.\n\nOn 29 April 2012, Chelsea exacted revenge on QPR in the reverse league fixture with a ruthless 6\u20131 victory, with four goals being scored in a nightmare opening 25 minutes for Rangers. [[Fernando Torres]] became the first player in over 20 years to score a hat-trick in this West London Derby. It was QPR, however, who had the last laugh. After holding Chelsea to a 0\u20130 draw at Loftus Road on 15 September 2012, they went on to beat Chelsea 1\u20130 in the reverse fixture on 2 January 2013 at Stamford Bridge, with the goal coming from former Chelsea player [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]], ending a 30-year wait for a win at the Bridge for Rangers. QPR finished the [[2012\u201313 Premier League]] season in last place, however, and were relegated to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. They were promoted to the Premier League again for the 2014\u201315 season after winning the [[2014 Football League Championship play-off Final]] 1\u20130 against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 24 May 2014. On 12 April 2015, Chelsea beat QPR 0\u20131 with [[Cesc F\u00e0bregas]] scoring the goal in the 88th minute. This sent Chelsea seven points clear at the top of the table ahead of Arsenal. QPR remained in the relegation zone, two points away from safety.\n\n===Fulham vs QPR derby===\nThe origins of a rivalry between Fulham and QPR date back before Chelsea were formed. In 1892 the two teams met at Kensal Rise to play in the West London Cup Final. QPR were 3\u20132 victors and won their first piece of silverware.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/club/history/potted-history/ |title=QPR: A POTTED HISTORY |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623055908/http://www.qpr.co.uk/club/history/potted-history/ |archive-date=23 June 2017 |url-status=dead |access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref> For the next few seasons QPR continued to win the cup, whilst Fulham won The [[West London League]]. In recent times, however, QPR and Fulham derbies are not common as both teams have been in different divisions for all but two seasons since the Premier League first started in 1992. As two very similar clubs in size, history and fan base, derbies, are at times, fiercer and more competitive than those against Chelsea.\n\nFrom 2002 until 2004, QPR and Fulham were closer than they had ever been when QPR and Fulham shared Loftus Road while Craven Cottage was being redeveloped. This added extra spice to a derby had they drawn each other in the cup, especially had QPR been the away team at their own ground.\n\nThe matches during the [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301]] season both ended up being 2\u20130 to Fulham. The game at Loftus Road saw [[Richard Langley]] and [[Clarke Carlisle]] \u2013 two of QPR's best players \u2013 seriously injured in the game and both were out for 18 months with [[cruciate ligament]] injuries; this was vital for QPR's descent into the third tier for the first time in 34 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/1144770.stm | work=BBC News | title=QPR 0\u20132 Fulham | date=31 January 2001}}</ref>\n \nQPR were promoted to the Premier League for the [[2011\u201312 Premier League|2011\u201312]] season, meaning the derby would take place for the first time in over ten years and in the Premier League for the first time. The match finished in a 6\u20130 victory for Fulham, with [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andy Johnson]] each bagging a hat-trick.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15051267.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fulham 6\u20130 QPR| date=2 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe return fixture between the two sides is sure to ignite the rivalry as QPR have recently come under the managerial guidance of [[Mark Hughes]], who was the manager of Fulham the previous season and left under controversial circumstances, citing the clubs' lack of ambition and stature as his reasons. With a last-minute controversial switch by [[Bobby Zamora]] to the Hoops, at the end of the [[January transfer window]], Fulham's first return to their temporary ground was a spicy affair. [[Samba Diakit\u00e9]] was sent off in the first half, and Zamora's replacement, [[Pavel Pogrebnyak]] scored the only goal of the game, meaning Fulham had done the double over QPR in the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/60482/qpr-vs-fulham/report|title=Queens Park Rangers 0 - 1 Fulham Match report - 25/02/2012 Premier League - Goal.com|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> The following season Rangers were on a dismal run of form without a win in seventeen games and looking certain for relegation. When the two side met on 15 December 2012 at Loftus Road, it was [[Adel Taarabt]] who took the Hoops to their first win of the season over their bitter rivals in a strong 2\u20131 victory. Fulham won the reverse fixture 3\u20132 when the two sides met on 1 April 2013 at Craven Cottage. In 2015\u201316, the clubs met once more in the Championship, and Fulham convincingly won both fixtures, in both cases being 3\u20130 up before half-time.\n\nAs of the 19/20 season, they are back in the same division since Fulham were relegated after finishing 19th in the [[2018-19 Premier League]].

Fulham were favourites, but QPR were not to be underestimated. They were just beginning to establish themselves as one of West London's top sides. Fulham had firmly established themselves as the best team in the area, because they had won the West London League for two years running. Fulham raced into a 2\u20130 lead and held it at half-time. QPR somehow managed to pull it back and won their first piece of silverware. This is seen as the first famous derby.\n*'''Brentford 6\u20131 QPR''' (21 August 1965) \u2013 Brentford stormed to an opening day win at [[Griffin Park]], however fortunes for both clubs changed shortly after. It was the last meeting between the two sides at Griffin Park for 35 years in a season which resulted in the relegation of Brentford in spite of this great start. In early 1967, [[History of Brentford F.C. (1954\u20131986)#19 January 1967|QPR attempted and failed to take over Brentford]] and Griffin Park, which would have resulted in the closure of Brentford FC.\n*'''QPR 2\u20134 Chelsea''' (21 February 1970) \u2013 In 1970, Chelsea and QPR were drawn to face each other in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Chelsea's [[Alan Hudson]] described it as a \"fantastic draw\", owing to the rivalry between the two clubs. To add further spice, QPR were fielding two former Chelsea players, [[Terry Venables]] and [[Barry Bridges]], as well as their star striker, [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]]. In an entertaining match, despite the poor pitch, Chelsea were 2\u20130 up within eight minutes thanks to [[Peter Osgood]] and [[David Webb (footballer)|David Webb]], before a twice-taken Venables penalty put Rangers back in contention. As Rangers threatened to equalise, Osgood scored twice more to complete his hat-trick and put the result beyond doubt; Bridges grabbed a late consolation for his side. Chelsea would ultimately go on to win the cup that season.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Kings of the King's Road |last=Batty |first=Clive |publisher=Vision Sports Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-905326-22-8 |pages=101\u2013102}}</ref>\n*'''QPR 6\u20130 Chelsea''' (31 March 1986) \u2013 Chelsea had been title challengers for most of the season, but went into the match having lost 4\u20130 to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] two days previously; this result all but ended their title challenge. Rangers striker [[Gary Bannister]] grabbed a hat-trick and fellow striker [[John Byrne (footballer, born 1961)|John Byrne]] scored twice to secure their biggest ever win over Chelsea. Towards the end of the game Chelsea's [[David Speedie]] was sent off for punching a QPR player.\n*'''Brentford 4\u20130 Fulham''' (26 April 1992) \u2013 In a Sunday morning fixture, Brentford secured promotion to the second tier of English football for the first time since 1954. Brentford raced into a four-goal lead by half time, including two goals in a minute. As the commentator on the day quoted, it was \"raining goals at Griffin Park\".\n*'''Chelsea 1\u20130 Fulham''' (14 April 2002) \u2013 The most important match between the clubs in recent years, an FA Cup semi-final at [[Villa Park]]. Newly promoted Fulham went into the match as underdogs, attempting to reach their first major final since [[1975 FA Cup Final|1975]]. By contrast, Chelsea were aiming for their third final in five years. [[John Terry]]'s deflected shot just before half-time proved to be the difference between the sides, sending Chelsea into the final.\n*'''QPR 1\u20130 Brentford''' (11 November 2003) \u2013 A match steeped in controversy as throughout the game ex-Bee [[Martin Rowlands]] goaded the Brentford fans and at full-time, instead of celebrating with the home fans, he and several other QPR players walked over to the away end and made inciteful gestures and goaded the Brentford fans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/news/40868/birchams-stoppage-time-winner--history|title=Bircham's stoppage time winner \u2013 History \u2013 Queens Park Rangers News|work=Loft For Words|access-date=15 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n*'''Fulham 1\u20130 Chelsea''' (19 March 2006) \u2013 Fulham secured their first win over Chelsea since 1979 with a goal from [[Lu\u00eds Boa Morte]] in a heated and controversial match. [[FA Premier League 2005\u201306|Champions-elect]] Chelsea had a [[Didier Drogba]] goal disallowed for a handball and [[William Gallas]] [[Misconduct (football)|sent off]], with the latter incident sparking a mass brawl of the players. After the final whistle, both sets of fans invaded the pitch, which led to some clashes and arrests.\n* '''Fulham 6\u20130 QPR''' (2 October 2011) \u2013 The first competitive match between the two teams in a decade and the first ever in the top flight. Much hype was made in the build-up, but an Andy Johnson hat-trick, goals from Clint Dempsey, Bobby Zamora and a Danny Murphy penalty annihilated Rangers. Adel Taarabt, who had been substituted at half-time, was famously seen waiting for a bus in Fulham Palace Road during the second half.\n* '''QPR 1\u20130 Chelsea''' (23 October 2011) \u2013 QPR secured a first victory over Chelsea since 1995, courtesy of an early [[Hei\u00f0ar Helguson]] penalty. Chelsea were down to nine men inside 40 minutes after [[Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa]] and Didier Drogba were both sent off, for denying a goalscoring opportunity and a reckless tackle respectively. Chelsea captain John Terry was accused of racially abusing QPR defender [[Anton Ferdinand]] during the match, for which he win stood trial in July 2012, being found not guilty. As a result of these allegations, Terry was stripped of the [[England national football team|England]] captaincy by the FA. England manager [[Fabio Capello]] resigned in protest against Terry's sacking.\n* '''Chelsea 6\u20131 QPR''' (29 April 2012) \u2013 Chelsea avenged their previous 1\u20130 league defeat to QPR, with [[Fernando Torres]] scoring his first hat-trick for the club.\n* '''Chelsea 0\u20131 QPR''' (2 January 2013) \u2013 QPR secured their first win at Stamford Bridge since March 1979 thanks to a 78th-minute winner from [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]]. Chelsea went into the game in fourth place and on the back of a four-match winning run while QPR where bottom of the table with just 10 points from 20 games, eight points from safety and without an away win in the league since November 2011, all of which combined to make it one of the most surprising results in the recent history of this fixture and of the [[2012\u201313 in English football|2012\u201313]] season.\n* '''Brentford 2\u20132 Chelsea''' (27 January 2013) \u2013 In the first game between Chelsea and Brentford since 1950, Brentford shocked Chelsea at Griffin Park, twice going ahead through goals from [[Marcello Trotta]] and  [[Harry Forrester (footballer)|Harry Forrester]].

It was administered by [[FIDE]], the World Chess Federation. The event was won by [[Levon Aronian]], with [[Teimour Radjabov]] second and [[Alexander Grischuk]] third.\n\nThe top two finishers here formed two of the eight players who played in the [[World Chess Championship 2011#Candidates Tournament|2011 Candidates Tournament]] to determine the challenger for the world champion. After [[Magnus Carlsen]] withdrew from the Candidates, Grischuk took his place, due to his third place in the Grand Prix.\n\nThe winner of the Grand Prix was originally scheduled to play a match in 2010 against the winner of the [[Chess World Cup 2009]], with the winner of that match becoming the challenger for the [[World Chess Championship 2012]].<ref>[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=4576 First FIDE Grand Prix in Baku, Azerbaijan], [[Chessbase]], April 19, 2008</ref> On November 25, 2008, FIDE announced major changes, with the winner and runner-up qualifying instead for an eight-player Candidates Tournament. This caused a number of protests, with [[Magnus Carlsen]] and [[Michael Adams (chess player)|Michael Adams]] withdrawing, and two other players being replaced. (For details, see [[World Chess Championship 2012]].)\n\nA number of host cities withdrew, causing all the tournaments except the first two to be rescheduled.\n\n==Format==\nThere were six tournaments spread over 2008, 2009 and 2010. Each of the 21 participating players was originally scheduled to play in exactly four of the six tournaments; though this was complicated when some players withdrew partway through.\n\nEach tournament is a 14 player, single [[round-robin tournament]]. In each round players scored 1 point for a win, \u00bd point for a [[draw (chess)|draw]] and 0 for a loss. Grand prix points were then allocated according to each player's standing in the tournament: 180 grand prix points for first place, 150 for second place, 130 for third place, and then 110 down to 10 points for places four to fourteen (decreasing by 10 points for each place). (Grand Prix points were split between players on equal tournament points).\n\nPlayers only counted their best three tournament results. The player with the most grand prix points was the winner.\n\nIf a tie-break was needed for the overall grand prix winner, the system was:<ref>[http://grandprix.fide.com/regulations.html Grand Prix Regulations, section 7.2], [[FIDE]] web site, accessed May 5, 2008</ref>\n# The fourth result not already in the top three performances\n# The number of actual game points scored in the four tournaments\n# The number of first-place finishes\n# The number of second-place finishes \n# The number of won games\n# Drawing of lots\n\n===Tournament dates===\n\nThe tournament dates and locations were as follows:<ref name=\"chessdom\">[http://www.chessdom.com/news/chess-grand-prix Chess Grand Prix 2008\u20132009 (updated)], Chessdom.com, accessed April 30, 2008</ref>\n\n* April 19 \u2013 May 6, 2008, [[Baku]], Azerbaijan\n* July 30 \u2013 August 15, 2008, [[Sochi]], Russia\n* December 13\u201329, 2008, [[Elista]], Russia (rescheduled from [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], in November 2008)<ref>[http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/3534-next-grand-prix-event-in-elista-press-release Next Grand Prix Event in Elista \u2013 Press Release], [[FIDE]] web site, 23 November 2008</ref>\n* April 14\u201330, 2009, [[Nalchik]], Russia (rescheduled from [[Montreux]], Switzerland)\n* August 9\u201324, 2009, [[Jermuk]], [[Armenia]] (rescheduled from [[Elista]], Russia)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/3591-fide-grand-prix-in-yerevan|title=FIDE Grand Prix in Yerevan |date=5 December 2008|accessdate=18 January 2009|publisher=FIDE}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jermuk2009.fide.com/|title=FIDE Grand Prix in Jermuk|publisher=FIDE}}</ref>\n* May 9\u201325, 2010, [[Astrakhan]], Russia (rescheduled from [[Karlovy Vary]], Czech Republic, in October 2009)<ref name=karlovy-vary-withdraws>[http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/twic741.html#16 Grand Prix Karlovy Vary Cancelled], [[The Week in Chess]], 19 January 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=ru:\u0412 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0432 \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u043d-\u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0424\u0418\u0414\u0415 |language=Russian |url=http://jilkin.ru/news/?id=3952 |date=13 October 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2009 |publisher=Website of [[Alexander Zhilkin]]}}</ref>\n\n===Draw rules===\nA variation from normal [[rules of chess|chess rules]] was that the players were not allowed to talk to each other during the game and a [[draw by agreement]] was not allowed.

(For details, see [[World Chess Championship 2012]].)\n\nA number of host cities withdrew, causing all the tournaments except the first two to be rescheduled.\n\n==Format==\nThere were six tournaments spread over 2008, 2009 and 2010. Each of the 21 participating players was originally scheduled to play in exactly four of the six tournaments; though this was complicated when some players withdrew partway through.\n\nEach tournament is a 14 player, single [[round-robin tournament]]. In each round players scored 1 point for a win, \u00bd point for a [[draw (chess)|draw]] and 0 for a loss. Grand prix points were then allocated according to each player's standing in the tournament: 180 grand prix points for first place, 150 for second place, 130 for third place, and then 110 down to 10 points for places four to fourteen (decreasing by 10 points for each place). (Grand Prix points were split between players on equal tournament points).\n\nPlayers only counted their best three tournament results.

Once a prestigious livestock show with show horses, cattle, swine, goats, sheep, poultry, and rabbit competitions., the management decided to stop funding this historic aspect of the fair much to the disappointment of the region's livestock community. The management  hired a decorator to attach faux barn and country scenes to the show buildings. In place of 4-H kids and their projects, management rents petting zoo animals.  The management has taken the further step to discontinue allowing any such shows during the off season.  Many historic local clubs and associations were displaced with not having a safe venue for their events as they had for over 50 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Train exhibits===\nThe [[RailGiants Train Museum]] is owned and maintained by the Southern California Chapter of the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society, and until November 2013 was the home to one of the world's largest steam locomotives, [[Union Pacific Big Boy 4014]], which has been acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad and was moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming for a multi-year restoration that returned 4014 to operation in May 2019.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe garden railroad train exhibit is called the '''Fairplex Garden Railroad'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fgrr.org/|title=Fairplex Garden Railroad|website=fgrr.org}}</ref> It has over 80 volunteers and from Nov through July, runs the second Sunday of every month, from 11:00am to 4:00pm, for the general public.

General view of assembly center being constructed on Pomona Fair Grounds for ev . . . - NARA - 536837.tif|thumb|200px|right| Construction of the Pomona Assembly Center.]]\n{{Commons category|Pomona Assembly Center}}\nDuring [[World War II]], the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds was the site of one of several temporary detention camps (also known as [[Internment of Japanese Americans#WCCA Civilian Assembly Centers|assembly centers]]) located throughout the [[Western United States|West]]. The first phase of the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|mass incarceration]] of 97,785 Californians of Japanese ancestry during the war. Most internees were U.S. citizens. Pursuant to [[Executive Order 9066]], signed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on February 19, 1942, fifteen makeshift detention facilities were constructed at various California racetracks, fairgrounds and labor camps. These facilities confined [[Japanese Americans|Japanese American citizens]] until permanent location centers such as those in [[Manzanar]] and [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument|Tule Lake]] in California could be built in more isolated areas of the country. Beginning on March 30, 1942, native-born American citizens and long-time legal residents of Japanese ancestry living in California were ordered to surrender themselves for detention.\n\nConstruction on the [[Pomona assembly center]] began on March 21, 1942, and the camp officially opened on May 7, 1942. The Pomona Facility consisted of 309 barracks, 8 mess halls, and 36 shower and latrine facilities. The first group of 72 Japanese American citizens arrived on May 9. By May 15, 1942 the Pomona site was operating near capacity, with 4,270 internees. Pomona reached a peak population of 5,434 before its closing on August 24, 1942. Most internees there were transferred to [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center|Heart Mountain]] in Wyoming. The site remained in use for the duration of the war, first housing U.S. troops, and then German and Italian [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. Today, the site serves as the Fairplex parking lot.\n\nOn August 24, 2016 a plaque was erected to recognize the former assembly center, POW camp.<ref>Linke, Konrad.

McKinley Ave., Pomona, California, approximately {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} east of downtown Los Angeles.\n\n==Controversy==\nThe Fairplex has been the center of controversy lasting over 50 years, only brought up among local residents and employees of the Los Angeles Fair Association, who, as of the year 2015, have lost their non-profit licence. The controversy surrounding The Los Angeles Fair Association are many issues including but not limited to embezzlement, theft, illegal taxing, and bribery of a government official. [I went on-line and found no reference to the previous accusations of losing the non-profit license, embezzlement, theft and bribery.]\n\n{{More citations ineeded}} From 2015 through 2017, the Fairplex became the subject of news and investigation by the Los Angeles Times for the improper collection of taxes from Fairplex RV Park residents, as well as its neglect of the RV park grounds, which resulted in issues with bed bugs and roaches as well as infrastructure problems that include damaged roads and walkways, bathrooms in disrepair, inadequate plumbing and electrical fixtures. In 2017, in a separate article written by the Los Angeles Times, the Los Angeles Fair Association agreed to a $325,000 settlement with the residents of the Fairplex RV Park. The settlement agreement allowed at least 475 people to be reimbursed for improper collection of taxes. Unfortunately, due to civil suit limitations and the abilities of the residents' legal counsel, residents were only able to file for reimbursement as far back as four years prior to the 2015 lawsuit, leaving some residents unable to file for reimbursement any earlier than that date. Within the aforementioned article, it has also been reported that the Association has spent $250,000 on renovations of public bathrooms and showers, and calls for more transparency of the Los Angeles Fair Association by the public and the City of Pomona.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-la-county-fair-tax-20170405-story.html|title=They paid a bogus tax for years.

Among other features of Fairplex are various scenic parks, plazas and picnic areas, a historic train exhibit, and {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of carnival grounds.\n\n===Livestock shows and 4-H===\nMost of the livestock and small stock shows during the county fair including 4-H competitions have been dismantled and the buildings allowed to deteriorate.  Once a prestigious livestock show with show horses, cattle, swine, goats, sheep, poultry, and rabbit competitions., the management decided to stop funding this historic aspect of the fair much to the disappointment of the region's livestock community. The management  hired a decorator to attach faux barn and country scenes to the show buildings. In place of 4-H kids and their projects, management rents petting zoo animals.  The management has taken the further step to discontinue allowing any such shows during the off season.  Many historic local clubs and associations were displaced with not having a safe venue for their events as they had for over 50 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Train exhibits===\nThe [[RailGiants Train Museum]] is owned and maintained by the Southern California Chapter of the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society, and until November 2013 was the home to one of the world's largest steam locomotives, [[Union Pacific Big Boy 4014]], which has been acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad and was moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming for a multi-year restoration that returned 4014 to operation in May 2019.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe garden railroad train exhibit is called the '''Fairplex Garden Railroad'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fgrr.org/|title=Fairplex Garden Railroad|website=fgrr.org}}</ref> It has over 80 volunteers and from Nov through July, runs the second Sunday of every month, from 11:00am to 4:00pm, for the general public. The FGRR gears up every year for the L.A. County Fair, its primary show. In December various members run their Christmas trains. The garden railroad uses [[G Scale]] trains.\n\n===Barretts OTB, sales, and closed race facilities===\nThere is a large Off Track Horse Wagering Racebook at Fairplex, located on White Avenue, about a mile north from McKinley Avenue in Pomona. The OTB accepts racing signals from the United States, Canada, and Australia. There is also a restaurant and Sports Bar called the Finish Line Grill.  Next to the OTB is '''Barretts Sales and Racing''', a horse facility with a (now closed) 5/8 mile racetrack and a grandstand seating 10,000. Barrett's provided equine training facilities, horse show facilities, and the Barrett's Equine Limited horse auction complex.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fairplex.com/fp/HorseRacing/index.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109034949/http://www.fairplex.com/fp/HorseRacing/index.asp |archive-date=2007-01-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The grandstand facility is also used to host concerts and special events accommodating up to 15,000 patrons.

General view of assembly center being constructed on Pomona Fair Grounds for ev . . . - NARA - 536837.tif|thumb|200px|right| Construction of the Pomona Assembly Center.]]\n{{Commons category|Pomona Assembly Center}}\nDuring [[World War II]], the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds was the site of one of several temporary detention camps (also known as [[Internment of Japanese Americans#WCCA Civilian Assembly Centers|assembly centers]]) located throughout the [[Western United States|West]]. The first phase of the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|mass incarceration]] of 97,785 Californians of Japanese ancestry during the war. Most internees were U.S. citizens. Pursuant to [[Executive Order 9066]], signed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on February 19, 1942, fifteen makeshift detention facilities were constructed at various California racetracks, fairgrounds and labor camps. These facilities confined [[Japanese Americans|Japanese American citizens]] until permanent location centers such as those in [[Manzanar]] and [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument|Tule Lake]] in California could be built in more isolated areas of the country. Beginning on March 30, 1942, native-born American citizens and long-time legal residents of Japanese ancestry living in California were ordered to surrender themselves for detention.\n\nConstruction on the [[Pomona assembly center]] began on March 21, 1942, and the camp officially opened on May 7, 1942. The Pomona Facility consisted of 309 barracks, 8 mess halls, and 36 shower and latrine facilities. The first group of 72 Japanese American citizens arrived on May 9. By May 15, 1942 the Pomona site was operating near capacity, with 4,270 internees. Pomona reached a peak population of 5,434 before its closing on August 24, 1942. Most internees there were transferred to [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center|Heart Mountain]] in Wyoming. The site remained in use for the duration of the war, first housing U.S. troops, and then German and Italian [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. Today, the site serves as the Fairplex parking lot.\n\nOn August 24, 2016 a plaque was erected to recognize the former assembly center, POW camp.<ref>Linke, Konrad.

McKinley Ave., Pomona, California, approximately {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} east of downtown Los Angeles.\n\n==Controversy==\nThe Fairplex has been the center of controversy lasting over 50 years, only brought up among local residents and employees of the Los Angeles Fair Association, who, as of the year 2015, have lost their non-profit licence. The controversy surrounding The Los Angeles Fair Association are many issues including but not limited to embezzlement, theft, illegal taxing, and bribery of a government official. [I went on-line and found no reference to the previous accusations of losing the non-profit license, embezzlement, theft and bribery.]\n\n{{More citations ineeded}} From 2015 through 2017, the Fairplex became the subject of news and investigation by the Los Angeles Times for the improper collection of taxes from Fairplex RV Park residents, as well as its neglect of the RV park grounds, which resulted in issues with bed bugs and roaches as well as infrastructure problems that include damaged roads and walkways, bathrooms in disrepair, inadequate plumbing and electrical fixtures. In 2017, in a separate article written by the Los Angeles Times, the Los Angeles Fair Association agreed to a $325,000 settlement with the residents of the Fairplex RV Park. The settlement agreement allowed at least 475 people to be reimbursed for improper collection of taxes. Unfortunately, due to civil suit limitations and the abilities of the residents' legal counsel, residents were only able to file for reimbursement as far back as four years prior to the 2015 lawsuit, leaving some residents unable to file for reimbursement any earlier than that date. Within the aforementioned article, it has also been reported that the Association has spent $250,000 on renovations of public bathrooms and showers, and calls for more transparency of the Los Angeles Fair Association by the public and the City of Pomona.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-la-county-fair-tax-20170405-story.html|title=They paid a bogus tax for years.
