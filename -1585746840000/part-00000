It was removed from the Coast and Geodetic Survey and became a component of the [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA) as the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps) upon the establishment of ESSA on 13 July 1965.

The Coast Guard is part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and has both military and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] duties. [[Title 14 of the United States Code|Title 14]] states that the Coast Guard is part of the armed forces at all times, making it the only branch of the military outside the Department of Defense. During a declared state of war, however, the President or Congress may direct that the Coast Guard operate as part of the Department of the Navy.<ref>{{usc|14|3}}</ref> The U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, along with the NOAA Commissioned Corps, operate under military rules with the exception of the applicability of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], to which they are subject only when militarized by executive order or while detailed to any component of the armed forces.<ref>{{Cite web|title=UCMJ S 802.

The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] is an additional reserve military component of the Army and Air Force, respectively, and is composed of National Guard units, which operate under [[Title 32 of the United States Code|Title 32]] and under state authority as the [[Army National Guard]] and [[Air National Guard]]. The militia that later became the National Guard was first formed in the [[Colony of Virginia]] in 1607 and is the oldest uniformed military force founded in the [[New World]]. The National Guard can also be mobilized by the President to operate under Federal authority through [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10]].

Uniformed officers of NOAA and PHS are paid on the same scale as members of the armed services with respective rank and time-in-grade. Additionally, PHS Officers are covered by the [[Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act]] and the [[Service Members Civil Relief Act]] (formerly the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act).\n\nPHS and NOAA consist of [[commissioned officer]]s only and have no [[warrant officer]] ranks or [[enlisted ranks]]. Commissioned officers of the PHS and NOAA may be militarized by the President.<ref>PHS is under Title 42 & 46 U.S.C.</ref> Because they are commissioned officers, they can be classified as [[prisoners of war]] under the [[Geneva Conventions]], if captured by a [[belligerent]] entity. The [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] (USC&GS), a predecessor to NOAA, originally began commissioning its officers so that if captured while engaged in battlefield surveying, they would be protected under the [[Law of Armed Conflict]] and could not be tried or executed as [[espionage|spies]]. The USC&GS Commissioned Officer Corps became the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps), upon the creation of the [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA) on 13 July 1965, then became the NOAA Corps upon the creation of NOAA on 3 October 1970. The PHS traces its origins to [[Marine Hospital Service|a system of marine hospitals]] created by \"[[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]]\", passed by Congress in 1798; it adopted a military model of organization in 1871.<ref>''[[United States Code]].

The communist-led ''[[Sejm]]'' ([[legislature]]) was declared to be the highest state authority. The real source of supreme state power, the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR), was not regulated by the constitution; it was ruled by its own statute. The constitution legalized many practices that had been introduced in Poland, in the wake of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Polish People's Army]] defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1944\u20131945, by Polish-communist governmental bodies, including the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (PKWN) and its successors.\n\nInstead of the traditional [[separation of powers]], the constitution introduced the Soviet concept of \"unity of the state's power\".<ref name=\"Cieplak\">{{Cite book|author=Cieplak, Tadeusz N. |chapter=Section 4.

Weather modification in warfare has been banned by the [[United Nations]] under the [[Environmental Modification Convention]].\n\n==History==\nA popular belief in northern Europe that shooting prevents hail caused many agricultural towns to fire cannons without ammunition. Veterans of the [[Seven Years' War]], [[Napoleonic wars]], and the [[American Civil War]] reported that rain fell after every large battle. After their stories were collected in ''War and Weather'', the [[United States Department of War]] in the late 19th century purchased $9,000 of gunpowder and explosives to detonate them in Texas.

He discovered that many areas faced the problem of drought. Over 82 percent of Thai agricultural land relied on rainfall. Thai farmers were not able to grow crops for lack of water. The royal rainmaking project debuted on 20 July 1969 at his behest, when the first rainmaking attempt was made at Khao Yai National Park. Dry ice flakes were scattered over clouds. Reportedly, some rainfall resulted. In 1971, the government established the Artificial Rainmaking Research and Development Project within the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives<ref>[[Royal Rainmaking Project]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn January 2011, several newspapers and magazines, including the UK's ''Sunday Times'' and ''Arabian Business'', reported that scientists backed by the government of [[Abu Dhabi]], the capital of the [[United Arab Emirates]], had created over 50 artificial rainstorms between July and August 2010 near [[Al Ain]], a city which lies close to the country's border with [[Oman]] and is the second-largest city in the [[Abu Dhabi Emirate]].

Cloud seeding entails spraying small particles, such as [[silver iodide]], onto clouds to affect their development, usually with the goal of increasing precipitation. Cloud seeding only works to the extent that there is already water vapor present in the air. Critics generally contend that claimed successes occur in conditions which were going to lead to rain anyway. It is used in a variety of drought-prone countries, including the [[United States]], [[China]], [[India]], and [[Russia]]. In [[China]] there is a perceived dependency upon it in dry regions, and there is a strong suspicion it is used to \"wash the air\" in dry and heavily polluted places, such as Beijing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Xueliang|last2=Fu|first2=Danhong|last3=Li|first3=Xingyu|last4=Hu|first4=Zhaoxia|last5=Lei|first5=Henchi|last6=Xiao|first6=Hui|last7=Hong|first7=Yanchao|date=February 2015|title=Advances in Cloud Physics and Weather Modification in China|url=https://journals-scholarsportal-info.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/pdf/02561530/v32i0002/230_aicpawmic.xml|journal=Advances in Atmospheric Sciences|publisher=SCIENCE PRESS|volume=32|issue=2|pages=230\u2013249|doi=10.1007/s00376-014-0006-9|via=Web of Science}}</ref> In mountainous areas of the United States such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada,<ref>Hunter, Steven M.

The substance is a [[polymer]] in powder form (a [[polyacrylic acid]] derivative) which reportedly has the ability to absorb 1,500 times its own weight in water. The theory is that the polymer is dropped into clouds to remove their moisture and force the storm to use more energy to move the heavier water drops, thus helping to dissipate the storm. When the gel reaches the ocean surface, it is reportedly dissolved. Peter Cordani teamed up with Mark Daniels and Victor Miller, the owners of a government contracting aviation firm [[AeroGroup]] which operated ex-military aircraft commercially. Using a high altitude B-57 Bomber, [[AeroGroup]] tested the substance dropping 9,000 pounds from the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57]] aircraft's large bomb bay disbursing it into a large thunderstorm cell just off the east coast of Florida.

The substance is a [[polymer]] in powder form (a [[polyacrylic acid]] derivative) which reportedly has the ability to absorb 1,500 times its own weight in water. The theory is that the polymer is dropped into clouds to remove their moisture and force the storm to use more energy to move the heavier water drops, thus helping to dissipate the storm. When the gel reaches the ocean surface, it is reportedly dissolved. Peter Cordani teamed up with Mark Daniels and Victor Miller, the owners of a government contracting aviation firm [[AeroGroup]] which operated ex-military aircraft commercially. Using a high altitude B-57 Bomber, [[AeroGroup]] tested the substance dropping 9,000 pounds from the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57]] aircraft's large bomb bay disbursing it into a large thunderstorm cell just off the east coast of Florida.
