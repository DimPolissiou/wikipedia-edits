However, the CIM-owned company that had purchased Sovereign Partner's lease failed to pay this increased rent, leading to an [[event of default]] under the lease and allowing CIM and Macklowe to begin the eviction process. Franck Muller objected, claiming that CIM was essentially choosing not to pay itself the increased rent and manufacturing an excuse to evict the CIM-owned master lessee and in turn Frank Muller, the sublessee.

He entered politics and devoted money for social and philanthropic causes.\n\n== Early life ==\nGazulu Lakshminarasu Chetty was born in [[Periamet]], [[Madras]]. His father, Sidhulu Chetty, owned a large [[indigo]], dye, and cloth business, and was the first Indian member of the [[Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry|Madras Chamber of Commerce]].<ref name=Muthiah>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chen-columns/the-holey-dollar/article4935194.ece|title=Activism over business|last=S. Muthiah|first=|date=July 21, 2013|website=[[The Hindu]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Due to the poor schooling facilities available in India at the time, Chetty had little formal education. However, even as a boy, Chetty was interested in politics and took part in Debating Societies.\n\n== Business ==\n\nOn completion of his education, Chetty worked as an apprentice under his father, whose business was soon afterwards renamed Sidhulu Chetty and Co.<ref name=ILG>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberalsindia.com/indianliberals/profiles/gazulu_lakshminarasu.php|title=Gazulu Lakshminarasu Chetty|accessdate=2008-10-31|publisher=Indian Liberal Group}}</ref> The firm mainly dealt in handkerchiefs and soon grew into a thriving corporation. After Sidhulu Chetty's death, Gazulu Chetty inherited the firm and expanded its network.\n\nWhen the [[American Civil War]] broke out, cotton trade was temporarily suspended between the United States of America and other countries. Chetty took advantage of the situation and made huge profits by speculating on the price of cotton.<ref name=DoIB>{{cite Wikisource|first=C.

Their proselytisation activities were allegedly favoured by officials of the British government, who preferred native Christians to Hindus in higher appointments in order to entice Hindu Indians to embrace Christianity. The religious stance of the Madras government was frequently condemned by the Hindu population. Chetty supported their cause, and launched agitations against conversions.\n\nOn 02 October 1844, Chetty founded the ''Crescent'', the first Indian-owned newspaper in the Madras Presidency for the \"amelioration of the condition of Hindus\".<ref name=\"indian_nationalism\">{{cite book | title=The Emergence of Indian Nationalism: Competition and Collaboration in the Later Nineteenth Century| last=Seal| first=Anil| year=1971| pages=198| publisher=CUP Archive| id={{ISBN|0521096529}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-09652-2}}}}</ref> But right from the beginning, the newspaper faced strict government opposition. An advertisement sent to the Madras government for insertion into the government publication ''Fort St George Gazette'' was rejected. Further, the government resolved to enact a law wherein a Hindu convert to Christianity would not lose his ancestral right to own property. This was severely condemned by the Hindu community of Madras who, under the leadership of Chetty, presented a memorial to the Governor on 09 April 1845. The government eventually withdrew its plans after prolonged discussions with the agitators.\n\nAround this time, the Madras government tried to introduce the Bible as a standard textbook for the students of the [[Madras University]].<ref name=\"tercentenaryp348\">[[#Madras Tercentenary Commemoration Volume|Madras Tercentenary Commemoration Volume]], Pg 348</ref> Students were often questioned on points connected to [[Christian theology]] and were denied government posts if their knowledge of Christian texts was found wanting. Hindus of the Madras Presidency protested against these measures. Chetty presided over a protest meeting at the Pachaiyappa's College on 07 October 1846 in which it was resolved to send a memorandum to the Court of Directors of the [[British East India Company]]. Their efforts were successful and moves to introduce Christian theology in the curriculum were disbanded. In 1853, the government once again tried to introduce the Bible into the educational curriculum, but its efforts were thwarted by George and [[John Bruce Norton]] and Chetty.<ref name=\"tercentenaryp348\" />\n\n== Torture Commission ==\n\nPeasants in various parts of the Madras Presidency were often subjected to cruel punishments if they failed to pay taxes on time. In 1854, with the assistance of [[Henry Danby Seymour|H. Danby Seymour]], a member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]], Chetty tried to induce the British authorities to investigate the methods of torture inflicted by the revenue collectors. In July 1854, Seymour tried to introduce a motion in the British Parliament. [[Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax|Sir Charles Wood]], President of the India Board, responded by appointing a Torture Commission in September 1854, to investigate the conduct of revenue officials. Further pressure was induced by a petition signed by Chetty and other Indians, which was presented in the [[House of Lords]] on 14 April 1856.\n\n== Madras Native Association ==\n\nChetty established Madras Native Association in 1852 as a platform for educated Indians to protest against any injustice on the part of the British. It was the first Indian political organization in the Madras Presidency. Chetty served as its first president.<ref name=ILG/><ref name=\"indian_nationalism\" /><ref name=\"tercentenaryp348\" /> Initially, his plans had been to establish a branch of the British Indian Association in Madras; however, a separate organisation was formed instead of a branch.<ref name=\"indian_nationalism\" /> P. Somasundaram Chettiar, a close associate of Chetty, served as the Secretary of the organization.<ref name=\"indian_nationalism\" /> The organization frequently locked horns with Christian missionaries.<ref name=\"indian_nationalism\" />\n\nIn 1852, the Madras Native Association presented a detailed list of grievances to the British Parliament. It was read out at the House of Lords on 25 February 1853 by the Earl of Ellenborough along with a petition from the inhabitants of [[Manchester]] that a minister and council for India be appointed and that they be made responsible directly to the British monarch. Chetty followed it up with another petition in 1855. This petition signed by over 14,000 people beseached the British Crown to take the administration of India directly under its control. These petitions resulted in the curtailment of the powers of the British East India Company eventually culminating in the transfer of sovereignty over India to the British Crown. The organisation was dissolved in 1867, one year before Chetty's death.\n\n== Honours ==\n\nIn 1861, Chetty was created [[Order of the Star of India|Companion of the Star of India]].<ref name=DoIB/><ref name=\"tercentenaryp348\" /> Two years later, in 1863, he was nominated to the [[Madras Legislative Council]] on the death of [[Vembaukum Sadagopacharlu|V.

Muthiah|first=|date=July 21, 2013|website=[[The Hindu]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Due to the poor schooling facilities available in India at the time, Chetty had little formal education. However, even as a boy, Chetty was interested in politics and took part in Debating Societies.\n\n== Business ==\n\nOn completion of his education, Chetty worked as an apprentice under his father, whose business was soon afterwards renamed Sidhulu Chetty and Co.<ref name=ILG>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberalsindia.com/indianliberals/profiles/gazulu_lakshminarasu.php|title=Gazulu Lakshminarasu Chetty|accessdate=2008-10-31|publisher=Indian Liberal Group}}</ref> The firm mainly dealt in handkerchiefs and soon grew into a thriving corporation. After Sidhulu Chetty's death, Gazulu Chetty inherited the firm and expanded its network.\n\nWhen the [[American Civil War]] broke out, cotton trade was temporarily suspended between the United States of America and other countries. Chetty took advantage of the situation and made huge profits by speculating on the price of cotton.<ref name=DoIB>{{cite Wikisource|first=C.

Their proselytisation activities were allegedly favoured by officials of the British government, who preferred native Christians to Hindus in higher appointments in order to entice Hindu Indians to embrace Christianity. The religious stance of the Madras government was frequently condemned by the Hindu population. Chetty supported their cause, and launched agitations against conversions.\n\nOn 02 October 1844, Chetty founded the ''Crescent'', the first Indian-owned newspaper in the Madras Presidency for the \"amelioration of the condition of Hindus\".<ref name=\"indian_nationalism\">{{cite book | title=The Emergence of Indian Nationalism: Competition and Collaboration in the Later Nineteenth Century| last=Seal| first=Anil| year=1971| pages=198| publisher=CUP Archive| id={{ISBN|0521096529}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-09652-2}}}}</ref> But right from the beginning, the newspaper faced strict government opposition. An advertisement sent to the Madras government for insertion into the government publication ''Fort St George Gazette'' was rejected. Further, the government resolved to enact a law wherein a Hindu convert to Christianity would not lose his ancestral right to own property. This was severely condemned by the Hindu community of Madras who, under the leadership of Chetty, presented a memorial to the Governor on 09 April 1845. The government eventually withdrew its plans after prolonged discussions with the agitators.\n\nAround this time, the Madras government tried to introduce the Bible as a standard textbook for the students of the [[Madras University]].<ref name=\"tercentenaryp348\">[[#Madras Tercentenary Commemoration Volume|Madras Tercentenary Commemoration Volume]], Pg 348</ref> Students were often questioned on points connected to [[Christian theology]] and were denied government posts if their knowledge of Christian texts was found wanting. Hindus of the Madras Presidency protested against these measures. Chetty presided over a protest meeting at the Pachaiyappa's College on 07 October 1846 in which it was resolved to send a memorandum to the Court of Directors of the [[British East India Company]]. Their efforts were successful and moves to introduce Christian theology in the curriculum were disbanded. In 1853, the government once again tried to introduce the Bible into the educational curriculum, but its efforts were thwarted by George and [[John Bruce Norton]] and Chetty.<ref name=\"tercentenaryp348\" />\n\n== Torture Commission ==\n\nPeasants in various parts of the Madras Presidency were often subjected to cruel punishments if they failed to pay taxes on time. In 1854, with the assistance of [[Henry Danby Seymour|H. Danby Seymour]], a member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]], Chetty tried to induce the British authorities to investigate the methods of torture inflicted by the revenue collectors. In July 1854, Seymour tried to introduce a motion in the British Parliament. [[Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax|Sir Charles Wood]], President of the India Board, responded by appointing a Torture Commission in September 1854, to investigate the conduct of revenue officials. Further pressure was induced by a petition signed by Chetty and other Indians, which was presented in the [[House of Lords]] on 14 April 1856.\n\n== Madras Native Association ==\n\nChetty established Madras Native Association in 1852 as a platform for educated Indians to protest against any injustice on the part of the British. It was the first Indian political organization in the Madras Presidency. Chetty served as its first president.<ref name=ILG/><ref name=\"indian_nationalism\" /><ref name=\"tercentenaryp348\" /> Initially, his plans had been to establish a branch of the British Indian Association in Madras; however, a separate organisation was formed instead of a branch.<ref name=\"indian_nationalism\" /> P. Somasundaram Chettiar, a close associate of Chetty, served as the Secretary of the organization.<ref name=\"indian_nationalism\" /> The organization frequently locked horns with Christian missionaries.<ref name=\"indian_nationalism\" />\n\nIn 1852, the Madras Native Association presented a detailed list of grievances to the British Parliament. It was read out at the House of Lords on 25 February 1853 by the Earl of Ellenborough along with a petition from the inhabitants of [[Manchester]] that a minister and council for India be appointed and that they be made responsible directly to the British monarch. Chetty followed it up with another petition in 1855. This petition signed by over 14,000 people beseached the British Crown to take the administration of India directly under its control. These petitions resulted in the curtailment of the powers of the British East India Company eventually culminating in the transfer of sovereignty over India to the British Crown. The organisation was dissolved in 1867, one year before Chetty's death.\n\n== Honours ==\n\nIn 1861, Chetty was created [[Order of the Star of India|Companion of the Star of India]].<ref name=DoIB/><ref name=\"tercentenaryp348\" /> Two years later, in 1863, he was nominated to the [[Madras Legislative Council]] on the death of [[Vembaukum Sadagopacharlu|V. Sadagopacharlu]], the first Indian nominated to the Madras Legislative Council as per the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]].<ref name=\"tercentenaryp348\" />\n\n== Death ==\n\nChetty died in poverty in 1868, having spent all his money in his social and political activities.<ref name=ILG/><ref name=DoIB/>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book|title=Representative Indians|url=https://archive.org/details/RepresentativeIndian|pages=[https://archive.org/details/RepresentativeIndian/page/n225 193]\u2013207|year=1897|author=Pillai, G.
