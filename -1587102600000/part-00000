It was filmed in [[Chicago]] and was released on April 7, 2000 by [[Metro\u2013Goldwyn\u2013Mayer]]. It was [[Carroll O'Connor]]'s final film before his death the following year.\n\n==Plot==\nBob and Elizabeth Rueland ([[David Duchovny]] and [[Joely Richardson]]) live and work in Chicago \u2014 Bob as an architect, Elizabeth as a zoologist at [[Lincoln Park Zoo]].\n\nOn the night of her fundraiser for a new primate house, Bob promises Elizabeth he'll finish the building. Elizabeth is killed in a car accident leaving the fundraiser, and her [[heart transplant|heart is transplanted]] to artist Grace Briggs ([[Minnie Driver]]), who has suffered from heart disease since the age of 14 and is near death.\n\nThe surgery is successful; Grace is able to live a normal life for the first time and plans to make her first airplane trip to Italy to paint. Grace's best friend Megan Dayton ([[Bonnie Hunt]]), encourages her to start dating in spite of her self-consciousness about the long surgical scar on her chest.\n\nGrace writes a letter to the donor's family after the surgery, thanking them for the heart she received; it takes her over a year to finally find the courage to mail the letter. Bob works to build the primate house Elizabeth raised money for; he is still depressed a year after her death. He recognizes that he must resume his life as he becomes frustrated seeing that his dog hasn't gotten over the loss either. His friend, veterinarian Charlie ([[David Alan Grier]]), organizes a blind date for him at O'Reilly's, a self-styled Irish-Italian restaurant. The date goes very badly, but Bob finds that he is interested in the waitress \u2014 Grace, who is also the granddaughter of the restaurant's owner, Marty O'Reilly ([[Carroll O'Connor]]).\n\nAlthough they are both unaware of the connection they have through Elizabeth's heart, Bob and Grace begin to date. As they grow closer together, Grace is reluctant to tell Bob about her medical history. After several months of dating, Grace finally decides to tell Bob about her transplant. However, before she gets the chance, she finds in his house the letter that she had sent several months earlier. Horrified by the discovery, Grace flees and tells Megan what has happened. Megan's husband, Joe, ([[Jim Belushi]]) becomes infuriated as he has misunderstood Grace's panic and thinks Bob must be married. Megan then explains the situation to him in six monosyllables: \"Grace has Bob's dead wife's heart!\" When Grace meets Bob again, she tells him the truth. Stunned and not knowing what to say, he leaves.\n\nAgainst Megan's advice to not run away from the situation, Grace goes to Italy alone. Back at home, Bob realizes that although he will always miss Elizabeth, he \"aches\" for Grace. He decides to go after her, and the two reunite in Italy.  They return to Chicago for the dedication of the new primate house.\n\nAs the film ends we see Wally ([[William Bronder]]) and Sophie ([[Marianne Muellerleile]]) dancing happily at their wedding reception at O'Reilly's restaurant, and Charlie holding Joe and a visibly pregnant Megan's toddler, while they join Grace and Bob on the dance floor.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Duchovny]] as Bob Rueland\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as Grace Briggs\n* [[Carroll O'Connor]] as Marty O'Reilly\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Angelo Pardipillo\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as Megan Dayton\n* [[David Alan Grier]] as Charlie Johnson\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Elizabeth Rueland\n* [[Eddie Jones (actor)|Eddie Jones]] as Emmett McFadden\n* [[Jim Belushi|James Belushi]] as Joe Dayton\n* [[William Bronder]] as Wally Jatczak\n* [[Marianne Muellerleile]] as Sophie\n* [[Dick Cusack]] as Mr. Bennington\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received generally mixed reviews.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  \nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty.

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  \nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

She '''went''' \"Who are you going with?\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n  c.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows where the source of the quotation is from. <ref name=\"SRL Ev>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353\u2013370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 }}</ref> Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] from full lexical verbs. <ref name=\"Chojnicka Latvian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chojnicka |first1=Joanna |title=Latvian verbs of speaking and their relations to evidentiality |journal=Kalbotyra |issue=69 |page=59-81}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
