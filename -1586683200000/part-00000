Nerf blasters are manufactured in multiple forms, including [[pistol]]s, [[rifle]]s, and [[light machine gun]]s. The first Nerf blasters emerged in the late 1980s with the release of the Nerf Blast-a-Ball<ref>[http://nerfguns.org/nerf-blast-a-ball Nerf Blast-a-Ball]</ref> and the Arrowstorm.\n\nThe Nerf blaster line currently consists of eighteen lines: N-Strike Elite, Alien Menace, Dart Tag, Vortex, Zombie Strike, Modulus, Mega, N-Strike, RIVAL, Doomlands, Super Soaker, Accustrike, Rebelle, Modulus Ghost Ops, Laser Ops Pro, Micro Shots, and Mega Accustrike. Cross-promotional models have also been released, themed around [[Marvel Comics]], ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Fortnite]]'', and ''[[Transformers]]''.\n\nAll Nerf blasters come packaged with a set of foam darts or mega darts matched to fit into their chambers. Refill darts can also be purchased separately. A majority of Nerf blasters are compatible with the different types of foam darts available; but the Magazine System blasters will only take Streamline darts, which have smaller diameter tips. In 2013, Elite darts became the new standard darts, as they are compatible with both regular and Magazine System blasters.\n\nNumerous accessories for Nerf blasters are available separately or supplied with selected blasters. These consist of ammunition holders or attachments that enhance the functional or aesthetic elements of Nerf blasters, as well as some [[Super Soaker]] blasters.\n\nThe Nerf line is also sold in [[Japan]] by [[Takara Tomy]], which sells other Hasbro products in the country. For marketing reasons, some blasters have been given different names in Japan. For example, the Stampede ECS is called \"Blazing Burst ECS\", while the Longstrike CS-6 is called \"Sniper Shot CS-6\"; nevertheless, these blasters still have their original names molded on them.\n\nIn 2011, the Nerf N-Strike Stampede ECS was awarded \"Boy Toy of the Year\" at the 11th Annual Toy of the Year Awards, which is held at the [[American International Toy Fair]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/11_best_toys_2011_toy_industry_awards |title=The 11 Best Toys of 2011 |author=Per-Lee, Myra |publisher=InventorSpot |accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref> In 2014, the Nerf Zombie Strike Crossfire Bow won the award for \"Best Action Toy\" at the 2014 U.K. Toy Fair.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/uk-toy-fair-2014-toy-winners-announced |title=U.K. Toy Fair: 2014 Toy Winners Announced |publisher=Global License! |date=2014-01-21 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Product lines==\n[[File:Nerf blaster.webm|thumb|300px|Engineering design of a Nerf Triad EX-3 blaster]]\n\n===N-Strike===\n[[File:Nerf (5697272271).jpg|thumb|A man aiming an N-Strike Stampede ECS]]\nN-Strike was the main line of the Blasters toy series.

It has five interchangeable parts: a barrel extension, flip up sight, dual-mode light beam, stock and main blaster. It resembles the M4 Carbine Rifle.

Firing distances are up to {{convert|75|ft|m}} for the U.S. models, while international models (identifiable by their grey triggers) have a maximum firing distance of {{convert|15|m|ft}}. The average Nerf blaster fires darts at around 70 feet per second.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/nerf/en_US/n-strike_elite.cfm |title=Nerf N-Strike Elite |publisher=[[Hasbro]] |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}</ref>\n\n====Elite XD====\nElite XD is a sub-series of N-Strike Elite and N-Strike Mega (Mega XD), but with advertised ranges of {{convert|85|to|90|ft|m}} for the US version and {{convert|22|m|ft}} for the international model. Although advertised as having a longer range than the Elite, the only difference in design is the different coloring, it did not affect performance significantly, confirmed by testing Elite XD reshells against their blue counterparts.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Recently, however, Hasbro updated the packaging for Elite XD blasters, no longer claiming a performance boost.\nThe current top elite blaster is the Titan CS-50 which is currently top of the range and comes with a 50 round mag and is fully automatic.\n\n===N-Strike Mega===\nN-Strike Mega, formally N-Strike Mega Series, is a line of blasters which fire red-colored ammunition larger than elite darts in both size and diameter. Nerf had advertised them to fire at \"mega\" ranges of up to 100 feet. In addition, they are also designed to \"whistle\" through the air. The series used to be a sub-series of N-Strike and N-Strike Elite, but evolved into its own series sometime in 2016.\n\n===Zombie Strike===\nThe Zombie Strike series was introduced in mid-2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/prepare-for-a-nerf-apocalypse-with-the-new-zombie-strik-743035852 |title=Prepare for a Nerf apocalypse with the new Zombie Strike line! |author=Bricken, Rob |publisher=[[Io9]] |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}</ref> This series contains blasters similar in performance to that of the N-Strike Elite line, but mostly green, and themed as weapons made from a toolshed.

It has darts designed for accuracy, with rifling in the dart tips. The darts get less range then N-Strike Elite blasters, but with better accuracy, but the blasters are really no different. They can also shoot up to 75 ft (22 M) with speeds about 70 FPS. The current blasters in the sub-series are the Alphahawk, FalconFire, Raptorstrike, Stratohawk, Accutrooper and the Quadrant. Some of the blasters in the line are also re-skins of N-Strike and N-Strike Elite Blasters, mainly the Stratohawk and Accutrooper.\n\n===Vortex===\nThe Vortex line was launched in 2011.

It is compatible with rail-mounted Nerf attachments via two tactical rails on top.  The blaster is painted in a white, black and orange color scheme with a distinctive raised gold \"ULTRA\" label on the right side (the raised logo is repeated on the left side, but in white, rather than gold).

Nerf blasters are manufactured in multiple forms, including [[pistol]]s, [[rifle]]s, and [[light machine gun]]s. The first Nerf blasters emerged in the late 1980s with the release of the Nerf Blast-a-Ball<ref>[http://nerfguns.org/nerf-blast-a-ball Nerf Blast-a-Ball]</ref> and the Arrowstorm.\n\nThe Nerf blaster line currently consists of eighteen lines: N-Strike Elite, Alien Menace, Dart Tag, Vortex, Zombie Strike, Modulus, Mega, N-Strike, RIVAL, Doomlands, Super Soaker, Accustrike, Rebelle, Modulus Ghost Ops, Laser Ops Pro, Micro Shots, and Mega Accustrike. Cross-promotional models have also been released, themed around [[Marvel Comics]], ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Fortnite]]'', and ''[[Transformers]]''.\n\nAll Nerf blasters come packaged with a set of foam darts or mega darts matched to fit into their chambers. Refill darts can also be purchased separately. A majority of Nerf blasters are compatible with the different types of foam darts available; but the Magazine System blasters will only take Streamline darts, which have smaller diameter tips. In 2013, Elite darts became the new standard darts, as they are compatible with both regular and Magazine System blasters.\n\nNumerous accessories for Nerf blasters are available separately or supplied with selected blasters. These consist of ammunition holders or attachments that enhance the functional or aesthetic elements of Nerf blasters, as well as some [[Super Soaker]] blasters.\n\nThe Nerf line is also sold in [[Japan]] by [[Takara Tomy]], which sells other Hasbro products in the country. For marketing reasons, some blasters have been given different names in Japan. For example, the Stampede ECS is called \"Blazing Burst ECS\", while the Longstrike CS-6 is called \"Sniper Shot CS-6\"; nevertheless, these blasters still have their original names molded on them.\n\nIn 2011, the Nerf N-Strike Stampede ECS was awarded \"Boy Toy of the Year\" at the 11th Annual Toy of the Year Awards, which is held at the [[American International Toy Fair]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/11_best_toys_2011_toy_industry_awards |title=The 11 Best Toys of 2011 |author=Per-Lee, Myra |publisher=InventorSpot |accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref> In 2014, the Nerf Zombie Strike Crossfire Bow won the award for \"Best Action Toy\" at the 2014 U.K. Toy Fair.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/uk-toy-fair-2014-toy-winners-announced |title=U.K. Toy Fair: 2014 Toy Winners Announced |publisher=Global License! |date=2014-01-21 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Product lines==\n[[File:Nerf blaster.webm|thumb|300px|Engineering design of a Nerf Triad EX-3 blaster]]\n\n===N-Strike===\n[[File:Nerf (5697272271).jpg|thumb|A man aiming an N-Strike Stampede ECS]]\nN-Strike was the main line of the Blasters toy series.

It has five interchangeable parts: a barrel extension, flip up sight, dual-mode light beam, stock and main blaster. It resembles the M4 Carbine Rifle. Its Elite successor is the N-Strike Elite Retaliator.\n\nIn 2010, the Stampede ECS - a bi-pod-mounted, battery-powered blaster which is loaded with dart magazines<ref name=\"mechanics\">{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/toys/nerf-stampede-hands-on-review?click=main_sr |title=Nerf Stampede Hands-On Review |author=Porges, Seth |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=2010-08-11 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}</ref> - was awarded \"Boy Toy of the Year\" at the 11th Annual Toy of the Year Awards, which is held at the [[American International Toy Fair]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/11_best_toys_2011_toy_industry_awards |title=The 11 Best Toys of 2011 |author=Per-Lee, Myra |publisher=InventorSpot |accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref> ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' praised it as \"the best overall Nerf gun ever\", being easy to use and less prone to jamming than earlier battery-powered Nerf models.<ref name=\"mechanics\"/>\n\n===N-Strike Elite===\nOn August 1, 2012, the N-Strike line was succeeded by the N-Strike Elite, with improved internal mechanisms for better firing distances. Firing distances are up to {{convert|75|ft|m}} for the U.S. models, while international models (identifiable by their grey triggers) have a maximum firing distance of {{convert|15|m|ft}}. The average Nerf blaster fires darts at around 70 feet per second.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/nerf/en_US/n-strike_elite.cfm |title=Nerf N-Strike Elite |publisher=[[Hasbro]] |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}</ref>\n\n====Elite XD====\nElite XD is a sub-series of N-Strike Elite and N-Strike Mega (Mega XD), but with advertised ranges of {{convert|85|to|90|ft|m}} for the US version and {{convert|22|m|ft}} for the international model. Although advertised as having a longer range than the Elite, the only difference in design is the different coloring, it did not affect performance significantly, confirmed by testing Elite XD reshells against their blue counterparts.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Recently, however, Hasbro updated the packaging for Elite XD blasters, no longer claiming a performance boost.\nThe current top elite blaster is the Titan CS-50 which is currently top of the range and comes with a 50 round mag and is fully automatic.\n\n===N-Strike Mega===\nN-Strike Mega, formally N-Strike Mega Series, is a line of blasters which fire red-colored ammunition larger than elite darts in both size and diameter. Nerf had advertised them to fire at \"mega\" ranges of up to 100 feet. In addition, they are also designed to \"whistle\" through the air. The series used to be a sub-series of N-Strike and N-Strike Elite, but evolved into its own series sometime in 2016.\n\n===Zombie Strike===\nThe Zombie Strike series was introduced in mid-2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/prepare-for-a-nerf-apocalypse-with-the-new-zombie-strik-743035852 |title=Prepare for a Nerf apocalypse with the new Zombie Strike line! |author=Bricken, Rob |publisher=[[Io9]] |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}</ref> This series contains blasters similar in performance to that of the N-Strike Elite line, but mostly green, and themed as weapons made from a toolshed.
