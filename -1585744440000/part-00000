The action was a disaster for the IRA; three of its volunteers were killed and two wounded. Six British soldiers were wounded, three seriously.

The ambushers, led by Charlie Hurley, were 13 strong but had only 7 [[rifle]]s, the remainder being equipped only with [[revolver]]s or [[semi-automatic pistol]]s.<ref name=Barry93>Barry 1981, p. 93.</ref> They took up position at the station ten minutes before the train pulled in, imprisoning the station master, clearing the station and taking cover behind sacks of grain and flour taken from a store.\n\nThe train was carrying around 50 British soldiers of the [[Essex Regiment]], who were mingled with civilian passengers throughout the train's carriages. The IRA party was therefore quite heavily outnumbered and out-gunned. However they were not warned of this, as two IRA scouts, who were supposed to have been on the train and signalled to them of British numbers, never turned up.<ref name=Barry93/> They also wrongly believed that the British troops were all in the central carriage.

{"title_page": "Urca process", "text_new": "{{short description|Phenomenon in astroparticle physics}}\nIn [[astroparticle physics]], an '''Urca process''' is a reaction which emits a [[neutrino]] and which is assumed to take part in cooling processes in [[neutron star]]s and [[white dwarf]]s.  The process was first discussed by [[George Gamow]] and [[M\u00e1rio Schenberg]] while they were visiting a casino named [[Cassino da Urca]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].  As Gamow recounts in his autobiography, the name was chosen in part to commemorate the gambling establishment where the two physicists had first met, and \"partially because the Urca Process results in a rapid disappearance of thermal energy from the interior of a star, similar to the rapid disappearance of money from the pockets of the gamblers on the Casino de Urca.\"<ref>{{cite book | last =  Gamow | first =  George | title = My World Line: An Informal Autobiography | publisher = The Viking Press | edition =  | location = New York | date =  | page = 137  | isbn = }}</ref> In Gamow's South Russian dialect, ''urca'' ({{lang-ru|\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0430}}) can also mean a robber or gangster.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |author=D.

The baryons can be [[nucleon]]s (free or bound), [[hyperon]]s like {{SubatomicParticle|Lambda}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Sigma}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Xi}}, or members of the {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Delta}} [[Isobar (nuclide)|isobar]]. The [[lepton]] is either an [[electron]] or a [[muon]].\n\nThe Urca process is especially important in the cooling of white dwarfs, where a lepton (usually an electron) is absorbed by the nucleus of an ion and then convectively carried away from the core of a star.  Then, a beta decay occurs.  Convection then carries the element back into the interior of the star, and the cycle repeats many times.  Because the neutrinos emitted during this process are unlikely to be reabsorbed, this is effectively a cooling mechanism for white dwarfs.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |author      = M.

The process was first discussed by [[George Gamow]] and [[M\u00e1rio Schenberg]] while they were visiting a casino named [[Cassino da Urca]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].  As Gamow recounts in his autobiography, the name was chosen in part to commemorate the gambling establishment where the two physicists had first met, and \"partially because the Urca Process results in a rapid disappearance of thermal energy from the interior of a star, similar to the rapid disappearance of money from the pockets of the gamblers on the Casino de Urca.\"<ref>{{cite book | last =  Gamow | first =  George | title = My World Line: An Informal Autobiography | publisher = The Viking Press | edition =  | location = New York | date =  | page = 137  | isbn = }}</ref> In Gamow's South Russian dialect, ''urca'' ({{lang-ru|\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0430}}) can also mean a robber or gangster.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |author=D.

They have the general form\n:{|\n| [[Baryon|B{{su|b=1}}]] ||   ||                                       || \u2192 || B{{su|b=2}} || + || {{SubatomicParticle|Lepton|link=yes}} || + || {{SubatomicParticle|Lepton antineutrino|link=yes}},\n|------------------------------------------\n| B{{su|b=2}}            || + || {{SubatomicParticle|Lepton|link=yes}} || \u2192 || B{{su|b=1}} || + ||{{SubatomicParticle|Lepton neutrino|link=yes}},\n|}\n\nwhere B{{su|b=1}} and B{{su|b=2}} are [[baryon]]s, {{SubatomicParticle|Lepton}} is a [[lepton]], and {{SubatomicParticle|Lepton neutrino}} (and {{SubatomicParticle|Lepton antineutrino}}) are (anti-)[[neutrino]]s. The baryons can be [[nucleon]]s (free or bound), [[hyperon]]s like {{SubatomicParticle|Lambda}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Sigma}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Xi}}, or members of the {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Delta}} [[Isobar (nuclide)|isobar]]. The [[lepton]] is either an [[electron]] or a [[muon]].\n\nThe Urca process is especially important in the cooling of white dwarfs, where a lepton (usually an electron) is absorbed by the nucleus of an ion and then convectively carried away from the core of a star.  Then, a beta decay occurs.  Convection then carries the element back into the interior of the star, and the cycle repeats many times.  Because the neutrinos emitted during this process are unlikely to be reabsorbed, this is effectively a cooling mechanism for white dwarfs.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |author      = M.

M. Forster]], about a young woman in the restrained culture of [[Edwardian era]] England. Set in Italy and England, the story is both a romance and a humorous critique of English society at the beginning of the 20th century. [[Merchant Ivory]] produced an award-winning [[A Room with a View (1986 film)|film adaptation]] in 1985.\n\nThe [[Modern Library]] ranked ''A Room with a View'' 79th on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]] (1998).\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n=== Part one===\n\nThe novel is set in the early 1900s Malik is known to have the best waves throughout the novel as upper-middle class English women are beginning to lead more independent, adventurous lives. In the first part, Miss Lucy Honeychurch is touring [[Italy]] with her overly-fussy spinster cousin and [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]], Miss Charlotte Bartlett. The novel opens in [[Florence]] with the women complaining about their rooms at the Pensione Bertolini. They were promised rooms with a view of the [[Arno River|River Arno]] but instead have ones overlooking a drab courtyard. Another guest, Mr Emerson, interrupts their \"peevish wrangling\" by spontaneously offering to swap rooms. He and his son, George, both have rooms with views of the Arno, and argues, \"Women like looking at a view; men don\u2019t.\" Charlotte rejects the offer, partly because she looks down on the Emersons' unconventional behaviour, and partially fears it would place them under an \"unseemly obligation\". However, another guest, Mr Beebe, an [[Anglican]] clergyman, persuades Charlotte to accept the offer; Charlotte suggests that the Emersons are socialists.\n\nThe following day, Lucy spends a \"long morning\" in the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]], accompanied by Miss Eleanor Lavish, a novelist, who promises to lead her on an adventure. Lavish confiscates Lucy's [[Baedeker]] guidebook, proclaiming she will show Lucy the \"true Italy\". On the way to [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]], the two take a wrong turn and get lost. After drifting for hours through various streets and piazzas, they eventually make it to the square in front of the church, only for Lavish to abandon Lucy (who still has her Baedeker) to pursue an old acquaintance.<ref>See the Dover Thrift Edition [New York, 1995], pp. 13\u201316.</ref> \n\nInside the church, Lucy runs into the Emersons. Although the other visitors find Mr. Emmerson's behavior somewhat unrefined, Lucy discovers she likes them both; she repeatedly encounters them in Florence. While touring [[Piazza della Signoria]], Lucy and George Emerson separately witness a murder. Lucy, overcome by its gruesomeness, is aided by George as she faints. Recovered, she asks him to retrieve the photographs she dropped near the murder scene. George finds them, but as they are covered in blood, he throws them into the river before telling Lucy; Lucy observes how boyish George is. As they stop by the River Arno before returning to the pensione, they engage in a personal conversation. \n\nLucy decides to avoid George, partly because she is confused by her feelings, and also to placate Charlotte who grows wary of the eccentric Emersons. She overheard Mr Eager, a clergyman, saying that Mr Emerson, \"murdered his wife in the sight of God\".  \n\nLater in the week, Mr Beebe, Mr Eager, the Emersons, Miss Lavish, Charlotte, and Lucy go on a day trip to Fiesole, a scenic area above Florence, driven in two carriages by Italian drivers. One driver is permitted to have a pretty girl he claims is his sister sit next to him on the box seat. When he kisses her, Mr Eager promptly orders her to leave. In the other carriage, Mr Emerson remarks how it is defeat rather than victory to part two people in love. \n\nOn a hillside, Lucy abandons Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett to their gossip and goes searching for Mr Beebe. Misunderstanding Lucy's awkward Italian, the driver leads her to where George is admiring the view. Overcome by Lucy's beauty amongst a field of violets, he takes her in his arms and kisses her. However, they are interrupted by Charlotte, who is shocked and upset, but mostly is ruffled by her own failure as a chaperone. Lucy promises Charlotte that she will say nothing to her mother about the \"insult\" George has paid her. The two women leave for Rome the next day before Lucy can say goodbye to George.\n\n===Part two===\nIn Rome, Lucy spends time with Cecil Vyse, whom she knew in England. Cecil twice proposes to Lucy in Italy; she rejects him both times. As Part Two begins, Lucy has returned to [[Surrey]], England, to her family home, Windy Corner. Cecil proposes yet again and this time she accepts. Cecil is a sophisticated London aesthete whose rank and class make him a desirable match, despite his despising country society; he is a rather comic figure who is snobbish and gives himself pretentious airs. \n\nThe [[vicar]], Mr Beebe, announces that a local villa has been leased; the new tenants are the Emersons, who, after a chance meeting with Cecil in London, learned about the villa being available. Cecil enticed them to come to the village as a comeuppance to the villa's landlord, Sir Harry Otway, whom Cecil (who believes himself to be very democratic) thinks is a snob. Lucy is angry with Cecil, as she had tentatively arranged for the elderly Misses Alan, guests at the Pensione Bertolini, to rent the villa. \n\nFate takes an ironic turn as Mr Beebe introduces Lucy's brother, Freddy, to the Emersons. Freddy invites George for \"a bathe\" in a nearby pond in the woods. Freddy, George, and Mr Beebe go to there. Freddy and George undress and jump in, eventually convincing Mr. Beebe to join them. They men enjoy themselves, frolicking and splashing in and out of the pond and running through the bushes until Lucy, her mother, and Cecil come upon them, having taken a short-cut through the woods during their walk. \n\nFreddy later invites George to play tennis at Windy Corner. Although Lucy is initially mortified by facing both George and Cecil (who is also visiting), she resolves to be gracious. Cecil annoys everyone by pacing around and reading aloud from a light romance novel that contains a scene suspiciously reminiscent of when George kissed Lucy in Florence. George catches Lucy alone in the garden and kisses her again. Lucy realises that the novel was written by Miss Lavish (the writer-acquaintance from Florence) and that Charlotte must thus have told her about the kiss.\n\nFurious with Charlotte for betraying her secret, Lucy forces her cousin to watch as she orders George to leave Windy Corner and never return. George argues that Cecil only sees Lucy as an \"object for the shelf\" and he will never love her enough to grant her independence, while George loves her for who she is. Lucy is moved but remains firm. Later that evening, after Cecil again rudely declines to play tennis, Lucy sees Cecil for what he truly is and ends their engagement. She decides to flee to Greece with the two Misses Alans. Meanwhile, George, unable to bear being around Lucy, is moving his father back to London, unaware Lucy has broken off her engagement. Shortly before Lucy's departure, she accidentally encounters Mr Emerson at Mr Beebe's house. He is unaware that Lucy is no longer engaged, and Lucy is unable to lie to him. Mr Emerson, with open, honest talk, strips away her defences, forcing Lucy to admit she has been in love with George all along.\n\nThe novel ends in Florence, in melodramatic fashion, where George and Lucy have [[elope]]d without Mrs Honeychurch's consent. However, Lucy has learned that Charlotte knew that Mr. Emerson was at Mr. Beebe's that fateful day, and had not discouraged or prevented her from going in and encountering him. Although Lucy \"had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps forever\", the story ends with the promise of lifelong love for both her and George.\n\n===Appendix===\nIn some editions, an appendix to the novel is given entitled \"A View without a Room\", written by Forster in 1958 as to what occurred between Lucy and George after the events of the novel. It is Forster's afterthought of the novel, and he quite clearly states that, \"I cannot think where George and Lucy live.\" They were quite comfortable up until the end of the [[First World War]], with Charlotte Bartlett leaving them all her money in her will, but the war ruined their happiness according to Forster. George became a [[conscientious objector]] and lost his government job. He was given non-combatant duties to avoid prison. This left Mrs Honeychurch deeply upset with her son-in-law. Mr Emerson died during the war, shortly after having a confrontation with police over Lucy's playing the music of a German composer, [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], on the piano. Eventually the couple had three children, two girls and a boy, and moved to Carshalton from Highgate to find a home. Despite their wanting to move into Windy Corner after Mrs Honeychurch's death, Freddy sold the house to support his family, as he was \"an unsuccessful but prolific doctor\".\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], George immediately enlisted as he saw the need to stop [[Hitler]] and the [[Nazi regime]]. He was unfaithful to Lucy during his time at war. Lucy was left homeless after her flat in Watford was bombed and the same happened to her married daughter in Nuneaton. George rose to the rank of corporal but was taken prisoner by the Italians in Africa. Once the fascist government in Italy fell, George returned to Florence. Finding it \"in a mess\", he was unable to find the Pensione Bertolini, stating, \"the View was still there,\" and that \"the room must be there, too, but could not be found.\" Forster ends by stating that George and Lucy await the Third World War, but with no word on where they live, for even he does not know.\n\nHe adds that Cecil served in \"Information or whatever the withholding of information was then entitled\" during the war, and was able to trick an Alexandria hostess into playing Beethoven's ''Moonlight Sonata'' by claiming he was Belgian, not German.\n\n==Allusions/references to other works==\n* Mr Beebe recalls his first encounter with Lucy was hearing her play the first of the two movements of Beethoven's final piano sonata, [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Opus 111]], at a talent show in Tunbridge Wells.\n* While visiting the Emersons Mr Beebe contemplates the numerous books strewn around.\n:\"I fancy they know how to read \u2013 a rare accomplishment. What have they got? [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]. Exactly. ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]''. Never heard of it. ''[[The Way of All Flesh (novel)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. Never heard of it.

M. Forster]], about a young woman in the restrained culture of [[Edwardian era]] England. Set in Italy and England, the story is both a romance and a humorous critique of English society at the beginning of the 20th century. [[Merchant Ivory]] produced an award-winning [[A Room with a View (1986 film)|film adaptation]] in 1985.\n\nThe [[Modern Library]] ranked ''A Room with a View'' 79th on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]] (1998).\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n=== Part one===\n\nThe novel is set in the early 1900s as upper-middle class English women are beginning to lead more independent, adventurous lives. In the first part, Miss Lucy Honeychurch is touring [[Italy]] with her overly-fussy spinster cousin and [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]], Miss Charlotte Bartlett. The novel opens in [[Florence]] with the women complaining about their rooms at the Pensione Bertolini. They were promised rooms with a view of the [[Arno River|River Arno]] but instead have ones overlooking a drab courtyard. Another guest, Mr Emerson, interrupts their \"peevish wrangling\" by spontaneously offering to swap rooms. He and his son, George, both have rooms with views of the Arno, and argues, \"Women like looking at a view; men don\u2019t.\" Charlotte rejects the offer, partly because she looks down on the Emersons' unconventional behaviour, and partially fears it would place them under an \"unseemly obligation\". However, another guest, Mr Beebe, an [[Anglican]] clergyman, persuades Charlotte to accept the offer; Charlotte suggests that the Emersons are socialists.\n\nThe following day, Lucy spends a \"long morning\" in the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]], accompanied by Miss Eleanor Lavish, a novelist, who promises to lead her on an adventure. Lavish confiscates Lucy's [[Baedeker]] guidebook, proclaiming she will show Lucy the \"true Italy\". On the way to [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]], the two take a wrong turn and get lost. After drifting for hours through various streets and piazzas, they eventually make it to the square in front of the church, only for Lavish to abandon Lucy (who still has her Baedeker) to pursue an old acquaintance.<ref>See the Dover Thrift Edition [New York, 1995], pp. 13\u201316.</ref> \n\nInside the church, Lucy runs into the Emersons. Although the other visitors find Mr. Emmerson's behavior somewhat unrefined, Lucy discovers she likes them both; she repeatedly encounters them in Florence. While touring [[Piazza della Signoria]], Lucy and George Emerson separately witness a murder. Lucy, overcome by its gruesomeness, is aided by George as she faints. Recovered, she asks him to retrieve the photographs she dropped near the murder scene. George finds them, but as they are covered in blood, he throws them into the river before telling Lucy; Lucy observes how boyish George is. As they stop by the River Arno before returning to the pensione, they engage in a personal conversation. \n\nLucy decides to avoid George, partly because she is confused by her feelings, and also to placate Charlotte who grows wary of the eccentric Emersons. She overheard Mr Eager, a clergyman, saying that Mr Emerson, \"murdered his wife in the sight of God\".  \n\nLater in the week, Mr Beebe, Mr Eager, the Emersons, Miss Lavish, Charlotte, and Lucy go on a day trip to Fiesole, a scenic area above Florence, driven in two carriages by Italian drivers. One driver is permitted to have a pretty girl he claims is his sister sit next to him on the box seat. When he kisses her, Mr Eager promptly orders her to leave. In the other carriage, Mr Emerson remarks how it is defeat rather than victory to part two people in love. \n\nOn a hillside, Lucy abandons Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett to their gossip and goes searching for Mr Beebe. Misunderstanding Lucy's awkward Italian, the driver leads her to where George is admiring the view. Overcome by Lucy's beauty amongst a field of violets, he takes her in his arms and kisses her. However, they are interrupted by Charlotte, who is shocked and upset, but mostly is ruffled by her own failure as a chaperone. Lucy promises Charlotte that she will say nothing to her mother about the \"insult\" George has paid her. The two women leave for Rome the next day before Lucy can say goodbye to George.\n\n===Part two===\nIn Rome, Lucy spends time with Cecil Vyse, whom she knew in England. Cecil twice proposes to Lucy in Italy; she rejects him both times. As Part Two begins, Lucy has returned to [[Surrey]], England, to her family home, Windy Corner. Cecil proposes yet again and this time she accepts. Cecil is a sophisticated London aesthete whose rank and class make him a desirable match, despite his despising country society; he is a rather comic figure who is snobbish and gives himself pretentious airs. \n\nThe [[vicar]], Mr Beebe, announces that a local villa has been leased; the new tenants are the Emersons, who, after a chance meeting with Cecil in London, learned about the villa being available. Cecil enticed them to come to the village as a comeuppance to the villa's landlord, Sir Harry Otway, whom Cecil (who believes himself to be very democratic) thinks is a snob. Lucy is angry with Cecil, as she had tentatively arranged for the elderly Misses Alan, guests at the Pensione Bertolini, to rent the villa. \n\nFate takes an ironic turn as Mr Beebe introduces Lucy's brother, Freddy, to the Emersons. Freddy invites George for \"a bathe\" in a nearby pond in the woods. Freddy, George, and Mr Beebe go to there. Freddy and George undress and jump in, eventually convincing Mr. Beebe to join them. They men enjoy themselves, frolicking and splashing in and out of the pond and running through the bushes until Lucy, her mother, and Cecil come upon them, having taken a short-cut through the woods during their walk. \n\nFreddy later invites George to play tennis at Windy Corner. Although Lucy is initially mortified by facing both George and Cecil (who is also visiting), she resolves to be gracious. Cecil annoys everyone by pacing around and reading aloud from a light romance novel that contains a scene suspiciously reminiscent of when George kissed Lucy in Florence. George catches Lucy alone in the garden and kisses her again. Lucy realises that the novel was written by Miss Lavish (the writer-acquaintance from Florence) and that Charlotte must thus have told her about the kiss.\n\nFurious with Charlotte for betraying her secret, Lucy forces her cousin to watch as she orders George to leave Windy Corner and never return. George argues that Cecil only sees Lucy as an \"object for the shelf\" and he will never love her enough to grant her independence, while George loves her for who she is. Lucy is moved but remains firm. Later that evening, after Cecil again rudely declines to play tennis, Lucy sees Cecil for what he truly is and ends their engagement. She decides to flee to Greece with the two Misses Alans. Meanwhile, George, unable to bear being around Lucy, is moving his father back to London, unaware Lucy has broken off her engagement. Shortly before Lucy's departure, she accidentally encounters Mr Emerson at Mr Beebe's house. He is unaware that Lucy is no longer engaged, and Lucy is unable to lie to him. Mr Emerson, with open, honest talk, strips away her defences, forcing Lucy to admit she has been in love with George all along.\n\nThe novel ends in Florence, in melodramatic fashion, where George and Lucy have [[elope]]d without Mrs Honeychurch's consent. However, Lucy has learned that Charlotte knew that Mr. Emerson was at Mr. Beebe's that fateful day, and had not discouraged or prevented her from going in and encountering him. Although Lucy \"had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps forever\", the story ends with the promise of lifelong love for both her and George.\n\n===Appendix===\nIn some editions, an appendix to the novel is given entitled \"A View without a Room\", written by Forster in 1958 as to what occurred between Lucy and George after the events of the novel. It is Forster's afterthought of the novel, and he quite clearly states that, \"I cannot think where George and Lucy live.\" They were quite comfortable up until the end of the [[First World War]], with Charlotte Bartlett leaving them all her money in her will, but the war ruined their happiness according to Forster. George became a [[conscientious objector]] and lost his government job. He was given non-combatant duties to avoid prison. This left Mrs Honeychurch deeply upset with her son-in-law. Mr Emerson died during the war, shortly after having a confrontation with police over Lucy's playing the music of a German composer, [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], on the piano. Eventually the couple had three children, two girls and a boy, and moved to Carshalton from Highgate to find a home. Despite their wanting to move into Windy Corner after Mrs Honeychurch's death, Freddy sold the house to support his family, as he was \"an unsuccessful but prolific doctor\".\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], George immediately enlisted as he saw the need to stop [[Hitler]] and the [[Nazi regime]]. He was unfaithful to Lucy during his time at war. Lucy was left homeless after her flat in Watford was bombed and the same happened to her married daughter in Nuneaton. George rose to the rank of corporal but was taken prisoner by the Italians in Africa. Once the fascist government in Italy fell, George returned to Florence. Finding it \"in a mess\", he was unable to find the Pensione Bertolini, stating, \"the View was still there,\" and that \"the room must be there, too, but could not be found.\" Forster ends by stating that George and Lucy await the Third World War, but with no word on where they live, for even he does not know.\n\nHe adds that Cecil served in \"Information or whatever the withholding of information was then entitled\" during the war, and was able to trick an Alexandria hostess into playing Beethoven's ''Moonlight Sonata'' by claiming he was Belgian, not German.\n\n==Allusions/references to other works==\n* Mr Beebe recalls his first encounter with Lucy was hearing her play the first of the two movements of Beethoven's final piano sonata, [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Opus 111]], at a talent show in Tunbridge Wells.\n* While visiting the Emersons Mr Beebe contemplates the numerous books strewn around.\n:\"I fancy they know how to read \u2013 a rare accomplishment. What have they got? [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]. Exactly. ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]''. Never heard of it. ''[[The Way of All Flesh (novel)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. Never heard of it.
