This is traditionally dated between 1050 BCE and 930 BCE. On the succession of Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]], around 930 BCE, the biblical account reports that the country split into two kingdoms: the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (including the cities of [[Shechem]] and [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]]) in the north and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (containing Jerusalem) in the south.\n\nIn contemporary scholarship the united monarchy is generally held to be a literary construction and not a historical reality, pointing to the lack of archaeological evidence. It is generally accepted that a \"[[Davidic line|House of David]]\" existed, but many believe that David could have only been the monarch or [[chieftain]] of Judah, which was likely small, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development.

In identifying these two sources, two separate accounts can be reconstructed. The anti-monarchical source describes [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] as having thoroughly routed the [[Philistines]], yet begrudgingly accepting the people's demand for a ruler, subsequently appointing Saul by [[cleromancy]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe pro-monarchical source describes the divinely appointed birth of [[Saul]] (a single word being changed by a later editor so that it referred to Samuel instead), and his leading of an army to victory over the [[Ammon (nation)|Ammonites]], resulted in the clamouring of the people for him to lead them against the Philistines, whereupon he is appointed king.<ref name=\"jones2001\">{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Gwilym H.|chapter=1 and 2 Samuel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCRYl9Ikk6EC&pg=PA196|editor-last1=Barton|editor-first1=John|editor-link1=John Barton (theologian)|editor-last2=Muddiman|editor-first2=John|editor-link2=John Muddiman|title=The Oxford Bible Commentary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|pages= 197\u2013199|isbn=978-0-19875-500-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Textual critic]]s also point to disparities in the account of David's rise to power as indicative of separate threads being merged later to create a [[Golden Age]] of a united monarchy. David is thought by scholars to have been a ruler in Judah, while Israel, comparatively immense and highly developed, continued unfettered. [[Modern archaeology]] also supports this view.<ref name=Finkelstein2001/>\n\nMost scholars believe the Books of Samuel exhibit too many [[anachronism]]s to have been a contemporary account. For example, there is mention of later [[armor]] (1 Samuel 17:4\u20137, 38\u201339; 25:13), use of [[camel]]s (1 Samuel 30:17), [[cavalry]] (as distinct from [[chariotry]]) (1 Samuel 13:5, 2 Samuel 1:6), and iron picks and axes (as though they were common) (2 Samuel 12:31). The historicity of the conquest described in the Book of Samuel is not attested, and many scholars regard this conquest as legendary in origin, particularly given the lack of evidence for the battles described involving the destruction of the Canaanite peoples. Most scholars believe that Samuel was compiled in the 8th century BCE (rather than the 10th century when most of the events described take place) based on both historical and legendary sources, primarily serving to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events described in [[Deuteronomy]].

[[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] the first judge to be declared king by the men of [[Shechem]] and the house of Millo (Bet Millo), reigned over Israel for three years before he was killed during the Battle of [[Tubas|Thebez]].\n\nAccording to the biblical account, the united monarchy was formed when there was a large popular expression in favour of introducing a king to rule over the decentralised Israelite confederacy. Increasing pressure from the [[Philistines]] and other neighboring peoples is said by the Bible to have forced the Israelites to unite as state following the [[anointing]] of Saul by Samuel. The Bible treats the notion of kingship as having been [[anathema]], it being viewed as the placing of one man in a position of reverence and power that ought to be reserved for [[God]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1 Samuel 8.6 |url=https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.8.7?lang=en |website=Sefaria |accessdate=17 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Civil war===\nDavid and Saul become bitter enemies, at least from Saul's point of view, although sources describe [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]], Saul's son, and [[Michal]], Saul's daughter and David's first wife, as assisting David to escape Saul, ultimately leading to a brief reconciliation before Saul's death.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAccording to the [[Second Book of Samuel]], Saul's disobedience prompts God to curtail his reign and hand his kingdom over to another dynasty.

In identifying these two sources, two separate accounts can be reconstructed. The anti-monarchical source describes [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] as having thoroughly routed the [[Philistines]], yet begrudgingly accepting the people's demand for a ruler, subsequently appointing Saul by [[cleromancy]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe pro-monarchical source describes the divinely appointed birth of [[Saul]] (a single word being changed by a later editor so that it referred to Samuel instead), and his leading of an army to victory over the [[Ammon (nation)|Ammonites]], resulted in the clamouring of the people for him to lead them against the Philistines, whereupon he is appointed king.<ref name=\"jones2001\">{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Gwilym H.|chapter=1 and 2 Samuel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCRYl9Ikk6EC&pg=PA196|editor-last1=Barton|editor-first1=John|editor-link1=John Barton (theologian)|editor-last2=Muddiman|editor-first2=John|editor-link2=John Muddiman|title=The Oxford Bible Commentary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|pages= 197\u2013199|isbn=978-0-19875-500-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Textual critic]]s also point to disparities in the account of David's rise to power as indicative of separate threads being merged later to create a [[Golden Age]] of a united monarchy. David is thought by scholars to have been a ruler in Judah, while Israel, comparatively immense and highly developed, continued unfettered. [[Modern archaeology]] also supports this view.<ref name=Finkelstein2001/>\n\nMost scholars believe the Books of Samuel exhibit too many [[anachronism]]s to have been a contemporary account. For example, there is mention of later [[armor]] (1 Samuel 17:4\u20137, 38\u201339; 25:13), use of [[camel]]s (1 Samuel 30:17), [[cavalry]] (as distinct from [[chariotry]]) (1 Samuel 13:5, 2 Samuel 1:6), and iron picks and axes (as though they were common) (2 Samuel 12:31). The historicity of the conquest described in the Book of Samuel is not attested, and many scholars regard this conquest as legendary in origin, particularly given the lack of evidence for the battles described involving the destruction of the Canaanite peoples.

Created by prominent game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], Luigi is portrayed as the slightly younger but taller brother of Nintendo's mascot [[Mario]], and appears in many games throughout the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], often as a [[sidekick]] to his older brother.\n\nLuigi first appeared in the 1983 [[Game & Watch]] game ''[[List of LCD games featuring Mario#Mario Bros.|Mario Bros.]]'' as the character controlled by the second player, and retained this role in the ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' arcade game, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', and other titles. The first game where he was available as a primary character was ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]''. In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs such as the ''[[Mario Party]]'' and ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, though he has been featured in a starring role on seven occasions: first in the 1990 LCD wrist watch game ''[[Nelsonic Industries|Luigi's Hammer Toss]]'', in ''[[Mario is Missing]]'', in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for the [[GameCube]] in 2001, in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2013, in ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'' and ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for the [[Wii U]] in 2013, in [[Luigi's Mansion Arcade|''Luigi's Mansion Arcade'']] in 2015 for arcades and [[Luigi's Mansion 3|''Luigi's Mansion 3'']] for [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2019. In all seven of these games, he is called upon to act as the hero because usually Mario, the usual hero within the franchise, is in need of rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three [[DiC]] TV series based on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games.\n\nOriginally developed as a [[palette swap]] of Mario with a green color scheme instead of red, Luigi has since developed a personality and style of his own. As his role in the ''Mario'' series progressed, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, taller and thinner than his brother. Nintendo called the period of March 2013 to March 2014 \"The Year of Luigi\" to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the character's existence. Correspondingly, games released in 2013 emphasised Luigi, such as ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'', and the level pack ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for ''[[New Super Mario Bros U]]''. An unlockable Luigi-themed version of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' titled ''Luigi Bros.'' was also included with ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Luigi emblem.svg|150px|thumb|left|This emblem appears on Luigi's hat and as a symbol for him in many game interfaces.]]\nThe events leading to Luigi's creation began in 1982, during the development of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', where the Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto had created Mario (then known as \"[[Mario#Conception and creation|Jumpman]]\") hoping that he would be able to recast the character in a variety of roles in future games.<ref name=\"hiscore\">Demaria, R: \"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games\", page 238. McGraw Hill-Osbourne, 2002</ref> Miyamoto had been inspired by the game ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'' to create a game with a simultaneous two-player mode, which led to his development of the game ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' in 1983, with Luigi filling the role of Mario's brother as the second playable character.<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\"/> Luigi's name is said to have been inspired by a pizza parlor near Nintendo of America's headquarters in [[Redmond, Washington]], called \"Mario & Luigi's\".<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\">{{cite web|publisher=International Arcade Museum|title=Mario Bros.

The later Japan-only version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' in 1986 (later released in the west as ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'') marked the beginning of Luigi's development toward becoming a more distinguished character. As with his previous appearances, Luigi remained a palette swap of Mario; however, his movement was no longer identical. Luigi could now jump higher and farther than his brother, at the expense of movement response and precision.<ref name=\"LL1up\">Hayward, Andrew. (October 1, 2007) [http://www.1up.com/news/update-sin-punishment-mario-lost VC Update: Sin and Punishment, Mario: Lost Levels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629064034/http://www.1up.com/news/update-sin-punishment-mario-lost |date=June 29, 2011 }}. [[1up.com]]. Retrieved 2008-04-14.</ref>\n\nWhile this version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' was released in Japan, it was deemed to be too difficult for American audiences at the time.<ref name=\"ignhistory\" /> In 1988, consequently, an alternative release was developed to serve as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' for western players (and later released in Japan as ''Super Mario USA''); this version played a key role in shaping Luigi's current appearance.<ref name=\"ignhistory\" /> The game was a conversion of ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]'', with the graphics altered to represent characters and scenes from the ''Mario'' franchise. In this release, the character of \"Mama\", who had the highest jump among the original cast, served as the template for Luigi, resulting in his taller, thinner look, combined with his Marioesque outfit and ubiquitous green color scheme. There were earlier appearances of Luigi being taller than Mario: in the 1988 Famicom Disk System game ''[[Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally]]'' and earlier, in a very rare 1986 anime ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' (though in the anime he wore a yellow shirt and the color of his hat and overalls were blue). Promotional artwork for ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'' depicts Luigi with this new look, but the actual games did not adapt this different character design in-game until the 1992 game ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''. Luigi's distinctive appearance from the ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]''-inspired version of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' has been used ever since, even for remakes of games in which he was originally a palette swap.\n\n===Actor portrayal===\nMuch like his appearance, Luigi's vocal portrayal has fluctuated over the years. In ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', which voiced many characters for the first time, some characters, including Luigi, had two different voices according to the region of the game: North American and European versions feature a low-pitched voice for Luigi, provided by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Wario]], [[Waluigi]], and [[Toadsworth]], whereas the Japanese version uses a high-pitched, [[falsetto]] voice, provided by (then French translator at Nintendo) Julien Bardakoff. All versions of ''[[Mario Party]]'' feature Bardakoff's high-pitched clips from ''Mario Kart 64''. Luigi retained this higher voice in ''[[Mario Party 2]]''. In ''[[Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Party 3]]'', his voice returned to a lower state. Since then, with the exceptions of ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi has consistently had a medium-pitched voice. In ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', Luigi's voice was the same high voice from the Japanese ''Mario Kart 64''. In ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi's voice is made up of clips from Mario's voice taken from ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', with raised pitches. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' and subsequent instalments in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, he has his own voice (which is medium-pitched) instead of a pitched-up version of Mario's.\n\n==Characteristics==\n<!-- Note that any content in this section, as with everywhere on Wikipedia, must be RELIABLY SOURCED.

Luigi always seems nervous and timid but is good-natured and not as quick to anger as his more famous brother. A baby version of the character named Baby Luigi debuted in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', who is held captive by Kamek. He also appeared in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' as a playable character along with Baby Mario. He is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], just like his adult self. Being the younger twin of Mario, Luigi is presumed to be also 24\u201325 years old.<ref>Mendelsohn, Tom (September 30, 2016).

''Super Mario Bros. 2'' introduced Luigi as the taller of the two brothers, as well as the better jumper. ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', and ''Super Mario World'' returned to featuring Luigi as a reskinned Mario. He made a minor appearance in his baby form in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''. Luigi was conspicuously absent in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. However, the [[Super Mario 64 DS|Nintendo DS remake]] of ''Super Mario 64'' features him as a playable character alongside Mario, [[Yoshi]], and [[Wario]]. He received his own starring role in the [[GameCube]] game ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'', where he wins a mansion from a contest he never entered, and saves Mario from [[King Boo]]. ''Luigi's Mansion'' has cultivated such a cult following that [[Nintendo]] made a sequel to the game nearly a decade after the original game's release date.

The DLC is also available as a standalone retail version. Luigi also appeared in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' along with his brother, Peach, Rosalina and Toad.\n\nLuigi appears in many of the ''Mario'' spin-offs, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', and all of the [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports titles]].

While he originally made a cameo appearance in the end credits of ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he appears more prominently in the ''Paper Mario'' series. He is a non-playable character in the original ''[[Paper Mario]]''. In the sequel ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', he appears yet again as a non-playable character, going on a separate adventure from Mario's. ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' features him as a playable character after he is initially brainwashed into working for the antagonist under the name \"Mr. L.\" The ''[[Mario & Luigi]]'' series features Luigi as a main protagonist; the events of the games focus on him and his brother Mario.

In the film, he was voiced by [[Y\u016b Mizushima]] and had a different color scheme than he has today, sporting a blue cap, blue overalls, and a yellow shirt. This was because he was not yet given a consistent color scheme. In the film, Luigi was very greedy and even left Mario at one point to look for coins. He was also a little more serious than his brother Mario, who constantly daydreamed about Princess Peach, although he was not as brave as Mario.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nLuigi later made an appearance in the third of a trilogy of OVAs entitled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'' released in 1989, in which the Mario characters acted out the story of [[Snow White]]. He appears at the end of the video to save Mario and Peach from the Wicked Queen, portrayed by [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]].\n\nLuigi regularly appeared in ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', airing from 1989 to 1990, which cast [[Danny Wells]] as both his live-action portrayal and voice. Like his brother, Luigi's voice actor changed in later cartoons, in his case to [[Tony Rosato]]. Even though he was not the starring character in the show, Luigi appeared in all 91 episodes of the three [[DiC]] Mario cartoons, in one of which his brother himself did not appear (\"Life's Ruff\" from ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'').\n\nLuigi played a different role in the [[Super Mario Bros.

Created by prominent game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], Luigi is portrayed as the slightly younger but taller brother of Nintendo's mascot [[Mario]], and appears in many games throughout the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], often as a [[sidekick]] to his older brother.\n\nLuigi first appeared in the 1983 [[Game & Watch]] game ''[[List of LCD games featuring Mario#Mario Bros.|Mario Bros.]]'' as the character controlled by the second player, and retained this role in the ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' arcade game, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', and other titles. The first game where he was available as a primary character was ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]''. In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs such as the ''[[Mario Party]]'' and ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, though he has been featured in a starring role on seven occasions: first in the 1990 LCD wrist watch game ''[[Nelsonic Industries|Luigi's Hammer Toss]]'', in ''[[Mario is Missing]]'', in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for the [[GameCube]] in 2001, in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2013, in ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'' and ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for the [[Wii U]] in 2013, in [[Luigi's Mansion Arcade|''Luigi's Mansion Arcade'']] in 2015 for arcades and [[Luigi's Mansion 3|''Luigi's Mansion 3'']] for [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2019. In all seven of these games, he is called upon to act as the hero because usually Mario, the usual hero within the franchise, is in need of rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three [[DiC]] TV series based on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games.\n\nOriginally developed as a [[palette swap]] of Mario with a green color scheme instead of red, Luigi has since developed a personality and style of his own. As his role in the ''Mario'' series progressed, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, taller and thinner than his brother. Nintendo called the period of March 2013 to March 2014 \"The Year of Luigi\" to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the character's existence. Correspondingly, games released in 2013 emphasised Luigi, such as ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'', and the level pack ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for ''[[New Super Mario Bros U]]''. An unlockable Luigi-themed version of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' titled ''Luigi Bros.'' was also included with ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Luigi emblem.svg|150px|thumb|left|This emblem appears on Luigi's hat and as a symbol for him in many game interfaces.]]\nThe events leading to Luigi's creation began in 1982, during the development of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', where the Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto had created Mario (then known as \"[[Mario#Conception and creation|Jumpman]]\") hoping that he would be able to recast the character in a variety of roles in future games.<ref name=\"hiscore\">Demaria, R: \"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games\", page 238. McGraw Hill-Osbourne, 2002</ref> Miyamoto had been inspired by the game ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'' to create a game with a simultaneous two-player mode, which led to his development of the game ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' in 1983, with Luigi filling the role of Mario's brother as the second playable character.<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\"/> Luigi's name is said to have been inspired by a pizza parlor near Nintendo of America's headquarters in [[Redmond, Washington]], called \"Mario & Luigi's\".<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\">{{cite web|publisher=International Arcade Museum|title=Mario Bros.

The later Japan-only version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' in 1986 (later released in the west as ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'') marked the beginning of Luigi's development toward becoming a more distinguished character. As with his previous appearances, Luigi remained a palette swap of Mario; however, his movement was no longer identical. Luigi could now jump higher and farther than his brother, at the expense of movement response and precision.<ref name=\"LL1up\">Hayward, Andrew.

[[1up.com]]. Retrieved 2008-04-14.</ref>\n\nWhile this version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' was released in Japan, it was deemed to be too difficult for American audiences at the time.<ref name=\"ignhistory\" /> In 1988, consequently, an alternative release was developed to serve as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' for western players (and later released in Japan as ''Super Mario USA''); this version played a key role in shaping Luigi's current appearance.<ref name=\"ignhistory\" /> The game was a conversion of ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]'', with the graphics altered to represent characters and scenes from the ''Mario'' franchise. In this release, the character of \"Mama\", who had the highest jump among the original cast, served as the template for Luigi, resulting in his taller, thinner look, combined with his Marioesque outfit and ubiquitous green color scheme. There were earlier appearances of Luigi being taller than Mario: in the 1988 Famicom Disk System game ''[[Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally]]'' and earlier, in a very rare 1986 anime ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' (though in the anime he wore a yellow shirt and the color of his hat and overalls were blue). Promotional artwork for ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'' depicts Luigi with this new look, but the actual games did not adapt this different character design in-game until the 1992 game ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''. Luigi's distinctive appearance from the ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]''-inspired version of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' has been used ever since, even for remakes of games in which he was originally a palette swap.\n\n===Actor portrayal===\nMuch like his appearance, Luigi's vocal portrayal has fluctuated over the years. In ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', which voiced many characters for the first time, some characters, including Luigi, had two different voices according to the region of the game: North American and European versions feature a low-pitched voice for Luigi, provided by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Wario]], [[Waluigi]], and [[Toadsworth]], whereas the Japanese version uses a high-pitched, [[falsetto]] voice, provided by (then French translator at Nintendo) Julien Bardakoff. All versions of ''[[Mario Party]]'' feature Bardakoff's high-pitched clips from ''Mario Kart 64''. Luigi retained this higher voice in ''[[Mario Party 2]]''. In ''[[Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Party 3]]'', his voice returned to a lower state. Since then, with the exceptions of ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi has consistently had a medium-pitched voice. In ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', Luigi's voice was the same high voice from the Japanese ''Mario Kart 64''. In ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi's voice is made up of clips from Mario's voice taken from ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', with raised pitches. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' and subsequent instalments in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, he has his own voice (which is medium-pitched) instead of a pitched-up version of Mario's.\n\n==Characteristics==\n<!-- Note that any content in this section, as with everywhere on Wikipedia, must be RELIABLY SOURCED.

Luigi always seems nervous and timid but is good-natured and not as quick to anger as his more famous brother. A baby version of the character named Baby Luigi debuted in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', who is held captive by Kamek. He also appeared in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' as a playable character along with Baby Mario. He is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], just like his adult self.\n\nWhile it has not been made official, [[Princess Daisy|Daisy]] may be Luigi's romantic interest. They were a romantic couple in the [[Super Mario Bros.

Consequently, this indirectly confirms Luigi's full name as Luigi Mario.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://getnews.jp/archives/1144379 |date=September 14, 2015 |language=Japanese |title=\u3010\u885d\u6483\u4e8b\u5b9f\u3011\u3064\u3044\u306b\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u516c\u5f0f\u306e\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u306e\u672c\u540d\u304c\u5224\u660e\uff01\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u306e\u4ee3\u8868\u53d6\u7de0\u5f79\u30fb\u5bae\u672c\u8302\u6c0f\u304c\u660e\u304b\u3059 |trans-title=[Impact] fact finally found real name of Nintendo official of Mario!

''Super Mario Bros. 2'' introduced Luigi as the taller of the two brothers, as well as the better jumper. ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', and ''Super Mario World'' returned to featuring Luigi as a reskinned Mario. He made a minor appearance in his baby form in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''. Luigi was conspicuously absent in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. However, the [[Super Mario 64 DS|Nintendo DS remake]] of ''Super Mario 64'' features him as a playable character alongside Mario, [[Yoshi]], and [[Wario]]. He received his own starring role in the [[GameCube]] game ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'', where he wins a mansion from a contest he never entered, and saves Mario from [[King Boo]]. ''Luigi's Mansion'' has cultivated such a cult following that [[Nintendo]] made a sequel to the game nearly a decade after the original game's release date. The sequel is called ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' and is playable on the [[Nintendo 3DS]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Nintendo World Report |title=Luigi's Mansion 2 to Haunt Nintendo 3DS |date = June 7, 2011 |author=Brown, Andrew |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/26596}}</ref> He reprised his role in the third game, ''[[Luigi's Mansion 3]]'', on [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\nLuigi has been associated with the more difficult second acts of multiple ''Super Mario'' games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/new-super-luigi-u-review|title=New Super Luigi U Review|author=Jeremy Parish|work=[[USGamer]]|date=June 25, 2013|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> These include ''The Lost Levels'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' and the [[new game plus]] in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'', which offer more challenging elaborations on their respective predecessors and allow the player to use Luigi as the main character, in whom reduced friction and higher jumping is consistent in all of these games.

He also appears in ''Super Mario 3D Land'' as a playable character as well as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', the latter having a DLC mode, where he is the main character, called ''New Super Luigi U''. It has levels altered to his specific play abilities, including higher jumping. The DLC is also available as a standalone retail version. Luigi also appeared in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' along with his brother, Peach, Rosalina and Toad.\n\nLuigi appears in many of the ''Mario'' spin-offs, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', and all of the [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports titles]]. He also appears in all five instalments of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series; in the first three instalments, he is an unlockable character.\n\nLuigi has appeared in every [[Mario role-playing games|''Mario'' role-playing game]]. While he originally made a cameo appearance in the end credits of ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he appears more prominently in the ''Paper Mario'' series. He is a non-playable character in the original ''[[Paper Mario]]''. In the sequel ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', he appears yet again as a non-playable character, going on a separate adventure from Mario's. ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' features him as a playable character after he is initially brainwashed into working for the antagonist under the name \"Mr. L.\" The ''[[Mario & Luigi]]'' series features Luigi as a main protagonist; the events of the games focus on him and his brother Mario. He has appeared in all five ''Mario & Luigi'' games.\n\n===Other media===\n{{see also|Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!|Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros. (TV series)}}\n\nLuigi made his animated debut in the 1986 film ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!|Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Save Princess Peach!]]''. In the film, he was voiced by [[Y\u016b Mizushima]] and had a different color scheme than he has today, sporting a blue cap, blue overalls, and a yellow shirt. This was because he was not yet given a consistent color scheme. In the film, Luigi was very greedy and even left Mario at one point to look for coins. He was also a little more serious than his brother Mario, who constantly daydreamed about Princess Peach, although he was not as brave as Mario.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nLuigi later made an appearance in the third of a trilogy of OVAs entitled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'' released in 1989, in which the Mario characters acted out the story of [[Snow White]]. He appears at the end of the video to save Mario and Peach from the Wicked Queen, portrayed by [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]].\n\nLuigi regularly appeared in ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', airing from 1989 to 1990, which cast [[Danny Wells]] as both his live-action portrayal and voice. Like his brother, Luigi's voice actor changed in later cartoons, in his case to [[Tony Rosato]]. Even though he was not the starring character in the show, Luigi appeared in all 91 episodes of the three [[DiC]] Mario cartoons, in one of which his brother himself did not appear (\"Life's Ruff\" from ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'').\n\nLuigi played a different role in the [[Super Mario Bros.

Random lane draw put the two semi-final winners on the outside, Leonard having the misfortune to draw lane 1, Mennea in lane 8.  Wells was just inside of Mennea in 7 while Quarrie drew lane 4. Wells just eked into the final with a fourth place in his semi-final. Had timed qualification been involved, he only had the tenth-fastest time in the semis.\n\nWells, who disliked using [[starting blocks]] but used them, was out fast, making up the stagger on Mennea 40 metres into the race. Coming off the turn Mennea was two metres back, behind both Leonard and Quarrie.  Mennea accelerated down the straight edging closer to Wells with every step.  He caught Wells five metres before the finish and continued past him for the win, regarded as one of the great comebacks in Olympic sprinting.  Quarrie was able to outlean Leonard for the bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://speedendurance.com/2010/04/19/lane-8-200m-revisited-pietro-mennea-1980-olympic-gold-medal/|title=Lane 8 200m Revisited \u2013 Pietro Mennea 1980 Olympic Gold Medal|date=19 April 2010|website=SpeedEndurance.com|access-date=4 June 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1980/07/29/mennea-nips-wells-in-olympic-drama/e50ae96a-45ef-4eed-b21b-8e3eef581d25/</ref>\n\n==Records==\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1980 Summer Olympics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" \n|- \n!

It was initially equal to 6992 troy grains. The pound avoirdupois was divided into 16 ounces. During the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], the avoirdupois pound was redefined as 7,000 troy grains. Since then, the [[Grain (measure)|grain]] has often been an integral part of the avoirdupois system. By 1758, two Elizabethan Exchequer standard weights for the avoirdupois pound existed, and when measured in troy grains they were found to be of 7,002 grains and 6,999 grains.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Skinner | first=F.G. | journal=Bulletin of the British Society for the History of Science | title=The English Yard and Pound Weight | year=1952 | doi=10.1017/S0950563600000646 | volume=1 | pages=184\u20136| issue=7 }}</ref><ref name=\"Standards\">{{cite book|author=United States.

Materials traded in the marketplace are quantified according to accepted units and standards in order to avoid fraud. The standards themselves are legally defined so as to facilitate the resolution of disputes brought to the courts; only legally defined measures will be recognised by the courts. Quantifying devices used by traders (weights, weighing machines, containers of volumes, measures of length) are subject to official inspection, and penalties apply if they are fraudulent.\n\nThe Weights and Measures Act of 1878 marked a major overhaul of the British system of weights and measures, and the definition of the pound given there remained in force until the 1960s. The pound was defined thus (Section 4) \"The ... platinum weight ... deposited in the Standards department of the Board of Trade ... shall continue to be the imperial standard of ... weight ... and the said platinum weight shall continue to be the Imperial Standard for determining the Imperial Standard Pound for the United Kingdom\". Paragraph 13 states that the weight ''in vacuo'' of this standard shall be called the Imperial Standard Pound, and that all other weights mentioned in the act and permissible for commerce shall be ascertained from it alone. The First Schedule of the Act gave more details of the standard pound: it is a platinum cylinder nearly {{convert|1.35|in|mm}} high, and {{convert|1.15|in|mm}} diameter, and the edges are carefully rounded off. It has a groove about {{convert|0.34|in|mm}} from the top, to allow the cylinder to be lifted using an ivory fork. It was constructed following the destruction of the Houses of Parliament by fire in 1834, and is stamped P.S. 1844, 1&nbsp;lb (P.S. stands for \"Parliamentary Standard\"). The pound was redefined in the United Kingdom in 1963 relative to the kilogram.\n\n====Relationship to the kilogram====\nThe 1878 Act said that contracts worded in terms of metric units would be deemed by the courts to be made according to the Imperial units defined in the Act, and a table of metric equivalents was supplied so that the Imperial equivalents could be legally calculated. This defined, in UK law, metric units in terms of Imperial ones. The equivalence for the pound was given as 1&nbsp;lb = {{val|453.59265|u=g}} or 0.45359&nbsp;kg, which made the kilogram equivalent to about {{val|2.2046213|u=lb}}. In 1883, it was determined jointly by the Standards Department of the Board of Trade and the Bureau International that {{val|0.4535924277|u=kg}} was a better approximation, and this figure, rounded to {{val|0.45359243|u=kg}} was given legal status by an [[Order in Council]] in May 1898.<ref name=nbs447>{{cite book | title=Weights and measures standards of the United States&nbsp;\u2013 A brief history | year=1976 | url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/contents.html | first=L.E. | last=Barbrow | author2=Judson, L.V. | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511153143/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/contents.html | archivedate=11 May 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1963, a new [[Weights and Measures Act]] reversed this relationship and the pound was defined for the first time as a mass equal to {{val|0.45359237|u=kg}} to match the definition of the international pound agreed in 1959.\n\n====Troy pound====\n{{main|Troy weight}}\n\nA troy pound is equal to 12 [[troy ounce]]s and to 5,760 [[Grain (unit)|grains]], that is exactly {{val|373.2417216}} grams.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/pubs/upload/AppC-12-hb44-final.pdf| author=United States National Bureau of Standards | title=Appendix C of NIST Handbook 44, Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices, General Tables of Units of Measurement| page=C-14}}</ref><!--Source uses U+002D Hyphen-Minus in page number and it should not be changed to n-dash. --> Troy weights were used in England by jewellers.

It never became a legal standard in England; the use of this pound waxed and waned with the influence of the Hansa itself.\n\nA London pound was equal to 7,200 troy grains (16 troy ounces) or, equivalently, 10,240 tower grains (16 tower ounces).\n\n{|\n|-\n|1 London pound (16&nbsp;oz)\n|= \n|align=right|{{frac|1|1|3}} tower (or troy) pounds\n|= \n|align=right|10,240 tower grains\n|= \n|align=right|7,200 troy grains\n|-\n|1 London ounce (20 dwt)\n|=\n|align=right|1 tower (or troy) ounce\n|=\n|align=right|640 tower grains\n|=\n|align=right|450 troy grains\n|-\n|1 London pennyweight\n|=\n|align=right|1 tower (or troy) pennyweight\n|=\n|align=right|32 tower grains\n|=\n|align=right|{{frac|22|1|2}} troy grains\n|}\n\n===In the United States===\nIn the United States, the avoirdupois pound as a unit of mass has been officially defined in terms of the kilogram since the [[Mendenhall Order|Mendenhall Order of 1893]]. That Order defined the pound to be {{val|2.20462}} pounds to a kilogram. The following year, this relationship was refined as {{val|2.20462234}} pounds to a kilogram, following a determination of the British pound.<ref name=nbs447 />\n\nIn 1959, the United States National Bureau of Standards redefined the pound (avoirdupois) to be exactly equal to 0.453&nbsp;592&nbsp;37&nbsp;kilograms, which had been designated as the International Pound. According to a 1959 [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] publication, the United States 1894 pound differed from the international pound by approximately one part in 10 million.<ref name=NGS>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf|author=United States National Bureau of Standards|title=Notices \"Refinement of values for the yard and the pound\"|date=25 June 1959|accessdate=12 August 2006}}</ref> The difference is so insignificant that it can be ignored for almost all practical purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/h4402_appenc.pdf |author=United States National Bureau of Standards |title=Appendix C of NIST Handbook 44, Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices, General Tables of Units of Measurement |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126000000/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/h4402_appenc.pdf |archivedate=26 November 2006 }} \"In Great Britain, the Yard, the Avoirdupois Pound, the troy pound, and the Apothecaries pound are identical with the units of the same names used in the United States.\" (The introduction to this appendix makes it clear that the appendix is only for convenience and has no normative value: \"In most of the other tables, only a limited number of decimal places are given, therefore making the tables better adopted to the average user.\")</ref>\n\n===Byzantine litra===\n{{main|Byzantine units of measurement#Weight}}\nThe Byzantines used a series of measurements known as pounds ({{lang-la|libra}}, {{lang-el|\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1}}, ''litra''). The most common was the ''logarik\u0113 litra'' (\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, \"pound of account\"), established by [[Constantine the Great]] in 309/310. It formed the basis of the Byzantine [[Byzantine coinage|monetary system]], with one ''litra'' of gold equivalent to 72 ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]''. A hundred ''litrai'' were known as a ''kent\u0113narion'' (\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \"hundredweight\"). Its weight seems to have decreased gradually from the original 324 grams to 319. Due to its association with gold, it was also known as the ''chrysaphik\u0113 litra'' (\u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, \"gold pound\") or ''thalassia litra'' (\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, \"maritime pound\"), but it could also be used as a measure of land, equalling a fortieth of the ''thalassios [[modios]]''.<ref name=\"ODB\">{{cite book | title = Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium'' | chapter = Litra | page = 1238 | last = Schilbach | first = Erich | title-link = Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium | editor-first = Alexander P. | editor-last = Kazhdan | editor-link = Alexander Kazhdan | year = 1991 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-504652-8}}</ref>\n\nThe ''soualia litra'' was specifically used for weighing olive oil or wood, and corresponded to 4/5 of the ''logarik\u0113'', i.e. 256 g. Some outlying regions, especially in later times, adopted various local measures, based on Italian, Arab or Turkish measures. The most important of these was the ''argyrik\u0113 litra'' (\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, \"silver pound\") of 333 g, found in [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Cyprus]], and probably of Arab origin.<ref name=\"ODB\"/>\n\n===French livre===\n{{See also|Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution#Mass|Units of measurement in France}}\n\nSince the Middle Ages, various pounds (''livre'') have been used in France. Since the 19th century, a ''livre'' has referred to the ''[[#Metric pounds|metric pound]]'', 500g.\n\nThe ''livre esterlin'' was equivalent to about {{convert|367.1|g|gr}} and was used between the late 9th century and the mid-14th century.<ref name=\"size.com-Francemass\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/charts/UTBLFrancemass.htm|accessdate=12 August 2006|title=Pre-metric French units of mass livre and smaller|date=16 March 2001|author=Sizes, Inc.}}</ref>\n\nThe ''livre poids de marc'' or ''livre de Paris'' was equivalent to about {{convert|489.5|g|gr}} and was used between the 1350s and the late 18th century.<ref name=\"size.com-Francemass\" /> It was introduced by the government of [[John II of France|John II]].\n\nThe ''livre m\u00e9trique'' was set equal to the kilogram by the decree of ''13 Brumaire an IX'' between 1800 and 1812. This was a form of official metric pound.<ref name=\"size.com-Francemass\" />\n\nThe ''livre [[Mesures usuelles|usuelle]]'' (customary unit) was defined as 500 grams by the decree of 28 March 1812. It was abolished as a unit of mass effective 1 January 1840 by a decree of 4 July 1837,<ref name=\"size.com-Francemass\" /> but is still used informally.\n\n===German and Austrian Pfund===\nOriginally derived from the Roman libra, the definition varied throughout Germany in the Middle Ages and onward. The measures and weights of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] were reformed in 1761 by Empress [[Maria Theresia of Austria]].<ref name=hille>{{cite journal | last=Hille | first=K.C. | title=Medicinal-Gewicht |page=268 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfI3AAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA268 | journal=Magazin f\u00fcr Pharmacie und die dahin einschlagenden Wissenschaften | year=1831 | location=Heidelberg }}</ref> The unusually heavy Habsburg (civil) pound of 16 ounces was later defined in terms of 560.012 grams. [[Bavaria]]n reforms in 1809 and 1811 adopted essentially the same standard pound. In [[Prussia]], a reform in 1816 defined a uniform civil pound in terms of the Prussian foot and distilled water, resulting in a Prussian pound of 467.711 grams.\n\nBetween 1803 and 1815, all German regions west of the [[River Rhine]] were French, organised in the [[Departments of France|departement]]s: [[Roer (department)|Roer]], [[Sarre (department)|Sarre]], [[Rhin-et-Moselle]], and [[Mont-Tonnerre]]. As a result of the Congress of Vienna, these became part of various German states. However, many of these regions retained the metric system and adopted a metric pound of precisely 500 grams. In 1854, the pound of 500 grams also became the official mass standard of the [[Zollverein|German Customs Union]], but local pounds continued to co-exist with the Zollverein pound for some time in some German states. Nowadays, the term ''Pfund'' is sometimes still in use and universally refers to a pound of 500 grams.\n\n===Russian funt===\nThe Russian pound (\u0424\u0443\u043d\u0442, funt) is an [[obsolete Russian unit of measurement]] of mass. It is equal to 409.51718 grams.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cardarelli, F. |year=2004 |title=Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures: Their SI Equivalences and Origins |publisher=Springer |edition=2nd |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediaofs0000card/page/122 122] |isbn=1-85233-682-X |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediaofs0000card |url-access=registration }}</ref> In 1899, the Russian pound was the basic unit of weight, and all other units of weight were formed from it; in partiticular, a [[zolotnik]] was 1/96 of a funt, and a [[pood]] was 40 funts.\n\n===Sk\u00e5lpund===\nThe Sk\u00e5lpund was a Scandinavian measurement that varied in weight between regions. From the 17th century onward, it was equal to 425.076 grams in Sweden but was abandoned in 1889 when Sweden switched to the metric system.\n\nIn Norway, the same name was used for a weight of 498.1 grams. In Denmark, it equalled 471 grams.\n\nIn the 19th century, Denmark followed Germany's lead and redefined the pound as 500 grams.\n\n===Portuguese libra and arr\u00e1tel===\nThe Portuguese unit that corresponds to the pounds of different nations is the ''arratel'', equivalent to 16 ounces of ''Colonha'', a variant of the Cologne standard. This arratel was introduced in 1499 by Manuel I, king of Portugal. Based on an evaluation of bronze nesting weight piles distributed by Manuel I to different towns, the arr\u00e1tel of Manuel I has been estimated to be of 457.8 g. In the early 19th century, the arratel was evaluated at 459 g. <ref>Lu\u00eds Seabra Lopes, \"As Pilhas de Pesos de Dom Manuel I: Contributo para a sua Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o, Inventaria\u00e7\u00e3o e Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o\", ''Portugalia: Nova S\u00e9rie'', vol. 39, Universidade do Porto, 2018, p. 217-251.</ref>\n\nIn the 15th century, the arratel was of 14 ounces of ''Colonha'' or 400.6 g. The Portuguese ''libra'' was the same as 2 arr\u00e1tels. There were also arratels of 12.5 and 13 ounces and libras of 15 and 16 ounces. The Troyes or Tria standard was also used.<ref>Lu\u00eds Seabra Lopes, \"Sistemas Legais de Medidas de Peso e Capacidade, do Condado Portucalense ao S\u00e9culo XVI\", ''Portugalia: Nova S\u00e9rie'', vol. 24, 2003, p. 113-164.</ref>\n\n===Jersey pound===\nA Jersey pound is an obsolete unit of mass used on the island of [[Jersey]] from the 14th century to the 19th century. It was equivalent to about 7,561 grains (490 grams). It may have been derived from the [[#French livre|French livre poids de marc]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sizes.com/units/pound_jersey.htm|title=Jersey pound|author=Sizes, Inc. |accessdate=12 August 2006 |date=28 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Trone pound===\nThe trone pound is one of a number of [[obsolete Scottish units of measurement]]. It was equivalent to between 21 and 28 avoirdupois ounces (about 600-800 grams).\n\n===Metric pounds===\nIn many countries, upon the introduction of a [[metric system]], the pound (or its translation) became an informal term for 500 grams. In [[German language|German]], the term is ''Pfund'', in [[French language|French]] ''livre'', in Dutch ''pond'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''libra'', in [[Italian language|Italian]] ''libbra'', and in [[Danish (language)|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''pund''.\n\nThough not from the same linguistic origin, the Chinese ''j\u012bn'' ({{lang|zh|\u65a4}}, also known as \"[[catty]]\") has a modern definition of exactly 500 grams, divided into 10 ''li\u01ceng'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e24}}). Traditionally about 605 grams, the ''jin'' has been in use for more than two thousand years, serving the same purpose as \"pound\" for the common-use measure of weight.\n\nHundreds of older pounds were replaced in this way. Examples of the older pounds are one of around 459 to 460 grams in Spain, Portugal, and Latin America; one of 498.1 grams in Norway; and several different ones in what is now Germany.\n\nAlthough the use of the pound as an informal term persists in these countries to a varying degree, scales and measuring devices are denominated only in grams and kilograms. A pound of product must be determined by weighing the product in grams as the use of the ''pound'' is not [[European units of measurement directives|sanctioned]] for trade within the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1980L0181:20090527:EN:PDF| author = The Council of the European Communities | title = Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to Unit of measurement and on the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC | date=27 May 2009 | accessdate=14 September 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n==Use in weaponry==<!--NOTE TO EDITORS: This section is externally linked to from [[Carronade]].

It was initially equal to 6992 troy grains. The pound avoirdupois was divided into 16 ounces. During the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], the avoirdupois pound was redefined as 7,000 troy grains. Since then, the [[Grain (measure)|grain]] has often been an integral part of the avoirdupois system. By 1758, two Elizabethan Exchequer standard weights for the avoirdupois pound existed, and when measured in troy grains they were found to be of 7,002 grains and 6,999 grains.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Skinner | first=F.G. | journal=Bulletin of the British Society for the History of Science | title=The English Yard and Pound Weight | year=1952 | doi=10.1017/S0950563600000646 | volume=1 | pages=184\u20136| issue=7 }}</ref><ref name=\"Standards\">{{cite book|author=United States.

Materials traded in the marketplace are quantified according to accepted units and standards in order to avoid fraud. The standards themselves are legally defined so as to facilitate the resolution of disputes brought to the courts; only legally defined measures will be recognised by the courts. Quantifying devices used by traders (weights, weighing machines, containers of volumes, measures of length) are subject to official inspection, and penalties apply if they are fraudulent.\n\nThe Weights and Measures Act of 1878 marked a major overhaul of the British system of weights and measures, and the definition of the pound given there remained in force until the 1960s. The pound was defined thus (Section 4) \"The ... platinum weight ... deposited in the Standards department of the Board of Trade ... shall continue to be the imperial standard of ... weight ... and the said platinum weight shall continue to be the Imperial Standard for determining the Imperial Standard Pound for the United Kingdom\". Paragraph 13 states that the weight ''in vacuo'' of this standard shall be called the Imperial Standard Pound, and that all other weights mentioned in the act and permissible for commerce shall be ascertained from it alone. The First Schedule of the Act gave more details of the standard pound: it is a platinum cylinder nearly {{convert|1.35|in|mm}} high, and {{convert|1.15|in|mm}} diameter, and the edges are carefully rounded off. It has a groove about {{convert|0.34|in|mm}} from the top, to allow the cylinder to be lifted using an ivory fork. It was constructed following the destruction of the Houses of Parliament by fire in 1834, and is stamped P.S. 1844, 1&nbsp;lb (P.S. stands for \"Parliamentary Standard\"). The pound was redefined in the United Kingdom in 1963 relative to the kilogram.\n\n====Relationship to the kilogram====\nThe 1878 Act said that contracts worded in terms of metric units would be deemed by the courts to be made according to the Imperial units defined in the Act, and a table of metric equivalents was supplied so that the Imperial equivalents could be legally calculated. This defined, in UK law, metric units in terms of Imperial ones. The equivalence for the pound was given as 1&nbsp;lb = {{val|453.59265|u=g}} or 0.45359&nbsp;kg, which made the kilogram equivalent to about {{val|2.2046213|u=lb}}. In 1883, it was determined jointly by the Standards Department of the Board of Trade and the Bureau International that {{val|0.4535924277|u=kg}} was a better approximation, and this figure, rounded to {{val|0.45359243|u=kg}} was given legal status by an [[Order in Council]] in May 1898.<ref name=nbs447>{{cite book | title=Weights and measures standards of the United States&nbsp;\u2013 A brief history | year=1976 | url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/contents.html | first=L.E. | last=Barbrow | author2=Judson, L.V. | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511153143/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/contents.html | archivedate=11 May 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1963, a new [[Weights and Measures Act]] reversed this relationship and the pound was defined for the first time as a mass equal to {{val|0.45359237|u=kg}} to match the definition of the international pound agreed in 1959.\n\n====Troy pound====\n{{main|Troy weight}}\n\nA troy pound is equal to 12 [[troy ounce]]s and to 5,760 [[Grain (unit)|grains]], that is exactly {{val|373.2417216}} grams.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/pubs/upload/AppC-12-hb44-final.pdf| author=United States National Bureau of Standards | title=Appendix C of NIST Handbook 44, Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices, General Tables of Units of Measurement| page=C-14}}</ref><!--Source uses U+002D Hyphen-Minus in page number and it should not be changed to n-dash. --> Troy weights were used in England by jewellers.

This arratel was introduced in 1499 by Manuel I, king of Portugal. Based on an evaluation of bronze nesting weight piles distributed by Manuel I to different towns, the arr\u00e1tel of Manuel I has been estimated to be of 457.8 g. In the early 19th century, the arratel was evaluated at 459 g. <ref>Lu\u00eds Seabra Lopes, \"As Pilhas de Pesos de Dom Manuel I: Contributo para a sua Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o, Inventaria\u00e7\u00e3o e Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o\", ''Portugalia: Nova S\u00e9rie'', vol. 39, Universidade do Porto, 2018, p. 217-251.</ref>\n\nIn the 15th century, the arratel was of 14 ounces of ''Colonha'' or 400.6 g. The Portuguese ''libra'' was the same as 2 arr\u00e1tels. There were also arratels of 12.5 and 13 ounces and libras of 15 and 16 ounces. The Troyes or Tria standard was also used.<ref>Lu\u00eds Seabra Lopes, \"Sistemas Legais de Medidas de Peso e Capacidade, do Condado Portucalense ao S\u00e9culo XVI\", ''Portugalia: Nova S\u00e9rie'', vol. 24, 2003, p. 113-164.</ref>\n\n===Jersey pound===\nA Jersey pound is an obsolete unit of mass used on the island of [[Jersey]] from the 14th century to the 19th century. It was equivalent to about 7,561 grains (490 grams). It may have been derived from the [[#French livre|French livre poids de marc]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sizes.com/units/pound_jersey.htm|title=Jersey pound|author=Sizes, Inc. |accessdate=12 August 2006 |date=28 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Trone pound===\nThe trone pound is one of a number of [[obsolete Scottish units of measurement]]. It was equivalent to between 21 and 28 avoirdupois ounces (about 600-800 grams).\n\n===Metric pounds===\nIn many countries, upon the introduction of a [[metric system]], the pound (or its translation) became an informal term for 500 grams. In [[German language|German]], the term is ''Pfund'', in [[French language|French]] ''livre'', in Dutch ''pond'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''libra'', in [[Italian language|Italian]] ''libbra'', and in [[Danish (language)|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''pund''.\n\nThough not from the same linguistic origin, the Chinese ''j\u012bn'' ({{lang|zh|\u65a4}}, also known as \"[[catty]]\") has a modern definition of exactly 500 grams, divided into 10 ''li\u01ceng'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e24}}). Traditionally about 605 grams, the ''jin'' has been in use for more than two thousand years, serving the same purpose as \"pound\" for the common-use measure of weight.\n\nHundreds of older pounds were replaced in this way. Examples of the older pounds are one of around 459 to 460 grams in Spain, Portugal, and Latin America; one of 498.1 grams in Norway; and several different ones in what is now Germany.\n\nAlthough the use of the pound as an informal term persists in these countries to a varying degree, scales and measuring devices are denominated only in grams and kilograms. A pound of product must be determined by weighing the product in grams as the use of the ''pound'' is not [[European units of measurement directives|sanctioned]] for trade within the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1980L0181:20090527:EN:PDF| author = The Council of the European Communities | title = Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to Unit of measurement and on the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC | date=27 May 2009 | accessdate=14 September 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n==Use in weaponry==<!--NOTE TO EDITORS: This section is externally linked to from [[Carronade]].

A cannon that fires a six-pound ball, for example, is called a ''six-pounder''. Standard sizes are 6, 12, 18, 24, 32 and 42 pounds; 68-pounders also exist, and other nonstandard weapons use the same scheme.

He sees that Myne used to be known as Motosu Urano from another land and time. She loved every kind of literature in existence, but she was suddenly crushed to death under a pile of books. As she died, she wished that she would be able to read all kinds of books in her next life. She hears a small voice crying out in pain before awakening in the body of the young girl named Myne who is bedridden due to a fever. Confused about her surroundings, she asks her new mother, Effa, and elder sister, Tuuli, where she can find books to read, but they don't seem to understand. When they leave to prepare dinner, Myne searches the house, but finds out it is only a small wooden cabin with no books in sight, or even any paper, causing her to cry. After a few days, the only convenience Myne can find is by putting a pin in her long hair to keep it up, which surprises Tuuli. When Effa asks Myne to accompany her to the food market, she agrees, believing it to be a way to find books outside her home. Looking around town, she realizes that she lives in the slightly impoverished side of a classic medieval town, as well as that her father, Gunther, is a guard along the town border. When they reach the market, Myne finds a single book enclosed in a locked glass case at a stall. She asks the owner if she can see it, but the man tells her that books are rare and only nobles are allowed to handle them. Undeterred, Myne says that if she cannot buy books anywhere, she will have to make them herself.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Life Improvements and Slates \n| TranslitTitle       = Seikatsu kaizen to Sekiban\n| NativeTitle         = \u751f\u6d3b\u6539\u5584\u3068\u77f3\u677f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|10}}\n| ShortSummary        = Irritated by her ragged and itchy hair, Myne takes a fruit that Tuuli bought at the market and extracts its oil, creating a basic shampoo that cleans her hair, shocking both Effa and Tuuli. The next day, Gunther forgets a package at home, so Myne and Tuuli attempt to make the trek to his stationed gate to bring it to him. Outside their townhouse door, they meet Lutz, Ralph, and Fey, a family trio of boys who also live in the neighborhood. Exhausted from the walk outside, Myne collapses and is given a ride on Ralph's back to the gate, to Lutz's slight disappointment. Along the way, Myne is able to determine Ralph's feelings for Tuuli, as well as Lutz's possible feelings for herself. They reach the gate and deliver the package to Gunther, where the boys then split off to go cut wood in the forest. Gunter introduces Myne and Tuuli to his partner Otto, who suddenly pulls out a scroll made of animal hide. Intrigued, Myne asks her father to buy parchment for her, but is declined when he tells her she cannot read or write, as well its high cost. Otto offers to teach Myne to read and write on a small chalkboard-like slate, to which she then happily agrees, surprising Gunther with slight jealousy. The season begins to cool, halting Myne's progress as she helps her family pack for the town's fall festival. The family travels to the festival location where Myne is forced to sit off to the side due to her frailty. She ponders how writing had advanced through civilizations and comes up with the idea of weaving fiber-like papyrus as a paper substitute, similar to what ancient Egyptians did. Before she can plan this out, she faints when she sees a pig slaughtered up close, causing Gunther to bring her back to the gate to Otto. After she wakes, Otto hands her the slate and writes her name for her in the new language so she can practice. As she practices, he begins to subconsciously write in Japanese and writes down the names of everyone she has met thus far. When Otto returns, he finds Myne passed out from a fever and rushes her home. That night, she encourages herself on her progress with writing before wondering what great idea she had before she suddenly fainted at the festival.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = The Events of Winter\n| TranslitTitle       = Fuyu no Dekigoto\n| NativeTitle         = \u51ac\u306e\u3067\u304d\u3054\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|17}}\n| ShortSummary        = Two months after Myne's consciousness came to the new world, winter struck the town hard and buried it in snow. Since every day is spent indoors, Myne attempts to shave the fibers off of twigs to weave into a pseudo-papyrus paper. After three days of working and weaving, she hardly gets a single corner completed before giving up in frustration at her slow progress. Effa comes up with an idea for Myne to help weave baskets, to which Myne has prior knowledge of how to make from when she was back in Japan. Myne makes her basket with ease and surprises Tuuli and Effa with its efficiency, though Tuuli gets upset since she wants to become an apprentice seamstress and Myne appears to be better than her. Effa offers to teach Tuuli how to weave up to her 7th birthday, which is when the town's children become baptized and choose a profession. Effa tries to ring Myne in as well, but she politely declines in favor of her next goal, which is waiting until spring to make clay tablets similar to those of ancient Mesopotamia. The next morning, Tuuli and Gunther go and pick parues, which are fruit from completely iced-over trees. The fruit can be used as both a drinkable juice and a type of bird feed, but after accidentally tasting the feed and finding it edible, Myne figures out how to turn it into a type of pancake, which her family and the neighbor boys enjoy. That night, Effa and Tuuli begin to question where Myne is getting her ideas from, but Gunther says he prefers this Myne over a sad and sick one. At the same time, Myne's slate pencil wears itself out, so she asks Gunther to take her to the gate to get it replaced, much to his chagrin. He drops Myne off the next day, and Otto gives Myne a new pencil to work with. As Otto begins his work, Myne corrects him on a few calculations, surprising him. He asks her to help out, to which she agrees in exchange for a constant supply of slate pencils. That night, while Tuuli has a dress prepared for her upcoming baptism, Myne decides to create a hair ornament for her to look her best.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = Forests and Clay Tablets \n| TranslitTitle       = Hajimete no Mori to Nendo ban\n| NativeTitle         = \u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u68ee\u3068\u7c98\u571f\u677f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|24}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne decides to cook dinner for the family and, using cooking tactics from Japan, surprises them on how good it is. Gunther and Effa decide on whether to show Myne to a cooking apprentice, but she heartily declines, stating she wants to go to the forest in search of clay. Her family eventually dissuade her, claiming she is not strong enough to go to the forest and that she needs to build up her strength first. Later on, Gunther tells Myne that Otto has asked for her to be his calculations assistant, though it is unofficial since unbaptized children cannot work. She arrives at the gate to see Otto teaching a class of older kids how to write, and while it was awkward to start, the class warms up to Myne and eventually begin learning from her. After the students leave, Otto rewards her by teaching her how to write complete words. While she frequently got sick near the beginning, Myne eventually builds up her stamina enough to go to the forest, but ends up getting sick the day she was supposed to go. Once spring ended, Myne finally was able to go into the forest with Lutz's family and Tuuli. She begins digging for clay, but is caught by Lutz, who after scolding her for not resting, helps her find the right spots to dig. They find a hot spot for clay, allowing Myne to collect and flatten them out into many individual tablets to write on. Myne completes a story Effa tells her when she is sick onto the tablets and leaves them out to dry, but Lutz's brothers crush them, believing them to be cushions. Heartbroken, Myne begins to mysteriously glow as she shouts and berates the boys, before Lutz arrives and calms her down. As she sadly begins digging again, Lutz orders the boys to help her as penance. They are able to recreate the tablets, but they are washed away in the rain the next day. As they build the clay book for a third time, Lutz and Myne exchange their dreams for the future; Lutz to be a traveling merchant and Myne a librarian. They complete the tablets and Myne brings them home to harden in the fireplace, but they instantly shatter, causing Myne to shout in frustration.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Baptisms and Strange Fevers \n| TranslitTitle       = Senreishiki to Fushigina Netsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u6d17\u793c\u5f0f\u3068\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u71b1\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|31}}\n| ShortSummary        = Tuuli's baptism day arrives and her hair ornament is the talk of the neighborhood.

While there, a messenger arrives while Otto is away, but Myne offers to read and deliver the message to Otto, surprising the messenger. That night, as Tuuli tells everyone about her day, Gunther presents with her a sewing kit as a gift. He also gives Myne a knife and tells her that she will now be the house helper instead. However, she comes up with the idea to carve tree bark into wooden planks to write on, similar to that of ancient China. The next day, she goes into the forest with Lutz and begins carving her planks, but to low success. Lutz decides to help, but in exchange for an opportunity to meet Otto in regards to being a traveling merchant. Myne asks Otto about the traveling trade, but Otto states that it isn't a good profession for a city child, although he agrees to talk with Lutz about it. Myne collects all the planks and brings them to her family storage room to dry. She then thinks about what to write with and comes up with the idea to use soot. Mixing soot with clay, Myne creates a basic black pencil to use to write on the planks, but when she arrives home, the planks are gone and Effa is revealed to have used them for firewood. Distraught, Myne begins to mysteriously glow again, but suddenly collapses with a terrible fever. Lutz arrives and cheers Myne up, telling her to keep moving forward. While she stays in bed, Lutz brings her bamboo strips to work on, but Effa burns them as well, believing them to be more kindling for the fire. Myne starts to glow again and contemplates giving up entirely, but the thought of Lutz helping her persuades her to keep trying. As she calms down, her fever does also, begging her to question what sort of sickness her body really has. Once she's healed, Myne meets with Otto and they plan a day for Lutz and Otto to meet.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| Title               = Meeting\n| TranslitTitle       = Kaigo\n| NativeTitle         = \u4f1a\u5408\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|7}}\n| ShortSummary        = Before their meeting with Otto, Myne decides to wash Lutz's hair with her shampoo so he can look his best. Afterwards, she asks why he wants to be a traveling merchant, but he responds with his own questions regarding what she wants to do. She reveals that she's changed her goal from selling books to selling paper, hinting that she wants his help. The meeting day arrives, but Otto shows up with an old partner named Benno, a town merchant and former traveling trader. Benno becomes immediately interested in children's clean hair and Myne's hair pin, but she says the details are a secret. Otto deters Lutz from becoming a traveling merchant on the ground of losing one's citizenship, meaning they cannot reside in any town or have any sort of luxury. Coming to terms with this, Lutz chooses to help Myne make paper and sell it. Myne reveals her idea for making paper from plants and selling them for profit, though Benno questions its authenticity. Myne promises a prototype before her baptism and Benno agrees to sponsor her if it comes true. Myne goes over what tools she needs and asks Lutz to find a suitable tree to use to extract its fibers. Otto offers to give Myne nails to use to build her tools in exchange for the use of her shampoo for his wife. She agrees and meets his wife Corinna, an executive in the Seamstress Guild and Benno's sister, and washes her hair for the nails. Myne and Lutz try to build their tools, but can't get the exact proportions quite right. At the gate, Otto gives Myne and Lutz invitations from Benno to meet with him, when suddenly Otto remembers from their meeting that Benno believes Myne's illness is called the \"Devouring\" and is fatal.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| Title               = Seeds of Suspicion\n| TranslitTitle       = Fushin-kan no Mebae\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e0d\u4fe1\u611f\u306e\u82bd\u751f\u3048\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|14}}\n| ShortSummary        = Lutz and Myne make their way through the wealthy side of town to Benno's office, amazed by the grandeur around them. They arrive at his building and have lunch with him, where he scolds them for going to Otto for nails and advice instead of himself. After Myne apologizes, Benno offers to create all the tools necessary to create the paper for the duo, but in exchange for the rights to Myne's shampoo. Myne agrees, but she also wants Lutz and herself to have all the rights to the paper once it becomes a profitable product, to which Benno agrees. They write out the order forms and sign a binding magical contract with Benno. On their way home, Lutz starts to become suspicious of who Myne is given the detailed discussion she had with Benno and how Lutz didn't understand any of it. Myne becomes increasingly anxious about giving herself away to those around her, and decides that if she's going to let the fever take her, it'll be after the completes her paper. She meets with Mark, Benno's assistant, to discuss a possible workshop stationed near the forest gate, but suddenly collapses. She awakens in Benno's home where he orders her to be accompanied by Lutz at all times when going out for work. After she heads home, Benno explains to Otto that the Devouring is manifested in commoner children who develop mana and rarely survive to their baptism. The next day, Myne and Lutz arrive at Benno's office where he says they have a workshop ready for them, but she is to do none of the heavy lifting.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| Title               = Lutz's Myne\n| TranslitTitle       = Ruttsu no Main\n| NativeTitle         = \u30eb\u30c3\u30c4\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|21}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne and Lutz arrive at their new workshop, and as they begin to put things in order, Myne is relieved to see Lutz acting normal towards her. Their first task is to create a bamboo strainer, but are not skilled enough to build it themselves. They delegate tasks between a lumberer to build tools and a craftsman to make the strainer, but after negotiating with them, Lutz again becomes suspicious of Myne's identity. Once their tools are ready, the pair venture out into the woods to extract tree fibers. While Lutz cuts down trees, Myne is suddenly attacked by a carnivorous weed known as a trombe, which will constantly grow and sprout even after it is cut down. Lutz calls his brothers and they eventually chop the trombe to pieces. Realizing its potential, Myne uses the scattered trombe twigs as her base and easily peels the fibers off. After planning the next steps, Lutz tells Myne that they need to talk after the paper is completed, causing her to worry. During each step of making the paper, Lutz becomes increasingly suspicious of Myne given how she seems to know what she is doing with no previous experience. After a few days of working, they finish the paper and Myne agrees to talk. She reveals she is not the Myne he once knew, and when he asks for her to return the original Myne, she says that if she does, all that will remain is a corpse. Myne adds that while she herself is not the cause of the fever, the fever itself led to the original's demise and that it is eating away at her as well. When Lutz starts to blame the new identity, Myne retorts claiming that she never wanted this and was given this fate when she died in her own world. She lets him decide whether or not to let her be taken by the fever since he was the one who saved her after her mother kept burning her ideas. Conflicted, Lutz asks how long she has been Myne, but figures out it was when she added the pin to her hair, nearly a year prior. He ultimately allows the new Myne to stay and chooses to let her family decide her fate since the current Myne is the one he mostly remembers at this point. They bring their paper prototypes to Benno, who after testing them, gives them a passing grade and allows them to be his apprentices.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| Title               = The Guild Master's Granddaughter \n| TranslitTitle       = Girudo-ch\u014d no Magomusume\n| NativeTitle         = \u30ae\u30eb\u30c9\u9577\u306e\u5b6b\u5a18\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|28}}\n| ShortSummary        = Benno and Mark teaches Myne and Lutz how the currency works in the world from small bronze coins to silver coins up to large gold coins before giving the pair their share for creating the paper. Myne asks how much her hair ornaments could be worth to sell commercially, deciding it to be their winter merchandise. Benno brings them to the Merchant Guild to meet the head executive Gustav, who he has a rivalry with. While they wait to be seen, Myne learns the layout of the town and the surrounding land to become more acquainted for the future. They meet with Gustav, who is initially against the unbaptized children becoming apprentices until they present him with the hair ornament. He relents and allows them to be registered in exchange for the ornament for his granddaughter's upcoming baptism. After deciding a price, Gustav attempts to ring in Myne to work for him instead of Benno, but she declines. After learning how much money Benno weaseled out of Gustav, Myne learns from him to always be searching for ways to increase your income. Lutz and Myne arrange to meet with Gustav's granddaughter Freida to present her with the ornament, to which she has wanted ever since she saw Tuuli wear one the previous year. Since Freida has pigtails for her hair, Myne offers to sell her two ornaments; one at full price and the second one at half price. Freida accepts, but believes Myne is missing out on profit, similar to what Benno told her earlier. Just like her grandfather, Freida attempts to ring in Myne to her family business, but Myne again declines. They present Freida with her ornaments and prepare to leave in case of Myne's sickness, but Freida asks if she has the Devouring. She explains that it is a fever-like illness that eats the host from the inside, and when Myne asks how she knows, Freida says she has it as well. When Myne asks how to cure it, Freida says it cannot be cured, but can only be contained with either expensive medicine or if the host has clear motivation and not become depressed. Myne thanks her for her advice and the pair prepares to leave.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| Title               = To the Second Winter\n| TranslitTitle       = Futatabime no Fuyu ni Mukete\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e8c\u5ea6\u76ee\u306e\u51ac\u306b\u5411\u3051\u3066\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|5}}\n| ShortSummary        = Hitting the one year mark since her arrival, Myne is bedridden while her family prepares for the fall festival again. As she lies in bed, she suddenly begins to feel the Devouring bubbling inside her, but quickly forces it down. Her family and Lutz return home with food from the festival and are glad to see her health returning. Myne and Lutz go over the training process for apprentices, which include etiquette, literacy, and the ability to perform calculations. The pair ask Benno how to look proper, who tells them to completely overhaul their wardrobe using the money they have accumulated so far. Benno then asks Myne for help with the shampoo-making process since production is not going well. She figures out the issue and when asked what to do with the unused oil they have made thus far, Myne says she will sell them as a different product for a jokingly high price, to which Benno shockingly accepts. When asked why, he tells her it is for her Devouring medication and that she should potentially be ready to sell everything she owns for it. Myne tells Benno everything he needs to know for the shampoo, causing him to ask her who she is and how she knows it all, but she refuses to say. The following day, Myne goes to the gate to practice writing words with Otto, but when he is called to deal with a trombe threat, the Devouring attempts to return again, forcing her to push it down. Later, as she and Lutz prepare the workshop for winter and set up bark hides to dry, but the Devouring appears a third time, forcing Myne to suppress it, worrying Lutz in the process. She explains it appears frequently nowadays, even when she is not disheartened, but the only real remedy is the expensive medicine. They return to Benno's office where Lutz begs him to save Myne since he himself cannot do anything for her. Benno retorts saying that he can help her by manning up and not giving her anything to worry about. Lutz asks Myne if she wants to sell any more of her homemade products, to which she agrees and brings Otto her weaving basket. They discuss other consumable products, when suddenly Myne begins to glow and collapses as the Devouring explodes inside her.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 11\n| Title               = Life-or-Death Choices and Family Meetings \n| TranslitTitle       = Ky\u016bkyoku no Sentaku to Kazoku Kaigi\n| NativeTitle         = \u7a76\u6975\u306e\u9078\u629e\u3068\u5bb6\u65cf\u4f1a\u8b70\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne awakens in Freida's bed and notices a shattered bracelet on her wrist. Freida walks in and tells her how the bracelet was a magical item that absorbs the Devouring fever, but that her illness will soon return within a year. When Myne asks where she can get more, Freida reveals that her family bought every faulty one in town and that the real bracelets are carried by nobles. Freida gives her an ultimatum: make a contract with the nobles and live but leave her family behind, or stay with her family and die. She also reveals that she has a contract to be a future concubine to a noble and is at peace with the decision. Myne thanks Gustav for saving her, but he tells her that the item she used is worth a large amount of money, which she agrees to pay thanks to her deals with Benno, surprising Gustav since he believed she could not and would be forced to work for him instead. Myne spends the rest of the day cooking sweets and playing with Freida before leaving with her family the following morning, who believe Myne is completely cured. She and Lutz arrive at Benno's office where he scolds her for cooking with sugar while she was with Freida since it is actually a rare commodity. Myne notices how busy Benno's shop is during the winter months and ponders making classic Japanese games to sell over the next year. That night at home, she presents her baptismal outfit to Gunther before telling her family the truth about the Devouring and her time limit. After discussing the option of moving in among the nobles with her family, she decides to stay with her family with the time she has left.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12\n| Title               = Baptism and Divine Paradises\n| TranslitTitle       = Senrei shiki to Kami no Rakuen\n| NativeTitle         = \u6d17\u793c\u5f0f\u3068\u795e\u306e\u697d\u5712\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = As the seasons begin to warm, Myne arranges to end her apprenticeship with Benno and sells the rights of the paper-making process to him.

Myne then meets with Freida, who is surprised and saddened by Myne's decision to stay with her family and die. Since she wants to accumulate enough money for her family to be happy before she goes, Myne agrees to sell all her recipes for cooking with sugar to Freida, who tearfully accepts. Soon after, Myne's baptismal day arrives, so she meets Lutz and parades down the main street with the other town's children toward the city temple. There, the children register for citizenship and learn about the religious history of their world. Afterwards, the clergy and children offer a prayer to the world's gods and goddesses, but the humorous poses required cause Myne to laugh hysterically, resulting in her being taken away under the guise of being ill. She awakens in an unknown room and proceeds to wander around the halls before stumbling across the temple library, but is unable to enter since only clergy are allowed. Myne meets with the High Bishop, who says that admission to work at the temple comes with a sizable donation. Myne offers one large gold coin, the highest currency, shocking him. He follows up by requiring her parent's approval, but agrees that even if they say no, she is welcome to come by and read anytime she wants.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 13\n| Title               = The Choice to be an Apprentice Priestess\n| TranslitTitle       = Miko Minarai to iu Sentakushi\n| NativeTitle         = \u5deb\u5973\u898b\u7fd2\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u9078\u629e\u80a2\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|26}}\n| ShortSummary        = Lutz scolds Myne as she rests in a temple bed for collapsing from excitement after finding out she can become a temple librarian. When she arrives home and tells her family about her plan, however, Gunther angrily refuses to allow her to go and convinces her that priestesses are for orphans that must stay at the church. As Myne comes to terms with this, the Devouring begins to bubble up inside her due to her inner turmoil of choosing between books and family. A few days later, Myne returns to the temple to turn down the offer and meets Ferdinand, the High Priest. Together, they read the religious scripture until the High Bishop arrives, who is puzzled by Myne's decision to refuse his offer. When she reveals she has the Devouring, the High Bishop frantically brings out a large golden grail. When Myne touches the goblet, it suddenly glows red, and the religious pair ask to meet with Myne's parents at a later date. Myne and Lutz then go to Benno, who demands Myne explain to him everything that happened at the temple. After she does, Benno reveals that she is strongly targeted by the church because they are short on mana due to a governmental conflict, and wish to use her Devouring as a sort of refuel in exchange for her desire of books. He also reveals that this will save her life, and recommends binding a magical contract with Lutz and Benno so she will be able to have contact with them while with the church. Myne registers at the guild to create a constant supply of income for her and Benno's profits, but on their way home, Lutz tearfully laments not being able to make books with Myne anymore. Myne apologizes, but retorts that he will always be her first choice if she ever has a problem and claims to still desire to make her own books with his help.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14\n| Title               = Conclusions\n| TranslitTitle       = Ketchaku\n| NativeTitle         = \u6c7a\u7740\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|26}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne tells her parents about the meeting with the temple clergy regarding her apprenticeship, and also reveals how she would live as a noble in exchange for her Devouring to fuel the church's mana supply. She recalls to them how Benno advised to use any means necessary to improve her life and fight for her dreams, including the option to abuse her illness in order to be treated as a noble. Gunther agrees, but Tuuli and Effa are fearful of the potential consequences of negotiating with the temple nobility. Myne and her parents arrive at the church and meet with Ferdinand and the High Bishop, but when he realizes they aren't wealthy, the High Bishop's attitude suddenly becomes condescending and arrogant. After refusing to give Myne to the church without having their demands met, Myne's parents are attacked by the temple's guards and Myne is to be taken by force. As Gunther is about to be overwhelmed, Myne begins to glow and attacks the High Bishop with a semi-psychic power. She knocks him unconscious, but as she goes in for the kill, Ferdinand stands in her way and calms her down. Ferdinand apologizes for not stopping the High Bishop's aggression and brings the family to his room for discussions. There, he explains that Myne's sudden explosion of power is called the \"Crushing\" and occurs when the host of the Devouring lets their emotions overwhelm them. When asked why she isn't already dead, Myne says she used a broken magical item to stay alive, but refused to form a contract with a noble since it would deprive her of her way of life. Moved by her words, Ferdinand agrees to the family's conditions and allows Myne to become a member of the church with full benefits.

On the way home, Myne hears about a strange man looking for her and is told to be cautious. That night, Gunther meets with Otto to discuss their future, only for Otto to reveal he's been offered a position by Benno to help support his newborn child. The next day, Benno reveals that someone broke into the Merchant Guild, and the suspect is most likely a spy from the temple who's looking for Myne. He also finds out that Freida bought Myne's recipe for cooking with sugar, much to his chagrin due to a lack of supplies and accessibility, but plans to make her a future offer. At the temple, Ferdinand reports his spy's findings to the High Bishop, promoting her potential high value, but the High Bishop counters with plans to abuse Myne for her mana. The day of Myne's inauguration arrives, but as she walks the halls of the temple, she hears derogatory commoner remarks aimed in her direction. She meets with Ferdinand, recites the prayer to be an apprentice, and is handed her blue robes, the sign of clergy coming from a noble family. She then meets her three attendants, called \"retainers\". She meets a quiet young man named Fran, a conceited young girl named Delia, and a pompous young boy named Gil, all who wear gray-robed uniforms, indicating the lowest level member of the temple.

He sees that Myne used to be known as Motosu Urano from another land and time. She loved every kind of literature in existence, but she was suddenly crushed to death under a pile of books. As she died, she wished that she would be able to read all kinds of books in her next life. She hears a small voice crying out in pain before awakening in the body of the young girl named Myne who is bedridden due to a fever. Confused about her surroundings, she asks her new mother, Effa, and elder sister, Tuuli, where she can find books to read, but they don't seem to understand. When they leave to prepare dinner, Myne searches the house, but finds out it is only a small wooden cabin with no books in sight, or even any paper, causing her to cry. After a few days, the only convenience Myne can find is by putting a pin in her long hair to keep it up, which surprises Tuuli. When Effa asks Myne to accompany her to the food market, she agrees, believing it to be a way to find books outside her home. Looking around town, she realizes that she lives in the slightly impoverished side of a classic medieval town, as well as that her father, Gunther, is a guard along the town border. When they reach the market, Myne finds a single book enclosed in a locked glass case at a stall. She asks the owner if she can see it, but the man tells her that books are rare and only nobles are allowed to handle them. Undeterred, Myne says that if she cannot buy books anywhere, she will have to make them herself.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Life Improvements and Slates \n| TranslitTitle       = Seikatsu kaizen to Sekiban\n| NativeTitle         = \u751f\u6d3b\u6539\u5584\u3068\u77f3\u677f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|10}}\n| ShortSummary        = Irritated by her ragged and itchy hair, Myne takes a fruit that Tuuli bought at the market and extracts its oil, creating a basic shampoo that cleans her hair, shocking both Effa and Tuuli. The next day, Gunther forgets a package at home, so Myne and Tuuli attempt to make the trek to his stationed gate to bring it to him. Outside their townhouse door, they meet Lutz, Ralph, and Fey, a family trio of boys who also live in the neighborhood. Exhausted from the walk outside, Myne collapses and is given a ride on Ralph's back to the gate, to Lutz's slight disappointment. Along the way, Myne is able to determine Ralph's feelings for Tuuli, as well as Lutz's possible feelings for herself. They reach the gate and deliver the package to Gunther, where the boys then split off to go cut wood in the forest. Gunter introduces Myne and Tuuli to his partner Otto, who suddenly pulls out a scroll made of animal hide. Intrigued, Myne asks her father to buy parchment for her, but is declined when he tells her she cannot read or write, as well its high cost. Otto offers to teach Myne to read and write on a small chalkboard-like slate, to which she then happily agrees, surprising Gunther with slight jealousy. The season begins to cool, halting Myne's progress as she helps her family pack for the town's fall festival. The family travels to the festival location where Myne is forced to sit off to the side due to her frailty. She ponders how writing had advanced through civilizations and comes up with the idea of weaving fiber-like papyrus as a paper substitute, similar to what ancient Egyptians did. Before she can plan this out, she faints when she sees a pig slaughtered up close, causing Gunther to bring her back to the gate to Otto. After she wakes, Otto hands her the slate and writes her name for her in the new language so she can practice. As she practices, he begins to subconsciously write in Japanese and writes down the names of everyone she has met thus far. When Otto returns, he finds Myne passed out from a fever and rushes her home. That night, she encourages herself on her progress with writing before wondering what great idea she had before she suddenly fainted at the festival.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = The Events of Winter\n| TranslitTitle       = Fuyu no Dekigoto\n| NativeTitle         = \u51ac\u306e\u3067\u304d\u3054\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|17}}\n| ShortSummary        = Two months after Myne's consciousness came to the new world, winter struck the town hard and buried it in snow. Since every day is spent indoors, Myne attempts to shave the fibers off of twigs to weave into a pseudo-papyrus paper. After three days of working and weaving, she hardly gets a single corner completed before giving up in frustration at her slow progress. Effa comes up with an idea for Myne to help weave baskets, to which Myne has prior knowledge of how to make from when she was back in Japan. Myne makes her basket with ease and surprises Tuuli and Effa with its efficiency, though Tuuli gets upset since she wants to become an apprentice seamstress and Myne appears to be better than her. Effa offers to teach Tuuli how to weave up to her 7th birthday, which is when the town's children become baptized and choose a profession. Effa tries to ring Myne in as well, but she politely declines in favor of her next goal, which is waiting until spring to make clay tablets similar to those of ancient Mesopotamia. The next morning, Tuuli and Gunther go and pick parues, which are fruit from completely iced-over trees. The fruit can be used as both a drinkable juice and a type of bird feed, but after accidentally tasting the feed and finding it edible, Myne figures out how to turn it into a type of pancake, which her family and the neighbor boys enjoy. That night, Effa and Tuuli begin to question where Myne is getting her ideas from, but Gunther says he prefers this Myne over a sad and sick one. At the same time, Myne's slate pencil wears itself out, so she asks Gunther to take her to the gate to get it replaced, much to his chagrin. He drops Myne off the next day, and Otto gives Myne a new pencil to work with. As Otto begins his work, Myne corrects him on a few calculations, surprising him. He asks her to help out, to which she agrees in exchange for a constant supply of slate pencils. That night, while Tuuli has a dress prepared for her upcoming baptism, Myne decides to create a hair ornament for her to look her best.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = Forests and Clay Tablets \n| TranslitTitle       = Hajimete no Mori to Nendo ban\n| NativeTitle         = \u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u68ee\u3068\u7c98\u571f\u677f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|24}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne decides to cook dinner for the family and, using cooking tactics from Japan, surprises them on how good it is. Gunther and Effa decide on whether to show Myne to a cooking apprentice, but she heartily declines, stating she wants to go to the forest in search of clay. Her family eventually dissuade her, claiming she is not strong enough to go to the forest and that she needs to build up her strength first. Later on, Gunther tells Myne that Otto has asked for her to be his calculations assistant, though it is unofficial since unbaptized children cannot work. She arrives at the gate to see Otto teaching a class of older kids how to write, and while it was awkward to start, the class warms up to Myne and eventually begin learning from her. After the students leave, Otto rewards her by teaching her how to write complete words. While she frequently got sick near the beginning, Myne eventually builds up her stamina enough to go to the forest, but ends up getting sick the day she was supposed to go. Once spring ended, Myne finally was able to go into the forest with Lutz's family and Tuuli. She begins digging for clay, but is caught by Lutz, who after scolding her for not resting, helps her find the right spots to dig. They find a hot spot for clay, allowing Myne to collect and flatten them out into many individual tablets to write on. Myne completes a story Effa tells her when she is sick onto the tablets and leaves them out to dry, but Lutz's brothers crush them, believing them to be cushions. Heartbroken, Myne begins to mysteriously glow as she shouts and berates the boys, before Lutz arrives and calms her down. As she sadly begins digging again, Lutz orders the boys to help her as penance. They are able to recreate the tablets, but they are washed away in the rain the next day. As they build the clay book for a third time, Lutz and Myne exchange their dreams for the future; Lutz to be a traveling merchant and Myne a librarian. They complete the tablets and Myne brings them home to harden in the fireplace, but they instantly shatter, causing Myne to shout in frustration.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Baptisms and Strange Fevers \n| TranslitTitle       = Senreishiki to Fushigina Netsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u6d17\u793c\u5f0f\u3068\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u71b1\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|10|31}}\n| ShortSummary        = Tuuli's baptism day arrives and her hair ornament is the talk of the neighborhood. Though he wants to stay and watch the parade, Gunther is forced to work, so he brings Myne with him to the gate. While there, a messenger arrives while Otto is away, but Myne offers to read and deliver the message to Otto, surprising the messenger. That night, as Tuuli tells everyone about her day, Gunther presents with her a sewing kit as a gift. He also gives Myne a knife and tells her that she will now be the house helper instead. However, she comes up with the idea to carve tree bark into wooden planks to write on, similar to that of ancient China. The next day, she goes into the forest with Lutz and begins carving her planks, but to low success. Lutz decides to help, but in exchange for an opportunity to meet Otto in regards to being a traveling merchant. Myne asks Otto about the traveling trade, but Otto states that it isn't a good profession for a city child, although he agrees to talk with Lutz about it. Myne collects all the planks and brings them to her family storage room to dry. She then thinks about what to write with and comes up with the idea to use soot. Mixing soot with clay, Myne creates a basic black pencil to use to write on the planks, but when she arrives home, the planks are gone and Effa is revealed to have used them for firewood. Distraught, Myne begins to mysteriously glow again, but suddenly collapses with a terrible fever. Lutz arrives and cheers Myne up, telling her to keep moving forward. While she stays in bed, Lutz brings her bamboo strips to work on, but Effa burns them as well, believing them to be more kindling for the fire. Myne starts to glow again and contemplates giving up entirely, but the thought of Lutz helping her persuades her to keep trying. As she calms down, her fever does also, begging her to question what sort of sickness her body really has. Once she's healed, Myne meets with Otto and they plan a day for Lutz and Otto to meet.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| Title               = Meeting\n| TranslitTitle       = Kaigo\n| NativeTitle         = \u4f1a\u5408\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|7}}\n| ShortSummary        = Before their meeting with Otto, Myne decides to wash Lutz's hair with her shampoo so he can look his best. Afterwards, she asks why he wants to be a traveling merchant, but he responds with his own questions regarding what she wants to do. She reveals that she's changed her goal from selling books to selling paper, hinting that she wants his help. The meeting day arrives, but Otto shows up with an old partner named Benno, a town merchant and former traveling trader. Benno becomes immediately interested in children's clean hair and Myne's hair pin, but she says the details are a secret. Otto deters Lutz from becoming a traveling merchant on the ground of losing one's citizenship, meaning they cannot reside in any town or have any sort of luxury. Coming to terms with this, Lutz chooses to help Myne make paper and sell it. Myne reveals her idea for making paper from plants and selling them for profit, though Benno questions its authenticity. Myne promises a prototype before her baptism and Benno agrees to sponsor her if it comes true. Myne goes over what tools she needs and asks Lutz to find a suitable tree to use to extract its fibers. Otto offers to give Myne nails to use to build her tools in exchange for the use of her shampoo for his wife. She agrees and meets his wife Corinna, an executive in the Seamstress Guild and Benno's sister, and washes her hair for the nails. Myne and Lutz try to build their tools, but can't get the exact proportions quite right. At the gate, Otto gives Myne and Lutz invitations from Benno to meet with him, when suddenly Otto remembers from their meeting that Benno believes Myne's illness is called the \"Devouring\" and is fatal.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| Title               = Seeds of Suspicion\n| TranslitTitle       = Fushin-kan no Mebae\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e0d\u4fe1\u611f\u306e\u82bd\u751f\u3048\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|14}}\n| ShortSummary        = Lutz and Myne make their way through the wealthy side of town to Benno's office, amazed by the grandeur around them. They arrive at his building and have lunch with him, where he scolds them for going to Otto for nails and advice instead of himself. After Myne apologizes, Benno offers to create all the tools necessary to create the paper for the duo, but in exchange for the rights to Myne's shampoo. Myne agrees, but she also wants Lutz and herself to have all the rights to the paper once it becomes a profitable product, to which Benno agrees. They write out the order forms and sign a binding magical contract with Benno. On their way home, Lutz starts to become suspicious of who Myne is given the detailed discussion she had with Benno and how Lutz didn't understand any of it. Myne becomes increasingly anxious about giving herself away to those around her, and decides that if she's going to let the fever take her, it'll be after the completes her paper. She meets with Mark, Benno's assistant, to discuss a possible workshop stationed near the forest gate, but suddenly collapses. She awakens in Benno's home where he orders her to be accompanied by Lutz at all times when going out for work. After she heads home, Benno explains to Otto that the Devouring is manifested in commoner children who develop mana and rarely survive to their baptism. The next day, Myne and Lutz arrive at Benno's office where he says they have a workshop ready for them, but she is to do none of the heavy lifting.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| Title               = Lutz's Myne\n| TranslitTitle       = Ruttsu no Main\n| NativeTitle         = \u30eb\u30c3\u30c4\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|21}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne and Lutz arrive at their new workshop, and as they begin to put things in order, Myne is relieved to see Lutz acting normal towards her. Their first task is to create a bamboo strainer, but are not skilled enough to build it themselves. They delegate tasks between a lumberer to build tools and a craftsman to make the strainer, but after negotiating with them, Lutz again becomes suspicious of Myne's identity. Once their tools are ready, the pair venture out into the woods to extract tree fibers. While Lutz cuts down trees, Myne is suddenly attacked by a carnivorous weed known as a trombe, which will constantly grow and sprout even after it is cut down. Lutz calls his brothers and they eventually chop the trombe to pieces. Realizing its potential, Myne uses the scattered trombe twigs as her base and easily peels the fibers off. After planning the next steps, Lutz tells Myne that they need to talk after the paper is completed, causing her to worry. During each step of making the paper, Lutz becomes increasingly suspicious of Myne given how she seems to know what she is doing with no previous experience. After a few days of working, they finish the paper and Myne agrees to talk. She reveals she is not the Myne he once knew, and when he asks for her to return the original Myne, she says that if she does, all that will remain is a corpse. Myne adds that while she herself is not the cause of the fever, the fever itself led to the original's demise and that it is eating away at her as well. When Lutz starts to blame the new identity, Myne retorts claiming that she never wanted this and was given this fate when she died in her own world. She lets him decide whether or not to let her be taken by the fever since he was the one who saved her after her mother kept burning her ideas. Conflicted, Lutz asks how long she has been Myne, but figures out it was when she added the pin to her hair, nearly a year prior. He ultimately allows the new Myne to stay and chooses to let her family decide her fate since the current Myne is the one he mostly remembers at this point. They bring their paper prototypes to Benno, who after testing them, gives them a passing grade and allows them to be his apprentices.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| Title               = The Guild Master's Granddaughter \n| TranslitTitle       = Girudo-ch\u014d no Magomusume\n| NativeTitle         = \u30ae\u30eb\u30c9\u9577\u306e\u5b6b\u5a18\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|28}}\n| ShortSummary        = Benno and Mark teaches Myne and Lutz how the currency works in the world from small bronze coins to silver coins up to large gold coins before giving the pair their share for creating the paper.

Benno brings them to the Merchant Guild to meet the head executive Gustav, who he has a rivalry with. While they wait to be seen, Myne learns the layout of the town and the surrounding land to become more acquainted for the future. They meet with Gustav, who is initially against the unbaptized children becoming apprentices until they present him with the hair ornament. He relents and allows them to be registered in exchange for the ornament for his granddaughter's upcoming baptism. After deciding a price, Gustav attempts to ring in Myne to work for him instead of Benno, but she declines. After learning how much money Benno weaseled out of Gustav, Myne learns from him to always be searching for ways to increase your income. Lutz and Myne arrange to meet with Gustav's granddaughter Freida to present her with the ornament, to which she has wanted ever since she saw Tuuli wear one the previous year. Since Freida has pigtails for her hair, Myne offers to sell her two ornaments; one at full price and the second one at half price. Freida accepts, but believes Myne is missing out on profit, similar to what Benno told her earlier. Just like her grandfather, Freida attempts to ring in Myne to her family business, but Myne again declines. They present Freida with her ornaments and prepare to leave in case of Myne's sickness, but Freida asks if she has the Devouring. She explains that it is a fever-like illness that eats the host from the inside, and when Myne asks how she knows, Freida says she has it as well. When Myne asks how to cure it, Freida says it cannot be cured, but can only be contained with either expensive medicine or if the host has clear motivation and not become depressed. Myne thanks her for her advice and the pair prepares to leave.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| Title               = To the Second Winter\n| TranslitTitle       = Futatabime no Fuyu ni Mukete\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e8c\u5ea6\u76ee\u306e\u51ac\u306b\u5411\u3051\u3066\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|5}}\n| ShortSummary        = Hitting the one year mark since her arrival, Myne is bedridden while her family prepares for the fall festival again. As she lies in bed, she suddenly begins to feel the Devouring bubbling inside her, but quickly forces it down. Her family and Lutz return home with food from the festival and are glad to see her health returning. Myne and Lutz go over the training process for apprentices, which include etiquette, literacy, and the ability to perform calculations. The pair ask Benno how to look proper, who tells them to completely overhaul their wardrobe using the money they have accumulated so far. Benno then asks Myne for help with the shampoo-making process since production is not going well. She figures out the issue and when asked what to do with the unused oil they have made thus far, Myne says she will sell them as a different product for a jokingly high price, to which Benno shockingly accepts. When asked why, he tells her it is for her Devouring medication and that she should potentially be ready to sell everything she owns for it. Myne tells Benno everything he needs to know for the shampoo, causing him to ask her who she is and how she knows it all, but she refuses to say. The following day, Myne goes to the gate to practice writing words with Otto, but when he is called to deal with a trombe threat, the Devouring attempts to return again, forcing her to push it down. Later, as she and Lutz prepare the workshop for winter and set up bark hides to dry, but the Devouring appears a third time, forcing Myne to suppress it, worrying Lutz in the process. She explains it appears frequently nowadays, even when she is not disheartened, but the only real remedy is the expensive medicine. They return to Benno's office where Lutz begs him to save Myne since he himself cannot do anything for her. Benno retorts saying that he can help her by manning up and not giving her anything to worry about. Lutz asks Myne if she wants to sell any more of her homemade products, to which she agrees and brings Otto her weaving basket. They discuss other consumable products, when suddenly Myne begins to glow and collapses as the Devouring explodes inside her.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 11\n| Title               = Life-or-Death Choices and Family Meetings \n| TranslitTitle       = Ky\u016bkyoku no Sentaku to Kazoku Kaigi\n| NativeTitle         = \u7a76\u6975\u306e\u9078\u629e\u3068\u5bb6\u65cf\u4f1a\u8b70\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne awakens in Freida's bed and notices a shattered bracelet on her wrist. Freida walks in and tells her how the bracelet was a magical item that absorbs the Devouring fever, but that her illness will soon return within a year. When Myne asks where she can get more, Freida reveals that her family bought every faulty one in town and that the real bracelets are carried by nobles. Freida gives her an ultimatum: make a contract with the nobles and live but leave her family behind, or stay with her family and die. She also reveals that she has a contract to be a future concubine to a noble and is at peace with the decision. Myne thanks Gustav for saving her, but he tells her that the item she used is worth a large amount of money, which she agrees to pay thanks to her deals with Benno, surprising Gustav since he believed she could not and would be forced to work for him instead. Myne spends the rest of the day cooking sweets and playing with Freida before leaving with her family the following morning, who believe Myne is completely cured. She and Lutz arrive at Benno's office where he scolds her for cooking with sugar while she was with Freida since it is actually a rare commodity. Myne notices how busy Benno's shop is during the winter months and ponders making classic Japanese games to sell over the next year. That night at home, she presents her baptismal outfit to Gunther before telling her family the truth about the Devouring and her time limit. After discussing the option of moving in among the nobles with her family, she decides to stay with her family with the time she has left.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12\n| Title               = Baptism and Divine Paradises\n| TranslitTitle       = Senrei shiki to Kami no Rakuen\n| NativeTitle         = \u6d17\u793c\u5f0f\u3068\u795e\u306e\u697d\u5712\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = As the seasons begin to warm, Myne arranges to end her apprenticeship with Benno and sells the rights of the paper-making process to him. Lutz decides to continue his apprenticeship as a merchant under Benno after convincing his mother that he won't follow the family trade into craftsmanship. Myne then meets with Freida, who is surprised and saddened by Myne's decision to stay with her family and die. Since she wants to accumulate enough money for her family to be happy before she goes, Myne agrees to sell all her recipes for cooking with sugar to Freida, who tearfully accepts. Soon after, Myne's baptismal day arrives, so she meets Lutz and parades down the main street with the other town's children toward the city temple. There, the children register for citizenship and learn about the religious history of their world. Afterwards, the clergy and children offer a prayer to the world's gods and goddesses, but the humorous poses required cause Myne to laugh hysterically, resulting in her being taken away under the guise of being ill. She awakens in an unknown room and proceeds to wander around the halls before stumbling across the temple library, but is unable to enter since only clergy are allowed. Myne meets with the High Bishop, who says that admission to work at the temple comes with a sizable donation. Myne offers one large gold coin, the highest currency, shocking him. He follows up by requiring her parent's approval, but agrees that even if they say no, she is welcome to come by and read anytime she wants.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 13\n| Title               = The Choice to be an Apprentice Priestess\n| TranslitTitle       = Miko Minarai to iu Sentakushi\n| NativeTitle         = \u5deb\u5973\u898b\u7fd2\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u9078\u629e\u80a2\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|26}}\n| ShortSummary        = Lutz scolds Myne as she rests in a temple bed for collapsing from excitement after finding out she can become a temple librarian. When she arrives home and tells her family about her plan, however, Gunther angrily refuses to allow her to go and convinces her that priestesses are for orphans that must stay at the church. As Myne comes to terms with this, the Devouring begins to bubble up inside her due to her inner turmoil of choosing between books and family. A few days later, Myne returns to the temple to turn down the offer and meets Ferdinand, the High Priest. Together, they read the religious scripture until the High Bishop arrives, who is puzzled by Myne's decision to refuse his offer. When she reveals she has the Devouring, the High Bishop frantically brings out a large golden grail. When Myne touches the goblet, it suddenly glows red, and the religious pair ask to meet with Myne's parents at a later date. Myne and Lutz then go to Benno, who demands Myne explain to him everything that happened at the temple. After she does, Benno reveals that she is strongly targeted by the church because they are short on mana due to a governmental conflict, and wish to use her Devouring as a sort of refuel in exchange for her desire of books. He also reveals that this will save her life, and recommends binding a magical contract with Lutz and Benno so she will be able to have contact with them while with the church. Myne registers at the guild to create a constant supply of income for her and Benno's profits, but on their way home, Lutz tearfully laments not being able to make books with Myne anymore. Myne apologizes, but retorts that he will always be her first choice if she ever has a problem and claims to still desire to make her own books with his help.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14\n| Title               = Conclusions\n| TranslitTitle       = Ketchaku\n| NativeTitle         = \u6c7a\u7740\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|26}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne tells her parents about the meeting with the temple clergy regarding her apprenticeship, and also reveals how she would live as a noble in exchange for her Devouring to fuel the church's mana supply. She recalls to them how Benno advised to use any means necessary to improve her life and fight for her dreams, including the option to abuse her illness in order to be treated as a noble. Gunther agrees, but Tuuli and Effa are fearful of the potential consequences of negotiating with the temple nobility. Myne and her parents arrive at the church and meet with Ferdinand and the High Bishop, but when he realizes they aren't wealthy, the High Bishop's attitude suddenly becomes condescending and arrogant. After refusing to give Myne to the church without having their demands met, Myne's parents are attacked by the temple's guards and Myne is to be taken by force. As Gunther is about to be overwhelmed, Myne begins to glow and attacks the High Bishop with a semi-psychic power. She knocks him unconscious, but as she goes in for the kill, Ferdinand stands in her way and calms her down. Ferdinand apologizes for not stopping the High Bishop's aggression and brings the family to his room for discussions. There, he explains that Myne's sudden explosion of power is called the \"Crushing\" and occurs when the host of the Devouring lets their emotions overwhelm them. When asked why she isn't already dead, Myne says she used a broken magical item to stay alive, but refused to form a contract with a noble since it would deprive her of her way of life. Moved by her words, Ferdinand agrees to the family's conditions and allows Myne to become a member of the church with full benefits. Myne returns home to Lutz and Tuuli and tearfully hugs them with joy.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|p=Side Stories (OVA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://booklove-anime.jp/news/258 |title=TV\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u300c\u672c\u597d\u304d\u306e\u4e0b\u524b\u4e0a \u53f8\u66f8\u306b\u306a\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u306f\u624b\u6bb5\u3092\u9078\u3093\u3067\u3044\u3089\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u300d\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |language=Japanese |publisher=\u00a9\u9999\u6708\u7f8e\u591c\u30fbTO\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\uff0f\u672c\u597d\u304d\u306e\u4e0b\u524b\u4e0a\u88fd\u4f5c\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a |access-date=March 22, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{efn|name=etc}}|c=#79A3DD|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14.5 (Part 1)\n| Title               = Side Story One: Eustachius's Incognito Operation Downtown\n| TranslitTitle       = Yusutokusu no Shitamachi Sen'ny\u016b Dai Sakusen\n| NativeTitle         = \u30e6\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4e0b\u753a\u6f5c\u5165\u5927\u4f5c\u6226\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|10}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14.5 (Part 2)\n| Title               = Side Story Two: Visiting Missus Corinna\n| TranslitTitle       = Korin'na-sama no Otaku H\u014dmon\n| NativeTitle         = \u30b3\u30ea\u30f3\u30ca\u69d8\u306e\u304a\u5b85\u8a2a\u554f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|10}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|p=2|c=#79A3DD}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 15\n| Title               = Apprentice Priestess\n| TranslitTitle       = Shinden no Miko Minarai\n| NativeTitle         = \u795e\u6bbf\u306e\u5deb\u5973\u898b\u7fd2\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|4}}\n| ShortSummary        = Myne returns to Benno's shop to tell him the news of her apprenticeship, only to find Lutz working as an assistant as part of his apprenticeship.

On the way home, Myne hears about a strange man looking for her and is told to be cautious. That night, Gunther meets with Otto to discuss their future, only for Otto to reveal he's been offered a position by Benno to help support his newborn child. The next day, Benno reveals that someone broke into the Merchant Guild, and the suspect is most likely a spy from the temple who's looking for Myne. He also finds out that Freida bought Myne's recipe for cooking with sugar, much to his chagrin due to a lack of supplies and accessibility, but plans to make her a future offer. At the temple, Ferdinand reports his spy's findings to the High Bishop, promoting her potential high value, but the High Bishop counters with plans to abuse Myne for her mana. The day of Myne's inauguration arrives, but as she walks the halls of the temple, she hears derogatory commoner remarks aimed in her direction. She meets with Ferdinand, recites the prayer to be an apprentice, and is handed her blue robes, the sign of clergy coming from a noble family. She then meets her three attendants, called \"retainers\". She meets a quiet young man named Fran, a conceited young girl named Delia, and a pompous young boy named Gil, all who wear gray-robed uniforms, indicating the lowest level member of the temple. When Ferdinand is called away, it is determined that, while Gil is brash and Fran is devoted to the temple, Delia out secretly out to get Myne, per the High Boshop's orders.\n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 16\n| Title               = Blue Robes and Uncommon Sense\n| TranslitTitle       = Aoi I to Kotonaru J\u014dshiki\n| NativeTitle         = \u9752\u3044\u8863\u3068\u7570\u306a\u308b\u5e38\u8b58\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|11}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 17\n| Title               = Needs\n| TranslitTitle       = Ataerubeki Mono\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3082\u306e\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|18}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = 79A3DD\n}}<!--\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = \n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = \n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}-->\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
