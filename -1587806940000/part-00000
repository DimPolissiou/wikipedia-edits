The shire covers an area of {{convert|870|km2|sqmi|1}}.  The shire existed as a local government entity from 1910 until 2008, when it was [[Merger (politics)|amalgamated]] \nwith the [[Shire of Maroochy]] and [[City of Caloundra]] to form the [[Sunshine Coast Region]], and again from 1 January 2014, when it was re-established.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Noosa.jpg|thumb|left|Noosa Beach.]]\n\n===Ancient history===\nThe Noosa area was originally home to several [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] groups. These primarily include the ''[[Undumbi]]'' tribe to the south, the ''[[Dulingbara]]'' to the north, and the ''[[Kabi Kabi]]'' (or ''Gabbi Gabbi'') to the west.\n\n''[[Gabi-Gabi language|Gubbi Gubbi]] (Kabi Kabi, Cabbee, Carbi, Gabi Gabi)'' is an [[Australian Aboriginal language]] spoken on Gubbi Gubbi country. The Gubbi Gubbi language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the [[Sunshine Coast Region]] and [[Gympie Region]], particularly the towns of [[Caloundra]], [[Noosa Heads, Queensland|Noosa Heads]], [[Gympie]] and extending north towards [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]] and south to [[Caboolture, Queensland|Caboolture]]''.''<ref>{{Cite SLQ-CC-BY|url=https://maps.slq.qld.gov.au/iyil/view/13|title=Gubbi Gubbi|author=|date=|website=Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages map|access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 the Australian Federal Court determined (title claim QC2013/003) that the native title holders for the Noosa area are the Kabi Kabi First Nation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Native Title Applications and Determination Areas |url=http://www.nntt.gov.au/Maps/QLD_Southern_and_Western_NTDA_Schedule.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=25 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough much of the culture and presence of the traditional owners of the Noosa district has been lost during the short period of white settlement, there still exist many subtle reminders. These include:\n* [[bora ring]]s, used during rituals.\n* [[scarred tree|canoe trees]], marks on trees where bark was removed for canoes.\n* border/navigation trees, marks on trees used to mark paths and/or tribal borders.\n* [[Indigenous Australian art#Rock engravings|stone carvings]]\n* [[burial tree]]s\n* [[midden]]s, shell mound created by thousands of years of discarded shells.\n* stone axes\n* spoken legends, many local legends which were traditionally passed through the generations survive today.\n* [[List of Australian place names of Aboriginal origin|place names]]'', many local names are versions of the original Aboriginal names.\n\nIt is widely accepted that the name Noosa comes from the local [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word (Noothera or Gnuthuru in the Kabi Kabi language) for shadow or shady place.<ref>{{cite web |last=Potter |first=Ron |title=Place Names of South-East Queensland |url=http://www.dovenetq.net.au/~piula/Placenames/page49.html |accessdate=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816081404/http://www.dovenetq.net.au/~piula/Placenames/page49.html |archivedate=16 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An 1870 map of Noosa shows the Noosa River written as Nusa River.

This early settlement was primarily driven firstly by timber [[logging]] and then secondly a [[gold rush]] in the [[Gympie]] area, north of Noosa. The difficulty of transport in the region, which persisted to the 1920s and beyond, was one major reason for this.\n\nIn 1871, the Government laid out a port at Tewantin, which was duly surveyed and by 1877 contained two hotels, a boarding house, school, police station and telegraph office. In 1872, the Noosa Heads and coastal region south to Peregian Beach was set aside as an Aboriginal Mission, however this was cancelled in 1878 and land was opened for selection on 15 January 1879. With the advent of the railway, Tewantin declined in importance.<ref name=noosahist>{{cite web |url=http://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/docs/CommGuide05PartD.pdf |format=PDF |title=Noosa Community Guide - 2005 and Beyond (5th ed.) |author=Noosa Council |year=2005 |pages=44\u201357 |accessdate=25 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724202653/http://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/docs/CommGuide05PartD.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 24 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nNoosa is a region, not a town. It contains beaches and a beach national park, the cleanest river in South-East Queensland and an extensive trail network inland, linking a number of lifestyle villages, including Cooroy and Pomona. In the last 50 years Noosa has been transformed from an isolated fishing village to a [[tourist]] destination. Although this has had its costs the shire is known for its generally ''greener'' approach to development. Most development in Noosa has been restrained. Noosa has no high rise buildings, due both to local community pressure and to council planning action, and much remaining native forest. 34.8% of the Noosa district consists of [[National Park]]s, [[Conservation park (Australia)|Conservation Park]]s, [[State Forest]]s, and other generally protected land.\n\nThe popularity of Noosa Heads comes from the fact that is it one of Australia's few North facing beaches located on the East Coast, hence Noosa Beach is relatively protected from on-shore wind and storms.\n\n===Council history===\nThe area was originally incorporated as part of the [[Shire of Widgee|Widgee Divisional Board]] on 11 November 1879 under the ''Divisional Boards Act 1879''. Noosa was created as a separate shire under the ''Local Authorities Act 1902'' in 1910, with an initial population of 2,000. The first elections were held on 22 April 1910 and resulted in James Duke becoming the first shire chairman. The Noosa Shire Hall was constructed in [[Pomona, Queensland|Pomona]] in 1911.<ref name=noosahist/>\n\nOn Saturday 8 September 1917, an Honour Roll was unveiled at the Noosa Shire Hall in Pomona. It was to honour and commemorate those from the district who had left Australia to serve in the armed forces during [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81861529 |title=The Chronicle.

In December 1980, the Shire headquarters moved to Pelican Street, [[Tewantin, Queensland|Tewantin]].

The core Councillors who were most influential in this change were elected in a group called The Resident's Team{{cn|date=April 2020}}.  They laid the foundation for many of the planning and environmental protection concepts for which Noosa is now famous{{cn|date=April 2020}}. The 1982-1985 Noosa Council was the first to introduce the idea of a development/population cap{{cn|date=April 2020}}, the concept of strategic planning, a focus on community arts, the use of design and landscape controls in development applications and they introduced drafts of many of the first development control plans for each of the Noosa townships. The business lobby supported by several local media personalities were successful in seeing this Council being largely replaced by a pro-development Council in the 1985 election{{cn|date=April 2020}}.  That pro-development Council was, in turn, largely removed by the Noosa community in the subsequent 1988 election.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n  \nFollowing the election of Noosa's first green mayor, Noel Playford who was an original member of the 1982-1985 Residents Team{{cn|date=April 2020}}, in 1988, Noosa's first formal strategic plan was gazetted, and in 1990 development was limited to four storeys. In 1993, a major Council and community complex covering {{convert|9|ha|acre|1}} opened at Wallace Park, [[Noosaville, Queensland|Noosaville]].\n\nIn 1995, the mayor Noel Playford controversially formally announced a \"population cap\" of 56,500 people for Noosa Shire based on the initial concepts developed during the 1982-1985 Council term.<ref>{{cite web |last=Winsbury |first=John |title=If the cap fits - can we wear it? |url=https://www.planning.org.au/documents/item/2187 |accessdate=25 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415113941/http://www.planning.org.au/documents/item/2187 |archivedate=15 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The population cap was the expected population under the planning scheme if all available land was developed in accordance with the planning scheme.

The Gubbi Gubbi language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the [[Sunshine Coast Region]] and [[Gympie Region]], particularly the towns of [[Caloundra]], [[Noosa Heads, Queensland|Noosa Heads]], [[Gympie]] and extending north towards [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]] and south to [[Caboolture, Queensland|Caboolture]]''.''<ref>{{Cite SLQ-CC-BY|url=https://maps.slq.qld.gov.au/iyil/view/13|title=Gubbi Gubbi|author=|date=|website=Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages map|access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 the Australian Federal Court determined (title claim QC2013/003) that the native title holders for the Noosa area are the Kabi Kabi First Nation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Native Title Applications and Determination Areas |url=http://www.nntt.gov.au/Maps/QLD_Southern_and_Western_NTDA_Schedule.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=25 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough much of the culture and presence of the traditional owners of the Noosa district has been lost during the short period of white settlement, there still exist many subtle reminders. These include:\n* [[bora ring]]s, used during rituals.\n* [[scarred tree|canoe trees]], marks on trees where bark was removed for canoes.\n* border/navigation trees, marks on trees used to mark paths and/or tribal borders.\n* [[Indigenous Australian art#Rock engravings|stone carvings]]\n* [[burial tree]]s\n* [[midden]]s, shell mound created by thousands of years of discarded shells.\n* stone axes\n* spoken legends, many local legends which were traditionally passed through the generations survive today.\n* [[List of Australian place names of Aboriginal origin|place names]]'', many local names are versions of the original Aboriginal names.\n\nIt is widely accepted that the name Noosa comes from the local [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word (Noothera or Gnuthuru in the Kabi Kabi language) for shadow or shady place.<ref>{{cite web |last=Potter |first=Ron |title=Place Names of South-East Queensland |url=http://www.dovenetq.net.au/~piula/Placenames/page49.html |accessdate=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816081404/http://www.dovenetq.net.au/~piula/Placenames/page49.html |archivedate=16 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An 1870 map of Noosa shows the Noosa River written as Nusa River.

This early settlement was primarily driven firstly by timber [[logging]] and then secondly a [[gold rush]] in the [[Gympie]] area, north of Noosa. The difficulty of transport in the region, which persisted to the 1920s and beyond, was one major reason for this.\n\nIn 1871, the Government laid out a port at Tewantin, which was duly surveyed and by 1877 contained two hotels, a boarding house, school, police station and telegraph office. In 1872, the Noosa Heads and coastal region south to Peregian Beach was set aside as an Aboriginal Mission, however this was cancelled in 1878 and land was opened for selection on 15 January 1879. With the advent of the railway, Tewantin declined in importance.<ref name=noosahist>{{cite web |url=http://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/docs/CommGuide05PartD.pdf |format=PDF |title=Noosa Community Guide - 2005 and Beyond (5th ed.) |author=Noosa Council |year=2005 |pages=44\u201357 |accessdate=25 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724202653/http://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/docs/CommGuide05PartD.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 24 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nNoosa is a region, not a town. It contains beaches and a beach national park, the cleanest river in South-East Queensland and an extensive trail network inland, linking a number of lifestyle villages, including Cooroy and Pomona. In the last 50 years Noosa has been transformed from an isolated fishing village to a [[tourist]] destination. Although this has had its costs the shire is known for its generally ''greener'' approach to development. Most development in Noosa has been restrained. Noosa has no high rise buildings, due both to local community pressure and to council planning action, and much remaining native forest. 34.8% of the Noosa district consists of [[National Park]]s, [[Conservation park (Australia)|Conservation Park]]s, [[State Forest]]s, and other generally protected land.\n\nThe popularity of Noosa Heads comes from the fact that is it one of Australia's few North facing beaches located on the East Coast, hence Noosa Beach is relatively protected from on-shore wind and storms.\n\n===Council history===\nThe area was originally incorporated as part of the [[Shire of Widgee|Widgee Divisional Board]] on 11 November 1879 under the ''Divisional Boards Act 1879''. Noosa was created as a separate shire under the ''Local Authorities Act 1902'' in 1910, with an initial population of 2,000. The first elections were held on 22 April 1910 and resulted in James Duke becoming the first shire chairman. The Noosa Shire Hall was constructed in [[Pomona, Queensland|Pomona]] in 1911.<ref name=noosahist/>\n\nOn Saturday 8 September 1917, an Honour Roll was unveiled at the Noosa Shire Hall in Pomona. It was to honour and commemorate those from the district who had left Australia to serve in the armed forces during [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81861529 |title=The Chronicle.

The core Councillors who were most influential in this change were elected in a group called The Resident's Team{{cn|date=April 2020}}.  They laid the foundation for many of the planning and environmental protection concepts for which Noosa is now famous{{cn|date=April 2020}}. The 1982-1985 Noosa Council was the first to introduce the idea of a development/population cap{{cn|date=April 2020}}, the concept of strategic planning, a focus on community arts, the use of design and landscape controls in development applications and they introduced drafts of many of the first development control plans for each of the Noosa townships. The business lobby supported by several local media personalities were successful in seeing this Council being largely replaced by a pro-development Council in the 1985 election{{cn|date=April 2020}}.  That pro-development Council was, in turn, largely removed by the Noosa community in the subsequent 1988 election.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n  \nFollowing the election of Noosa's first green mayor, Noel Playford who was an original member of the 1982-1985 Residents Team{{cn|date=April 2020}}, in 1988, Noosa's first formal strategic plan was gazetted, and in 1990 development was limited to four storeys.

The court held that such wide restrictions of basic rights may be adopted only under the Crisis Act by the Government as whole and not under Protection of Public Health Act by the Ministry of Health alone. Both the curfew and retail sale ban were originally adopted by Government Resolutions on 14 and 15 March respectively, however then they were replaced by Ministry of Health Protection Measures from 24 March onwards.

However, many other classifications follow the [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]] in placing the larks in a large oscine subgroup [[Passerida]] (which excludes [[Corvidae|crows]], [[shrike]]s and their allies, [[Vireonidae|vireo]]s, and many groups characteristic of Australia and southeastern Asia).  For instance, the American Ornithologists' Union places larks just after the crows, shrikes, and vireos.  At a finer level of detail, some now place the larks at the beginning of a [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] Sylvioidea with the swallows, various \"[[Old World warbler]]\" and \"[[Old World babbler|babbler]]\" groups, [[Passerine|and others]].<ref name=Barker2002>{{cite journal | last = Barker | first = F.

Most have streaked brown plumage, some boldly marked with black or white. Their dull appearance [[camouflage]]s them on the ground, especially when on the nest. They feed on [[insect]]s and [[seed predation|seeds]]; though adults of most species eat seeds primarily, all species feed their young insects for at least the first week after hatching. Many species dig with their bills to uncover food.  Some larks have heavy bills (reaching an extreme in the [[thick-billed lark]]) for cracking seeds open, while others have long, down-curved bills, which are especially suitable for digging.<ref name = \"Kikkawa\"/>\n\nLarks are the only passerines that lose all their feathers in their first [[moult]] (in all species whose first moult is known). This may result from the poor quality of the chicks' feathers, which in turn may result from the benefits to the parents of switching the young to a lower-quality diet (seeds), which requires less work from the parents.<ref name = \"Kikkawa\"/>\n\nIn many respects, including long [[bird anatomy|tertial feathers]], larks resemble other ground birds such as [[pipit]]s.  However, in larks the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] (the lowest leg bone, connected to the toes) has only one set of scales on the rear surface, which is rounded.  Pipits and all other [[songbird]]s have two plates of scales on the rear surface, which meet at a protruding rear edge.<ref name=\"Ridgway 1907\"/>\n\n===Calls and song===\nLarks have more elaborate calls than most birds, and often extravagant [[bird vocalization|songs]] given in display flight.<ref name = \"Kikkawa\"/> These melodious sounds (to human ears), combined with a willingness to expand into [[Anthropogenic biome|anthropogenic]] habitats \u2014 as long as these are not too intensively managed \u2014 have ensured larks a prominent place in literature and music, especially the [[Eurasian skylark]] in northern Europe and the [[crested lark]] and [[calandra lark]] in southern Europe.\n\n==Behaviour==\n===Breeding===\nMale larks use song flights to defend their breeding territory and attract a mate. Most species build nests on the ground, usually [[cup nest|cups]] of dead grass, but in some species the nests are more complicated and partly domed.  A few desert species nest very low in bushes, perhaps so circulating air can cool the nest.<ref name = \"Kikkawa\"/> Larks' [[bird egg|eggs]] are usually speckled. The size of the clutch is very variable and ranges from the single egg laid by [[Sclater's lark]] up to 6-8 eggs laid by the [[calandra lark]] and the [[black lark]].<ref name=hbw>{{cite web | last1=de Juana | first1=E. | last2=Su\u00e1rez | first2=F. | last3=Ryan | first3=P.  | year=2018 | title=Larks (Alaudidae) | editor1-last=del Hoyo | editor1-first=J. | editor2-last=Elliott | editor2-first=A. | editor3-last=Sargatal | editor3-first=J. | editor4-last=Christie | editor4-first=D.A. | editor5-last=de Juana | editor5-first=E. | work=Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive | publisher=Lynx Edicions | url=https://www.hbw.com/node/52302 | accessdate=22 July 2018 |url-access=subscription  }}</ref> Larks incubate for 11 to 16 days.<ref name = \"Kikkawa\"/>\n\n==In culture==\n===Larks as food===\nLarks, commonly consumed with bones intact, have historically been considered wholesome, delicate, and light game. They can be used in a number of dishes; for example, they can be stewed, broiled, or used as filling in a meat pie. Lark's tongues were particularly highly valued. In modern times, shrinking habitats made lark meat rare and hard to come by, though it can still be found in restaurants in Italy and elsewhere in southern Europe.<ref name = \"Hooper\"/>\n\n===Symbolism===\nThe lark in mythology and literature stands for daybreak, as in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] \"[[The Knight's Tale]]\", \"the bisy larke, messager of day\" (I.1487; Benson 1988), and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Sonnet 29]], \"the lark at break of day arising / From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate\" (11\u201312). The lark is also (often simultaneously) associated with \"lovers and lovers' observance\" (as in [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]'s [[Can vei la lauzeta mover]]) and with \"church services\" (Sylvester and Roberts 2000), and often those the meanings of daybreak and religious reference are combined (in [[William Blake|Blake's]] ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', into a \"spiritual daybreak\" (Baine and Baine 1986)) to signify \"passage from Earth to Heaven and from Heaven to Earth\" (Stevens 2001). In Renaissance painters such as [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] the lark symbolizes [[Christ]], in reference to [[Gospel of John|John]] 16:16 (Cadogan 2000).\n\n===Pet===\nTraditionally larks are kept as [[Aviculture|pets]] in China. In Beijing, larks are taught to mimic the voice of other songbirds and animals. It is an old-fashioned habit of the Beijingers to teach their larks 13 kinds of sounds in a strict order (called \"the 13 songs of a lark\", Chinese: \u767e\u7075\u5341\u4e09\u5957). The larks that can sing the full 13 sounds in the correct order are highly valued, while any disruption in the songs will decrease its value significantly (Jin 2005).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lark bunting]]\n* [[Lark sparrow]]\n* [[Magpie-lark]] (Neither a lark nor a magpie, but a giant [[monarch flycatcher]])\n* [[Meadowlark]]\n* [[Pipit|Titlark]], a synonym for [[meadow pipit]]\n* [[Songlark]]\n* [[Alouette (song)|\"Alouette\"]] (a song)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | refs = \n<ref name = \"Hooper\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/17/cat-dormouse-italian-recipes|title=Cat, dormouse and other Italian recipes | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Hooper | date=2010-02-17 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref>\n<ref name = \"Kikkawa\">{{cite book|last=Kikkawa|first=Jiro|chapter=Larks|editor=[[Christopher Perrins|Perrins, Christopher]]|title=Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds|publisher=Firefly Books|year=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fireflyencyclope0000unse/page/578 578\u2013583]|isbn=1-55297-777-3|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/fireflyencyclope0000unse/page/578}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|title=Horned Lark|url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/horned_lark/lifehistory|publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology|accessdate=2012-07-12}}\n*{{cite journal | author = The American Ornithologists' Union | title = The American Ornithologists' Union Check-List of North American Birds\n| journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 20 | issue = 6 |date = June 1886 | pages = 539 | doi = 10.1086/274272| doi-access = free }}\n*{{cite web|title=Check-list of North American Birds |year=1998\u20132006 |url=http://www.aou.org/checklist/index.php3 |accessdate=2008-06-24 |publisher=American Ornithologists' Union |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315195843/http://www.aou.org/checklist/index.php3 |archivedate=2008-03-15 |url-status=dead }}\n*{{cite book|last1=Baine|first1=Rodney M.|last2=Baine|first2=Mary R.|title=The scattered portions: William Blake's biological symbolism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9UlaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 February 2012|year=1986|isbn=978-0-935265-10-1|page=70}}\n*{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Larry D.|title=The Riverside Chaucer|year=1988|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-282109-1|page=45}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cadogan|first=Jeanne K.|title=Domenico Ghirlandaio: artist and artisan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NGNEd9rplzcC&pg=PA215|accessdate=27 February 2012|year=2000|publisher=Yale UP|isbn=978-0-300-08720-8|page=215}}\n*{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Shoushen|title=\u91d1\u53d7\u7533\u8bb2\u5317\u4eac|year=2005|publisher=Beijing Press|location=Beijing|isbn=9787200057935}}\n*{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=Anthony|title=Ariadne's Clue: A Guide to the Symbols of Humankind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06We3O2BWVwC&pg=PA363|accessdate=27 February 2012|year=2001|publisher=Princeton UP|isbn=978-0-691-08661-3|page=363}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Sylvester|first1=Louise|last2=Roberts|first2=Jane Annette|title=Middle English word studies: a word and author index|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnRmyM52G6cC&pg=PA17|accessdate=27 February 2012|year=2000|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=978-0-85991-606-6|page=17}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{ cite journal | last=Meinertzhagen  | first=R. | year=1951 | title=Review of the Alaudidae | journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=121 | issue=1 | pages=81\u2013132 | doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1951.tb00739.x }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Larks}}\n{{Commons category|Alaudidae}}\n{{Wikispecies|Alaudidae}}\n* [http://ibc.lynxeds.com/family/larks-alaudidae Lark videos, photos and sounds] - Internet Bird Collection\n\n{{Larks IOC August2017}}\n{{Larks eBird August2017}}\n{{Larks Birdlife-HBW August2017}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q29858}}\n\n[[Category:Alaudidae|*]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Nicholas Aylward Vigors]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{More footnotes|date=May 2014}}\n{{Automatic Taxobox\n| name = Lark\n| image = Alauda arvensis 2.jpg\n| image_caption = [[Eurasian skylark]] (''Alauda arvensis'')\n| taxon = Alaudidae\n| authority = [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors|Vigors]], 1825\n| subdivision_ranks = Genera\n| subdivision = see text\n}}\n'''Larks''' are [[passerine]] [[bird]]s of the family '''Alaudidae'''.

For instance, the American Ornithologists' Union places larks just after the crows, shrikes, and vireos.  At a finer level of detail, some now place the larks at the beginning of a [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] Sylvioidea with the swallows, various \"[[Old World warbler]]\" and \"[[Old World babbler|babbler]]\" groups, [[Passerine|and others]].<ref name=Barker2002>{{cite journal | last = Barker | first = F.

Most have streaked brown plumage, some boldly marked with black or white. Their dull appearance [[camouflage]]s them on the ground, especially when on the nest. They feed on [[insect]]s and [[seed predation|seeds]]; though adults of most species eat seeds primarily, all species feed their young insects for at least the first week after hatching. Many species dig with their bills to uncover food.  Some larks have heavy bills (reaching an extreme in the [[thick-billed lark]]) for cracking seeds open, while others have long, down-curved bills, which are especially suitable for digging.<ref name = \"Kikkawa\"/>\n\nLarks are the only passerines that lose all their feathers in their first [[moult]] (in all species whose first moult is known). This may result from the poor quality of the chicks' feathers, which in turn may result from the benefits to the parents of switching the young to a lower-quality diet (seeds), which requires less work from the parents.<ref name = \"Kikkawa\"/>\n\nIn many respects, including long [[bird anatomy|tertial feathers]], larks resemble other ground birds such as [[pipit]]s.  However, in larks the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] (the lowest leg bone, connected to the toes) has only one set of scales on the rear surface, which is rounded.  Pipits and all other [[songbird]]s have two plates of scales on the rear surface, which meet at a protruding rear edge.<ref name=\"Ridgway 1907\"/>\n\n===Calls and song===\nLarks have more elaborate calls than most birds, and often extravagant [[bird vocalization|songs]] given in display flight.<ref name = \"Kikkawa\"/> These melodious sounds (to human ears), combined with a willingness to expand into [[Anthropogenic biome|anthropogenic]] habitats \u2014 as long as these are not too intensively managed \u2014 have ensured larks a prominent place in literature and music, especially the [[Eurasian skylark]] in northern Europe and the [[crested lark]] and [[calandra lark]] in southern Europe.\n\n==Behaviour==\n===Breeding===\nMale larks use song flights to defend their breeding territory and attract a mate. Most species build nests on the ground, usually [[cup nest|cups]] of dead grass, but in some species the nests are more complicated and partly domed.  A few desert species nest very low in bushes, perhaps so circulating air can cool the nest.<ref name = \"Kikkawa\"/> Larks' [[bird egg|eggs]] are usually speckled. The size of the clutch is very variable and ranges from the single egg laid by [[Sclater's lark]] up to 6-8 eggs laid by the [[calandra lark]] and the [[black lark]].<ref name=hbw>{{cite web | last1=de Juana | first1=E. | last2=Su\u00e1rez | first2=F. | last3=Ryan | first3=P.  | year=2018 | title=Larks (Alaudidae) | editor1-last=del Hoyo | editor1-first=J. | editor2-last=Elliott | editor2-first=A. | editor3-last=Sargatal | editor3-first=J. | editor4-last=Christie | editor4-first=D.A. | editor5-last=de Juana | editor5-first=E. | work=Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive | publisher=Lynx Edicions | url=https://www.hbw.com/node/52302 | accessdate=22 July 2018 |url-access=subscription  }}</ref> Larks incubate for 11 to 16 days.<ref name = \"Kikkawa\"/>\n\n==In culture==\n===Larks as food===\nLarks, commonly consumed with bones intact, have historically been considered wholesome, delicate, and light game. They can be used in a number of dishes; for example, they can be stewed, broiled, or used as filling in a meat pie. Lark's tongues were particularly highly valued. In modern times, shrinking habitats made lark meat rare and hard to come by, though it can still be found in restaurants in Italy and elsewhere in southern Europe.<ref name = \"Hooper\"/>\n\n===Symbolism===\nThe lark in mythology and literature stands for daybreak, as in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] \"[[The Knight's Tale]]\", \"the bisy larke, messager of day\" (I.1487; Benson 1988), and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Sonnet 29]], \"the lark at break of day arising / From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate\" (11\u201312). The lark is also (often simultaneously) associated with \"lovers and lovers' observance\" (as in [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]'s [[Can vei la lauzeta mover]]) and with \"church services\" (Sylvester and Roberts 2000), and often those the meanings of daybreak and religious reference are combined (in [[William Blake|Blake's]] ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', into a \"spiritual daybreak\" (Baine and Baine 1986)) to signify \"passage from Earth to Heaven and from Heaven to Earth\" (Stevens 2001). In Renaissance painters such as [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] the lark symbolizes [[Christ]], in reference to [[Gospel of John|John]] 16:16 (Cadogan 2000).\n\n===Pet===\nTraditionally larks are kept as [[Aviculture|pets]] in China. In Beijing, larks are taught to mimic the voice of other songbirds and animals. It is an old-fashioned habit of the Beijingers to teach their larks 13 kinds of sounds in a strict order (called \"the 13 songs of a lark\", Chinese: \u767e\u7075\u5341\u4e09\u5957). The larks that can sing the full 13 sounds in the correct order are highly valued, while any disruption in the songs will decrease its value significantly (Jin 2005).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lark bunting]]\n* [[Lark sparrow]]\n* [[Magpie-lark]] (Neither a lark nor a magpie, but a giant [[monarch flycatcher]])\n* [[Meadowlark]]\n* [[Pipit|Titlark]], a synonym for [[meadow pipit]]\n* [[Songlark]]\n* [[Alouette (song)|\"Alouette\"]] (a song)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | refs = \n<ref name = \"Hooper\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/17/cat-dormouse-italian-recipes|title=Cat, dormouse and other Italian recipes | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Hooper | date=2010-02-17 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref>\n<ref name = \"Kikkawa\">{{cite book|last=Kikkawa|first=Jiro|chapter=Larks|editor=[[Christopher Perrins|Perrins, Christopher]]|title=Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds|publisher=Firefly Books|year=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fireflyencyclope0000unse/page/578 578\u2013583]|isbn=1-55297-777-3|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/fireflyencyclope0000unse/page/578}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|title=Horned Lark|url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/horned_lark/lifehistory|publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology|accessdate=2012-07-12}}\n*{{cite journal | author = The American Ornithologists' Union | title = The American Ornithologists' Union Check-List of North American Birds\n| journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 20 | issue = 6 |date = June 1886 | pages = 539 | doi = 10.1086/274272| doi-access = free }}\n*{{cite web|title=Check-list of North American Birds |year=1998\u20132006 |url=http://www.aou.org/checklist/index.php3 |accessdate=2008-06-24 |publisher=American Ornithologists' Union |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315195843/http://www.aou.org/checklist/index.php3 |archivedate=2008-03-15 |url-status=dead }}\n*{{cite book|last1=Baine|first1=Rodney M.|last2=Baine|first2=Mary R.|title=The scattered portions: William Blake's biological symbolism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9UlaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 February 2012|year=1986|isbn=978-0-935265-10-1|page=70}}\n*{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Larry D.|title=The Riverside Chaucer|year=1988|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-282109-1|page=45}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cadogan|first=Jeanne K.|title=Domenico Ghirlandaio: artist and artisan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NGNEd9rplzcC&pg=PA215|accessdate=27 February 2012|year=2000|publisher=Yale UP|isbn=978-0-300-08720-8|page=215}}\n*{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Shoushen|title=\u91d1\u53d7\u7533\u8bb2\u5317\u4eac|year=2005|publisher=Beijing Press|location=Beijing|isbn=9787200057935}}\n*{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=Anthony|title=Ariadne's Clue: A Guide to the Symbols of Humankind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06We3O2BWVwC&pg=PA363|accessdate=27 February 2012|year=2001|publisher=Princeton UP|isbn=978-0-691-08661-3|page=363}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Sylvester|first1=Louise|last2=Roberts|first2=Jane Annette|title=Middle English word studies: a word and author index|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnRmyM52G6cC&pg=PA17|accessdate=27 February 2012|year=2000|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=978-0-85991-606-6|page=17}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{ cite journal | last=Meinertzhagen  | first=R. | year=1951 | title=Review of the Alaudidae | journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=121 | issue=1 | pages=81\u2013132 | doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1951.tb00739.x }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Larks}}\n{{Commons category|Alaudidae}}\n{{Wikispecies|Alaudidae}}\n* [http://ibc.lynxeds.com/family/larks-alaudidae Lark videos, photos and sounds] - Internet Bird Collection\n\n{{Larks IOC August2017}}\n{{Larks eBird August2017}}\n{{Larks Birdlife-HBW August2017}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q29858}}\n\n[[Category:Alaudidae|*]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Nicholas Aylward Vigors]]\n", "name_user": "WolfmanSF", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lark"}

It was released in the US in December 1967 ([[Epic Records]] L2N 6071 (monaural) / B2N 171 (stereo)) and in the UK on 16 April 1968 ([[Pye Records]] NPL 20000 (monaural) / NSPL 20000 (stereo)). In December 1967, Epic Records also released each of the two records from ''A Gift From a Flower to a Garden'' as separate albums in the US. The first record was released as ''Wear Your Love Like Heaven'', and the second record was released as ''For Little Ones''. This was done to allow budgeting for the double album package, which included a folder of the printed lyrics to the second disc with artwork, and a cover featuring an [[infrared photography|infrared]] photo of Donovan by [[Karl Ferris]] who was his and Jimi Hendrix's personal photographer (requiring six colour separations for printing, instead of the usual four separations).\n\n==History==\nAfter recording the ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'' album, Donovan focused on releasing hit singles. \"[[Epistle to Dippy]]\" (essentially an inside-joke/open letter for a childhood friend) hit the top 20 in February 1967 and \"[[There is a Mountain]]\" (#11 US; #8 UK) followed in August.\n\nRiding high on the success of these singles, Donovan entered the studio in October to record his next album. The double album that resulted from these sessions consisted of one disc of electric [[pop music]] (''Wear Your Love Like Heaven'') and another of [[acoustic instrument|acoustic]] children's music (''For Little Ones''). The acoustic album allowed Donovan to present a facet of his songwriting that had not been featured on his singles. It also allowed him to show his strength as a [[guitar]] player and performer in a way that he could not when augmented by [[session musician]]s. In fact, Donovan's live performances of the time featured instrumentation and performances more in line with ''For Little Ones'' than his hit singles and the first record of ''A Gift From a Flower to a Garden''.\n\nWhile [[Mickie Most]] produced the single from the album (\"[[Wear Your Love Like Heaven]]\" b/w \"Oh Gosh\"), and is credited with the album's production, Donovan actually produced the bulk of the material himself, allowing Most the credit to help sales.\n\nIn the album's liner notes, Donovan explained his purpose in creating two rather different discs (one for the present generation, and the other for the \"dawning generation\"), and also denounced the use of drugs. Several of his earlier records had contained both veiled and open references to drug use (particularly [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[LSD]]), but since the release of ''[[Mellow Yellow]]'', he had both been arrested and prosecuted for marijuana possession, and had seen people he knew turning to harder drugs ([[History and culture of amphetamines|speed]], [[heroin]], [[cocaine]]), and the damage this caused in their lives. Instead, Donovan promoted the use of [[transcendental meditation|meditation]] and other techniques, in his new songs.\n\n==Songs==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\"Mad John's Escape\" is a song written for a friend of Donovan's who escaped from a mental health centre. The song details Mad John's escape and subsequent adventures.\n\n\"Under the Greenwood Tree\" was originally written by [[William Shakespeare]] in ''[[As You Like It]]'', and set to music by Donovan for the [[Royal National Theatre]], who planned to use it in a stage production. At the end of the song, Donovan sings \"Will you, won't you... join the dance?\" in reference to the chorus of \"The Lobster Quadrille\" in Chapter X of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.\n\n\"Epistle to Derroll\" is dedicated to the banjo player and singer [[Derroll Adams]], an early influence on Donovan.\n\n==Cover==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe front cover photo design of ''Wear Your Love Like Heaven'' features a [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] style infrared photograph of Donovan on the moat in front of [[Bodiam Castle]] by [[Karl Ferris]] who was his and Jimi Hendrix's personal photographer. The back cover photo was also a shot taken by Ferris in LA during Donovan's and Karl's initiation into [[Transcendental Meditation]], and depicted Donovan visiting with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album reviews\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]] <br><small>(original double album)</small>\n|rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-gift-from-a-flower-to-a-garden-mw0000691015|author=Eder, Bruce|title=Donovan ''A Gift from a Flower to a Garden''|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>\n|rev2 = AllMusic <br><small>(for ''Wear Your Love Like Heaven'')</small>\n|rev2score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/wear-your-love-like-heaven-mw0000852536|author=Bush, John|title=Donovan ''Wear Your Love Like Heaven''|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>\n|rev3 = AllMusic <br><small>(for ''For Little Ones'')</small>\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/for-little-ones-mw0000841608|author=Bush, John|title=Donovan ''Wear Your Love Like Heaven''|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>\n|rev4 = [[MusicHound]]\n|rev4score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>Graff, Gary; Durchholz, Daniel (eds) (1999).

It was released in the US in December 1967 ([[Epic Records]] L2N 6071 (monaural) / B2N 171 (stereo)) and in the UK on 16 April 1968 ([[Pye Records]] NPL 20000 (monaural) / NSPL 20000 (stereo)). In December 1967, Epic Records also released each of the two records from ''A Gift From a Flower to a Garden'' as separate albums in the US. The first record was released as ''Wear Your Love Like Heaven'', and the second record was released as ''For Little Ones''. This was done to allow budgeting for the double album package, which included a folder of the printed lyrics to the second disc with artwork, and a cover featuring an [[infrared photography|infrared]] photo of Donovan by [[Karl Ferris]] who was his and Jimi Hendrix's personal photographer (requiring six colour separations for printing, instead of the usual four separations).\n\n==History==\nAfter recording the ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'' album, Donovan focused on releasing hit singles. \"[[Epistle to Dippy]]\" (essentially an inside-joke/open letter for a childhood friend) hit the top 20 in February 1967 and \"[[There is a Mountain]]\" (#11 US; #8 UK) followed in August.\n\nRiding high on the success of these singles, Donovan entered the studio in October to record his next album. The double album that resulted from these sessions consisted of one disc of electric [[pop music]] (''Wear Your Love Like Heaven'') and another of [[acoustic instrument|acoustic]] children's music (''For Little Ones''). The acoustic album allowed Donovan to present a facet of his songwriting that had not been featured on his singles. It also allowed him to show his strength as a [[guitar]] player and performer in a way that he could not when augmented by [[session musician]]s. In fact, Donovan's live performances of the time featured instrumentation and performances more in line with ''For Little Ones'' than his hit singles and the first record of ''A Gift From a Flower to a Garden''.\n\nWhile [[Mickie Most]] produced the single from the album (\"[[Wear Your Love Like Heaven]]\" b/w \"Oh Gosh\"), and is credited with the album's production, Donovan actually produced the bulk of the material himself, allowing Most the credit to help sales.\n\nIn the album's liner notes, Donovan explained his purpose in creating two rather different discs (one for the present generation, and the other for the \"dawning generation\"), and also denounced the use of drugs. Several of his earlier records had contained both veiled and open references to drug use (particularly [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[LSD]]), but since the release of ''[[Mellow Yellow]]'', he had both been arrested and prosecuted for marijuana possession, and had seen people he knew turning to harder drugs ([[History and culture of amphetamines|speed]], [[heroin]], [[cocaine]]), and the damage this caused in their lives. Instead, Donovan promoted the use of [[transcendental meditation|meditation]] and other techniques, in his new songs.\n\n==Songs==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\"Mad John's Escape\" is a song written for a friend of Donovan's who escaped from a mental health centre. The song details Mad John's escape and subsequent adventures.\n\n\"Under the Greenwood Tree\" was originally written by [[William Shakespeare]] in ''[[As You Like It]]'', and set to music by Donovan for the [[Royal National Theatre]], who planned to use it in a stage production. At the end of the song, Donovan sings \"Will you, won't you... join the dance?\" in reference to the chorus of \"The Lobster Quadrille\" in Chapter X of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.\n\n\"Epistle to Derroll\" is dedicated to the banjo player and singer [[Derroll Adams]], an early influence on Donovan.\n\n==Cover==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe front cover photo design of ''Wear Your Love Like Heaven'' features a [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] style infrared photograph of Donovan on the moat in front of [[Bodiam Castle]] by [[Karl Ferris]] who was his and Jimi Hendrix's personal photographer. The back cover photo was also a shot taken by Ferris in LA during Donovan's and Karl's initiation into [[Transcendental Meditation]], and depicted Donovan visiting with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album reviews\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]] <br><small>(original double album)</small>\n|rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-gift-from-a-flower-to-a-garden-mw0000691015|author=Eder, Bruce|title=Donovan ''A Gift from a Flower to a Garden''|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>\n|rev2 = AllMusic <br><small>(for ''Wear Your Love Like Heaven'')</small>\n|rev2score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/wear-your-love-like-heaven-mw0000852536|author=Bush, John|title=Donovan ''Wear Your Love Like Heaven''|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>\n|rev3 = AllMusic <br><small>(for ''For Little Ones'')</small>\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/for-little-ones-mw0000841608|author=Bush, John|title=Donovan ''Wear Your Love Like Heaven''|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>\n|rev4 = [[MusicHound]]\n|rev4score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>Graff, Gary; Durchholz, Daniel (eds) (1999).

He played [[college football]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] and was drafted by the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the seventh round of the [[2013 NFL Draft]].\n\nAfter he graduated from [[Warren High School (Arkansas)|Warren High School]] in Arkansas, where he played football as a [[wide receiver]], Gragg committed to the [[University of Arkansas]] along with three other Warren players. Although he spent his freshman season as a receiver on the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas Razorbacks football squad]], the coaching staff converted Gragg into a tight end in 2010. In his sophomore and junior seasons, the Razorbacks made appearances in [[Bowl Championship Series]] games and defeated the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State Wildcats]] in the [[2012 Cotton Bowl Classic]], which culminated the 2011 season. A knee injury caused Gragg to miss eight games in his senior season as the Arkansas team finished with a losing record. Invited to participate in the [[NFL Scouting Combine]], an evaluative competition among prospective NFL players, Gragg ran the fastest [[40-yard dash]] time and had the second-highest [[vertical jump]] among tight ends in attendance; in the [[draft (sports)|draft]], the Bills chose Gragg with the 222nd overall selection, a pick Buffalo acquired from a trade with the [[St. Louis Rams]]. One of five tight ends in spring training, he made Buffalo's regular-season roster and played in nine regular-season games during the [[2013 NFL season]]. He then played in 10 games in 2014 and 13 games in 2015 before missing the entire 2016 season due to injury.\n\n==Early life==\nChris Gragg was born on June 30, 1990, in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], to Kelvin and Tenita Gragg, both of whom worked as educators.<ref name=\"Arkansas_bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasrazorbacks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=6100&ATCLID=1514875|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203042828/http://www.arkansasrazorbacks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=6100&ATCLID=1514875|archivedate=December 3, 2013 |title=Chris Gragg|publisher=University of Arkansas|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"2014_NFL_Game_logs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/player/chrisgragg/2539202/gamelogs|title=Chris Gragg 2014 Game Logs|publisher=National Football League|accessdate=August 15, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Education\">{{cite news|url=http://pbcommercial.com/news/local/gragg-surprises-seark-students-stresses-education|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055043/http://pbcommercial.com/news/local/gragg-surprises-seark-students-stresses-education|archivedate=August 10, 2014|title=Gragg Surprises SEARK Students, Stresses Education|date=March 12, 2014|last=Stokes|first=Phyllis|newspaper=Pine Bluff Commercial|publisher=Stephens Media Group}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Kelvin coached the [[Warren High School (Arkansas)|Warren High School]] football team, and Chris served as the team's [[water boy]] until he was in junior high school.<ref name=\"Chapter 2\">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.buffalonews.com/press-coverage/2013/08/chris-graggs-rookie-journal-chapter-2.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022804/http://blogs.buffalonews.com/press-coverage/2013/08/chris-graggs-rookie-journal-chapter-2.html|archivedate=December 3, 2013|title=Chris Gragg's Rookie Journal: Chapter 2|newspaper=The Buffalo News|publisher=Berkshire Hathaway|last=Grahm|first=Tim|date=August 1, 2013}}</ref> For the Warren squad, Gragg played football as a [[wide receiver]] alongside future NFL players [[Jarius Wright]] and [[Greg Childs (American football)|Greg Childs]].<ref name=\"College_bio\">{{cite news|url=http://arkansasnews.com/2010/08/13/room-for-one-more-gragg-counting-on-big-role-in-offense|title=Room For One More?

He played [[college football]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] and was drafted by the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the seventh round of the [[2013 NFL Draft]].\n\nAfter he graduated from [[Warren High School (Arkansas)|Warren High School]] in Arkansas, where he played football as a [[wide receiver]], Gragg committed to the [[University of Arkansas]] along with three other Warren players. Although he spent his freshman season as a receiver on the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas Razorbacks football squad]], the coaching staff converted Gragg into a tight end in 2010. In his sophomore and junior seasons, the Razorbacks made appearances in [[Bowl Championship Series]] games and defeated the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State Wildcats]] in the [[2012 Cotton Bowl Classic]], which culminated the 2011 season. A knee injury caused Gragg to miss eight games in his senior season as the Arkansas team finished with a losing record. Invited to participate in the [[NFL Scouting Combine]], an evaluative competition among prospective NFL players, Gragg ran the fastest [[40-yard dash]] time and had the second-highest [[vertical jump]] among tight ends in attendance; in the [[draft (sports)|draft]], the Bills chose Gragg with the 222nd overall selection, a pick Buffalo acquired from a trade with the [[St. Louis Rams]]. One of five tight ends in spring training, he made Buffalo's regular-season roster and played in nine regular-season games during the [[2013 NFL season]]. He then played in 10 games in 2014 and 13 games in 2015 before missing the entire 2016 season due to injury.\n\n==Early life==\nChris Gragg was born on June 30, 1990, in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], to Kelvin and Tenita Gragg, both of whom worked as educators.<ref name=\"Arkansas_bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasrazorbacks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=6100&ATCLID=1514875|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203042828/http://www.arkansasrazorbacks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=6100&ATCLID=1514875|archivedate=December 3, 2013 |title=Chris Gragg|publisher=University of Arkansas|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"2014_NFL_Game_logs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/player/chrisgragg/2539202/gamelogs|title=Chris Gragg 2014 Game Logs|publisher=National Football League|accessdate=August 15, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Education\">{{cite news|url=http://pbcommercial.com/news/local/gragg-surprises-seark-students-stresses-education|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055043/http://pbcommercial.com/news/local/gragg-surprises-seark-students-stresses-education|archivedate=August 10, 2014|title=Gragg Surprises SEARK Students, Stresses Education|date=March 12, 2014|last=Stokes|first=Phyllis|newspaper=Pine Bluff Commercial|publisher=Stephens Media Group}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Kelvin coached the [[Warren High School (Arkansas)|Warren High School]] football team, and Chris served as the team's [[water boy]] until he was in junior high school.<ref name=\"Chapter 2\">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.buffalonews.com/press-coverage/2013/08/chris-graggs-rookie-journal-chapter-2.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022804/http://blogs.buffalonews.com/press-coverage/2013/08/chris-graggs-rookie-journal-chapter-2.html|archivedate=December 3, 2013|title=Chris Gragg's Rookie Journal: Chapter 2|newspaper=The Buffalo News|publisher=Berkshire Hathaway|last=Grahm|first=Tim|date=August 1, 2013}}</ref> For the Warren squad, Gragg played football as a [[wide receiver]] alongside future NFL players [[Jarius Wright]] and [[Greg Childs (American football)|Greg Childs]].<ref name=\"College_bio\">{{cite news|url=http://arkansasnews.com/2010/08/13/room-for-one-more-gragg-counting-on-big-role-in-offense|title=Room For One More?
