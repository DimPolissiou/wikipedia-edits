{"title_page": "Christian library", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2009}}\n'''Christian Theological libraries''' have their origins in the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] whose practice and transmission depended on the keeping and duplication of sacred texts. Like Judaism, [[Christianity]] depends fundamentally on the preservation and study of a [[sacred text]]. From this it follows that the texts and the secondary literature will be collected for the use of the literate members of the religious communities and passed on to succeeding generations.\n\n==Early Christian libraries==\nThe integral relationship between [[Christianity]] and its texts has always ensured a central place for books, for learning, and for libraries among Christians. The passing of two millennia has witnessed changes in the manner and intensity of Christian scholarship, yet it has always been the case that [[theology|theological]] learning is inconceivable without libraries and librarians doing the work both of collecting the theological insights of the past and anticipating future theological and religious trends.\n\nThe establishment of the [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|Christian canon]] has classically been a subject of central interest to the Christian religion (though in more recent years it has become a special study for theologians and textual critics). It also has a direct bearing on the origins of Christian libraries. As preliminary consensus in the formation of a canon was arrived at, [[Early Christianity|early Christian communities]] would typically entrust to a member of the community the task of providing care and security for those documents that authentically represented the identity and cohesion of each community in this upstart (and frequently embattled) religion.\n\nThe impulse to keep valued texts and documents safe but accessible shaped the patterns of early collections, and the first recorded mention of early Christian library activity comes down to us from a context of hostility. Under the Emperor [[Diocletian]] (3rd-century), a series of edicts against the Christians included orders that Christian books be seized and destroyed. From this it can reasonably be inferred that it was typical for a local Christian assembly to possess a collection of texts of one kind or another, and that the authorities considered the destruction of such materials to be an essential part of suppressing the Christian faith.\n\n===The library at Jerusalem===\nBishop [[Alexander of Jerusalem]] established a library during his tenure (first half of the 3rd century): this is known from the records of an actual \u201creader\u201d, [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], who mentions some of the works he found there. Possibly Alexander's library had as its model the notable Classical collection of [[Alexandria]]: it may be that while still in the Egyptian city, [[Origen]] encouraged his student Alexander to initiate a center for study in [[Jerusalem]].\n\n===The library at Caesarea===\nOrigen had a hand also in the establishment of the early Christian library of greatest renown, that at [[Caesarea]], based on his own private collection. The great [[Jerome]] was later associated with this library, although a lot of the specific library work appears to have been the task of [[Pamphilus of Caesarea|Pamphilus]] who, according to Jerome, \u201csearched throughout the world for examples that were true and eternal monuments of gifted writers.\u201d <ref>Gamble, ''Books'', 156</ref> Through these efforts, the library grew to include thousands of volumes, a staggering accomplishment when one considers the labor involved in copying by hand. The breadth and quality of this collection is attested by the range of sources cited by Eusebius, who relied on this library in research for his works. Primary collections included all the works of Origen, as well as contemporaries such as [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Sulpicius Apollinaris|Apollinaris]], [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], [[Irenaeus]], and virtually all the important ecclesiastical writers of the period. Since the library performed the critical functions of copying, revising and gathering texts into usable selections, scriptural texts were present in abundance.\n\nPreservation issues also presented themselves: we have record of there having been projects to \u201cconvert\u201d the library (or at least its most heavily used segments) from papyrus to parchment.  It needs to be emphasized that Caesarea's was, in almost every modern sense, principally a research rather than a congregational or liturgical library.  In this setting ambitious critical works were housed, and ever more ambitious and critical works were written, and it would be some time before any Christian library again rose to the standard set in Caesarea.  (Regrettably, we cannot be certain what became of the collection, except that it is lost almost without a trace).\n\n===The library at Alexandria===\nOf a specifically Christian library in Alexandria (as distinct from the renowned Classical [[library of Alexandria]] of earlier centuries) less is known. Given the prominence of the city within the Greek world of letters, it is quite possible that authoritative teaching figures such as [[Pantaenus]] and Clement put their personal libraries at the disposal of students, and that over time a Christian library took shape.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n===The early library of the Bishop of Rome===\nIt was not until the 4th and 5th centuries,  when political conditions permitted,  that \u201cepiscopal\u201d libraries took shape in [[Rome]], situated in the [[Lateran Palace]]. Here were housed not only theological works, but, in keeping with the administrative function, archives as well.\n\n===The library at Hippo Regius===\nOf all the Christian libraries in the West in the first six centuries, we know most about the library at [[Hippo Regius|Hippo]], home of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. No distinction is made in the contemporary accounts between his personal library and that of the church, so it is probable that the two were housed together <ref>Gamble, 167</ref> The librarian recorded over a thousand items under Augustine's personal authorship, and the collection is certain to have included scriptural books, the works of other Latin and Greek Christian writers, and a rich selection of \u201csecular\u201d works.  We know that the collection was fully catalogued (perhaps Augustine himself had a hand in this), but along with the rest of the collection this index is lost.\n\n===Further improvements===\nWhen it was safe to do so, Christianity made the most of the accomplishments of Roman civilization with respect to books and libraries: if the possession of a well-stocked library was considered an enviable adornment to a Roman house, it is probable that a similar element of prestige was conferred on those Christian gathering places which possessed the premier collections of letters and texts. [[Jerome]] (4th and 5th century), for example, was able to assume that wherever there was a congregation, books would be found. In the course of things, those churches that became regional administrative centers tended to develop the best collections.\n\n===The Near East===\nOf early Christian libraries in the East, far less is known.  The Imperial Library of [[Constantinople]] encompassed at its peak over 100,000 items but in no sense was it primarily  a theological library.\n\n==Libraries in the monastic setting==\n\nThe earliest examples come from Egypt. Monasteries under the direction of [[Pachomius]] (4th century) and [[Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite|Shenouda]] (5th century) required that members learn to read, and it was further expected that they would borrow and study texts from the community's collection. (Twentieth-century archeological discoveries\u2014Phobaimmon and [[Nag Hammadi]], for example\u2013-have indicated that there was a tremendous amount of activity in writing and copying texts, and one library \u201ccatalog\u201d from the period lists eighty titles.)  Collections were composed of biblical texts, lectionaries, church canons, hagiography/biography, etc.\n\nIn [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christendom]],  monastic libraries developed on a similar pattern.  \u201cCatalogs\u201d were simply inventories of items held by the community.  On those rare occasions when a community's benefactor would donate their personal collection, the tendency was not to dispose of questionable or even heretical works:  given the short supply of texts, almost any item would be considered a \u201crare book.\u201d  The common practice in monastic life was for the abbot (or equivalent) to be charged with the responsibility for securing and caring for the collection.\n\nIt is from southern Italy that we receive the most enduring image of early Christian (and monastic) libraries and librarianship, in the person of [[Cassiodorus]].  Like no one else of his time, he leaves us a compendious work of bibliography, the Institituiones divinarum et saecularum litterarum (Institutes of Divine and Secular Literature), which surveys first Christian and then secular texts, providing notes and commentary along the way.   An earlier attempt at Rome to establish a theological school had been frustrated, and so on his family's estate at Calabria he established the \u201cVivarium\u201d, as a setting in which \u201cto incorporate systematic theological study into monastic life.\u201d  (Gamble, 1990)  With this in view he assembled a large library of both Christian and Classical texts and designed a curriculum of study.  He undertook his monastic and bibliographic work only after a long and well-rewarded career in the service of the [[Goths]], and hence the work we remember him for can be seen as aspiring  \u201cto combat the growing chaos of the world\u201d (Southern, \u201c Benedictine,\u201d 167). We learn from the Institutiones how he had these sub-collections housed, what they included, together with how they were obtained.\n\n==The Later Middle Ages==\n\nCassiodorus may have been aware of  the inception of the library at [[Monte Cassino]] under the influence of [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict]]  (LeJay and Otten, \u201cCassiodorus.\u201d)  In any event, with the Imperial City increasingly under attack, the locus of library activity shifted increasingly to the rural monastic houses.  Benedict supported and energized the place of the library in the community by  delegating one or two senior brothers to walk on \u201cpatrol\u201d at a set hour, to ensure that no one is engaged in idle chatter, rather than being diligent in his reading.  (Thurston, \u201cLibraries,\u201d   228-32.)\n\nDuring the succeeding centuries, such libraries played an increasingly strategic role in defending the tradition of learning from decay, pillage, and even disappearance.  By the standards of the later Middle Ages, a monastery collection numbering more than a thousand would have been considered very large. Quality and utility rather than mass were most to be desired.  Catalogs varied in complexity and in volume, and \u201cchained books\u201d were common enough to indicate that security was a lively concern.\n\nWe know a little about the physical design of some libraries of the period from extant documents.  Typically a large, pillared hall would serve as a reading room, with built-in cupboards to store the books.  Carrels for study were often set around the perimeter to utilize available light.  An additional floor might house a [[scriptorium]].\n\nThe same period saw the flowering of monastic libraries in Britain. Once the Roman occupation ended in the mid-Fifth century, [[Columba]] founded the meditation and copying center at Iona off the coast of Scotland.  A century later witnessed the arrival of [[Augustine of Canterbury]], sent to England by [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]], and this set in motion the establishment of greater conformity to the will of Rome on the part of the English church.  A side-effect of this harmony was a marked increase in monastic library development in England, and a key figure in this maturing was [[Benedict Biscop]] of Wearmouth on the North Sea Coast.  In the tradition of Pamphilius and Cassiodorus, Biscop traveled far to get the works he required:  \u201che sought [books] where they were best to be found among the desolate remains of ancient civilization in Italy.\u201d  (Southern, 168)  Most importantly, what he retrieved from the Continent contained everything that was necessary for understanding the main outlines of the Christian learning of the ancient world (Southern, 168).  The perfect testimony to the value of his diligent endeavors is that they  supported the scholarship of [Bede], \u201cthe greatest example of Benedictine scholarship and of the use to which a Benedictine library can be put.\u201d  (Southern, 170)\n\nThe rise of [[university|universities]] and their libraries was energized greatly by bequests:  Bp. [[Robert Grosseteste]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] to [[university of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Robert de Sorbon]] to the [[University of Paris]], etc.  The emerging university libraries, small though they may have been at first, rapidly assumed a different function than the monastic libraries.  Research activity, rather than copying and preservation, predominated.  And it is fair to say that the advent of  new technology - the printing press - in the late 14th century helped take this distinction (the beginnings of a \u201cdemand\u201d model) still further.\n\nIn France, prior to 1200 all of the major theological schools had all grown up in the environs of cathedrals:  [[St. Victor's Abbey, Paris|St. Victor]], [[Biblioth\u00e8que Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve|Ste. Genevieve]], [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]].  This association of the cathedral and academy proved to have a decisive influence in determining both where and how theological research and education were to be carried out for centuries to come.\n\nBy 1500 there were between 75 and 85 universities in Western Europe.  Most began without formal libraries, but over the course of time the user of private tutors\u2019 collections in faculties of theology and elsewhere gave way to more methodical and sustainable collection schemes.\n\n==Early Modern Europe==\n\n===The Renaissance===\nIf the later Middle Ages were characterized by the \u201crescue and preservation\u201d of Christian texts by monastics on the fringes of the world, the [[Renaissance]] (14th-17th centuries) was an era of recovery. It is doubtful whether the history of Western Civilization has ever seen, before or since, such a hunger for ancient texts and their contents. Admittedly, this appetite was more for Greek and Latin classical texts than for Christian works, but the general effect was a positive one for libraries.\n\nThe advent of the [[printing press]] had a direct and rapid effect on libraries, for it offered not only the prospect of more copies of more volumes being on the market, but made the unprecedented range of available editions a consideration: \u201cthe desired classics were appearing in versions more reliable than their predecessors because of the Humanist scholarship, and far more stable once in print than anything the manuscript age could have produced.\u201d<ref>Jackson, ''Libraries'', p. 112</ref>\n\nThis change-of-focus showed itself first in Italy: [[Petrarch]], [[Boccacio]], [[Salutati]] and others rediscovered, aggressively collected, and copied manuscripts from all-but-lost collections during the 14th century. Significantly, when this appetite turned into something of a \u201cgold-rush\u201d, it was almost invariably to places such as the Benedictine library of [[Monte Cassino]] where text-hunters turned. For economic and other reasons, Florence became the center of such activity.  Across Europe the focus for library expansion and activity became the royal or princely libraries:  aggressive activity in collecting, gathering and protecting texts from their scattered locations was characterized by individuals rather than churches or even universities.\n\nThe greatest of these book-hunters were personal agents of wealthy noblemen. Perhaps this is why the greatest legacy for theological librarianship of this essentially humanist cultural movement was the effect it had on the [[Vatican Library]]. Its earlier collection had been dispersed during the [[Avignon Papacy|interval]] at [[Avignon]], so that on his accession [[Pope Nicholas V|Pope Nicholas]] found only 350 volumes extant. The library of the Vatican was brought back to health essentially as a combination of personal library collections, such as that of the [[Duke of Urbino]] (1120 volumes added to the Vatican Library after his death).\n\nIn the Low Countries and in England the effect of the Renaissance was somewhat different: [[Erasmus]] in Rotterdam was not only a fine and aggressive collector in his own right, but with great erudition brought together the best of the specifically Christian tradition with the emergent [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] of the Continent. The effects of such efforts on the Reformation period and beyond are impossible to calculate.\n\n===The Protestant Reformation===\nThe turmoil generated by the English monarchy's break with Rome in the 16th century had a devastating effect on theological library collections. In Yorkshire alone, for example, under the aegis of various religious orders, there may have been more than fifty abbeys, priories, etc., each of them having at least a modest library. Yet within the space of little more than a generation, this whole structure was crudely dismantled. State-authorized visitations during the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Edward VI]] meant the break-up of collections not only in the monasteries but also at the universities as well.<ref>Cross, \u201dMonastic,\u201d p. 256</ref> Insofar as this process was guided by any principle, it was to suppress that which was medieval and to elevate that which was Classical and Humanist in character. In large measure this had the desired effects of cutting British libraries loose from the literary tradition associated with Rome, and of turning interest toward the Anglo-Saxon church. There is some evidence that the abrupt \u201cchange of fashion\u201d in theological literature and learning brought in by the Henrician Reformation had the curious effect of extracting significant portions of monastic collections from purely religious surroundings. So quickly did materials intrinsic to the Catholic tradition become devalued (the monarchy was aggressive and quite ruthless in moving the Church in the direction of Protestant humanism) that it was not uncommon for displaced monks, friars and abbots to be able to take with them, gratis, items from monastic libraries.\n\nAdditionally, some private collectors ([[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], [[Matthew Parker]], [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]], etc.) were able to save some of the monastic holdings from destruction.<ref>Clement, ''Renaissance Libraries'', p. 551</ref> It was in the spirit of such private generosity that efforts to overturn the Reformation's more destructive impulses that moved [[Thomas Bodley]] to help re-establish the [[Bodleian Library|library at Oxford]].\n\nSimilar currents can be observed in the Continental Reformation, with some books taken from the monasteries moved to [[Lutheran Churches of the Reformation|Lutheran churches]]. A more enduring effect was the shift of surviving monastic collections to the universities. Many universities which were founded in the 16th century had their libraries enriched tremendously by works taken from Dominican and Jesuit libraries, especially. Leipzig's collection, for example, received 1,500 manuscripts and 4,000 printed books in this fashion. Basel received the contents of both the city's cathedral library and a nearby Dominican library. This can hardly have been what the monks and scribes had in mind amid their earlier toils, but at least the works lived on in active use. Many libraries suffered damage or disruption  during the [[Thirty Years\u2019 War]] in the 17th century, but in general the 17th and 18th centuries were a period of remarkable growth in theological collections of Continental Europe: again, the uniform trend was away from the cloisters and into the academy.\n\n===The Enlightenment===\n\n====Great Britain====\nReligious dissent in England had the effect of prompting some dissenters to leave for America, where their views on Church, State and education found expression in new colleges. Many of those who remained in England found themselves denied access to the universities by the [[Act of Uniformity (disambiguation)|Acts of Uniformity]] (1549 and after). Their response was to found their own \u201cacademies\u201d, 35 of which were established between 1680 and 1780. Library resources for these schools were chiefly supplied by the private collections of the academies\u2019 benefactors.\n\nDuring the same time period were also established endowed libraries for the use of parishioners.  In this case it appears that literature was made available to keep readers from lapsing into the \u201ceasy moral ways\u201d thought to be characteristic of the Restoration era.\n\nThe labors of Rev. [[Thomas Bray]] demonstrate how far a  \u201cphilanthropic\u201d vision for Christian libraries could sometimes extend. It came to Bray's attention that many ministers, both Anglican and Dissenting, in Britain and in the Colonies, simply lacked the means to procure theological books, and were effectively consigned to rural parishes where they were not within reasonable distance of books to borrow. The result was the formulation of \u201cParochial and Lending Libraries\u201d.  He drafted a six-page list of titles to be included, and aimed to set up such a collection for every deanery in England,<ref>Jackson, p. 208</ref> and appealed for donations of books and money to the aristocracy.  Eventually the [[SPCK]] (which he helped found late in the 17th century) thought well enough of the enterprise to undertake its sponsorship.\n\nThe new idea of a regional, or even a lending library of theological literature was taken even further by a Non-Conformist Scot, [[James Kirkwood (Church of Scotland)|James Kirkwood]], who proposed the support of such ventures with a property tax. Kirkwood won the support of the scientist [[Robert Boyle]] for the translation and distribution of Gaelic Bible translations in the north of Scotland. In this formerly deprived region he also helped establish 77 \u201clending libraries\u201d in the early decades of the 18th century.\n\n====France====\nBy contrast, the paroxysm that rocked France at the end of the 18th century was felt first by the libraries of the Jesuits. Whether impelled by the jealousy of other orders, or whether anti-clerical sentiment was simply an explosion looking for a place to occur, the Jesuits took the brunt. A series of edicts meant to rein in their influence and holdings culminated with the actual dissolution of the order in 1773. Most French universities, having close ties with the Church, did not survive the Revolution. As was the case in the Reformation, their book and manuscript collections were dispersed mostly to university or private libraries, in Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck, etc.\n\nThe French Revolution brought similar changes to ecclesiastical libraries, though there seemed to be a more overtly destructive impulse at the root of changes. The idea was to confiscate collections and redistribute them for the benefit of the public. One contemporary estimate put the number of books seized at 12 million.<ref>Jackson, 275</ref>  The urge to protect one's own literary property had its effect once again, however, and many of the items made their way into clandestine or private collections.\n\n==North American seminary libraries==\n\n===Origin and development===\nTheological collections had almost always been a component part, often indeed the central part, of cathedral or university libraries.  In North America this situation was altered forever by several factors:\n\n1. After the Enlightenment, theology was reassessed to the status of one subject of inquiry among many, rather than retaining its place as the \u201cQueen of the Sciences\".\n2. Emigration to American afforded the opportunity to reconsider the entire system of theological education.\n3. In North America, theological education would no longer be driven, dominated or informed by a state church. Other factors \u2013 new schools of thought as well as \u201cmarket forces\u201d, personal philanthropy, etc. - would play a stronger role than previously.<ref>Endy, \"Theology and Learning in Early America,\u201d in: Henry, ''Schools of Thought'', pp. 125-51</ref>\n\nIt is true that the idea of an independent seminary had occasional antecedents in Europe, but the model that emerged in America was in almost every respect unique. Harvard and Yale and other colleges were established for the training of clergy, but at the time this was not considered to be a specialized and professional education. The lines of demarcation between secular and theological learning were not clear. Of the 400 books donated by [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] shortly after the founding of the [[Harvard University|college]], about two thirds were theological, and since the collection's growth depended largely on donations from clergy, this proportion did not change rapidly. The Harvard \u201cshelf-list\u201d was compared with a recommended-list of the time, [[Richard Baxter]]\u2019s Christian Directory, which indicated that the collection at Harvard was at best meager. (Baxter, as well as [[Samuel Willard]]\u2019s ''Brief Directions to a Young Scholar'', [[Cotton Mather]]'s\u2019 ''Manductio ad Ministerium'', ''Directions for a Candidate of the Ministry'', and [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]\u2019s ''The Preacher, as Discourse ... to which is added a Catalogue of Some Authors were some of the conspectuses for theological literature which were used at the time''.)\n\nIn 18th-century America, consensus on theology and theological training came under considerable strain. Traditionally, it was thought that theological training was best carried out through a rigorous program in academic subjects. But revivalist trends outside the academy and theological ferment within it led to increasing distrust.\n\nThe option of personal apprenticeship in the home of a respected clergyman\u2014what came to be called the \u201cSchools of the Prophets\u201d\u2013-grew in popularity in the aftermath of the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1740 and after) [[Joseph Bellamy]] of Bethlehem, CT, was probably the best example: his personal library consisted of approximately 100 books and at least 350 pamphlets (an essential medium for \u201cbroadcasting\u201d sermons at the time). There is some irony in the fact that, though it removed many of the best divinity students from the academy, this \u201cunorthodox\u201d approach produced more than its share of highly learned pastors, on the strength of the erudition of the \"Prophets\u201d, the power of example, and perhaps sometimes of the quality of their personal libraries.\n\nThis \u201cun-orthodox\u201d trend in the training of Protestant ministers helped prepare the ground for another development in theological libraries: the institution of \u201cfree-standing\u201d schools of theology. Some of these ([[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]]) remained affiliated with the original colleges, others ([[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary|Pittsburgh]]) became independent entities. But what is of signal importance in all cases is that here were assembled collections for theology and divinity and nothing else. Again, donations of private theological collections provided the foundation <ref>Hadidian, \u201cSeminary,\u201d pp. 220 ff.</ref>  Several seminary libraries were formed on this basis by the end of the 18th century (New Brunswick, Service Seminary in PA, St. Mary's-Baltimore). The first part of the 19th century saw excellent theological collections being gathered at Andover (later merged with the Harvard Divinity Collection), [[Hartford]] (sold much later to [[Candler School of Theology]] at [[Emory University]]), Yale, Auburn/[[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union in New York]], [[Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School|Colgate-Rochester]] (and subsequent mergers from [[Bexley Hall]] and [[Crozer Theological Seminary]]), [[General Theological Seminary|General]], [[Drew University|Drew]], Princeton, Gettysburg, St. Charles Borromeo,  etc. In the Midwest, the [[St. Mary of the Lake Seminary]] was founded in 1844, and on the west coast what is now the [[Pacific School of Religion]] came into existence in 1866.\n\n===Situation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries===\n\nIn North America, both denominational and non-denominational schools of theology had seen remarkable proliferation by the middle of the 19th century. When, in 1924, the first comprehensive study of ministerial education was undertaken, 161 Protestant schools were listed. This number had increased to 224 only a decade later. In his important survey of theological libraries in 1930, Yale's Raymond Morris indicated that theological libraries ranged in collections from a few hundred volumes up to almost 200,000. This was impressive numerical growth, but he found that libraries were almost always under-supported financially, with repercussions being felt in collections, facilities and staffing.<ref>Morris, ''Libraries'', pp. 149-91</ref>\n\nWithin the Catholic communion in North America, growth patterns had also been phenomenal. An overview in 1960 listed 93 diocesan seminaries (50 considered \u201cmajor\u201d), as well as 294 \u201chouses of study\u201d, with a total of almost 20,000 students in preparation.<ref>Harrington. ''Catholic'', pp.  155-57</ref> While at that time none of the Catholic collections were on the same scale as the largest Protestant libraries, many contained more than 100,000 items.\n\nIt is clear now that by the time the surveys by Beach and Harrington were carried out (1960), a watershed had been crossed, and that demographics of theological education and of church attendance were in the process of rapid change. Among Catholic seminaries, the number of candidates for the priesthood has fallen drastically in the past thirty years (by 2/3, according to some estimates). On the Protestant side, while the overall number of students has remained strong, at the same time attendance patterns have been in sharp decline, and this has drastically reduced the number of graduates who end up serving in parishes. The second half of the 20th century contrasted sharply with the first, and the number of theological colleges and libraries had grown too quickly and too broadly to correspond with trends in the last three decades of the century. This has posed enormous, complex challenges for seminaries and their librarians: serious dislocation, and too many unevenly distributed schools.\n\n===The Character of present-day collections===\n\nThe magnificent wealth of resources now in evidence is the result of a complex and lengthy development process.  Which is another way of saying that there have been slightly different routes taken to attain the caliber enjoyed by many collections today.  Some have relied principally on rapid denominational growth (which generated demand for clergy and brought in funding required from denominations and benefactors); some have prospered from the skill and vision of exceptional library leadership; some libraries have built their reputations on exquisite collections purchased and then donated by private individuals; still others have excelled in cultivating niche collections or services.\n\nThe individual collections are unique, and the product of many sets of circumstances, so summarizing adequately here would be difficult. (Though dated, earlier overviews by Allison, Walker, Gapp, and Hadidian still provide useful outlines of the distinctive strengths of most collections. A useful, centralized source for current information  on seminaries and their libraries is [https://web.archive.org/web/20070720224744/http://www.atla.com/tsig/catalogs/onlineindex.html American Theological Library Association index]\n\nAs the 21st century begins, it is fair to say that the legacy remains strong, but the structure which supports it is showing signs of strain.\n\nFor example:\n*Decline in church membership within many denominations.\n*The smaller number of students in seminary (and the tuition revenue they contribute).\n*The steadily increasing costs of adding to collections, which makes it difficult for all but a few libraries to maintain acquisitions budgets.\n*The rapid incursion of Communications Technology and Electronic Resources is beginning to call into question the continued need for  physical library collections.\n*The growing demand for distance-learning programs pushes the seminary to reconfigure the way it offers access to course materials.\n\nNo one can predict what effect these developments might have on theological libraries in the 21st Century.  In cases where the parent institutions have found it impossible to remain in operation, libraries have been sold intact or dispersed. Where there are a number of reasonably compatible schools in a specific area, on some occasions libraries have been merged outright, or retained separate libraries but established a consortial arrangement. In the latter case, efficiencies result from reciprocal borrowing privileges and from avoiding duplicate acquisitions where possible.\n\nIt seems a foregone conclusion that there will be further such retrenchments in the coming years, quite likely on a more widespread basis. With trends like these emerging in recent years, the role of the [[American Theological Library Association]] (founded 1947) has been of vital importance.  The primary function of the association has been to offer coordination and support of theological library activity in the US and Canada.\n\nATLA's other notable contributions have been the development and production of the Religion Indexes (1949 ff.) in print and more recently in electronic versions, its preservation initiatives in assembling core theological collections in microform (1973 and after).\n\nThe most recent initiative from ATLA has been the ATLAS serials project, which will bring fifty key theological periodicals to market in an alternative, electronic format.  ATLA has ongoing relationships with sister agencies, such as the CONSEIL (International Council of Theological Library Associations) and ANZTLA (Australian and New Zealand Theological Library Association).\n\n==The twentieth century and beyond: growth, retrenchment, redefinition==\n\nDepending upon one's perspective, trends during the 20th century can be seen as evidence of a bright or an uncertain future for theological libraries.\n\nIn Europe, by the end of the 19th century theological education and training for the ministry had come almost universally under the auspices of the universities. Among other things this usually meant the demise of discrete theological collections within separate facilities, though this did not necessarily mean the devaluation of such collections. Indeed, it is fair to say that as the 20th century opened, not only the finest theological collections but the most erudite and distinguished centers of theological research were in Germany and in Britain (Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen, G\u00f6ttingen, Berlin, Oxford and Cambridge, to name only a few).\n\nWhat no one could have predicted was the devastation brought by wars, from the beginning to the end of the century. The [[University of Nancy]] in France lost its library in 1914, as did [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain|Louvain]] in the same year. Great libraries of theology at Monte Cassino, at Dresden, and at Caen were wrecked in 1944. As recently as 1992 the state library at Sarajevo fell victim to a rocket attack. The numerical losses here and elsewhere were high: Hamburg and Frankfurt each lost 600,000 vols., W\u00fcrzburg 350,000, and so on.\n\nPolitical as well as military upheavals have had an adverse effect on European theological library collections and activity. Libraries in Eastern Europe illustrate this vividly: collection priorities in places such as Jena, Rostock and Leipzig could hardly be said to have been favorable to theological research during the years 1945-1990. Moreover, since the reunification of the two German states, the massive amounts of money and personnel which it would take to bring theological collections back to acceptable standards has not been easy to come by.<ref>Harris, ''History'', p. 215</ref> Nevertheless, these challenging conditions have led to significant co-operation between libraries, particularly through [[BETH \u2013 European Theological Libraries|BETH]] - the European Theology Libraries Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theo.kuleuven.be/apps/press/beth/about-beth-2/history/|title=History {{!}} BETH|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>\n\nOf all Continental theological collections, few managed to navigate the various catastrophes of the century better than the [[Vatican Library]]. Steadily enriched by a sequence of outstanding gifts over several centuries, even the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Era did little lasting harm. By the end of the 19th century the library encompassed close to half a million books, and tens of thousands of manuscripts. Several of the Popes ([[Leo XIII]] and [[Pius XI]]) have taken a keen and active interest in the library, and great effort and expense has been taken to ensure that the collections not only continue to grow but are well cared-for. Like many of Europe's great theological libraries, bibliographic searching is now enabled globally via the Internet. Increasingly, well-financed libraries such as the Vatican's are working aggressively to develop plans for uploading digital versions of some of their treasures (most often archival materials) onto web-servers.\n\n==Summary==\n\nThis overview has demonstrated that the role and function of theological libraries have always been characterized by continuity amid turmoil, resourcefulness amid frequently inadequate resources, and advocacy of that which is of lasting value within a setting of constant ecclesiastical, societal and political change.  In the words of Cassiodorus:\n\nWe aim  both to preserve what is old and to build something new; we desire to raise up things that are modern without diminishing the works of our ancestors. (cited in Southern, 169)\n\nOnly on very rare occasions have the legacy and contributions of theological libraries been noticed, and then usually long after the fact. (Thomas Cahill's ''[[How the Irish Saved Civilization]]'' provides a pleasant exception.)   But lasting acclaim is quite beside the point:  from Pamphilius of Caesarea onward, theological libraries have most often been energized by the efforts of those who savor a degree of anonymity.\n\nThe \u201cAge of Information\u201d is commonly considered as posing a dire threat (or at least a plausible alternative) to the perpetuity of printed texts and paper-based library collections.  But of course it also holds out the promise of unprecedented collaboration between the excellent collections and the astute librarians who work in them.  Hence there is reason for hope that the best days for theological libraries are not in the past but in the future.\n\n{{cite encyclopedia\n  | last = Stewart\n  | first = David\n  | title = Christian Libraries\n  | encyclopedia = International Dictionary of Library Histories\n  | volume = 1\n  | pages = 48\u201354\n  | publisher = Fitzroy Dearborn\n  | location = London\n  | year = 2001 }}\n\n\n==List of Online Christian Libraries==\n*[https://www.vatlib.it/home.php?ling=eng&res=1920x1080'' The Vatican Library''] \n*[http://www.prdl.org/'' The Post-Reformation Digital Library''] \n*[http://oll.libertyfund.org/groups/128'' Online Library of Liberty'']  \n*[http://www.ntslibrary.com'' The NTS Library''] \n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160112082435/http://ccel.us/ '' The Evangelical Christian Library''] \n*[http://thelibraryofthesaints.is'' The Library of the Saints'']{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*Stewart, David (2001) \"From Then to Now: a brief historical survey of the American Theological Library Association\".

Like Judaism, [[Christianity]] depends fundamentally on the preservation and study of a [[sacred text]]. From this it follows that the texts and the secondary literature will be collected for the use of the literate members of the religious communities and passed on to succeeding generations.\n\n==Early Christian libraries==\nThe integral relationship between [[Christianity]] and its texts has always ensured a central place for books, for learning, and for libraries among Christians. The passing of two millennia has witnessed changes in the manner and intensity of Christian scholarship, yet it has always been the case that [[theology|theological]] learning is inconceivable without libraries and librarians doing the work both of collecting the theological insights of the past and anticipating future theological and religious trends.\n\nThe establishment of the [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|Christian canon]] has classically been a subject of central interest to the Christian religion (though in more recent years it has become a special study for theologians and textual critics). It also has a direct bearing on the origins of Christian libraries. As preliminary consensus in the formation of a canon was arrived at, [[Early Christianity|early Christian communities]] would typically entrust to a member of the community the task of providing care and security for those documents that authentically represented the identity and cohesion of each community in this upstart (and frequently embattled) religion.\n\nThe impulse to keep valued texts and documents safe but accessible shaped the patterns of early collections, and the first recorded mention of early Christian library activity comes down to us from a context of hostility. Under the Emperor [[Diocletian]] (3rd-century), a series of edicts against the Christians included orders that Christian books be seized and destroyed. From this it can reasonably be inferred that it was typical for a local Christian assembly to possess a collection of texts of one kind or another, and that the authorities considered the destruction of such materials to be an essential part of suppressing the Christian faith.\n\n===The library at Jerusalem===\nBishop [[Alexander of Jerusalem]] established a library during his tenure (first half of the 3rd century): this is known from the records of an actual \u201creader\u201d, [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], who mentions some of the works he found there. Possibly Alexander's library had as its model the notable Classical collection of [[Alexandria]]: it may be that while still in the Egyptian city, [[Origen]] encouraged his student Alexander to initiate a center for study in [[Jerusalem]].\n\n===The library at Caesarea===\nOrigen had a hand also in the establishment of the early Christian library of greatest renown, that at [[Caesarea]], based on his own private collection. The great [[Jerome]] was later associated with this library, although a lot of the specific library work appears to have been the task of [[Pamphilus of Caesarea|Pamphilus]] who, according to Jerome, \u201csearched throughout the world for examples that were true and eternal monuments of gifted writers.\u201d <ref>Gamble, ''Books'', 156</ref> Through these efforts, the library grew to include thousands of volumes, a staggering accomplishment when one considers the labor involved in copying by hand. The breadth and quality of this collection is attested by the range of sources cited by Eusebius, who relied on this library in research for his works. Primary collections included all the works of Origen, as well as contemporaries such as [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Sulpicius Apollinaris|Apollinaris]], [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], [[Irenaeus]], and virtually all the important ecclesiastical writers of the period. Since the library performed the critical functions of copying, revising and gathering texts into usable selections, scriptural texts were present in abundance.\n\nPreservation issues also presented themselves: we have record of there having been projects to \u201cconvert\u201d the library (or at least its most heavily used segments) from papyrus to parchment.  It needs to be emphasized that Caesarea's was, in almost every modern sense, principally a research rather than a congregational or liturgical library.  In this setting ambitious critical works were housed, and ever more ambitious and critical works were written, and it would be some time before any Christian library again rose to the standard set in Caesarea.  (Regrettably, we cannot be certain what became of the collection, except that it is lost almost without a trace).\n\n===The library at Alexandria===\nOf a specifically Christian library in Alexandria (as distinct from the renowned Classical [[library of Alexandria]] of earlier centuries) less is known. Given the prominence of the city within the Greek world of letters, it is quite possible that authoritative teaching figures such as [[Pantaenus]] and Clement put their personal libraries at the disposal of students, and that over time a Christian library took shape.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n===The early library of the Bishop of Rome===\nIt was not until the 4th and 5th centuries,  when political conditions permitted,  that \u201cepiscopal\u201d libraries took shape in [[Rome]], situated in the [[Lateran Palace]]. Here were housed not only theological works, but, in keeping with the administrative function, archives as well.\n\n===The library at Hippo Regius===\nOf all the Christian libraries in the West in the first six centuries, we know most about the library at [[Hippo Regius|Hippo]], home of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. No distinction is made in the contemporary accounts between his personal library and that of the church, so it is probable that the two were housed together <ref>Gamble, 167</ref> The librarian recorded over a thousand items under Augustine's personal authorship, and the collection is certain to have included scriptural books, the works of other Latin and Greek Christian writers, and a rich selection of \u201csecular\u201d works.  We know that the collection was fully catalogued (perhaps Augustine himself had a hand in this), but along with the rest of the collection this index is lost.\n\n===Further development===\nWhen it was safe to do so, Christianity made the most of the accomplishments of Roman civilization with respect to books and libraries: if the possession of a well-stocked library was considered an enviable adornment to a Roman house, it is probable that a similar element of prestige was conferred on those Christian gathering places which possessed the premier collections of letters and texts. [[Jerome]] (4th and 5th century), for example, was able to assume that wherever there was a congregation, books would be found. In the course of things, those churches that became regional administrative centers tended to develop the best collections.\n\n===The Near East===\nOf early Christian libraries in the East, far less is known.  The Imperial Library of [[Constantinople]] encompassed at its peak over 100,000 items but in no sense was it primarily  a theological library.\n\n==Libraries in the monastic setting==\n\nThe earliest examples come from Egypt. Monasteries under the direction of [[Pachomius]] (4th century) and [[Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite|Shenouda]] (5th century) required that members learn to read, and it was further expected that they would borrow and study texts from the community's collection. (Twentieth-century archeological discoveries\u2014Phobaimmon and [[Nag Hammadi]], for example\u2013-have indicated that there was a tremendous amount of activity in writing and copying texts, and one library \u201ccatalog\u201d from the period lists eighty titles.)  Collections were composed of biblical texts, lectionaries, church canons, hagiography/biography, etc.\n\nIn [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christendom]],  monastic libraries developed on a similar pattern.  \u201cCatalogs\u201d were simply inventories of items held by the community.  On those rare occasions when a community's benefactor would donate their personal collection, the tendency was not to dispose of questionable or even heretical works:  given the short supply of texts, almost any item would be considered a \u201crare book.\u201d  The common practice in monastic life was for the abbot (or equivalent) to be charged with the responsibility for securing and caring for the collection.\n\nIt is from southern Italy that we receive the most enduring image of early Christian (and monastic) libraries and librarianship, in the person of [[Cassiodorus]].  Like no one else of his time, he leaves us a compendious work of bibliography, the Institituiones divinarum et saecularum litterarum (Institutes of Divine and Secular Literature), which surveys first Christian and then secular texts, providing notes and commentary along the way.   An earlier attempt at Rome to establish a theological school had been frustrated, and so on his family's estate at Calabria he established the \u201cVivarium\u201d, as a setting in which \u201cto incorporate systematic theological study into monastic life.\u201d  (Gamble, 1990)  With this in view he assembled a large library of both Christian and Classical texts and designed a curriculum of study.  He undertook his monastic and bibliographic work only after a long and well-rewarded career in the service of the [[Goths]], and hence the work we remember him for can be seen as aspiring  \u201cto combat the growing chaos of the world\u201d (Southern, \u201c Benedictine,\u201d 167). We learn from the Institutiones how he had these sub-collections housed, what they included, together with how they were obtained.\n\n==The Later Middle Ages==\n\nCassiodorus may have been aware of  the inception of the library at [[Monte Cassino]] under the influence of [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict]]  (LeJay and Otten, \u201cCassiodorus.\u201d)  In any event, with the Imperial City increasingly under attack, the locus of library activity shifted increasingly to the rural monastic houses.  Benedict supported and energized the place of the library in the community by  delegating one or two senior brothers to walk on \u201cpatrol\u201d at a set hour, to ensure that no one is engaged in idle chatter, rather than being diligent in his reading.  (Thurston, \u201cLibraries,\u201d   228-32.)\n\nDuring the succeeding centuries, such libraries played an increasingly strategic role in defending the tradition of learning from decay, pillage, and even disappearance.  By the standards of the later Middle Ages, a monastery collection numbering more than a thousand would have been considered very large. Quality and utility rather than mass were most to be desired.  Catalogs varied in complexity and in volume, and \u201cchained books\u201d were common enough to indicate that security was a lively concern.\n\nWe know a little about the physical design of some libraries of the period from extant documents.  Typically a large, pillared hall would serve as a reading room, with built-in cupboards to store the books.  Carrels for study were often set around the perimeter to utilize available light.  An additional floor might house a [[scriptorium]].\n\nThe same period saw the flowering of monastic libraries in Britain. Once the Roman occupation ended in the mid-Fifth century, [[Columba]] founded the meditation and copying center at Iona off the coast of Scotland.  A century later witnessed the arrival of [[Augustine of Canterbury]], sent to England by [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]], and this set in motion the establishment of greater conformity to the will of Rome on the part of the English church.  A side-effect of this harmony was a marked increase in monastic library development in England, and a key figure in this maturing was [[Benedict Biscop]] of Wearmouth on the North Sea Coast.  In the tradition of Pamphilius and Cassiodorus, Biscop traveled far to get the works he required:  \u201che sought [books] where they were best to be found among the desolate remains of ancient civilization in Italy.\u201d  (Southern, 168)  Most importantly, what he retrieved from the Continent contained everything that was necessary for understanding the main outlines of the Christian learning of the ancient world (Southern, 168).  The perfect testimony to the value of his diligent endeavors is that they  supported the scholarship of [Bede], \u201cthe greatest example of Benedictine scholarship and of the use to which a Benedictine library can be put.\u201d  (Southern, 170)\n\nThe rise of [[university|universities]] and their libraries was energized greatly by bequests:  Bp. [[Robert Grosseteste]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] to [[university of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Robert de Sorbon]] to the [[University of Paris]], etc.  The emerging university libraries, small though they may have been at first, rapidly assumed a different function than the monastic libraries.  Research activity, rather than copying and preservation, predominated.  And it is fair to say that the advent of  new technology - the printing press - in the late 14th century helped take this distinction (the beginnings of a \u201cdemand\u201d model) still further.\n\nIn France, prior to 1200 all of the major theological schools had all grown up in the environs of cathedrals:  [[St. Victor's Abbey, Paris|St. Victor]], [[Biblioth\u00e8que Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve|Ste. Genevieve]], [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]].  This association of the cathedral and academy proved to have a decisive influence in determining both where and how theological research and education were to be carried out for centuries to come.\n\nBy 1500 there were between 75 and 85 universities in Western Europe.  Most began without formal libraries, but over the course of time the user of private tutors\u2019 collections in faculties of theology and elsewhere gave way to more methodical and sustainable collection schemes.\n\n==Early Modern Europe==\n\n===The Renaissance===\nIf the later Middle Ages were characterized by the \u201crescue and preservation\u201d of Christian texts by monastics on the fringes of the world, the [[Renaissance]] (14th-17th centuries) was an era of recovery. It is doubtful whether the history of Western Civilization has ever seen, before or since, such a hunger for ancient texts and their contents. Admittedly, this appetite was more for Greek and Latin classical texts than for Christian works, but the general effect was a positive one for libraries.\n\nThe advent of the [[printing press]] had a direct and rapid effect on libraries, for it offered not only the prospect of more copies of more volumes being on the market, but made the unprecedented range of available editions a consideration: \u201cthe desired classics were appearing in versions more reliable than their predecessors because of the Humanist scholarship, and far more stable once in print than anything the manuscript age could have produced.\u201d<ref>Jackson, ''Libraries'', p. 112</ref>\n\nThis change-of-focus showed itself first in Italy: [[Petrarch]], [[Boccacio]], [[Salutati]] and others rediscovered, aggressively collected, and copied manuscripts from all-but-lost collections during the 14th century. Significantly, when this appetite turned into something of a \u201cgold-rush\u201d, it was almost invariably to places such as the Benedictine library of [[Monte Cassino]] where text-hunters turned. For economic and other reasons, Florence became the center of such activity.  Across Europe the focus for library expansion and activity became the royal or princely libraries:  aggressive activity in collecting, gathering and protecting texts from their scattered locations was characterized by individuals rather than churches or even universities.\n\nThe greatest of these book-hunters were personal agents of wealthy noblemen. Perhaps this is why the greatest legacy for theological librarianship of this essentially humanist cultural movement was the effect it had on the [[Vatican Library]]. Its earlier collection had been dispersed during the [[Avignon Papacy|interval]] at [[Avignon]], so that on his accession [[Pope Nicholas V|Pope Nicholas]] found only 350 volumes extant. The library of the Vatican was brought back to health essentially as a combination of personal library collections, such as that of the [[Duke of Urbino]] (1120 volumes added to the Vatican Library after his death).\n\nIn the Low Countries and in England the effect of the Renaissance was somewhat different: [[Erasmus]] in Rotterdam was not only a fine and aggressive collector in his own right, but with great erudition brought together the best of the specifically Christian tradition with the emergent [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] of the Continent. The effects of such efforts on the Reformation period and beyond are impossible to calculate.\n\n===The Protestant Reformation===\nThe turmoil generated by the English monarchy's break with Rome in the 16th century had a devastating effect on theological library collections. In Yorkshire alone, for example, under the aegis of various religious orders, there may have been more than fifty abbeys, priories, etc., each of them having at least a modest library. Yet within the space of little more than a generation, this whole structure was crudely dismantled. State-authorized visitations during the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Edward VI]] meant the break-up of collections not only in the monasteries but also at the universities as well.<ref>Cross, \u201dMonastic,\u201d p. 256</ref> Insofar as this process was guided by any principle, it was to suppress that which was medieval and to elevate that which was Classical and Humanist in character. In large measure this had the desired effects of cutting British libraries loose from the literary tradition associated with Rome, and of turning interest toward the Anglo-Saxon church. There is some evidence that the abrupt \u201cchange of fashion\u201d in theological literature and learning brought in by the Henrician Reformation had the curious effect of extracting significant portions of monastic collections from purely religious surroundings. So quickly did materials intrinsic to the Catholic tradition become devalued (the monarchy was aggressive and quite ruthless in moving the Church in the direction of Protestant humanism) that it was not uncommon for displaced monks, friars and abbots to be able to take with them, gratis, items from monastic libraries.\n\nAdditionally, some private collectors ([[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], [[Matthew Parker]], [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]], etc.) were able to save some of the monastic holdings from destruction.<ref>Clement, ''Renaissance Libraries'', p. 551</ref> It was in the spirit of such private generosity that efforts to overturn the Reformation's more destructive impulses that moved [[Thomas Bodley]] to help re-establish the [[Bodleian Library|library at Oxford]].\n\nSimilar currents can be observed in the Continental Reformation, with some books taken from the monasteries moved to [[Lutheran Churches of the Reformation|Lutheran churches]]. A more enduring effect was the shift of surviving monastic collections to the universities. Many universities which were founded in the 16th century had their libraries enriched tremendously by works taken from Dominican and Jesuit libraries, especially. Leipzig's collection, for example, received 1,500 manuscripts and 4,000 printed books in this fashion. Basel received the contents of both the city's cathedral library and a nearby Dominican library. This can hardly have been what the monks and scribes had in mind amid their earlier toils, but at least the works lived on in active use. Many libraries suffered damage or disruption  during the [[Thirty Years\u2019 War]] in the 17th century, but in general the 17th and 18th centuries were a period of remarkable growth in theological collections of Continental Europe: again, the uniform trend was away from the cloisters and into the academy.\n\n===The Enlightenment===\n\n====Great Britain====\nReligious dissent in England had the effect of prompting some dissenters to leave for America, where their views on Church, State and education found expression in new colleges. Many of those who remained in England found themselves denied access to the universities by the [[Act of Uniformity (disambiguation)|Acts of Uniformity]] (1549 and after). Their response was to found their own \u201cacademies\u201d, 35 of which were established between 1680 and 1780. Library resources for these schools were chiefly supplied by the private collections of the academies\u2019 benefactors.\n\nDuring the same time period were also established endowed libraries for the use of parishioners.  In this case it appears that literature was made available to keep readers from lapsing into the \u201ceasy moral ways\u201d thought to be characteristic of the Restoration era.\n\nThe labors of Rev. [[Thomas Bray]] demonstrate how far a  \u201cphilanthropic\u201d vision for Christian libraries could sometimes extend. It came to Bray's attention that many ministers, both Anglican and Dissenting, in Britain and in the Colonies, simply lacked the means to procure theological books, and were effectively consigned to rural parishes where they were not within reasonable distance of books to borrow. The result was the formulation of \u201cParochial and Lending Libraries\u201d.  He drafted a six-page list of titles to be included, and aimed to set up such a collection for every deanery in England,<ref>Jackson, p. 208</ref> and appealed for donations of books and money to the aristocracy.  Eventually the [[SPCK]] (which he helped found late in the 17th century) thought well enough of the enterprise to undertake its sponsorship.\n\nThe new idea of a regional, or even a lending library of theological literature was taken even further by a Non-Conformist Scot, [[James Kirkwood (Church of Scotland)|James Kirkwood]], who proposed the support of such ventures with a property tax. Kirkwood won the support of the scientist [[Robert Boyle]] for the translation and distribution of Gaelic Bible translations in the north of Scotland. In this formerly deprived region he also helped establish 77 \u201clending libraries\u201d in the early decades of the 18th century.\n\n====France====\nBy contrast, the paroxysm that rocked France at the end of the 18th century was felt first by the libraries of the Jesuits. Whether impelled by the jealousy of other orders, or whether anti-clerical sentiment was simply an explosion looking for a place to occur, the Jesuits took the brunt. A series of edicts meant to rein in their influence and holdings culminated with the actual dissolution of the order in 1773. Most French universities, having close ties with the Church, did not survive the Revolution. As was the case in the Reformation, their book and manuscript collections were dispersed mostly to university or private libraries, in Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck, etc.\n\nThe French Revolution brought similar changes to ecclesiastical libraries, though there seemed to be a more overtly destructive impulse at the root of changes. The idea was to confiscate collections and redistribute them for the benefit of the public. One contemporary estimate put the number of books seized at 12 million.<ref>Jackson, 275</ref>  The urge to protect one's own literary property had its effect once again, however, and many of the items made their way into clandestine or private collections.\n\n==North American seminary libraries==\n\n===Origin and development===\nTheological collections had almost always been a component part, often indeed the central part, of cathedral or university libraries.  In North America this situation was altered forever by several factors:\n\n1. After the Enlightenment, theology was reassessed to the status of one subject of inquiry among many, rather than retaining its place as the \u201cQueen of the Sciences\".\n2. Emigration to American afforded the opportunity to reconsider the entire system of theological education.\n3. In North America, theological education would no longer be driven, dominated or informed by a state church. Other factors \u2013 new schools of thought as well as \u201cmarket forces\u201d, personal philanthropy, etc. - would play a stronger role than previously.<ref>Endy, \"Theology and Learning in Early America,\u201d in: Henry, ''Schools of Thought'', pp. 125-51</ref>\n\nIt is true that the idea of an independent seminary had occasional antecedents in Europe, but the model that emerged in America was in almost every respect unique. Harvard and Yale and other colleges were established for the training of clergy, but at the time this was not considered to be a specialized and professional education. The lines of demarcation between secular and theological learning were not clear. Of the 400 books donated by [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] shortly after the founding of the [[Harvard University|college]], about two thirds were theological, and since the collection's growth depended largely on donations from clergy, this proportion did not change rapidly. The Harvard \u201cshelf-list\u201d was compared with a recommended-list of the time, [[Richard Baxter]]\u2019s Christian Directory, which indicated that the collection at Harvard was at best meager. (Baxter, as well as [[Samuel Willard]]\u2019s ''Brief Directions to a Young Scholar'', [[Cotton Mather]]'s\u2019 ''Manductio ad Ministerium'', ''Directions for a Candidate of the Ministry'', and [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]\u2019s ''The Preacher, as Discourse ... to which is added a Catalogue of Some Authors were some of the conspectuses for theological literature which were used at the time''.)\n\nIn 18th-century America, consensus on theology and theological training came under considerable strain. Traditionally, it was thought that theological training was best carried out through a rigorous program in academic subjects. But revivalist trends outside the academy and theological ferment within it led to increasing distrust.\n\nThe option of personal apprenticeship in the home of a respected clergyman\u2014what came to be called the \u201cSchools of the Prophets\u201d\u2013-grew in popularity in the aftermath of the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1740 and after) [[Joseph Bellamy]] of Bethlehem, CT, was probably the best example: his personal library consisted of approximately 100 books and at least 350 pamphlets (an essential medium for \u201cbroadcasting\u201d sermons at the time). There is some irony in the fact that, though it removed many of the best divinity students from the academy, this \u201cunorthodox\u201d approach produced more than its share of highly learned pastors, on the strength of the erudition of the \"Prophets\u201d, the power of example, and perhaps sometimes of the quality of their personal libraries.\n\nThis \u201cun-orthodox\u201d trend in the training of Protestant ministers helped prepare the ground for another development in theological libraries: the institution of \u201cfree-standing\u201d schools of theology. Some of these ([[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]]) remained affiliated with the original colleges, others ([[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary|Pittsburgh]]) became independent entities. But what is of signal importance in all cases is that here were assembled collections for theology and divinity and nothing else. Again, donations of private theological collections provided the foundation <ref>Hadidian, \u201cSeminary,\u201d pp. 220 ff.</ref>  Several seminary libraries were formed on this basis by the end of the 18th century (New Brunswick, Service Seminary in PA, St. Mary's-Baltimore). The first part of the 19th century saw excellent theological collections being gathered at Andover (later merged with the Harvard Divinity Collection), [[Hartford]] (sold much later to [[Candler School of Theology]] at [[Emory University]]), Yale, Auburn/[[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union in New York]], [[Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School|Colgate-Rochester]] (and subsequent mergers from [[Bexley Hall]] and [[Crozer Theological Seminary]]), [[General Theological Seminary|General]], [[Drew University|Drew]], Princeton, Gettysburg, St. Charles Borromeo,  etc. In the Midwest, the [[St. Mary of the Lake Seminary]] was founded in 1844, and on the west coast what is now the [[Pacific School of Religion]] came into existence in 1866.\n\n===Situation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries===\n\nIn North America, both denominational and non-denominational schools of theology had seen remarkable proliferation by the middle of the 19th century. When, in 1924, the first comprehensive study of ministerial education was undertaken, 161 Protestant schools were listed. This number had increased to 224 only a decade later. In his important survey of theological libraries in 1930, Yale's Raymond Morris indicated that theological libraries ranged in collections from a few hundred volumes up to almost 200,000. This was impressive numerical growth, but he found that libraries were almost always under-supported financially, with repercussions being felt in collections, facilities and staffing.<ref>Morris, ''Libraries'', pp. 149-91</ref>\n\nWithin the Catholic communion in North America, growth patterns had also been phenomenal. An overview in 1960 listed 93 diocesan seminaries (50 considered \u201cmajor\u201d), as well as 294 \u201chouses of study\u201d, with a total of almost 20,000 students in preparation.<ref>Harrington. ''Catholic'', pp.  155-57</ref> While at that time none of the Catholic collections were on the same scale as the largest Protestant libraries, many contained more than 100,000 items.\n\nIt is clear now that by the time the surveys by Beach and Harrington were carried out (1960), a watershed had been crossed, and that demographics of theological education and of church attendance were in the process of rapid change. Among Catholic seminaries, the number of candidates for the priesthood has fallen drastically in the past thirty years (by 2/3, according to some estimates). On the Protestant side, while the overall number of students has remained strong, at the same time attendance patterns have been in sharp decline, and this has drastically reduced the number of graduates who end up serving in parishes. The second half of the 20th century contrasted sharply with the first, and the number of theological colleges and libraries had grown too quickly and too broadly to correspond with trends in the last three decades of the century. This has posed enormous, complex challenges for seminaries and their librarians: serious dislocation, and too many unevenly distributed schools.\n\n===The Character of present-day collections===\n\nThe magnificent wealth of resources now in evidence is the result of a complex and lengthy development process.  Which is another way of saying that there have been slightly different routes taken to attain the caliber enjoyed by many collections today.  Some have relied principally on rapid denominational growth (which generated demand for clergy and brought in funding required from denominations and benefactors); some have prospered from the skill and vision of exceptional library leadership; some libraries have built their reputations on exquisite collections purchased and then donated by private individuals; still others have excelled in cultivating niche collections or services.\n\nThe individual collections are unique, and the product of many sets of circumstances, so summarizing adequately here would be difficult. (Though dated, earlier overviews by Allison, Walker, Gapp, and Hadidian still provide useful outlines of the distinctive strengths of most collections. A useful, centralized source for current information  on seminaries and their libraries is [https://web.archive.org/web/20070720224744/http://www.atla.com/tsig/catalogs/onlineindex.html American Theological Library Association index]\n\nAs the 21st century begins, it is fair to say that the legacy remains strong, but the structure which supports it is showing signs of strain.\n\nFor example:\n*Decline in church membership within many denominations.\n*The smaller number of students in seminary (and the tuition revenue they contribute).\n*The steadily increasing costs of adding to collections, which makes it difficult for all but a few libraries to maintain acquisitions budgets.\n*The rapid incursion of Communications Technology and Electronic Resources is beginning to call into question the continued need for  physical library collections.\n*The growing demand for distance-learning programs pushes the seminary to reconfigure the way it offers access to course materials.\n\nNo one can predict what effect these developments might have on theological libraries in the 21st Century.  In cases where the parent institutions have found it impossible to remain in operation, libraries have been sold intact or dispersed. Where there are a number of reasonably compatible schools in a specific area, on some occasions libraries have been merged outright, or retained separate libraries but established a consortial arrangement. In the latter case, efficiencies result from reciprocal borrowing privileges and from avoiding duplicate acquisitions where possible.\n\nIt seems a foregone conclusion that there will be further such retrenchments in the coming years, quite likely on a more widespread basis. With trends like these emerging in recent years, the role of the [[American Theological Library Association]] (founded 1947) has been of vital importance.  The primary function of the association has been to offer coordination and support of theological library activity in the US and Canada.\n\nATLA's other notable contributions have been the development and production of the Religion Indexes (1949 ff.) in print and more recently in electronic versions, its preservation initiatives in assembling core theological collections in microform (1973 and after).\n\nThe most recent initiative from ATLA has been the ATLAS serials project, which will bring fifty key theological periodicals to market in an alternative, electronic format.  ATLA has ongoing relationships with sister agencies, such as the CONSEIL (International Council of Theological Library Associations) and ANZTLA (Australian and New Zealand Theological Library Association).\n\n==The twentieth century and beyond: growth, retrenchment, redefinition==\n\nDepending upon one's perspective, trends during the 20th century can be seen as evidence of a bright or an uncertain future for theological libraries.\n\nIn Europe, by the end of the 19th century theological education and training for the ministry had come almost universally under the auspices of the universities. Among other things this usually meant the demise of discrete theological collections within separate facilities, though this did not necessarily mean the devaluation of such collections. Indeed, it is fair to say that as the 20th century opened, not only the finest theological collections but the most erudite and distinguished centers of theological research were in Germany and in Britain (Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen, G\u00f6ttingen, Berlin, Oxford and Cambridge, to name only a few).\n\nWhat no one could have predicted was the devastation brought by wars, from the beginning to the end of the century. The [[University of Nancy]] in France lost its library in 1914, as did [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain|Louvain]] in the same year. Great libraries of theology at Monte Cassino, at Dresden, and at Caen were wrecked in 1944. As recently as 1992 the state library at Sarajevo fell victim to a rocket attack. The numerical losses here and elsewhere were high: Hamburg and Frankfurt each lost 600,000 vols., W\u00fcrzburg 350,000, and so on.\n\nPolitical as well as military upheavals have had an adverse effect on European theological library collections and activity. Libraries in Eastern Europe illustrate this vividly: collection priorities in places such as Jena, Rostock and Leipzig could hardly be said to have been favorable to theological research during the years 1945-1990. Moreover, since the reunification of the two German states, the massive amounts of money and personnel which it would take to bring theological collections back to acceptable standards has not been easy to come by.<ref>Harris, ''History'', p. 215</ref> Nevertheless, these challenging conditions have led to significant co-operation between libraries, particularly through [[BETH \u2013 European Theological Libraries|BETH]] - the European Theology Libraries Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theo.kuleuven.be/apps/press/beth/about-beth-2/history/|title=History {{!}} BETH|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>\n\nOf all Continental theological collections, few managed to navigate the various catastrophes of the century better than the [[Vatican Library]]. Steadily enriched by a sequence of outstanding gifts over several centuries, even the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Era did little lasting harm. By the end of the 19th century the library encompassed close to half a million books, and tens of thousands of manuscripts. Several of the Popes ([[Leo XIII]] and [[Pius XI]]) have taken a keen and active interest in the library, and great effort and expense has been taken to ensure that the collections not only continue to grow but are well cared-for. Like many of Europe's great theological libraries, bibliographic searching is now enabled globally via the Internet. Increasingly, well-financed libraries such as the Vatican's are working aggressively to develop plans for uploading digital versions of some of their treasures (most often archival materials) onto web-servers.\n\n==Summary==\n\nThis overview has demonstrated that the role and function of theological libraries have always been characterized by continuity amid turmoil, resourcefulness amid frequently inadequate resources, and advocacy of that which is of lasting value within a setting of constant ecclesiastical, societal and political change.  In the words of Cassiodorus:\n\nWe aim  both to preserve what is old and to build something new; we desire to raise up things that are modern without diminishing the works of our ancestors. (cited in Southern, 169)\n\nOnly on very rare occasions have the legacy and contributions of theological libraries been noticed, and then usually long after the fact. (Thomas Cahill's ''[[How the Irish Saved Civilization]]'' provides a pleasant exception.)   But lasting acclaim is quite beside the point:  from Pamphilius of Caesarea onward, theological libraries have most often been energized by the efforts of those who savor a degree of anonymity.\n\nThe \u201cAge of Information\u201d is commonly considered as posing a dire threat (or at least a plausible alternative) to the perpetuity of printed texts and paper-based library collections.  But of course it also holds out the promise of unprecedented collaboration between the excellent collections and the astute librarians who work in them.  Hence there is reason for hope that the best days for theological libraries are not in the past but in the future.\n\n{{cite encyclopedia\n  | last = Stewart\n  | first = David\n  | title = Christian Libraries\n  | encyclopedia = International Dictionary of Library Histories\n  | volume = 1\n  | pages = 48\u201354\n  | publisher = Fitzroy Dearborn\n  | location = London\n  | year = 2001 }}\n\n\n==List of Online Christian Libraries==\n*[https://www.vatlib.it/home.php?ling=eng&res=1920x1080'' The Vatican Library''] \n*[http://www.prdl.org/'' The Post-Reformation Digital Library''] \n*[http://oll.libertyfund.org/groups/128'' Online Library of Liberty'']  \n*[http://www.ntslibrary.com'' The NTS Library''] \n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160112082435/http://ccel.us/ '' The Evangelical Christian Library''] \n*[http://thelibraryofthesaints.is'' The Library of the Saints'']{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*Stewart, David (2001) \"From Then to Now: a brief historical survey of the American Theological Library Association\".

The Articles of Confederation prohibited pacts intended to weaken the Confederation, Field said, and did not ban all pacts between states.<ref name=\"Wharton167\" /> Although provisions of the compact could be superseded by the Constitution, none of the operative articles of it were; in fact, Maryland, Virginia, and the United States government have all treated the compact as if it were still binding and enforceable.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 167-168.</ref> Field relied heavily on ''[[Virginia v. Tennessee]]'', 148 U.S. 503 (1893), decided in the prior term, in defining what a \"compact\" was and the extent of the Constitution's prohibition on them.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 168-171.</ref> But Field not only concluded that the Compact of 1785 was not in violation of the Articles of Confederation but also strongly asserted that the Constitution did not apply to those already in force at the time of its adoption:<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 171.</ref>\n\n:In our judgment, the Compact of 1785 was not prohibited by the Articles of Confederation. It was not a treaty, confederation, or alliance within the meaning of those terms as there used, and it remained as a subsisting operative contract between them, in full force, when the confederation went out of existence upon the adoption of the present Constitution of the United States, and it was not affected or set aside by the prohibitory clause of that instrument. Its prohibition extends only to future agreements or compacts, not against those already in existence, except so far as their stipulations might affect subjects placed under the control of Congress, such as commerce and the navigation of public waters, which is included under the power to regulate commerce. Furthermore, Field said, both states as recently as 1874 had agreed that the Compact of 1785 remained valid and in force.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 171-173.</ref>\n\nField now turned the Court's attention to the construction of the actual clauses contained in the compact. Field observed that Article 7 of the compact contained no reference to the Pocomoke, and so was irrelevant to the issue at hand.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 174.</ref> Article 8 likewise contained no relevant language, he said.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 174-175.</ref> Field rejected as wrongly decided ''Hendricks v. Commonwealth'', 75 Va. 939, (1882), a decision by the Virginia Court of Appeals (which gave equal fishing rights in the Potomac and Pocomoke), because that court drew its conclusion based on a mis-quoted Article 8.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 175-176.</ref> Lastly, Field noted that at no time was Pocomoke Sound ever considered merely a part of the Pocomoke River.  The two bodies of water were, at the time the compact was entered into, and for many years thereafter, considered distinct bodies of water, and Pocomoke Sound was not covered by the Compact of 1785.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 176-177.</ref>\n\nFinally, Field argued that the crime Wharton committed was a crime against the state of Virginia, not against one of her citizens. Since a crime against the state itself was not mentioned in the Compact of 1785, Virginia was entirely within her rights to try, convict, and punish Wharton.<ref name=\"Wharton177\">''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 177.</ref>\n\nThe writ of habeas corpus was denied.<ref name=\"Wharton177\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Sansonetti, Thomas and Quast, Sylvia. \"Not Just a Western Issue Anymore: Water Disputes in the Eastern United States.\" ''Cumberland Law Review.'' 34:185 (2003).\n*Wennersten, John R.

Tennessee]]'', 148 U.S. 503 (1893), decided in the prior term, in defining what a \"compact\" was and the extent of the Constitution's prohibition on them.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 168-171.</ref> But Field not only concluded that the Compact of 1785 was not in violation of the Articles of Confederation but also strongly asserted that the Constitution did not apply to those already in force at the time of its adoption:<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 171.</ref>\n\n:In our judgment, the Compact of 1785 was not prohibited by the Articles of Confederation. It was not a treaty, confederation, or alliance within the meaning of those terms as there used, and it remained as a subsisting operative contract between them, in full force, when the confederation went out of existence upon the adoption of the present Constitution of the United States, and it was not affected or set aside by the prohibitory clause of that instrument. Its prohibition extends only to future agreements or compacts, not against those already in existence, except so far as their stipulations might affect subjects placed under the control of Congress, such as commerce and the navigation of public waters, which is included under the power to regulate commerce. Furthermore, Field said, both states as recently as 1874 had agreed that the Compact of 1785 remained valid and in force.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 171-173.</ref>\n\nField now turned the Court's attention to the construction of the actual clauses contained in the compact. Field observed that Article 7 of the compact contained no reference to the Pocomoke, and so was irrelevant to the issue at hand.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 174.</ref> Article 8 likewise contained no relevant language, he said.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 174-175.</ref> Field rejected as wrongly decided ''Hendricks v. Commonwealth'', 75 Va. 939, (1882), a decision by the Virginia Court of Appeals (which gave equal fishing rights in the Potomac and Pocomoke), because that court drew its conclusion based on a mis-quoted Article 8.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 175-176.</ref> Lastly, Field noted that at no time was Pocomoke Sound ever considered merely a part of the Pocomoke River.  The two bodies of water were, at the time the compact was entered into, and for many years thereafter, considered distinct bodies of water, and Pocomoke Sound was not covered by the Compact of 1785.<ref>''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 176-177.</ref>\n\nFinally, Field argued that the crime Wharton committed was a crime against the state of Virginia, not against one of her citizens. Since a crime against the state itself was not mentioned in the Compact of 1785, Virginia was entirely within her rights to try, convict, and punish Wharton.<ref name=\"Wharton177\">''Wharton'', 153 U.S. at 177.</ref>\n\nThe writ of habeas corpus was denied.<ref name=\"Wharton177\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Sansonetti, Thomas and Quast, Sylvia. \"Not Just a Western Issue Anymore: Water Disputes in the Eastern United States.\" ''Cumberland Law Review.'' 34:185 (2003).\n*Wennersten, John R.
