The family was [[social stigma|stigmatized]] by the abandonment of the father and by the [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] status of the children under Argentine law, and was consequently somewhat isolated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/24/books/two-faces-of-evita.html|title=Two Faces of Evita|last=Jennings|first=Kate|access-date=16 August 2018|language=en}}</ref> A desire to expunge this part of her life might have been a motivation for Eva to arrange the destruction of her original birth certificate in 1945.<ref name=\"Borroni, Otelo 1970\"/>{{page needed|date=October 2015}}<ref name=\"Fraser 4\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:4).</ref>\n\nWhen Duarte suddenly died and his mistress and their children sought to attend his funeral, there was an unpleasant scene at the church gates.

In 1934, at the age of 15, Eva escaped her poverty-stricken village when she ran off with a young musician to the nation's capital of [[Buenos Aires]]. The young couple's relationship ended almost as quickly as it had begun, but Eva remained in Buenos Aires. She began to pursue jobs on the stage and the radio, and eventually became a film actress.

The city was especially overcrowded during this period because of the migrations caused by the [[Great Depression]]. On 28 March 1935, she had her professional debut in the play ''Mrs. Perez'' (''la Se\u00f1ora de P\u00e9rez''), at the Comedias Theater.\n\nIn 1936, Eva toured nationally with a theater company, worked as a model, and was cast in a few [[B-Movie|B-grade movie]] melodramas. In 1942, Eva experienced some economic stability when a company called ''Candilejas'' (sponsored by a soap manufacturer) hired her for a daily role in one of their radio dramas called ''Muy Bien'', which aired on ''Radio El Mundo'' (World Radio), the most important radio station in the country at that time.<ref name=\"Fraser 26\">Fraser & Navarro (p. 26)</ref> Later that year, she signed a five-year contract with ''Radio Belgrano'', which assured her a role in a popular historical-drama program called ''Great Women of History'', in which she played [[Elizabeth I of England]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]], and [[Alexandra of Hesse|the last Tsarina of Russia]]. Eventually, Eva Duarte came to co-own the radio company. By 1943, Eva Duarte was earning five or six thousand [[peso]]s a month, making her one of the highest-paid radio actresses in the nation. Pablo Raccioppi, who jointly ran ''Radio El Mundo'' with Eva Duarte, is said to have not liked her, but to have noted that she was \"thoroughly dependable\".<ref name=\"Fraser 27\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:27).</ref> Eva also had a short-lived film career, but none of the films in which she appeared were hugely successful. In one of her last films, ''[[La cabalgata del circo]]'' (''The Circus Cavalcade''), Eva played a young country girl who rivaled an older woman, the movie's star, [[Libertad Lamarque]].\n\nAs a result of her success with radio dramas and the films, Eva achieved some financial stability. In 1942, she was able to move into her apartment in the exclusive neighborhood of [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]], on 1567 Calle Posadas. The next year Eva began her career in politics, as one of the founders of the Argentine Radio Syndicate (ARA).<ref name=\"Borroni, Otelo 1970\"/>{{page needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Early relationship with Juan Per\u00f3n==\n[[File:Juan y Eva Oficial.jpg|thumb|left|Evita and Juan Per\u00f3n in 1947]][[File:Museo del Bicentenario - \"Retrato de Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n y Eva Duarte\", Numa Ayrinhac.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Official portrait of [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]] and Evita, by [[Numa Ayrinhac]] in 1948.

In response, Per\u00f3n, who was then the Secretary of Labour, established a fund to raise money to aid the victims. He devised a plan to have an \"artistic festival\" as a fundraiser, and invited radio and film actors to participate. After a week of fundraising, all participants met at a [[wiktionary:Gala|gala]] held at [[Estadio Luna Park|Luna Park Stadium]] in Buenos Aires to benefit earthquake victims. \n\nIt was at this gala, on 22 January 1944, that Eva Duarte first met Colonel [[Juan Per\u00f3n]].<ref name=\"Fraser 32-3\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:32\u201333).</ref> Eva promptly became the colonel's mistress.

Shortly after the formation of the union, Eva Duarte was elected its president. Fraser and Navarro speculate that Juan Per\u00f3n made the suggestion that performers create a union, and the other performers likely felt it was good politics to elect his mistress. Shortly after her election as president of the union, Eva Duarte began a daily program called ''Toward a Better Future,'' which dramatized, in soap opera form, the accomplishments of Juan Per\u00f3n. Often, Per\u00f3n's own speeches were played during the program. When she spoke, Eva Duarte spoke in ordinary language as a regular woman who wanted listeners to believe what she herself believed about Juan Per\u00f3n.<ref name=\"Fraser 43\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:43).</ref>\n\n==Rise to power==\n\n===Juan Per\u00f3n's arrest===\n{{History of Argentina}}\n[[File:17deoctubre-enlafuente.jpg|thumb|left|[[Loyalty Day (Argentina)|Demonstration]] for Per\u00f3n's release, on 17 October 1945. The [[Casa Rosada]] is seen in the background.]]\n\nBy early 1945, a group of Army officers called the GOU for \"[[United Officers' Group|Grupo de Oficiales Unidos]]\" (United Officers' Group), nicknamed \"The Colonels\", had gained considerable influence within the Argentine government. President [[Pedro Pablo Ram\u00edrez]] became wary of Juan Per\u00f3n's growing power within the government and was unable to curb that power. On 24 February 1944, Ram\u00edrez signed his own resignation paper, which Fraser and Navarro claim was drafted by Juan Per\u00f3n himself. [[Edelmiro Juli\u00e1n Farrell]], a friend of Juan Per\u00f3n, became President. Juan Per\u00f3n returned to his job as Labor Minister. Fraser and Navarro claim that, by this point, Per\u00f3n was the most powerful man in the Argentine government.<ref name=\"Fraser 39\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:39).</ref> On 9 October 1945 Juan Per\u00f3n was arrested by his opponents within the government who feared that, due to the strong support of the ''[[descamisados]]'', the workers and the poor of the nation, Per\u00f3n's popularity might eclipse that of the sitting president.\n\nSix days later, between 250,000 and 350,000 people gathered in front of the [[Casa Rosada]], Argentina's government house, to demand Juan Per\u00f3n's release, and their wish was granted. At 11 pm, Juan Per\u00f3n stepped onto the balcony of the Casa Rosada and addressed the crowd. Biographer Robert D. Crassweller claims that this moment was particularly powerful because it dramatically recalled important aspects of Argentine history. Crassweller writes that Juan Per\u00f3n enacted the role of a ''[[caudillo]]'' addressing his people in the tradition of Argentine leaders [[Juan Manuel de Rosas|Rosas]] and [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]. Crassweller also claims that the evening contained \"[[Mysticism|mystic]] [[overtones]]\" of a \"[[quasi]]-religious\" nature.<ref name=\"Crassweller 170-1\">Crassweller (1987:170\u20131).</ref>\nEva Per\u00f3n has often been credited with organizing the rally of thousands that freed Juan Per\u00f3n from prison on 17 October 1945. This version of events was popularized in the movie version of the [[Evita (musical)|Lloyd Webber musical]]; most historians agree that this version of events is unlikely.<ref>A&E (1996).</ref> At the time of Per\u00f3n's imprisonment, Eva was still merely an actress. She had no political clout with the various [[trade union|labor union]]s, and it is claimed that she was not well liked within Per\u00f3n's inner circle, nor was she liked by many within the film and radio business at this point. When Juan Per\u00f3n was imprisoned, Eva Duarte was suddenly disenfranchised. In reality, the massive rally that freed Per\u00f3n from prison was organized by the various unions, such as [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Labor Confederation]], or ''CGT'' as they came to be known. To this day, 17 October is something of a holiday for the [[Justicialist Party]] in Argentina (celebrated as ''D\u00eda de la Lealtad'', or \"[[Loyalty Day (Argentina)|Loyalty Day]]\"). What followed was shocking and nearly unheard of. Juan Per\u00f3n, the well-connected and politically rising star, married Eva. Despite Eva's childhood illegitimacy, and having an uncertain reputation, Per\u00f3n was in love with Eva, and her loyal devotion to him even while he had been under arrest touched him deeply, and so he married her, providing a respectability she had never known. Eva and Juan were married discreetly in a civil ceremony in [[Jun\u00edn, Buenos Aires|Jun\u00edn]] on 18 October 1945 and in a church wedding on 9 December 1945 in [[La Plata]].\n\n===1946 Presidential election victory===\nAfter his release from prison, Juan Per\u00f3n decided to campaign for the presidency of the nation, which he won in a landslide. Eva campaigned heavily for her husband during his 1946 presidential bid. Using her weekly radio show, she delivered powerful speeches with heavy [[populism|populist]] rhetoric urging the poor to align themselves with Per\u00f3n's movement.\n\n==European tour==\n[[File:Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|Per\u00f3n arrives in [[Madrid]].]]\n\nIn 1947, Eva embarked on a much-publicized \"Rainbow Tour\" of Europe, meeting with numerous dignitaries and heads of state, such as [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Pope Pius XII]]. Biographers Fraser and Navarro write that the tour had its genesis in an invitation that the Spanish leader had extended to Juan Per\u00f3n. For political reasons it was decided that Eva, rather than Juan Per\u00f3n, should make the visit. Fraser and Navarro write that Argentina had only recently emerged from its \"wartime quarantine\", thus taking its place in the United Nations and improving relations with the United States. Therefore, a visit to Franco, with [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Ant\u00f3nio Salazar of Portugal]], the last remaining Western European authoritarian leaders in power, would be diplomatically frowned upon internationally. Fraser and Navarro write that Eva made the decision that if Juan Per\u00f3n would not accept Franco's invitation for a state visit to Spain, then she would. Advisors then decided that Eva should visit many other European countries in addition to Spain. This would make it seem that Eva's sympathies were not specifically with [[Francoist Spain]] but with all of Europe. The tour was billed not as a political tour but as a non-political \"goodwill\" tour.<ref name=\"Fraser 88-9\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:88\u201389).</ref>\n\nEva was well received in Spain, where she visited the tombs of Spanish monarchs [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] in the [[Capilla Real de Granada]]. [[Francoist Spain]] had not recovered from the [[Spanish Civil War]] (the [[autarky|autarkic]] economy and the UN embargo meant that the country could not feed its people). During her visit to Spain, Eva handed out 100-[[Spanish peseta|peseta]] notes to many poor children she met on her journey. She also received from Franco the highest award given by the Spanish government, the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]].\n\nEva then visited Rome, where the reception was not as warm as it had been in Spain. Though [[Pope Pius XII]] did not give her a [[Papal Orders of Chivalry|Papal decoration]], she was allowed the time usually allotted to queens and was given a [[rosary]]. <!--And protests were held outside her hotel room. Some demonstrators claimed that Peronism was just another form of fascism.--><ref name=\"Fraser 89\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:89).</ref>\n\nHer next stop was France, where she was generally well received. She visited the [[Palace of Versailles]], among other sites. She also met with [[Charles de Gaulle]]. She promised France two shipments of wheat.\n\nWhile in France, Eva received word that [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] would not receive her when she planned to visit Britain, regardless of what his Foreign Office might advise,<ref>Alan Michie, God Save The Queen, p. ___ (1952)</ref> and that her visit would not be viewed as a state visit. Fraser and Navarro wrote that Eva regarded the royal family's refusal to meet her as a snub, and canceled the trip to the United Kingdom. Eva gave \"exhaustion\" as the official reason for not going on to Britain.\n[[File:Buenos Aires - Eva Per\u00f3n de gala en fundaci\u00f3n del Teatro Col\u00f3n.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Per\u00f3n wearing a dress designed by [[Christian Dior]]]]\n\nEva also visited Switzerland during her European tour, a visit that has been viewed as the worst part of the trip. According to the book ''Evita: A Biography'' by John Barnes, while she traveled down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough and, concluding the two-month tour, returned to Argentina.\n\nMembers of the Peronist opposition speculated that the true purpose of the European tour was to deposit funds in a [[Swiss bank account]]. \"The opposition in Buenos Aires\", write Fraser and Navarro, \"assumed that the genuine purpose of the whole European visit was for Eva and her husband to deposit money in Swiss bank accounts, and that the rest had been devised to conceal this. Many wealthy Argentines did this, but there are many more convenient and less conspicuous ways of depositing money in Swiss accounts than meeting the Swiss Foreign Minister and being shown around a watch factory.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 98-9\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:98\u201399).</ref> Fraser and Navarro conclude, \"Was there a Swiss bank account? It seems unlikely.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 208\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:208)</ref>\n\nDuring her tour to Europe, Eva Per\u00f3n was featured in a cover story for [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine. The cover's caption \u2013 \"Eva Per\u00f3n: Between two worlds, an Argentine rainbow\" \u2013 was a reference to the name given to Eva's European tour, The Rainbow Tour. This was the only time in the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its cover. (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Per\u00f3n.) The 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.<ref name=\"Fraser 91\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:91).</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated [[haircut|hairdos]] of her movie-star days. The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone and even the style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]]. Her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris [[Haute couture|couture]] and became particularly attached to the fashions of [[Christian Dior S.A.|Christian Dior]] and the jewels of [[Cartier SA|Cartier]]. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, Eva began to appear in public wearing conservative though stylish ''tailleurs'' (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/78738/13-things-you-might-not-know-about-eva-peron|title=13 Things You Might Not Know About Eva Per\u00f3n|date=2017-05-07|website=mentalfloss.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>\n\n==Charitable and feminist activities==\n{{See also|Feminism in Argentina}}\n\n===Eva Foundation===\n[[File:Evita (fundaci\u00f3n).JPG|thumb|left|Per\u00f3n meets with the public in her foundation's office.]]\n\nThe ''[[Sociedad de Beneficencia]]'' (Society of Beneficence), a [[Charitable organization|charity group]] made up of 87 society ladies, was responsible for most works of charity in Buenos Aires prior to the election of Juan Per\u00f3n. Fraser and Navarro write that at one point the ''Sociedad'' had been an enlightened institution, caring for [[orphans]] and homeless women, but that those days had long since passed by the time of the first term of Juan Per\u00f3n. In the 1800s, the ''Sociedad'' had been supported by private contributions, largely those of the husbands of the society ladies. But by the 1940s, the ''Sociedad'' was supported by the government.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{page needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIt had been the tradition of the ''Sociedad'' to elect the [[First Lady of Argentina]] as president of the charity. But the ladies of the ''Sociedad'' did not approve of Eva Per\u00f3n's impoverished background, lack of formal education, and former career as an actress. Fraser and Navarro write that the ladies of the ''Sociedad'' were afraid that Evita would set a bad example for the orphans, therefore the society ladies did not extend to Evita the position of president of their organization. It has often been said that Evita had the government funding for the ''Sociedad'' cut off in retaliation. Fraser and Navarro suggest that this version of events is in dispute, but that the government funding that had previously supported the ''Sociedad'' now went to support Evita's own foundation. The [[Eva Per\u00f3n Foundation]] began with 10,000 pesos provided by Evita herself.<ref name=\"Fraser 117\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:117).</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Woman with the Whip]]'', the first English-language biography of Eva Per\u00f3n, author Mary Main writes that no account records were kept for the foundation because it was merely a means of funneling government money into private [[Swiss bank accounts]] controlled by the Per\u00f3ns.<ref>Main (1980).</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2015}} Fraser and Navarro counter these claims, writing that Ram\u00f3n Cereijo, the Minister of Finance, kept records, and that the foundation \"began as the simplest response to the poverty [Evita] encountered each day in her office\" and \"the appalling backwardness of social services\u2014or charity, as it was still called\u2014in Argentina.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 114\">Fraser & Navarro\n(1996:114).</ref> Crassweller writes that the foundation was supported by donations of cash and goods from the Peronist unions and private businesses, and that the [[Confederacion General del Trabajo de Espa\u00f1a|Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo]] donated three man-days (later reduced to two) of salary for every worker per year. Tax on lottery and movie tickets also helped to support the foundation, as did a levy on casinos and revenue from horse races. Crassweller also notes that there were some cases of businesses being pressured to donate to the foundation, with negative repercussions resulting if requests for donations were not met.<ref>Crassweller (1987:209\u2013210).</ref>\n\nWithin a few years, the foundation had assets in cash and goods in excess of three billion [[peso]]s, or over $200 million at the exchange rate of the late 1940s. It employed 14,000 workers, of whom 6,000 were construction workers and 26 were priests. It purchased and distributed annually 400,000 pairs of shoes, 500,000 sewing machines, and 200,000 cooking pots. The foundation also gave scholarships, built homes, hospitals, and other charitable institutions. Every aspect of the foundation was under Evita's supervision. The foundation also built entire communities, such as [[Ciudad Evita|Evita City]], which still exists today. Fraser and Navarro claim that due to the works and health services of the foundation, for the first time in history there was no inequality in Argentine health care.<ref name=\"Fraser 119\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:119).</ref>\n[[File:Argentina - Eva Per\u00f3n en Campeonato de f\u00fatbol infantil.jpg|thumb|right|Per\u00f3n kicks off the Youth Football Championship, 1948]]\n\nFraser and Navarro write that it was Evita's work with the foundation that played a large role in her idealization, even leading some to consider her a [[saint]]. Though it was unnecessary from a practical standpoint, Evita set aside many hours per day to meet with the poor who requested help from her foundation. During these meetings with the poor, Evita often kissed the poor and allowed them to kiss her. Evita was even witnessed placing her hands in the suppurated wounds of the sick and poor, touching the [[Leprosy|leprous]], and kissing the [[Syphilis|syphilitic]]. Fraser and Navarro write that though Argentina is secular in many respects, it is essentially a Catholic country. Therefore, when Evita kissed the syphilitic and touched the leprous she \"...ceased to be the President's wife and acquired some of the characteristics of saints depicted in Catholicism.\" Poet [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Casti\u00f1eira de Dios|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Casti\u00f1eira de Dios]], a man from a wealthy background, reflected on the times he witnessed Evita meeting with the poor: \"I had had a sort of literary perception of the people and the poor and she had given me a Christian one, thus allowing me to become a Christian in the profoundest sense....\"<ref name=\"Fraser 126-7\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:126\u201327).</ref>\n\nFraser and Navarro write that, toward the end of her life, Evita was working as many as 20 to 22 hours per day in her foundation, often ignoring her husband's request that she cut back on her workload and take the weekends off. The more she worked with the poor in her foundation, the more she adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty, saying, \"Sometimes I have wished my insults were slaps or lashes.

It was necessary to wait more than a year before the House of Representatives sanctioned it on 9 September 1947. Law 13,010 established the equality of political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in Argentina. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously. In a public celebration and ceremony, Juan Per\u00f3n signed the law granting women the right to vote, and then he handed the bill to Eva, symbolically making it hers.\n\nEva Per\u00f3n then created the [[Women's Peronist Party]], the first large female political party in the nation. Navarro and Fraser write that by 1951, the party had 500,000 members and 3,600 headquarters across the country. Navarro and Fraser write that while Eva Per\u00f3n did not consider herself a feminist, her impact on the political life of women was decisive. Thousands of previously apolitical women entered politics because of Eva Per\u00f3n. They were the first women active in Argentine politics. The combination of female suffrage and the organization of the Women's Peronist Party granted Juan Per\u00f3n a large majority (63 percent) of the vote in the 1951 presidential elections.\n\n==1952 Presidential election==\n\n===Vice-Presidential nomination===\n[[File:Cabildo Abierto del Partido Peronista - 1951.jpg|thumb|left|A crowd of an estimated two million gathers in 1951 to show support for the Juan Per\u00f3n\u2013Eva Per\u00f3n ticket.]]\n\nIn 1951, Evita set her sights on earning a place on the ballot as candidate for vice-president. This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and her increasing powers within the government. According to the Argentine Constitution, the Vice President automatically succeeds the President in the event of the President's death. The possibility of Evita becoming president in the event of Juan Per\u00f3n's death was not something the military could accept.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{page needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nShe received great support from the working class, the unions, and the Peronist Women's Party. The intensity of the support she drew from these groups is said to have surprised even Juan Per\u00f3n himself. Fraser and Navarro write that the wide support Evita's proposed candidacy generated indicated to him that Evita had become as important to members of the Peronist party as Juan Per\u00f3n himself was.<ref name=\"Fraser 143\">Fraser & Navarro (1986:143).</ref>\n[[File:Evita llorando abraza a Per\u00f3n - 17OCT1951.jpg|thumb|Per\u00f3n embraces her husband during the 1951 joint ticket rally, unable to accept popular calls that she run for Vice-President.]]\nOn 22 August 1951, the unions held a mass rally of two million people called \"Cabildo Abierto.\" (The name \"Cabildo Abierto\" was a reference and tribute to the first local Argentine government of the [[May Revolution]], in 1810.) The Per\u00f3ns addressed the crowd from the balcony of a huge scaffolding set up on the [[Avenida 9 de Julio]], several blocks away from the Casa Rosada, the official government house of Argentina. Overhead were two large portraits of Eva and Juan Per\u00f3n. It has been claimed that \"Cabildo Abierto\" was the largest public display of support in history for a female political figure.<ref name=\"Quieroz 14\" />\n\nAt the mass rally, the crowd demanded that Evita publicly announce her candidacy as vice president. She pleaded for more time to make her decision. The exchange between Evita and the crowd of two million became, for a time, a genuine and spontaneous dialogue,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} with the crowd chanting, \"\u00a1Evita, Vice-Presidente!\" When Evita asked for more time so she could make up her mind, the crowd demanded, \"\u00a1Ahora, Evita, ahora!\" (\"Now, Evita, now!\"). Eventually, they came to a compromise. Evita told the audience that she would announce her decision over the radio a few days later.\n\n===Declining health===\n[[File:Peron y Eva - Acto en Plaza de Mayo -1MAY1952.jpg|thumb|left|Eva Per\u00f3n addresses the Peronists on 17 October 1951.

She said her only ambition was that in the large chapter of history to be written about her husband, the footnotes would mention a woman who brought the \"...hopes and dreams of the people to the president\", a woman who eventually turned those hopes and dreams into \"glorious reality\". In Peronist rhetoric, this event has come to be referred to as \"The Renunciation\", portraying Evita as having been a selfless woman in line with the Hispanic myth of ''[[marianismo]]''. Most biographers postulate that Evita did not so much renounce her ambition as bow to pressure from her husband, the military, and the Argentine upper class, who preferred that she not enter the race.\n\n[[File:Eva.renunciamiento.1951.ogg|thumb|Per\u00f3n's renunciation speech (in Spanish).

The monument, which was to be a statue of a man representing the ''[[descamisados]]'', was projected to be larger than the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Evita's body was to be stored in the base of the monument and, in the tradition of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s corpse, to be displayed for  the public. While the monument was being constructed, Evita's embalmed body was displayed in her former office at the CGT building for almost two years. Before the monument to Evita was completed, Juan Per\u00f3n was overthrown in a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]], the [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]], in 1955. Per\u00f3n hastily fled the country and was unable to make arrangements to secure Evita's body.\n\nFollowing his flight, a military dictatorship took power. The new authorities removed Evita's body from display, and its whereabouts were a mystery for 16 years. From 1955 until 1971, the military dictatorship of Argentina issued a ban on Peronism. It became illegal not only to possess pictures of Juan and Eva Per\u00f3n in one's home, but to speak their names. In 1971, the military revealed that Evita's body was buried in a crypt in [[Milan]], Italy, under the name \"Mar\u00eda Maggi.\" It appeared that her body had been damaged during its transport and storage, such as compressions to her face and disfigurement of one of her feet due to the body having been left in an upright position.\n\nIn 1995, [[Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez]] published ''Santa Evita,'' a fictionalized work propounding many new stories about the escapades of the corpse. Allegations that her body was the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from his description of an 'emotional necrophilia' by embalmers, Colonel Koenig and his assistant Arancibia. Many primary and secondary references to his novel have inaccurately stated that her body had been defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth. Also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made, that the corpse had been damaged with a hammer, and that one of the wax copies was the object of an officer's sexual attentions.<ref name=\"Fraser epilogue\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:Epilogue).</ref>\n\n===Final resting place===\nIn 1971, Evita's body was exhumed and flown to Spain, where Juan Per\u00f3n maintained the corpse in his home. Juan and his third wife, Isabel, decided to keep the corpse in their dining room on a platform near the table. In 1973, Juan Per\u00f3n came out of exile and returned to Argentina, where he became president for the third time. Per\u00f3n died in office in 1974. His third wife, [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]], whom he had married on 15 November 1961, and who had been elected vice-president, succeeded him. She became the first female president in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Isabel had Eva Per\u00f3n's body returned to Argentina and (briefly) displayed beside her husband's. Per\u00f3n's body was later buried in the Duarte family tomb in [[La Recoleta Cemetery]], Buenos Aires. The previous removal of Evita's body was avenged by the [[Montoneros]] when they in 1970 stole the corpse of [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]], whom they had previously killed. Montoneros then used the captive body of Aramburu to pressure for the repatriation of Evita's body. Once Evita's body arrived in Argentina, the Montoneros gave up Aramburu's corpse and abandoned it in a street in Buenos Aires.<ref>{{cite book |last=Negrete |first=Claudio R. |date=2010 |title=Necroman\u00eda: Historia de una pasi\u00f3n argentina |chapter-url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=bQGoIAE2p1gC&pg=PT109&lpg=PT109&dq=lopez+rega+cadaver+evita&source=bl&ots=Vvli_fLngu&sig=4tHYBp6WgrWL5T_7cK_goECHR3Y&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiZ1aSwg-bKAhXJ8HIKHYenAckQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&q=lopez%20rega%20cadaver%20evita&f=false |location= |publisher=Sudamericana |chapter=Canjeando muertos |page= |isbn= |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nThe Argentine government took elaborate measures to make Per\u00f3n's tomb secure.

As a female corpse reiterating the symbolic themes of both woman and [[Martyr (politics)|martyr]], Eva Per\u00f3n perhaps lays double claim to spiritual leadership.<ref name=\"Taylor 148\">Taylor (p. 148).</ref>}}\n\n[[John Balfour (diplomat)|John Balfour]] was the British ambassador in Argentina during the Per\u00f3n regime, and describes Evita's popularity:\n\n{{quote|She was by any standard a very extraordinary woman; when you think of Argentina and indeed Latin America as a men-dominated part of the world, there was this woman who was playing a very great role. And of course she aroused very different feelings in the people with whom she lived. The oligarchs, as she called the well-to-do and privileged people, hated her. They looked upon her as a ruthless woman. The masses of the people on the other hand worshipped her. They looked upon her as a lady bountiful who was dispensing [[Manna]] from heaven.<ref name=\"IMDB\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2302781/|title=Interview with sir John Balfour in the documentary Eva Per\u00f3n Queen of Hearts|accessdate=2015-06-04}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 2011, two giant murals of Evita were unveiled on the building facades of the current Ministry of Social Development, located on [[9 de Julio Avenue]]. The works were painted by Argentine artist [[Alejandro Marmo]]. On 26 July 2012, to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of Evita's death, notes were issued in a value of 100 pesos. The controversial effigy of [[Julio Argentino Roca]] was replaced by that of Eva Duarte, making her the first actual woman to be featured on the [[currency of Argentina]]. The image in the notes is based on a 1952 design, whose sketch was found in the Mint, made by the engraver Sergio Pilosio with artist [[Roger Pfund]]. The printing totals 20 million notes; it is not clear whether the government will replace the notes that feature Roca and the [[Conquest of the Desert]].\n\n===Allegations of fascism===\n[[File:Evita y Golda Meir.jpg|thumb|right|On 9 April 1951, [[Golda Meir]], then Labor Minister of [[Israel]], met with Eva Per\u00f3n to thank her for the aid the Eva Per\u00f3n Foundation had given to Israel.]]\n\nBiographers Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro write that Juan Per\u00f3n's opponents had from the start accused Per\u00f3n of being a [[fascism|fascist]]. [[Spruille Braden]], a diplomat from the United States who was greatly supported by Juan Per\u00f3n's opponents, campaigned against Juan Per\u00f3n's first candidacy on the platform that Juan Per\u00f3n was a fascist and a Nazi. Fraser and Navarro also theorize that the perception of the Per\u00f3ns as fascists was enhanced during Evita's 1947 European tour during which she was a guest of honour of [[Francisco Franco]]. By 1947, Franco had become politically isolated as one of the few remaining fascists to retain power. Franco, therefore, was in desperate need of a political ally. With nearly a third of Argentina's population of Spanish descent, it seemed natural for Argentina to have diplomatic relations with Spain. Commenting on the international perception of Evita during her 1947 European tour, Fraser and Navarro write, \"It was inevitable that Evita be viewed in a fascist context. Therefore, both Evita and Per\u00f3n were seen to represent an ideology which had run its course in Europe, only to re-emerge in an exotic, theatrical, even farcical form in a faraway country.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 100\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:100).</ref>\n\nLaurence Levine, the former president of the U.S.-Argentine Chamber of Commerce, writes that in contrast to [[Nazi]] ideology, the Per\u00f3ns were not [[anti-Semitic]]. In the book ''Inside Argentina from Per\u00f3n to [[Carlos Menem|Menem]]: 1950\u20132000 from an American Point of View'', Levine writes:\n\n{{quote|The American government demonstrated no knowledge of Per\u00f3n's deep admiration for Italy (and his distaste for Germany, whose culture he found too rigid). Nor did they appreciate that although anti-Semitism existed in Argentina, Per\u00f3n's own views and his political associations were not anti-Semitic. They paid no attention to the fact that Per\u00f3n sought out the Jewish community in Argentina to assist in developing his policies and that one of his most important allies in organizing the industrial sector was Jos\u00e9 Ber Gelbard, a Jewish immigrant from Poland.<ref>Levine (p. 23).</ref>}}\n[[File:Gelbard y peron.jpg|thumb|right|Juan Per\u00f3n and future Economy Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Ber Gelbard]]]]\n\nBiographer Robert D. Crassweller writes, \"Peronism was not fascism\", and \"Peronism was not Nazism.\" Crassweller also refers to the comments of U.S. Ambassador [[George S. Messersmith]]. While visiting Argentina in 1947, Messersmith made the following statement: \"There is not as much social discrimination against Jews here as there is right in New York or in most places at home.\"<ref name=\"Crassweller\">Crassweller (1987).</ref>\n\n''Time Magazine'' published an article by [[Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez]]\u2014Argentine writer, journalist, and former director of the [[Latin American]] program at [[Rutgers University]]\u2014titled \"The Woman Behind the Fantasy: Prostitute, Fascist, Profligate\u2014Eva Peron Was Much Maligned, Mostly Unfairly\". In this article, Mart\u00ednez writes that the accusations that Eva Per\u00f3n was a fascist, a Nazi, and a thief had been made against her for decades. He wrote that the allegations were untrue:\n\n{{quote|She was not a fascist\u2014ignorant, perhaps, of what that ideology meant. And she was not greedy. Though she liked jewelry, furs and Dior dresses, she could own as many as she desired without the need to rob others.... In 1964 [[Jorge Luis Borges]] stated that 'the mother of that woman [Evita]' was 'the madam of a whorehouse in Jun\u00edn.' He repeated the calumny so often that some still believe it or, more commonly, think Evita herself, whose lack of sex appeal is mentioned by all who knew her, apprenticed in that imaginary brothel. Around 1955 the pamphleteer Silvano Santander employed the same strategy to concoct letters in which Evita figures as an accomplice of the Nazis. It is true that (Juan) Per\u00f3n facilitated the entrance of Nazi criminals to Argentina in 1947 and 1948, thereby hoping to acquire advanced technology developed by the Germans during the war. But Evita played no part.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/1997/int/970120/cinema.the_woman.html |title=The woman behind the fantasy. prostitute, fascist, profligate\u2014Eva Per\u00f3n was much maligned, mostly unfairly |last=Mart\u00ednez |first=Tom\u00e1s Eloy |date=20 January 1997 |magazine=Time |accessdate=28 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011221053805/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/1997/int/970120/cinema.the_woman.html |archivedate=21 December 2001 }}</ref>}}\n\nIn his 2002 [[doctoral dissertation]] at [[Ohio State University]], Lawrence D. Bell writes that the governments that preceded Juan Per\u00f3n had been anti-Semitic but that his government was not. Juan Per\u00f3n \"eagerly and enthusiastically\" attempted to recruit the Jewish community into his government and set up a branch of the Peronist party for Jewish members, known as the Organizaci\u00f3n Israelita Argentina (OIA). Per\u00f3n's government was the first to court the Argentine Jewish community and the first to appoint Jewish citizens to public office.<ref>[http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=osu1039034580 ''The Jews and Per\u00f3n: Communal Politics and National Identity in Peronist Argentina, 1946\u20131955'' by Lawrence D.

The musical began as a [[concept album]] co-produced by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] in 1976, with [[Julie Covington]] in the title role. [[Elaine Paige]] was later cast in the title role when the concept album was adapted into a musical stage production in [[London's West End]] and won the 1978 [[Olivier Award]] for [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical|Best Performance in a Musical]]. In 1980, [[Patti LuPone]] won the [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical|Best Leading Actress in a Musical]] for her performance as the title character in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. The Broadway production also won the Tony Award for Best Musical. Nicholas Fraser claims that to date \"the musical stage production has been performed on every continent except Antarctica and has generated over $2 billion in revenue.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 193\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:193).</ref>\n\nAs early as 1978, the musical was considered as the basis for a movie. After a nearly 20-year production delay, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was cast in the title role for the 1996 [[Evita (1996 film)|film version]] and won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for \"Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy.\" In response to the American film, and in an alleged attempt to offer a more politically accurate depiction of Evita's life, an Argentine film company released ''[[Eva Per\u00f3n: The True Story]]''. The Argentine production starred actress [[Esther Goris]] in the title role. This movie was the 1996 Argentine submission for the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in the category of \"Best Foreign Language Film.\"\n\nNicholas Fraser writes that Evita is the perfect [[popular culture]] [[icon]] for our times because her career foreshadowed what, by the late 20th century, had become common. During Evita's time it was considered scandalous for a former entertainer to take part in public political life. Her detractors in Argentina had often accused Evita of turning public political life into show business. But by the late 20th century, Fraser claims, the public had become engrossed in the [[cult of celebrity]] and public political life had become insignificant. In this regard, Evita was perhaps ahead of her time. Fraser also writes that Evita's story is appealing to our celebrity-obsessed age because her story confirms one of Hollywood's oldest [[clich\u00e9]]s, the [[rags to riches]] story.<ref name=\"Fraser 194\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:194).</ref> Reflecting on Eva Per\u00f3n's popularity more than half a century after her death, [[Alma Guillermoprieto]] writes that, \"Evita's life has evidently just begun.\"<ref name=\"Guillermoprieto 16\">Guillermoprieto (2002:16)</ref>\n\n==Titles and honours==\n\nEva Peron appears on the 100 [[Argentine peso|peso]] note first issued in 2012 and scheduled for replacement sometime in 2018.\n\nThe titles given to Eva Peron are the following:<ref>http://evita3.marianobayona.com/disticon.html Honours of Eva Per\u00f3n</ref><ref>http://evita3.marianobayona.com/14jun06.html Distincionesa Eva Per\u00f3n</ref>\n\n===Titles and styles===\n* '''7 May 1919 \u2013 21 October 1945''': ''Miss'' Mar\u00eda Eva Duarte\n* '''22 October 1945 \u2013 3 June 1946''': ''Mrs'' Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n\n* '''4 June 1946 \u2013 26 July 1952''': ''Her Excellency'' Eva Per\u00f3n, First Lady of the Nation\n* '''7 May 1952 \u2013 Present''': ''Spiritual Leader of the Nation''\n\n===Honours===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n\n====National honours====\n* {{flag|Argentina}}: Grand Cross with Collar of the [[Order of the Liberator General San Mart\u00edn]]\n* {{flag|Argentina}}: Grand Cross of Honour of the Argentine Red Cross\n* {{flag|Argentina}}: Great Peronist Medal in Extraordinary Degree\n\n==== Foreign honours ====\n[[File:Eva Per\u00f3n e Eurico Dutra no Pal\u00e1cio do Catete 1.tif|thumb|Eva Per\u00f3n and Brazilian President [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]] at the [[Catete Palace]] in Rio de Janeiro, 1947.]]\n\n* {{flag|Bolivia}}: Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Condor of the Andes]] \n* {{flag|Brazil}}: Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Southern Cross]]<ref>{{cite news |title = Condecorada com a Ordem Nacional do M\u00e9rito a Senhora Eva Peron|newspaper = A Noite|date = 23 April 1952|url = http://memoria.bn.br/DocReader/Hotpage/HotpageBN.aspx?bib=348970_05&pagfis=12168&url=http://memoria.bn.br/docreader# | accessdate = 30 December 2018}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Colombia}}: Grand Cross of the [[Order of Boyaca|Order of Boyaca, Special Class]] \n* {{flag|Netherlands}}: Dame Grand Cross of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] \n* {{flag|Spain}}: Dame Grand Cross of the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]]<ref>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/58/29/ea/5829ea9a5dc9baad81efee618664b88e.jpg</ref><ref>https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?size=w400&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.archivioluce.com%2Ffoto%2Fhigh%2FATTUALITA%2FGP56%2FA00173095.jpg&type=IMAGE</ref>\n* {{flag|Sovereign Military Order of Malta}}: Dame Grand Cross of [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] \n* {{flag|Mexico}}: Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Aztec Eagle]] \n* {{flag|Syria}}: Grand Cross of the Order of Omeyades\n* {{flag|Ecuador}}: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit and the Ecuadorian Red Cross\n* {{flag|Haiti}}: Grand Cross of the [[National Order of Honour and Merit|Order of Honour and Merit]] \n* {{flag|Per\u00fa}}: Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Sun of Peru]]\n* {{flag|Paraguay}}:Grand Cross of the Merit of Paraguay\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Argentina|Biography}}\n*[[List of suffragists and suffragettes]]\n*[[Timeline of women's suffrage]]\n*[[Copa Eva Duarte]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{Cite journal| title=Evita: The Woman Behind the Myth | publisher=A&E Biography | year=1996 }}\n* {{cite book | title=Latin American Heroes: Liberators and Patriots from 1500 to the Present | last=Adams | first=Jerome R | isbn=978-0-345-38384-6 | publisher=Ballantine Books | year=1993 | url=https://archive.org/details/latinamericanher00jero }}\n* {{cite book | last=Ara | first=Pedro | title=El Caso Eva Per\u00f3n | year=1974}}\n* {{cite book | title=Evita, First Lady: A Biography of Eva Per\u00f3n | first=John | last=Barnes| year=1978|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York, New York}}\n* {{cite book | last=Vacca | first=Roberto | year=1970 | title=Eva Per\u00f3n | publisher=CEAL}}\n* {{cite book | last=Crassweller | first=Robert D | title=Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina | publisher=W.W.

She also ran the Ministries of Labor and Health, founded and ran the charitable [[Eva Per\u00f3n Foundation]], championed [[women's suffrage]] in Argentina, and founded and ran the nation's first large-scale female political party, the [[Women's Peronist Party]].\n\nIn 1951, Eva Per\u00f3n announced her candidacy for the Peronist nomination for the office of [[Vice President of Argentina]], receiving great support from the Peronist political base, low-income and working-class Argentines who were referred to as ''[[descamisados]]'' or \"shirtless ones\".

In 1934, at the age of 15, Eva escaped her poverty-stricken village when she ran off with a young musician to the nation's capital of [[Buenos Aires]]. The young couple's relationship ended almost as quickly as it had begun, but Eva remained in Buenos Aires. She began to pursue jobs on the stage and the radio, and eventually became a film actress.

The center of the city had many caf\u00e9s, restaurants, theaters, movie houses, shops, and bustling crowds. In direct contrast, the 1930s were also years of great unemployment, poverty, and hunger in the capital, and many new arrivals from the interior were forced to live in tenements, boardinghouses and in outlying shanties that became known as ''[[villas miserias]]''.<ref name=\"Quieroz 14\"/>}}\n[[File:Peron-Lamarque.jpg|thumb|right|Eva Duarte and [[Libertad Lamarque]] in ''[[La Cabalgata del Circo]]'', 1945]]\n\nUpon arrival in Buenos Aires, Eva Duarte was faced with the difficulties of surviving without formal education or connections. The city was especially overcrowded during this period because of the migrations caused by the [[Great Depression]]. On 28 March 1935, she had her professional debut in the play ''Mrs. Perez'' (''la Se\u00f1ora de P\u00e9rez''), at the Comedias Theater.\n\nIn 1936, Eva toured nationally with a theater company, worked as a model, and was cast in a few [[B-Movie|B-grade movie]] melodramas. In 1942, Eva experienced some economic stability when a company called ''Candilejas'' (sponsored by a soap manufacturer) hired her for a daily role in one of their radio dramas called ''Muy Bien'', which aired on ''Radio El Mundo'' (World Radio), the most important radio station in the country at that time.<ref name=\"Fraser 26\">Fraser & Navarro (p. 26)</ref> Later that year, she signed a five-year contract with ''Radio Belgrano'', which assured her a role in a popular historical-drama program called ''Great Women of History'', in which she played [[Elizabeth I of England]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]], and [[Alexandra of Hesse|the last Tsarina of Russia]]. Eventually, Eva Duarte came to co-own the radio company. By 1943, Eva Duarte was earning five or six thousand [[peso]]s a month, making her one of the highest-paid radio actresses in the nation. Pablo Raccioppi, who jointly ran ''Radio El Mundo'' with Eva Duarte, is said to have not liked her, but to have noted that she was \"thoroughly dependable\".<ref name=\"Fraser 27\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:27).</ref> Eva also had a short-lived film career, but none of the films in which she appeared were hugely successful. In one of her last films, ''[[La cabalgata del circo]]'' (''The Circus Cavalcade''), Eva played a young country girl who rivaled an older woman, the movie's star, [[Libertad Lamarque]].\n\nAs a result of her success with radio dramas and the films, Eva achieved some financial stability. In 1942, she was able to move into her apartment in the exclusive neighborhood of [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]], on 1567 Calle Posadas. The next year Eva began her career in politics, as one of the founders of the Argentine Radio Syndicate (ARA).<ref name=\"Borroni, Otelo 1970\"/>{{page needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Early relationship with Juan Per\u00f3n==\n[[File:Juan y Eva Oficial.jpg|thumb|left|Evita and Juan Per\u00f3n in 1947]][[File:Museo del Bicentenario - \"Retrato de Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n y Eva Duarte\", Numa Ayrinhac.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Official portrait of [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]] and Evita, by [[Numa Ayrinhac]] in 1948.

In response, Per\u00f3n, who was then the Secretary of Labour, established a fund to raise money to aid the victims. He devised a plan to have an \"artistic festival\" as a fundraiser, and invited radio and film actors to participate. After a week of fundraising, all participants met at a [[wiktionary:Gala|gala]] held at [[Estadio Luna Park|Luna Park Stadium]] in Buenos Aires to benefit earthquake victims. \n\nIt was at this gala, on 22 January 1944, that Eva Duarte first met Colonel [[Juan Per\u00f3n]].<ref name=\"Fraser 32-3\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:32\u201333).</ref> Eva promptly became the colonel's mistress.

Shortly after the formation of the union, Eva Duarte was elected its president. Fraser and Navarro speculate that Juan Per\u00f3n made the suggestion that performers create a union, and the other performers likely felt it was good politics to elect his mistress. Shortly after her election as president of the union, Eva Duarte began a daily program called ''Toward a Better Future,'' which dramatized, in soap opera form, the accomplishments of Juan Per\u00f3n. Often, Per\u00f3n's own speeches were played during the program. When she spoke, Eva Duarte spoke in ordinary language as a regular woman who wanted listeners to believe what she herself believed about Juan Per\u00f3n.<ref name=\"Fraser 43\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:43).</ref>\n\n==Rise to power==\n\n===Juan Per\u00f3n's arrest===\n{{History of Argentina}}\n[[File:17deoctubre-enlafuente.jpg|thumb|left|[[Loyalty Day (Argentina)|Demonstration]] for Per\u00f3n's release, on 17 October 1945. The [[Casa Rosada]] is seen in the background.]]\n\nBy early 1945, a group of Army officers called the GOU for \"[[United Officers' Group|Grupo de Oficiales Unidos]]\" (United Officers' Group), nicknamed \"The Colonels\", had gained considerable influence within the Argentine government. President [[Pedro Pablo Ram\u00edrez]] became wary of Juan Per\u00f3n's growing power within the government and was unable to curb that power. On 24 February 1944, Ram\u00edrez signed his own resignation paper, which Fraser and Navarro claim was drafted by Juan Per\u00f3n himself. [[Edelmiro Juli\u00e1n Farrell]], a friend of Juan Per\u00f3n, became President. Juan Per\u00f3n returned to his job as Labor Minister. Fraser and Navarro claim that, by this point, Per\u00f3n was the most powerful man in the Argentine government.<ref name=\"Fraser 39\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:39).</ref> On 9 October 1945 Juan Per\u00f3n was arrested by his opponents within the government who feared that, due to the strong support of the ''[[descamisados]]'', the workers and the poor of the nation, Per\u00f3n's popularity might eclipse that of the sitting president.\n\nSix days later, between 250,000 and 350,000 people gathered in front of the [[Casa Rosada]], Argentina's government house, to demand Juan Per\u00f3n's release, and their wish was granted. At 11 pm, Juan Per\u00f3n stepped onto the balcony of the Casa Rosada and addressed the crowd. Biographer Robert D. Crassweller claims that this moment was particularly powerful because it dramatically recalled important aspects of Argentine history. Crassweller writes that Juan Per\u00f3n enacted the role of a ''[[caudillo]]'' addressing his people in the tradition of Argentine leaders [[Juan Manuel de Rosas|Rosas]] and [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]. Crassweller also claims that the evening contained \"[[Mysticism|mystic]] [[overtones]]\" of a \"[[quasi]]-religious\" nature.<ref name=\"Crassweller 170-1\">Crassweller (1987:170\u20131).</ref>\nEva Per\u00f3n has often been credited with organizing the rally of thousands that freed Juan Per\u00f3n from prison on 17 October 1945. This version of events was popularized in the movie version of the [[Evita (musical)|Lloyd Webber musical]]; most historians agree that this version of events is unlikely.<ref>A&E (1996).</ref> At the time of Per\u00f3n's imprisonment, Eva was still merely an actress. She had no political clout with the various [[trade union|labor union]]s, and it is claimed that she was not well liked within Per\u00f3n's inner circle, nor was she liked by many within the film and radio business at this point. When Juan Per\u00f3n was imprisoned, Eva Duarte was suddenly disenfranchised. In reality, the massive rally that freed Per\u00f3n from prison was organized by the various unions, such as [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Labor Confederation]], or ''CGT'' as they came to be known. To this day, 17 October is something of a holiday for the [[Justicialist Party]] in Argentina (celebrated as ''D\u00eda de la Lealtad'', or \"[[Loyalty Day (Argentina)|Loyalty Day]]\"). What followed was shocking and nearly unheard of. Juan Per\u00f3n, the well-connected and politically rising star, married Eva. Despite Eva's childhood illegitimacy, and having an uncertain reputation, Per\u00f3n was in love with Eva, and her loyal devotion to him even while he had been under arrest touched him deeply, and so he married her, providing a respectability she had never known. Eva and Juan were married discreetly in a civil ceremony in [[Jun\u00edn, Buenos Aires|Jun\u00edn]] on 18 October 1945 and in a church wedding on 9 December 1945 in [[La Plata]].\n\n===1946 Presidential election victory===\nAfter his release from prison, Juan Per\u00f3n decided to campaign for the presidency of the nation, which he won in a landslide. Eva campaigned heavily for her husband during his 1946 presidential bid. Using her weekly radio show, she delivered powerful speeches with heavy [[populism|populist]] rhetoric urging the poor to align themselves with Per\u00f3n's movement.\n\n==European tour==\n[[File:Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|Per\u00f3n arrives in [[Madrid]].]]\n\nIn 1947, Eva embarked on a much-publicized \"Rainbow Tour\" of Europe, meeting with numerous dignitaries and heads of state, such as [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Pope Pius XII]]. Biographers Fraser and Navarro write that the tour had its genesis in an invitation that the Spanish leader had extended to Juan Per\u00f3n. For political reasons it was decided that Eva, rather than Juan Per\u00f3n, should make the visit. Fraser and Navarro write that Argentina had only recently emerged from its \"wartime quarantine\", thus taking its place in the United Nations and improving relations with the United States. Therefore, a visit to Franco, with [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Ant\u00f3nio Salazar of Portugal]], the last remaining Western European authoritarian leaders in power, would be diplomatically frowned upon internationally. Fraser and Navarro write that Eva made the decision that if Juan Per\u00f3n would not accept Franco's invitation for a state visit to Spain, then she would. Advisors then decided that Eva should visit many other European countries in addition to Spain. This would make it seem that Eva's sympathies were not specifically with [[Francoist Spain]] but with all of Europe. The tour was billed not as a political tour but as a non-political \"goodwill\" tour.<ref name=\"Fraser 88-9\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:88\u201389).</ref>\n\nEva was well received in Spain, where she visited the tombs of Spanish monarchs [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] in the [[Capilla Real de Granada]]. [[Francoist Spain]] had not recovered from the [[Spanish Civil War]] (the [[autarky|autarkic]] economy and the UN embargo meant that the country could not feed its people). During her visit to Spain, Eva handed out 100-[[Spanish peseta|peseta]] notes to many poor children she met on her journey. She also received from Franco the highest award given by the Spanish government, the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]].\n\nEva then visited Rome, where the reception was not as warm as it had been in Spain. Though [[Pope Pius XII]] did not give her a [[Papal Orders of Chivalry|Papal decoration]], she was allowed the time usually allotted to queens and was given a [[rosary]]. <!--And protests were held outside her hotel room. Some demonstrators claimed that Peronism was just another form of fascism.--><ref name=\"Fraser 89\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:89).</ref>\n\nHer next stop was France, where she was generally well received. She visited the [[Palace of Versailles]], among other sites. She also met with [[Charles de Gaulle]]. She promised France two shipments of wheat.\n\nWhile in France, Eva received word that [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] would not receive her when she planned to visit Britain, regardless of what his Foreign Office might advise,<ref>Alan Michie, God Save The Queen, p. ___ (1952)</ref> and that her visit would not be viewed as a state visit. Fraser and Navarro wrote that Eva regarded the royal family's refusal to meet her as a snub, and canceled the trip to the United Kingdom. Eva gave \"exhaustion\" as the official reason for not going on to Britain.\n[[File:Buenos Aires - Eva Per\u00f3n de gala en fundaci\u00f3n del Teatro Col\u00f3n.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Per\u00f3n wearing a dress designed by [[Christian Dior]]]]\n\nEva also visited Switzerland during her European tour, a visit that has been viewed as the worst part of the trip. According to the book ''Evita: A Biography'' by John Barnes, while she traveled down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough and, concluding the two-month tour, returned to Argentina.\n\nMembers of the Peronist opposition speculated that the true purpose of the European tour was to deposit funds in a [[Swiss bank account]]. \"The opposition in Buenos Aires\", write Fraser and Navarro, \"assumed that the genuine purpose of the whole European visit was for Eva and her husband to deposit money in Swiss bank accounts, and that the rest had been devised to conceal this. Many wealthy Argentines did this, but there are many more convenient and less conspicuous ways of depositing money in Swiss accounts than meeting the Swiss Foreign Minister and being shown around a watch factory.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 98-9\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:98\u201399).</ref> Fraser and Navarro conclude, \"Was there a Swiss bank account? It seems unlikely.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 208\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:208)</ref>\n\nDuring her tour to Europe, Eva Per\u00f3n was featured in a cover story for [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine. The cover's caption \u2013 \"Eva Per\u00f3n: Between two worlds, an Argentine rainbow\" \u2013 was a reference to the name given to Eva's European tour, The Rainbow Tour. This was the only time in the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its cover. (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Per\u00f3n.) The 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.<ref name=\"Fraser 91\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:91).</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated [[haircut|hairdos]] of her movie-star days. The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone and even the style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]]. Her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris [[Haute couture|couture]] and became particularly attached to the fashions of [[Christian Dior S.A.|Christian Dior]] and the jewels of [[Cartier SA|Cartier]].

In the 1800s, the ''Sociedad'' had been supported by private contributions, largely those of the husbands of the society ladies. But by the 1940s, the ''Sociedad'' was supported by the government.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{page needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIt had been the tradition of the ''Sociedad'' to elect the [[First Lady of Argentina]] as president of the charity. But the ladies of the ''Sociedad'' did not approve of Eva Per\u00f3n's impoverished background, lack of formal education, and former career as an actress. Fraser and Navarro write that the ladies of the ''Sociedad'' were afraid that Evita would set a bad example for the orphans, therefore the society ladies did not extend to Evita the position of president of their organization. It has often been said that Evita had the government funding for the ''Sociedad'' cut off in retaliation. Fraser and Navarro suggest that this version of events is in dispute, but that the government funding that had previously supported the ''Sociedad'' now went to support Evita's own foundation. The [[Eva Per\u00f3n Foundation]] began with 10,000 pesos provided by Evita herself.<ref name=\"Fraser 117\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:117).</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Woman with the Whip]]'', the first English-language biography of Eva Per\u00f3n, author Mary Main writes that no account records were kept for the foundation because it was merely a means of funneling government money into private [[Swiss bank accounts]] controlled by the Per\u00f3ns.<ref>Main (1980).</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2015}} Fraser and Navarro counter these claims, writing that Ram\u00f3n Cereijo, the Minister of Finance, kept records, and that the foundation \"began as the simplest response to the poverty [Evita] encountered each day in her office\" and \"the appalling backwardness of social services\u2014or charity, as it was still called\u2014in Argentina.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 114\">Fraser & Navarro\n(1996:114).</ref> Crassweller writes that the foundation was supported by donations of cash and goods from the Peronist unions and private businesses, and that the [[Confederacion General del Trabajo de Espa\u00f1a|Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo]] donated three man-days (later reduced to two) of salary for every worker per year. Tax on lottery and movie tickets also helped to support the foundation, as did a levy on casinos and revenue from horse races. Crassweller also notes that there were some cases of businesses being pressured to donate to the foundation, with negative repercussions resulting if requests for donations were not met.<ref>Crassweller (1987:209\u2013210).</ref>\n\nWithin a few years, the foundation had assets in cash and goods in excess of three billion [[peso]]s, or over $200 million at the exchange rate of the late 1940s. It employed 14,000 workers, of whom 6,000 were construction workers and 26 were priests. It purchased and distributed annually 400,000 pairs of shoes, 500,000 sewing machines, and 200,000 cooking pots. The foundation also gave scholarships, built homes, hospitals, and other charitable institutions. Every aspect of the foundation was under Evita's supervision. The foundation also built entire communities, such as [[Ciudad Evita|Evita City]], which still exists today. Fraser and Navarro claim that due to the works and health services of the foundation, for the first time in history there was no inequality in Argentine health care.<ref name=\"Fraser 119\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:119).</ref>\n[[File:Argentina - Eva Per\u00f3n en Campeonato de f\u00fatbol infantil.jpg|thumb|right|Per\u00f3n kicks off the Youth Football Championship, 1948]]\n\nFraser and Navarro write that it was Evita's work with the foundation that played a large role in her idealization, even leading some to consider her a [[saint]]. Though it was unnecessary from a practical standpoint, Evita set aside many hours per day to meet with the poor who requested help from her foundation. During these meetings with the poor, Evita often kissed the poor and allowed them to kiss her. Evita was even witnessed placing her hands in the suppurated wounds of the sick and poor, touching the [[Leprosy|leprous]], and kissing the [[Syphilis|syphilitic]]. Fraser and Navarro write that though Argentina is secular in many respects, it is essentially a Catholic country. Therefore, when Evita kissed the syphilitic and touched the leprous she \"...ceased to be the President's wife and acquired some of the characteristics of saints depicted in Catholicism.\" Poet [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Casti\u00f1eira de Dios|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Casti\u00f1eira de Dios]], a man from a wealthy background, reflected on the times he witnessed Evita meeting with the poor: \"I had had a sort of literary perception of the people and the poor and she had given me a Christian one, thus allowing me to become a Christian in the profoundest sense....\"<ref name=\"Fraser 126-7\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:126\u201327).</ref>\n\nFraser and Navarro write that, toward the end of her life, Evita was working as many as 20 to 22 hours per day in her foundation, often ignoring her husband's request that she cut back on her workload and take the weekends off. The more she worked with the poor in her foundation, the more she adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty, saying, \"Sometimes I have wished my insults were slaps or lashes. I've wanted to hit people in the face to make them see, if only for a day, what I see each day I help the people.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 126\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:126).</ref> Crassweller writes that Evita became fanatical about her work in the foundation and felt as though she were on a crusade against the very concept and existence of poverty and social ills. \"It is not surprising\", writes Crassweller, \"that as her public crusades and her private adorations took on a narrowing intensity after 1946, they simultaneously veered toward the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]].\" Crassweller compares Evita to [[Ignatius Loyola]], saying she came to be akin to a one-woman [[Jesuit Order]].<ref name=\"Crassweller 214-7\">Crassweller (1987:214\u2013217)</ref>\n\n===Women's Peronist Party and women's suffrage===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:Evita dirigi\u00e9ndose a una multitud de mujeres.jpg|thumb|Per\u00f3n supported the female vote.]]\n\nBiographers Fraser and Navarro wrote that Eva Per\u00f3n has often been credited with gaining the right to vote for Argentine women. While Eva did make radio addresses in support of [[women's suffrage]] and also published articles in her ''Democracia'' newspaper asking male Peronists to support women's right to vote, ultimately the ability to grant to women the right to vote was beyond Eva's powers. Fraser and Navarro claim that Eva's actions were limited to supporting a bill introduced by one of her supporters, Eduardo Colom, a bill that was eventually dropped.\n\nA new women's suffrage bill was introduced, which the [[Senate of Argentina]] sanctioned on 21 August 1946. It was necessary to wait more than a year before the House of Representatives sanctioned it on 9 September 1947. Law 13,010 established the equality of political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in Argentina. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously. In a public celebration and ceremony, Juan Per\u00f3n signed the law granting women the right to vote, and then he handed the bill to Eva, symbolically making it hers.\n\nEva Per\u00f3n then created the [[Women's Peronist Party]], the first large female political party in the nation. Navarro and Fraser write that by 1951, the party had 500,000 members and 3,600 headquarters across the country. Navarro and Fraser write that while Eva Per\u00f3n did not consider herself a feminist, her impact on the political life of women was decisive. Thousands of previously apolitical women entered politics because of Eva Per\u00f3n. They were the first women active in Argentine politics. The combination of female suffrage and the organization of the Women's Peronist Party granted Juan Per\u00f3n a large majority (63 percent) of the vote in the 1951 presidential elections.\n\n==1952 Presidential election==\n\n===Vice-Presidential nomination===\n[[File:Cabildo Abierto del Partido Peronista - 1951.jpg|thumb|left|A crowd of an estimated two million gathers in 1951 to show support for the Juan Per\u00f3n\u2013Eva Per\u00f3n ticket.]]\n\nIn 1951, Evita set her sights on earning a place on the ballot as candidate for vice-president. This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and her increasing powers within the government. According to the Argentine Constitution, the Vice President automatically succeeds the President in the event of the President's death. The possibility of Evita becoming president in the event of Juan Per\u00f3n's death was not something the military could accept.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{page needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nShe received great support from the working class, the unions, and the Peronist Women's Party. The intensity of the support she drew from these groups is said to have surprised even Juan Per\u00f3n himself. Fraser and Navarro write that the wide support Evita's proposed candidacy generated indicated to him that Evita had become as important to members of the Peronist party as Juan Per\u00f3n himself was.<ref name=\"Fraser 143\">Fraser & Navarro (1986:143).</ref>\n[[File:Evita llorando abraza a Per\u00f3n - 17OCT1951.jpg|thumb|Per\u00f3n embraces her husband during the 1951 joint ticket rally, unable to accept popular calls that she run for Vice-President.]]\nOn 22 August 1951, the unions held a mass rally of two million people called \"Cabildo Abierto.\" (The name \"Cabildo Abierto\" was a reference and tribute to the first local Argentine government of the [[May Revolution]], in 1810.) The Per\u00f3ns addressed the crowd from the balcony of a huge scaffolding set up on the [[Avenida 9 de Julio]], several blocks away from the Casa Rosada, the official government house of Argentina. Overhead were two large portraits of Eva and Juan Per\u00f3n. It has been claimed that \"Cabildo Abierto\" was the largest public display of support in history for a female political figure.<ref name=\"Quieroz 14\" />\n\nAt the mass rally, the crowd demanded that Evita publicly announce her candidacy as vice president. She pleaded for more time to make her decision. The exchange between Evita and the crowd of two million became, for a time, a genuine and spontaneous dialogue,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} with the crowd chanting, \"\u00a1Evita, Vice-Presidente!\" When Evita asked for more time so she could make up her mind, the crowd demanded, \"\u00a1Ahora, Evita, ahora!\" (\"Now, Evita, now!\"). Eventually, they came to a compromise. Evita told the audience that she would announce her decision over the radio a few days later.\n\n===Declining health===\n[[File:Peron y Eva - Acto en Plaza de Mayo -1MAY1952.jpg|thumb|left|Eva Per\u00f3n addresses the Peronists on 17 October 1951.

She said her only ambition was that in the large chapter of history to be written about her husband, the footnotes would mention a woman who brought the \"...hopes and dreams of the people to the president\", a woman who eventually turned those hopes and dreams into \"glorious reality\". In Peronist rhetoric, this event has come to be referred to as \"The Renunciation\", portraying Evita as having been a selfless woman in line with the Hispanic myth of ''[[marianismo]]''. Most biographers postulate that Evita did not so much renounce her ambition as bow to pressure from her husband, the military, and the Argentine upper class, who preferred that she not enter the race.\n\n[[File:Eva.renunciamiento.1951.ogg|thumb|Per\u00f3n's renunciation speech (in Spanish).

The monument, which was to be a statue of a man representing the ''[[descamisados]]'', was projected to be larger than the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Evita's body was to be stored in the base of the monument and, in the tradition of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s corpse, to be displayed for  the public. While the monument was being constructed, Evita's embalmed body was displayed in her former office at the CGT building for almost two years. Before the monument to Evita was completed, Juan Per\u00f3n was overthrown in a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]], the [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]], in 1955. Per\u00f3n hastily fled the country and was unable to make arrangements to secure Evita's body.\n\nFollowing his flight, a military dictatorship took power. The new authorities removed Evita's body from display, and its whereabouts were a mystery for 16 years. From 1955 until 1971, the military dictatorship of Argentina issued a ban on Peronism. It became illegal not only to possess pictures of Juan and Eva Per\u00f3n in one's home, but to speak their names. In 1971, the military revealed that Evita's body was buried in a crypt in [[Milan]], Italy, under the name \"Mar\u00eda Maggi.\" It appeared that her body had been damaged during its transport and storage, such as compressions to her face and disfigurement of one of her feet due to the body having been left in an upright position.\n\nIn 1995, [[Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez]] published ''Santa Evita,'' a fictionalized work propounding many new stories about the escapades of the corpse. Allegations that her body was the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from his description of an 'emotional necrophilia' by embalmers, Colonel Koenig and his assistant Arancibia. Many primary and secondary references to his novel have inaccurately stated that her body had been defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth. Also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made, that the corpse had been damaged with a hammer, and that one of the wax copies was the object of an officer's sexual attentions.<ref name=\"Fraser epilogue\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:Epilogue).</ref>\n\n===Final resting place===\nIn 1971, Evita's body was exhumed and flown to Spain, where Juan Per\u00f3n maintained the corpse in his home. Juan and his third wife, Isabel, decided to keep the corpse in their dining room on a platform near the table. In 1973, Juan Per\u00f3n came out of exile and returned to Argentina, where he became president for the third time. Per\u00f3n died in office in 1974. His third wife, [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]], whom he had married on 15 November 1961, and who had been elected vice-president, succeeded him. She became the first female president in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Isabel had Eva Per\u00f3n's body returned to Argentina and (briefly) displayed beside her husband's. Per\u00f3n's body was later buried in the Duarte family tomb in [[La Recoleta Cemetery]], Buenos Aires. The previous removal of Evita's body was avenged by the [[Montoneros]] when they in 1970 stole the corpse of [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]], whom they had previously killed. Montoneros then used the captive body of Aramburu to pressure for the repatriation of Evita's body.

Kirchner also says that women of her generation, who came of age in the 1970s during the military dictatorships in Argentina, owe a debt to Evita for offering an example of passion and combativeness.<ref name=\"Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina\"/> On 26 July 2002, the 50th anniversary of Eva Per\u00f3n's death, a museum opened in her honour called ''Museo Evita.'' The museum, created by her great-niece Cristina Alvarez Rodriguez, houses many of Eva Per\u00f3n's clothes, portraits, and artistic renderings of her life, and has become a popular tourist attraction.

Taylor claims that Evita has remained important in Argentina due to the combination of three unique factors:\n\n{{quote|In the images examined, the three elements consistently linked\u2014[[femininity]], [[mysticism|mystical]] or spirituality power, and revolutionary leadership\u2014display an underlying common theme. Identification with any one of these elements puts a person or a group at the margins of established society and at the limits of institutional authority. Anyone who can identify with all three images lays an overwhelming and echoing claim to dominance through forces that recognize no control in society or its rules. Only a woman can embody all three elements of this power.<ref name=\"Taylor 147\">Taylor (p. 147).</ref>}}\n[[File:Cristina recorri\u00f3 la \"Muestra Evita- Embajadora de la Paz\" en el Museo de Mosc\u00fa (17051584839) (2).jpg|thumb|right|President [[Cristina Kirchner]] in the exhibition of \"Evita: Ambassador of Peace\", in the [[State Historical Museum]] of [[Moscow]].]]\n\nTaylor argues that the fourth factor in Evita's continued importance in Argentina relates to her status as a dead woman and the power that death holds over the public imagination. Taylor suggests that Evita's embalmed corpse is analogous to the [[incorruptibility]] of various Catholic saints, such as [[Bernadette Soubirous]], and has powerful [[symbol]]ism within the largely Catholic cultures of Latin America:\n\n{{quote|To some extent her continuing importance and popularity may be attributed not only to her power as a woman but also to the power of the dead. However a society's vision of the [[afterlife]] may be structured, death by its nature remains a mystery, and, until society formally allays the commotion it causes, a source of disturbance and disorder. Women and the dead\u2014death and womanhood\u2014stand in similar relation to structured social forms: outside public institutions, unlimited by official rules, and beyond formal categories. As a female corpse reiterating the symbolic themes of both woman and [[Martyr (politics)|martyr]], Eva Per\u00f3n perhaps lays double claim to spiritual leadership.<ref name=\"Taylor 148\">Taylor (p. 148).</ref>}}\n\n[[John Balfour (diplomat)|John Balfour]] was the British ambassador in Argentina during the Per\u00f3n regime, and describes Evita's popularity:\n\n{{quote|She was by any standard a very extraordinary woman; when you think of Argentina and indeed Latin America as a men-dominated part of the world, there was this woman who was playing a very great role. And of course she aroused very different feelings in the people with whom she lived. The oligarchs, as she called the well-to-do and privileged people, hated her. They looked upon her as a ruthless woman. The masses of the people on the other hand worshipped her. They looked upon her as a lady bountiful who was dispensing [[Manna]] from heaven.<ref name=\"IMDB\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2302781/|title=Interview with sir John Balfour in the documentary Eva Per\u00f3n Queen of Hearts|accessdate=2015-06-04}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 2011, two giant murals of Evita were unveiled on the building facades of the current Ministry of Social Development, located on [[9 de Julio Avenue]]. The works were painted by Argentine artist [[Alejandro Marmo]]. On 26 July 2012, to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of Evita's death, notes were issued in a value of 100 pesos. The controversial effigy of [[Julio Argentino Roca]] was replaced by that of Eva Duarte, making her the first actual woman to be featured on the [[currency of Argentina]]. The image in the notes is based on a 1952 design, whose sketch was found in the Mint, made by the engraver Sergio Pilosio with artist [[Roger Pfund]]. The printing totals 20 million notes; it is not clear whether the government will replace the notes that feature Roca and the [[Conquest of the Desert]].\n\n===Allegations of fascism===\n[[File:Evita y Golda Meir.jpg|thumb|right|On 9 April 1951, [[Golda Meir]], then Labor Minister of [[Israel]], met with Eva Per\u00f3n to thank her for the aid the Eva Per\u00f3n Foundation had given to Israel.]]\n\nBiographers Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro write that Juan Per\u00f3n's opponents had from the start accused Per\u00f3n of being a [[fascism|fascist]]. [[Spruille Braden]], a diplomat from the United States who was greatly supported by Juan Per\u00f3n's opponents, campaigned against Juan Per\u00f3n's first candidacy on the platform that Juan Per\u00f3n was a fascist and a Nazi. Fraser and Navarro also theorize that the perception of the Per\u00f3ns as fascists was enhanced during Evita's 1947 European tour during which she was a guest of honour of [[Francisco Franco]]. By 1947, Franco had become politically isolated as one of the few remaining fascists to retain power. Franco, therefore, was in desperate need of a political ally. With nearly a third of Argentina's population of Spanish descent, it seemed natural for Argentina to have diplomatic relations with Spain. Commenting on the international perception of Evita during her 1947 European tour, Fraser and Navarro write, \"It was inevitable that Evita be viewed in a fascist context. Therefore, both Evita and Per\u00f3n were seen to represent an ideology which had run its course in Europe, only to re-emerge in an exotic, theatrical, even farcical form in a faraway country.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 100\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:100).</ref>\n\nLaurence Levine, the former president of the U.S.-Argentine Chamber of Commerce, writes that in contrast to [[Nazi]] ideology, the Per\u00f3ns were not [[anti-Semitic]]. In the book ''Inside Argentina from Per\u00f3n to [[Carlos Menem|Menem]]: 1950\u20132000 from an American Point of View'', Levine writes:\n\n{{quote|The American government demonstrated no knowledge of Per\u00f3n's deep admiration for Italy (and his distaste for Germany, whose culture he found too rigid). Nor did they appreciate that although anti-Semitism existed in Argentina, Per\u00f3n's own views and his political associations were not anti-Semitic. They paid no attention to the fact that Per\u00f3n sought out the Jewish community in Argentina to assist in developing his policies and that one of his most important allies in organizing the industrial sector was Jos\u00e9 Ber Gelbard, a Jewish immigrant from Poland.<ref>Levine (p. 23).</ref>}}\n[[File:Gelbard y peron.jpg|thumb|right|Juan Per\u00f3n and future Economy Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Ber Gelbard]]]]\n\nBiographer Robert D.

In this article, Mart\u00ednez writes that the accusations that Eva Per\u00f3n was a fascist, a Nazi, and a thief had been made against her for decades. He wrote that the allegations were untrue:\n\n{{quote|She was not a fascist\u2014ignorant, perhaps, of what that ideology meant. And she was not greedy. Though she liked jewelry, furs and Dior dresses, she could own as many as she desired without the need to rob others.... In 1964 [[Jorge Luis Borges]] stated that 'the mother of that woman [Evita]' was 'the madam of a whorehouse in Jun\u00edn.' He repeated the calumny so often that some still believe it or, more commonly, think Evita herself, whose lack of sex appeal is mentioned by all who knew her, apprenticed in that imaginary brothel. Around 1955 the pamphleteer Silvano Santander employed the same strategy to concoct letters in which Evita figures as an accomplice of the Nazis. It is true that (Juan) Per\u00f3n facilitated the entrance of Nazi criminals to Argentina in 1947 and 1948, thereby hoping to acquire advanced technology developed by the Germans during the war.

The musical began as a [[concept album]] co-produced by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] in 1976, with [[Julie Covington]] in the title role. [[Elaine Paige]] was later cast in the title role when the concept album was adapted into a musical stage production in [[London's West End]] and won the 1978 [[Olivier Award]] for [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical|Best Performance in a Musical]]. In 1980, [[Patti LuPone]] won the [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical|Best Leading Actress in a Musical]] for her performance as the title character in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production.

Nicholas Fraser claims that to date \"the musical stage production has been performed on every continent except Antarctica and has generated over $2 billion in revenue.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 193\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:193).</ref>\n\nAs early as 1978, the musical was considered as the basis for a movie. After a nearly 20-year production delay, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was cast in the title role for the 1996 [[Evita (1996 film)|film version]] and won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for \"Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy.\" In response to the American film, and in an alleged attempt to offer a more politically accurate depiction of Evita's life, an Argentine film company released ''[[Eva Per\u00f3n: The True Story]]''. The Argentine production starred actress [[Esther Goris]] in the title role. This movie was the 1996 Argentine submission for the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in the category of \"Best Foreign Language Film.\"\n\nNicholas Fraser writes that Evita is the perfect [[popular culture]] [[icon]] for our times because her career foreshadowed what, by the late 20th century, had become common. During Evita's time it was considered scandalous for a former entertainer to take part in public political life. Her detractors in Argentina had often accused Evita of turning public political life into show business. But by the late 20th century, Fraser claims, the public had become engrossed in the [[cult of celebrity]] and public political life had become insignificant. In this regard, Evita was perhaps ahead of her time. Fraser also writes that Evita's story is appealing to our celebrity-obsessed age because her story confirms one of Hollywood's oldest [[clich\u00e9]]s, the [[rags to riches]] story.<ref name=\"Fraser 194\">Fraser & Navarro (1996:194).</ref> Reflecting on Eva Per\u00f3n's popularity more than half a century after her death, [[Alma Guillermoprieto]] writes that, \"Evita's life has evidently just begun.\"<ref name=\"Guillermoprieto 16\">Guillermoprieto (2002:16)</ref>\n\n==Titles and honours==\n\nEva Peron appears on the 100 [[Argentine peso|peso]] note first issued in 2012 and scheduled for replacement sometime in 2018.\n\nThe titles given to Eva Peron are the following:<ref>http://evita3.marianobayona.com/disticon.html Honours of Eva Per\u00f3n</ref><ref>http://evita3.marianobayona.com/14jun06.html Distincionesa Eva Per\u00f3n</ref>\n\n===Titles and styles===\n* '''7 May 1919 \u2013 21 October 1945''': ''Miss'' Mar\u00eda Eva Duarte\n* '''22 October 1945 \u2013 3 June 1946''': ''Mrs'' Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n\n* '''4 June 1946 \u2013 26 July 1952''': ''Her Excellency'' Eva Per\u00f3n, First Lady of the Nation\n* '''7 May 1952 \u2013 Present''': ''Spiritual Leader of the Nation''\n\n===Honours===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n\n====National honours====\n* {{flag|Argentina}}: Grand Cross with Collar of the [[Order of the Liberator General San Mart\u00edn]]\n* {{flag|Argentina}}: Grand Cross of Honour of the Argentine Red Cross\n* {{flag|Argentina}}: Great Peronist Medal in Extraordinary Degree\n\n==== Foreign honours ====\n[[File:Eva Per\u00f3n e Eurico Dutra no Pal\u00e1cio do Catete 1.tif|thumb|Eva Per\u00f3n and Brazilian President [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]] at the [[Catete Palace]] in Rio de Janeiro, 1947.]]\n\n* {{flag|Bolivia}}: Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Condor of the Andes]] \n* {{flag|Brazil}}: Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Southern Cross]]<ref>{{cite news |title = Condecorada com a Ordem Nacional do M\u00e9rito a Senhora Eva Peron|newspaper = A Noite|date = 23 April 1952|url = http://memoria.bn.br/DocReader/Hotpage/HotpageBN.aspx?bib=348970_05&pagfis=12168&url=http://memoria.bn.br/docreader# | accessdate = 30 December 2018}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Colombia}}: Grand Cross of the [[Order of Boyaca|Order of Boyaca, Special Class]] \n* {{flag|Netherlands}}: Dame Grand Cross of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] \n* {{flag|Spain}}: Dame Grand Cross of the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]]<ref>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/58/29/ea/5829ea9a5dc9baad81efee618664b88e.jpg</ref><ref>https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?size=w400&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.archivioluce.com%2Ffoto%2Fhigh%2FATTUALITA%2FGP56%2FA00173095.jpg&type=IMAGE</ref>\n* {{flag|Sovereign Military Order of Malta}}: Dame Grand Cross of [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] \n* {{flag|Mexico}}: Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Aztec Eagle]] \n* {{flag|Syria}}: Grand Cross of the Order of Omeyades\n* {{flag|Ecuador}}: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit and the Ecuadorian Red Cross\n* {{flag|Haiti}}: Grand Cross of the [[National Order of Honour and Merit|Order of Honour and Merit]] \n* {{flag|Per\u00fa}}: Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Sun of Peru]]\n* {{flag|Paraguay}}:Grand Cross of the Merit of Paraguay\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Argentina|Biography}}\n*[[List of suffragists and suffragettes]]\n*[[Timeline of women's suffrage]]\n*[[Copa Eva Duarte]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{Cite journal| title=Evita: The Woman Behind the Myth | publisher=A&E Biography | year=1996 }}\n* {{cite book | title=Latin American Heroes: Liberators and Patriots from 1500 to the Present | last=Adams | first=Jerome R | isbn=978-0-345-38384-6 | publisher=Ballantine Books | year=1993 | url=https://archive.org/details/latinamericanher00jero }}\n* {{cite book | last=Ara | first=Pedro | title=El Caso Eva Per\u00f3n | year=1974}}\n* {{cite book | title=Evita, First Lady: A Biography of Eva Per\u00f3n | first=John | last=Barnes| year=1978|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York, New York}}\n* {{cite book | last=Vacca | first=Roberto | year=1970 | title=Eva Per\u00f3n | publisher=CEAL}}\n* {{cite book | last=Crassweller | first=Robert D | title=Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina | publisher=W.W.

Today, some of the country\u2019s most exciting chefs hail from distant shores and they\u2019re infusing their menus with the flavors of their heritage.

The catalogue includes essays from Rick Kinsel on the influence of Crawford\u2019s travels to Europe, especially to [[Andalusia]]; William C. Agee on the artist\u2019s life and reaction to historical events of the 20th century; John Crawford on the relationship between the two series and the role of photography in their development; and Emily Schuchardt Navratil on the genesis and context of individual works in each series. \"Ralston Crawford: Torn Signs\" was released by Merrell Publishers in April 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ralston Crawford: Torn Signs |url=http://www.merrellpublishers.com/9781858946733 |website=Merrell Publishers |accessdate=7 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''American Odysseys: Writings by New Americans''===\n\n''American Odysseys'' is an anthology of twenty-two novelists, poets, and short story writers.

Its chief geographical features are [[Coologe]] Lake, Derrycassan Lake and [[Camagh]] Lough. Derrycassan is traversed by a public road and several rural lanes. The townland covers 498 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe earliest surviving mention of the townland name is ''Doire Cas\u00e1in'', which appears in an interesting list of the rents  due to the McGovern Chief, [[Maghnus 'Ruadh' M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]] about 1400 A.D.<ref>{{Citation |author= L.

The clinical syndrome is associated with pathological findings including pneumonia, [[eosinophilic pneumonia]], [[cryptogenic organizing pneumonia]], acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, and [[Diffuse alveolar damage|diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)]]. Of these, the pathology most commonly associated with ARDS is DAD, which is characterized by a diffuse inflammation of lung tissue. The triggering insult to the tissue usually results in an initial release of [[cytokine|chemical signals]] and other inflammatory mediators secreted by local [[epithelium|epithelial]] and [[endothelium|endothelial]] cells.\n\n[[Neutrophils]] and some T-[[lymphocytes]] quickly migrate into the inflamed lung tissue and contribute in the amplification of the phenomenon. Typical histological presentation involves diffuse [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] damage and [[hyaline]] membrane formation in alveolar walls.

Generally, radiographic findings of fluid accumulation (pulmonary edema) affecting both lungs and unrelated to increased cardiopulmonary vascular pressure (such as in heart failure) may be suggestive of ARDS. \nUltrasound findings suggestive of ARDS include the following:\n* Anterior subpleural consolidations\n* Absence or reduction of lung sliding\n* \"Spared areas\" of normal parenchyma\n* [[Pleura]]l line abnormalities (irregular thickened fragmented pleural line)\n* Nonhomogeneous distribution of B-lines (a characteristic ultrasound finding suggestive of fluid accumulation in the lungs)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Volpicelli|first=Giovanni|last2=Elbarbary|first2=Mahmoud|last3=Blaivas|first3=Michael|last4=Lichtenstein|first4=Daniel A.|last5=Mathis|first5=Gebhard|last6=Kirkpatrick|first6=Andrew W.|last7=Melniker|first7=Lawrence|last8=Gargani|first8=Luna|last9=Noble|first9=Vicki E.|date=2012-04-01|title=International evidence-based recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|volume=38|issue=4|pages=577\u2013591|doi=10.1007/s00134-012-2513-4|issn=1432-1238|pmid=22392031}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome is usually treated with [[mechanical ventilation]] in the intensive care unit (ICU). Mechanical ventilation is usually delivered through a rigid tube which enters the oral cavity and is secured in the [[trachea|airway]] (endotracheal intubation), or by [[tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] when prolonged ventilation (\u22652 weeks) is necessary. The role of [[non-invasive ventilation]] is limited to the very early period of the disease or to prevent worsening respiratory distress in individuals with [[atypical pneumonia]]s, [[pulmonary contusion|lung bruising]], or major surgery patients, who are at risk of developing ARDS. Treatment of the underlying cause is crucial. Appropriate [[antibiotic]] therapy is started as soon as [[microbiological culture|culture]] results are available, or if infection is suspected (whichever is earlier). Empirical therapy may be appropriate if local microbiological surveillance is efficient. Where possible the origin of the infection is removed. When sepsis is diagnosed, appropriate local [[Guideline (medical)|protocols]] are followed.\n\n===Mechanical ventilation===\n{{further|Dual-control modes of ventilation|l1=Pressure regulated volume control}}\n\nThe overall goal of mechanical ventilation is to maintain acceptable gas exchange to meet the body's metabolic demands and to minimize adverse effects in its application. The parameters PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure, to keep alveoli open), mean airway pressure (to promote recruitment (opening) of easily collapsible alveoli and predictor of hemodynamic effects) and [[plateau pressure]] (best predictor of alveolar overdistention) are used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malhotra A |title=Low-tidal-volume ventilation in the acute respiratory distress syndrome |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=357 |issue=11 |pages=1113\u201320 |year=2007 |pmid=17855672 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct074213 |pmc=2287190}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, mechanical ventilation aimed to achieve tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) of 12\u201315 ml/kg (where the weight is [[body weight#ideal body weight|ideal body weight]] rather than actual weight). Recent studies have shown that high tidal volumes can overstretch alveoli resulting in [[volutrauma]] (secondary lung injury). The ARDS Clinical Network, or ARDSNet, completed a clinical trial that showed improved mortality when people with ARDS were ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg compared to the traditional 12 ml/kg. Low tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) may cause a permitted [[permissive hypercapnia|rise in blood carbon dioxide levels]] and [[atelectasis|collapse of alveoli]]<ref name=\"Rippe-ARDS\"/> because of their inherent tendency to increase shunting within the lung. Physiologic dead space cannot change as it is ventilation without perfusion. A shunt is perfusion without ventilation.\n\nLow tidal volume ventilation was the primary independent variable associated with reduced mortality in the NIH-sponsored ARDSnet trial of tidal volume in ARDS. Plateau pressure less than 30&nbsp;cm {{chem|H|2|O}} was a secondary goal, and subsequent analyses of the data from the ARDSnet trial and other experimental data demonstrate that there appears to be no safe upper limit to plateau pressure; regardless of plateau pressure, individuals with ARDS fare better with low tidal volumes.<ref name=\"Hager05\">{{cite journal|last1=Hager|first1=DN|last2=Krishnan|first2=JA|last3=Hayden|first3=DL|last4=Brower|first4=RG|last5=ARDS Clinical Trials Network|title=Tidal volume reduction in patients with acute lung injury when plateau pressures are not high|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=November 2005|volume=172|issue=10|pages=1241\u20135|pmid=16081547|doi=10.1164/rccm.200501-048cp|pmc=2718413}}</ref>\n\n====Airway pressure release ventilation====\nNo particular ventilator mode is known to improve mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSome [[respiratory therapist|practitioners]] favor [[airway pressure release ventilation]] when treating ARDS.

In ARDS, three populations of alveoli can be distinguished.  There are normal alveoli which are always inflated and engaging in gas exchange, flooded alveoli which can never, under any ventilatory regime, be used for gas exchange, and atelectatic or partially flooded alveoli that can be \"recruited\" to participate in gas exchange under certain ventilatory regimens.  The recruitable alveoli represent a continuous population, some of which can be recruited with minimal PEEP, and others which can only be recruited with high levels of PEEP.  An additional complication is that some alveoli can only be opened with higher airway pressures than are needed to keep them open, hence the justification for maneuvers where PEEP is increased to very high levels for seconds to minutes before dropping the PEEP to a lower level. PEEP can be harmful; high PEEP necessarily increases mean airway pressure and alveolar pressure, which can damage normal alveoli by overdistension resulting in DAD. A compromise between the beneficial and adverse effects of PEEP is inevitable.\n\nThe 'best PEEP' used to be defined as 'some' cm{{chem|H|2|O}} above the lower inflection point (LIP) in the [[Sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] pressure-volume relationship curve of the lung. Recent research has shown that the LIP-point pressure is no better than any pressure above it, as recruitment of collapsed alveoli{{mdash}}and, more importantly, the overdistension of aerated units{{mdash}}occur throughout the whole inflation. Despite the awkwardness of most procedures used to trace the pressure-volume curve, it is still used by some{{who|date=October 2013}} to define the ''minimum'' PEEP to be applied to their patients. Some new ventilators can automatically plot a pressure-volume curve.\n\nPEEP may also be set empirically. Some authors{{who|date=October 2013}} suggest performing a 'recruiting maneuver'{{mdash}}a short time at a very high continuous positive airway pressure, such as 50&nbsp;cm{{chem|H|2|O}} (4.9 kPa){{mdash}}to recruit or open collapsed units with a high distending pressure before restoring previous ventilation. The final PEEP level should be the one just before the drop in Pa{{chem|O|2}} or [[hemoglobin|peripheral blood oxygen saturation]] during a step-down trial.\n\n[[Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure|Intrinsic PEEP]] (iPEEP) or auto-PEEP{{mdash}}first described by John Marini of St. Paul Regions Hospital{{mdash}}is a potentially unrecognized contributor to PEEP in intubated individuals.  When ventilating at high frequencies, its contribution can be substantial, particularly in people with obstructive lung disease such as [[asthma]] or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). iPEEP has been measured in very few formal studies on ventilation in ARDS, and its contribution is largely unknown. Its measurement is recommended in the treatment of people who have ARDS, especially when using [[high-frequency ventilation|high-frequency (oscillatory/jet) ventilation]].\n\n=== Prone position ===\nThe position of lung infiltrates in acute respiratory distress syndrome is non-uniform.

The clinical syndrome is associated with pathological findings including pneumonia, [[eosinophilic pneumonia]], [[cryptogenic organizing pneumonia]], acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, and [[Diffuse alveolar damage|diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)]]. Of these, the pathology most commonly associated with ARDS is DAD, which is characterized by a diffuse inflammation of lung tissue. The triggering insult to the tissue usually results in an initial release of [[cytokine|chemical signals]] and other inflammatory mediators secreted by local [[epithelium|epithelial]] and [[endothelium|endothelial]] cells.\n\n[[Neutrophils]] and some T-[[lymphocytes]] quickly migrate into the inflamed lung tissue and contribute in the amplification of the phenomenon.

Generally, radiographic findings of fluid accumulation (pulmonary edema) affecting both lungs and unrelated to increased cardiopulmonary vascular pressure (such as in heart failure) may be suggestive of ARDS. \nUltrasound findings suggestive of ARDS include the following:\n* Anterior subpleural consolidations\n* Absence or reduction of lung sliding\n* \"Spared areas\" of normal parenchyma\n* [[Pleura]]l line abnormalities (irregular thickened fragmented pleural line)\n* Nonhomogeneous distribution of B-lines (a characteristic ultrasound finding suggestive of fluid accumulation in the lungs)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Volpicelli|first=Giovanni|last2=Elbarbary|first2=Mahmoud|last3=Blaivas|first3=Michael|last4=Lichtenstein|first4=Daniel A.|last5=Mathis|first5=Gebhard|last6=Kirkpatrick|first6=Andrew W.|last7=Melniker|first7=Lawrence|last8=Gargani|first8=Luna|last9=Noble|first9=Vicki E.|date=2012-04-01|title=International evidence-based recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|volume=38|issue=4|pages=577\u2013591|doi=10.1007/s00134-012-2513-4|issn=1432-1238|pmid=22392031}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome is usually treated with [[mechanical ventilation]] in the intensive care unit (ICU). Mechanical ventilation is usually delivered through a rigid tube which enters the oral cavity and is secured in the [[trachea|airway]] (endotracheal intubation), or by [[tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] when prolonged ventilation (\u22652 weeks) is necessary. The role of [[non-invasive ventilation]] is limited to the very early period of the disease or to prevent worsening respiratory distress in individuals with [[atypical pneumonia]]s, [[pulmonary contusion|lung bruising]], or major surgery patients, who are at risk of developing ARDS. Treatment of the underlying cause is crucial. Appropriate [[antibiotic]] therapy is started as soon as [[microbiological culture|culture]] results are available, or if infection is suspected (whichever is earlier). Empirical therapy may be appropriate if local microbiological surveillance is efficient. Where possible the origin of the infection is removed. When sepsis is diagnosed, appropriate local [[Guideline (medical)|protocols]] are followed.\n\n===Mechanical ventilation===\n{{further|Dual-control modes of ventilation|l1=Pressure regulated volume control}}\n\nThe overall goal of mechanical ventilation is to maintain acceptable gas exchange to meet the body's metabolic demands and to minimize adverse effects in its application. The parameters PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure, to keep alveoli open), mean airway pressure (to promote recruitment (opening) of easily collapsible alveoli and predictor of hemodynamic effects) and [[plateau pressure]] (best predictor of alveolar overdistention) are used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malhotra A |title=Low-tidal-volume ventilation in the acute respiratory distress syndrome |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=357 |issue=11 |pages=1113\u201320 |year=2007 |pmid=17855672 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct074213 |pmc=2287190}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, mechanical ventilation aimed to achieve tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) of 12\u201315 ml/kg (where the weight is [[body weight#ideal body weight|ideal body weight]] rather than actual weight). Recent studies have shown that high tidal volumes can overstretch alveoli resulting in [[volutrauma]] (secondary lung injury). The ARDS Clinical Network, or ARDSNet, completed a clinical trial that showed improved mortality when people with ARDS were ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg compared to the traditional 12 ml/kg. Low tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) may cause a permitted [[permissive hypercapnia|rise in blood carbon dioxide levels]] and [[atelectasis|collapse of alveoli]]<ref name=\"Rippe-ARDS\"/> because of their inherent tendency to increase shunting within the lung. Physiologic dead space cannot change as it is ventilation without perfusion. A shunt is perfusion without ventilation.\n\nLow tidal volume ventilation was the primary independent variable associated with reduced mortality in the NIH-sponsored ARDSnet trial of tidal volume in ARDS. Plateau pressure less than 30&nbsp;cm {{chem|H|2|O}} was a secondary goal, and subsequent analyses of the data from the ARDSnet trial and other experimental data demonstrate that there appears to be no safe upper limit to plateau pressure; regardless of plateau pressure, individuals with ARDS fare better with low tidal volumes.<ref name=\"Hager05\">{{cite journal|last1=Hager|first1=DN|last2=Krishnan|first2=JA|last3=Hayden|first3=DL|last4=Brower|first4=RG|last5=ARDS Clinical Trials Network|title=Tidal volume reduction in patients with acute lung injury when plateau pressures are not high|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=November 2005|volume=172|issue=10|pages=1241\u20135|pmid=16081547|doi=10.1164/rccm.200501-048cp|pmc=2718413}}</ref>\n\n====Airway pressure release ventilation====\nNo particular ventilator mode is known to improve mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSome [[respiratory therapist|practitioners]] favor [[airway pressure release ventilation]] when treating ARDS.

In ARDS, three populations of alveoli can be distinguished.  There are normal alveoli which are always inflated and engaging in gas exchange, flooded alveoli which can never, under any ventilatory regime, be used for gas exchange, and atelectatic or partially flooded alveoli that can be \"recruited\" to participate in gas exchange under certain ventilatory regimens.  The recruitable alveoli represent a continuous population, some of which can be recruited with minimal PEEP, and others which can only be recruited with high levels of PEEP.  An additional complication is that some alveoli can only be opened with higher airway pressures than are needed to keep them open, hence the justification for maneuvers where PEEP is increased to very high levels for seconds to minutes before dropping the PEEP to a lower level. PEEP can be harmful; high PEEP necessarily increases mean airway pressure and alveolar pressure, which can damage normal alveoli by overdistension resulting in DAD. A compromise between the beneficial and adverse effects of PEEP is inevitable.\n\nThe 'best PEEP' used to be defined as 'some' cm{{chem|H|2|O}} above the lower inflection point (LIP) in the [[Sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] pressure-volume relationship curve of the lung. Recent research has shown that the LIP-point pressure is no better than any pressure above it, as recruitment of collapsed alveoli{{mdash}}and, more importantly, the overdistension of aerated units{{mdash}}occur throughout the whole inflation. Despite the awkwardness of most procedures used to trace the pressure-volume curve, it is still used by some{{who|date=October 2013}} to define the ''minimum'' PEEP to be applied to their patients. Some new ventilators can automatically plot a pressure-volume curve.\n\nPEEP may also be set empirically. Some authors{{who|date=October 2013}} suggest performing a 'recruiting maneuver'{{mdash}}a short time at a very high continuous positive airway pressure, such as 50&nbsp;cm{{chem|H|2|O}} (4.9 kPa){{mdash}}to recruit or open collapsed units with a high distending pressure before restoring previous ventilation. The final PEEP level should be the one just before the drop in Pa{{chem|O|2}} or [[hemoglobin|peripheral blood oxygen saturation]] during a step-down trial.\n\n[[Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure|Intrinsic PEEP]] (iPEEP) or auto-PEEP{{mdash}}first described by John Marini of St. Paul Regions Hospital{{mdash}}is a potentially unrecognized contributor to PEEP in intubated individuals.  When ventilating at high frequencies, its contribution can be substantial, particularly in people with obstructive lung disease such as [[asthma]] or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). iPEEP has been measured in very few formal studies on ventilation in ARDS, and its contribution is largely unknown. Its measurement is recommended in the treatment of people who have ARDS, especially when using [[high-frequency ventilation|high-frequency (oscillatory/jet) ventilation]].\n\n=== Prone position ===\nThe position of lung infiltrates in acute respiratory distress syndrome is non-uniform.

Notably, the Berlin guidelines discourage the use of the term \"acute lung injury\" or ALI, as the term was commonly being misused to characterize a less severe degree of lung injury.  Instead, the committee proposes a classification of ARDS severity as mild, moderate or severe according to arterial oxygen saturation.<ref name=ARDS_BerlinDef /> The Berlin definitions represent the current international consensus guidelines for both clinical and research classification of ARDS.\n\n==Terminology==\nARDS is the severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) and of [[transfusion-related acute lung injury]] (TRALI).
