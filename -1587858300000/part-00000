Initially, the state was chosen to be a part of Finland, and on 14 November 1919, Tikhonov appointed a request to the Government of Finland. Later, however, the state was established as an independent state in alliance with Finland.\n\nOn 21 March 1920, the Government convened a congress of representatives of 11 northern counties<ref name=\"multuple1\">[http://militera.lib.ru/h/hesin_ss/01.html ''Hesin S.''

On the state flag, it had a red canton with white northern lights. The war flag was made in the same style but had three plaits and a complementary Bear with a  ''[[Billhook|vesuri]]'' in the clutches (there is evidence that in the center of the black cross on it was a red square).

However, on 18 May 1920 the [[Red Army]] went to Uhtua to claim back the republic. The state government fled to the village [[:fi:Vuokkiniemi|Vuokkiniemi]], which was 30&nbsp; km from the Soviet-Finnish border, from where they moved to Finland.\n\nKarelia remained a part of the RSFSR, where on its territory on June 8, 1920, was formed autonomous regional association Karelian labor commune that existed until 25 July 1923, when it was formed as the [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelian ASSR]].<ref>Karelian labor commune // The Great Soviet Encyclopedia  : 30 m. / hl. ed.

As a result, on 14 October 1920, the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] was signed between the RSFSR and Finland.\n\n== The East Karelian Uprising ==\n{{main|East Karelian Uprising and Soviet\u2013Finnish conflict 1921\u201322}}\n\nHowever, as it turned out, the Government of Finland and Karelian supporters of independence were not going to completely abandon their claims. 10 December 1920 in [[Vyborg]] the Karelian united government was created, which, in addition to the Provisional Government of Karelia, became the Olonets government and other national education.\n\nIn October 1921 in the territory of the Karelian labor commune in Tungudskoy parish was established as the underground '''Karelian Temporary Committee'''. In November and December 1921, the Finnish troops reoccupied part of the regions of Karelia, which began the Soviet\u2013Finnish conflict. In Karelia, martial law was imposed, commander of the Karelian Front was appointed commander of A. I. Sedyakin. By early January 1922, the units from Petrozavodsk of the Red Army defeated the main group of Finns, and in early February 1922 the '''Center Committee Karelian village of Uhtua''' was re-occupied by the Red Army. As a result of the successes of Soviet troops, Finland was forced to cease hostilities.

Tikhonov. The center of the village territorial entity was Uhtua. Initially, the state was chosen to be a part of Finland, and on 14 November 1919, Tikhonov appointed a request to the Government of Finland. Later, however, the state was established as an independent state in alliance with Finland.\n\nOn 21 March 1920, the Government convened a congress of representatives of 11 northern counties<ref name=\"multuple1\">[http://militera.lib.ru/h/hesin_ss/01.html ''Hesin S.''  Rout White Finnish adventure in Karelia in 1921-1922. - Moskva: Military MBC USSR, 1949.]</ref> of concern to the Provisional Government of White Karelia. The congress was attended by 116 delegates.<ref name=\"multuple1\" />\n\nOn the first day of the Congress, the issue of state symbols was addressed.\n{{Quotation|It is proposed that we develop a national Karelian emblem and colors to have in a national flag. By discussing, we have approved the following: Emblem - a bear in front of a log with an axe in their paw.

The author of the sketches was the Finnish artist [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]]. The coat of arms was a red-green bicolour Varangian shield, topped with traditional headdress loggers. The shield was a picture of a bear in black with a ''[[Billhook|vesuri]]'' in their paws.

The colors of the flag symbolize the following: green - a symbol of the country's forest and nature, red - bloodshed for the homeland, and the joy and fire, as in the ancient Karelians used slash-and-burn agriculture, black - the native land and sadness. On the state flag, it had a red canton with white northern lights. The war flag was made in the same style but had three plaits and a complementary Bear with a  ''[[Billhook|vesuri]]'' in the clutches (there is evidence that in the center of the black cross on it was a red square). There was also a pilot flag (luotsilippu), postal flag (postilippu), a customs flag (tullilippu),<ref name=\"chronos\" /> and a war pennant, in a similar manner to Finnish [[Household pennants of Finland|Household pennants]].<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ru-10h2.html Flag of the World: East Karelia (Russia) 1919-1920]</ref>\n\nThe congress decided to secede from Soviet Russia and, guided by the Soviet authorities declared the principle of \"the right of nations to self-determination\", they declared independence as the Republic of Uhtua.

However, on 18 May 1920 the [[Red Army]] went to Uhtua to claim back the republic. The state government fled to the village [[:fi:Vuokkiniemi|Vuokkiniemi]], which was 30&nbsp; km from the Soviet-Finnish border, from where they moved to Finland.\n\nKarelia remained a part of the RSFSR, where on its territory on June 8, 1920, was formed autonomous regional association Karelian labor commune that existed until 25 July 1923, when it was formed as the [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelian ASSR]].<ref>Karelian labor commune // The Great Soviet Encyclopedia  : 30 m. / hl. ed. A. Prokhorov . - 3rd ed. - M . : Soviet Encyclopfedia, 1969-1978.</ref>\n\nDuring the negotiations between the RSFSR and Finland, the Finns promoted territorial claims to Karelia, but due to the Red Army's size, the Finnish government was forced to abandon the idea. As a result, on 14 October 1920, the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] was signed between the RSFSR and Finland.\n\n== The East Karelian Uprising ==\n{{main|East Karelian Uprising and Soviet\u2013Finnish conflict 1921\u201322}}\n\nHowever, as it turned out, the Government of Finland and Karelian supporters of independence were not going to completely abandon their claims. 10 December 1920 in [[Vyborg]] the Karelian united government was created, which, in addition to the Provisional Government of Karelia, became the Olonets government and other national education.\n\nIn October 1921 in the territory of the Karelian labor commune in Tungudskoy parish was established as the underground '''Karelian Temporary Committee'''. In November and December 1921, the Finnish troops reoccupied part of the regions of Karelia, which began the Soviet\u2013Finnish conflict. In Karelia, martial law was imposed, commander of the Karelian Front was appointed commander of A. I. Sedyakin. By early January 1922, the units from Petrozavodsk of the Red Army defeated the main group of Finns, and in early February 1922 the '''Center Committee Karelian village of Uhtua''' was re-occupied by the Red Army. As a result of the successes of Soviet troops, Finland was forced to cease hostilities.

''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (video games)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town.

''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (gaming)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town.

Two extensions have been constructed, and there are plans for further extensions through to 2025.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe average daily flow is approximately 0.3&nbsp;[[gigalitre]]s (0.3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres), out of a London average day demand of approximately 2.0 gigalitres  (2.0&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/850_2613.htm|title=Our business|publisher=[[Thames Water]]|date=|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thamestunnelconsultation.co.uk/2012/11/30/sustainable-drainage-and-the-%E2%80%98supersewer%E2%80%99/|title=Sustainable drainage and the Supersewer|first=Richard |last=Aylard|date=November 2012|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> The main currently comprises a major loop linking the [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], [[Walton-on-Thames|Walton]], [[Ashford, Surrey|Ashford]] and [[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton]] WTWs clustered on the Thames upstream of [[Teddington Lock|Teddington Weir]] to central London by a southern branch via [[Brixton]] and northern branch via [[Kew]], and a separate unconnected length from [[Coppermill Stream|Coppermills WTW]] to [[Stoke Newington]].  The main is well below most water mains, at a depth of {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|65|m|abbr=on}} below ground level and approximately {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} below sea-level.  It is connected to water supply zones by some 20 shafts that extend from the main to ground level.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Driver==\nThe main serves as a partial alternative transfer system to existing trunk mains suffering increasing frequencies and severities of leaks and bursts.  Some of the oldest operational pressure mains in the world (the oldest dates from 1838), the high-level trunks have weakened with steady corrosion, and there has been both an increased carrying requirement resulting from increasing water demand, and increasing external stresses resulting from higher vehicle weights and frequencies.  This has been exacerbated by limited system redundancies which has restricted preventative refurbishment.  The main has both extended the operational life of the high-level trunks by reducing the flow demands placed on them, and, by providing a high degree of redundancy, enabling key trunks to be isolated and maintained.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Hydraulics==\nFlow through the main is by gravity under the [[Hydraulic head|driving head]] of the service reservoirs at the source WTWs.  By virtue of its depth, the pipeline is under some pressure; however, the hydraulic grade line rarely exceeds ground level, and, to enter, supply water must be pumped up into the distribution zones at the pump-out shafts.  In some respects, therefore, the main can be considered as a minor reservoir, from which supply is drawn as required.  An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the [[Battersea]] and Park Lane pump-out shafts.  The loop is closed to provide the redundancy that allows any segment on the ring to be isolated and drained for maintenance without interrupting the supply to any shaft, not for hydraulic reasons.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Construction==\nThe main was constructed in two phases: the southern leg from Ashford Common WTW to Barrow Hill Shaft in 1988 to 1991, and the northern leg between the same locations in 1991 to 1993.  Each phase was divided into a number of 'stages' that were separately contracted and constructed largely simultaneously. The different contractors involved in each stage is to some degree reflected in the variation in tunnelling and tunnel construction techniques used.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Geology==\nThe main lies mostly within [[London Clay]] with sections within the overlying alluvium and underlying [[Lambeth Group]] and [[Thanet_Formation|Thanet Sand]]. The predominance of the London Clay lengths is by design, as being easily excavated, largely impermeable and somewhat self-supporting for short periods it is a near-ideal tunnelling material. Where the hydraulics have required entry into the Lambeth Group and Thanet Sand, tunnelling was considerably more difficult. In particular, the Thanet Sand requires a high boring torque, is highly abrasive and, most challengingly, sufficiently permeable to contain a water table continuous with the underlying Chalk and measured at pressures up to {{convert|4|bar|abbr=on}}. An unexpected entry into the Thanet Sand while excavating near [[Tooting Commons|Tooting Bec Common]] led to the flooding of the tunnel and the temporary abandonment of a [[Tunnel boring machine|Tunnel Boring Machine]] (TBM). A further consideration of Thanet Sand is the presence of [[glauconite]], which oxidises on contact with air. The resulting de-oxygenated air resulted in two fatalities during the excavation of a pump-out shaft.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Future==\nThe main will be extended in stages over the coming decades. Work is currently under way to bridge the gap between the main loop at New River Head and the isolated segment at Stoke Newington and to extend a branch from the Brixton Shaft to Honor Oak reservoir. Both these projects are being assessed for their environmental sustainability through [[CEEQUAL]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Shafts==\nThe 21 shafts connecting the main to the surface are divided into:\n* 5 [[water treatment]] works (WTW), which supply clean water,\n* 11 [[pumping station]]s (PS), which withdraw water from the main,\n* 3 access shafts, where no water transfer occurs, and\n* 2 storage locations, where water is supplied or withdrawn as demand fluctuates.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===North leg===\n*[[Ashford Common]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton Park]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Mogden]], [[Isleworth]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Kew]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Barnes, London|Barnes]] \u2014 balancing storage\n*[[Holland Park|Holland Park Avenue]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Primrose Hill|Barrow Hill, Primrose Hill]] \u2014 PS\n\n===South leg===\n*Ashford Common \u2014 WTW\n*[[Walton-on-Thames|Walton]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Hampton, London|Hampton]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Surbiton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Hogsmill]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Raynes Park]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Streatham]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Brixton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Battersea]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]] \u2014 PS\n*Barrow Hill \u2014 PS\n\n===North extension===\n*Barrow Hill \u2014 PS\n*[[New River Head]] \u2014 PS<br>''under construction''\n*[[Stoke Newington]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Coppermill Stream|Coppermills]] \u2014 WTW\n\n===South extension===\n*Brixton \u2014 PS<br>''under construction''\n*[[Honor Oak]] \u2014 underground storage\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book |year=1994 |title=Thames Water Ring Main |work=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers |volume=102 |issue=special issue 2 |location=London |publisher=Telford |isbn= 0-7277-2003-1}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/850_2599.htm |date=July 2007  |title=London Ring Main extensions commence |publisher=[[Thames Water|Thames Water Utilities]]}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=type&id=113114 |title=Thames Water Tunnels |publisher=[[Mott Macdonald]] |postscript=, contractor for the current extensions}}\n* {{cite journal |url=https://www.e-sciencecentral.org/articles/Figure.php?xn=eer/eer-18-2-57-2&id=f10-eer-18-2-57-2&mode=export |title=(a) Thames Water Ring Main: existing tunnels and tunnels under construction and (b) the 21 shafts connecting the ring main to the surface. |publisher= Environmental Engineering Research 2013; 18(2): 57-63. |postscript=, Map and diagram of the ring main.

Runestones are commemorating Vikings killed in Finland. Runestone [[Runestone G 319|G 319]], which is dated to the early 13th century, also mentions Viking killed in Finland.[[File:Stiklestad.jpeg|thumb|220x220px|Painting of the death of [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf II]] in 1030 who was defeated in Finland in 1008 in the [[Battle at Herdaler]]]]\n== Early written sources ==\nSeveral medieval [[saga]]s, chronicles and other early historical sources mention wars and conflicts related to Finnish tribes and to Finland.[[File:Grand Duke Yaroslav the city resumes after the devastation of the Tatars of Russia (Boris Chorikov).jpg|thumb|252x252px|Grand prince [[Yaroslav II of Vladimir|Yaroslav]] who attacked Finland in 1227 according to [[Novgorod First Chronicle]].]]Finland was probably the same as [[Terra Feminarum]] which was attacked by Sweden in the 1050s CE, as described in ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum]]'' (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church) by [[Adam of Bremen]] in 1075.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} According to the source, the attack ended in the Swedish defeat, and led to the death of the king's son who was in charge of the campaign. Information on the conflict is however convoluted.\n\n[[Ynglingasaga]] written in early 13th century describes military expedition to Finland at the end of the 4th century by mythological Swedish king [[Agne]]. However, it is disputed whether the Old Norse concept of Finland refers to the present country of Finland; alternatively it could have meant the land of the [[S\u00e1mi]].\n\nLegendary [[Orkneyinga saga]] written around 1230 tells about Nor who travelled from [[Kvenland]] to Norway and took over the entire country. Based on the saga's internal chronologies, the war would have taken place on the 6th or 7th century CE. Another version of the saga, [[Hversu Noregr byggdist]], however omits the Kvenland part completely.\n\n[[Norna-Gests \u00fe\u00e1ttr]] saga from the early 14th century tells that [[Kvenland|Kvens]] (probably referring to a group of Finns) were raiding in Sweden in the mid-8th century.<ref>[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/sagas_oi/017.php Norna-Gests \u00fe\u00e1ttr, chapter 7.]  See also the [http://www.northvegr.org/lore/oldheathen/077.php English translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514042537/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/oldheathen/077.php|date=May 14, 2006}}.</ref> In the late 9th century, king [[Eric Anundsson]] was said to have conquered Finland, with several other eastern countries.<ref name=\":4\">[http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/haraldson3.html Saga of Olaf Haraldson].

Norwegian [[Ohthere from H\u00e5logaland|Ohthere]] tells in the ''[[Old English Orosius]]'' from 890 that Norwegians and [[Kvens (historical)|Kvens]] (''Qwenas'') were in conflict with each other from time to time.<ref name=\"Ottar\">[http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/iallt2003/oldenglish/OEparagraph-5.html Ottar's description of Kvenland].</ref>\n\nThe best-known Swedish war against Finland presumably took place in the 1150s known as the legendary [[First Swedish Crusade]].  Whether it ever actually happened, is however not certain as the information is based on the late 13th century legends. Sweden eventually took over Finland during the so-called [[Second Swedish Crusade]] around 1249 against Tavastians and the [[Third Swedish Crusade]] against Karelians in 1293. By the beginning of the 14th century, records of independent Finnish military activities ceased to surface.\n\n[[Heimskringla|Saga of Olaf Haraldson]] tells how the [[Olaf II of Norway|Saint Olaf]] himself, the King of Norway, plundered in Finland around 1008 and almost got killed at the [[Battle at Herdaler]].<ref>[http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/haraldson1.html http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/haraldson1.html] Saga of Olaf Haraldson.

Information on the conflict is however convoluted.\n\n[[Ynglingasaga]] written in early 13th century describes military expedition to Finland at the end of the 4th century by mythological Swedish king [[Agne]]. However, it is disputed whether the Old Norse concept of Finland refers to the present country of Finland; alternatively it could have meant the land of the [[S\u00e1mi]].\n\nLegendary [[Orkneyinga saga]] written around 1230 tells about Nor who travelled from [[Kvenland]] to Norway and took over the entire country. Based on the saga's internal chronologies, the war would have taken place on the 6th or 7th century CE. Another version of the saga, [[Hversu Noregr byggdist]], however omits the Kvenland part completely.\n\n[[Norna-Gests \u00fe\u00e1ttr]] saga from the early 14th century tells that [[Kvenland|Kvens]] (probably referring to a group of Finns) were raiding in Sweden in the mid-8th century.<ref>[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/sagas_oi/017.php Norna-Gests \u00fe\u00e1ttr, chapter 7.]  See also the [http://www.northvegr.org/lore/oldheathen/077.php English translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514042537/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/oldheathen/077.php|date=May 14, 2006}}.</ref> In the late 9th century, king [[Eric Anundsson]] was said to have conquered Finland, with several other eastern countries.<ref name=\":4\">[http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/haraldson3.html Saga of Olaf Haraldson].

Whether it ever actually happened, is however not certain as the information is based on the late 13th century legends. Sweden eventually took over Finland during the so-called [[Second Swedish Crusade]] around 1249 against Tavastians and the [[Third Swedish Crusade]] against Karelians in 1293. By the beginning of the 14th century, records of independent Finnish military activities ceased to surface.\n\n[[Heimskringla|Saga of Olaf Haraldson]] tells how the [[Olaf II of Norway|Saint Olaf]] himself, the King of Norway, plundered in Finland around 1008 and almost got killed at the [[Battle at Herdaler]].<ref>[http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/haraldson1.html http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/haraldson1.html] Saga of Olaf Haraldson.

Completed in 1916, she was assigned to the [[Dover Patrol]] where her primary duties involved bombarding German targets on the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|Belgian coast]], particularly at the ports of [[Zeebrugge]] and [[Ostend]]. In October 1917 ''Terror'' was hit by three torpedoes, taking severe damage to the bow and had to be towed into [[Portsmouth]] for repair. In April 1918 she participated in the [[Zeebrugge raid]] and provided gunnery support for the [[Fifth Battle of Ypres]] in September of the same year.\n\nAfter the war the monitor was attached to [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']], the Royal Navy's gunnery school in Portsmouth and participated in gunnery trials in the 1920s. In January 1934 ''Terror'' became the base ship at [[Singapore Naval Base|Sembawang Naval Base]] in [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] where she remained for the rest of the decade. From May 1939 to the end of the year she underwent an extensive refit in Singapore's dockyards.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War and the completion of her refit, ''Terror'' was ordered home to Europe in January 1940. From early March the monitor served in the Mediterranean where she defended [[Siege of Malta (1940)|Malta]] from Italian air raids before supporting the land-based assault of Italian positions in North Africa at the end of the year. In January 1941 the ship assisted with the capture of [[Bardia]] and [[Tobruk]] before she attempted to defend [[Benghazi]] from German air attacks in February. Suffering damage from two air attacks and two mines on 22 and 23 February, ''Terror'' was [[scuttled]] off the coast of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] in the early hours of 24 February. The crew were evacuated to the [[minesweeper]] {{HMS|Fareham|J89|2}} and [[corvette]] {{HMS|Salvia|K97|2}} prior to her sinking.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the First World War, the Royal Navy developed several classes of ships which were designed to give close support to troops ashore through the use of [[Naval Gunfire Support|naval bombardment]].<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 1; Buxton 2008 c. 1</ref> Termed [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]], they owed little to the monitors of the 19th century, though they shared the characteristics of poor seaworthiness, shallow [[Draft (hull)|draught]] and heavy armament in turrets. The size of the various monitor classes of the Royal Navy and their armaments varied greatly. The {{sclass-|Marshal Ney|monitor|4}} was the United Kingdom's first attempt at a monitor carrying {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} guns.<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 24</ref> Following construction of the first two of the ''Marshall Ney-class'', another four were ordered in May 1915, with the [[Harland and Wolff]] [[shipyard]] at [[Govan]] receiving a contract to construct two hulls, which were given [[yard number]]s 492 and 493. However, all four were cancelled in June when it was realised that there were insufficient gun turrets to complete both the [[battleship]], {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}}, and the monitors before 1917.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 8.1</ref>\n\nBy August 1915, {{HMS|Marshal Ney||2}}, the first of its class, had revealed a very poor performance in its sea trials. Its engines would not start reliably and were prone to stalling,<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 25</ref> making it impossible for the ship to achieve even the minimum standard for the trial of four hours of continuous sailing at full power. The vessel was also difficult to steer.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 4.2, para. 3</ref> Disappointed by the failure, the [[Admiralty]] began the design of a replacement class on 6 September, which incorporated lessons learned from all of the previous classes of monitor commissioned during the war. Some of the main modifications were an increase in the power supply to guarantee a speed of {{convert|12|kn}} and a change to the angles and lines of the hull to improve steering. Another significant change was to raise the top of the [[anti-torpedo bulge]] above the waterline and reduce its width; both changes would improve the stability and maneuverability of the ship at sea. The bulge was fitted along each side of the ship and was intended to absorb the impact of any explosions. To maintain protection while reducing the bulge's width, its inner compartment was made water tight and filled with 70 steel tubes, rather than leaving the inner compartment open to the sea as in previous designs.<ref name=\"Brown1999p148\">Brown 1999 p. 148</ref><ref name=\"Buxton8.2p2\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.2</ref>\n\n==Design and construction==\nThe new design, which would later be named the ''Erebus''-class, was for a vessel {{convert|405|ft|m|abbr=on|lk=on|1}} long, {{convert|88|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on|1}} [[Beam (nautical)|wide]] with a draught of {{convert|11|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on|1}}. It would have {{convert|8,450|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[Displacement (ship)#Loaded displacement|loaded displacement]],<ref name=\"Buxtonc8.3para2\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.3 para. 2</ref>{{efn-lr|Official figures for displacement on completion were not recorded for either vessel of the ''Erebus''-class, leading to historians estimating the true displacement from the completed design and manifest.

The flotilla anchored off Zeebrugge and began their bombardment at around 05:00 on 12 May, with the monitors {{HMS|Marshal Soult||2}} and ''Terror'' concentrating on the south lock gate and her sister ship ''Erebus'' concentrating on the north gate. Poor visibility and problems with [[Air Observation Post|spotting aircraft]] meant that the fall of shot couldn't be fully observed or their trajectories corrected. The German shore battery began to return fire but ceased after four rounds due to the same poor visibility, enhanced by a British [[smoke screen]]. The British bombardment was called off at 06:00 due to a change in the wind direction clearing their smoke screen and making their ships visible from the shore.

The ship sailed first to Dover on 21 October but on the next leg of the journey to Portsmouth two days later, in heavy seas, a major leak developed off [[Hastings]]. The crew evacuated while a tug boat maintained a line to the ship. They were able to reboard ''Terror'' the next day and brought her back into Dover harbour. During the second attempt to reach Portsmouth on 27 October, Bruton again refused to sail the ship backwards but changed his mind after the salvage expert left the ship. She was then towed backwards to Portsmouth, where it took until early January to repair the damage.<ref>Dunn, Chapter 13, Section: \"New monitors\"</ref>  A [[Court-martial|Court of Inquiry]] was called into the 23 October abandonment.

Intending to use the port as a key supply point for their armies, the allies recognised that the shortage of anti-aircraft guns, lack of radar and limited air cover from the RAF was a strategic weakness that would have to be addressed. However, the capture of the port coincided with the arrival of the [[Luftwaffe]] in North Africa as the advance forces of [[Operation Sonnenblume]]. The Germans immediately began an intense series of air raids against both Benghazi and Tobruk, which included the dropping of [[magnetic mines]] into the harbours.<ref>Raugh 2013 p. 123; Playfair 1956 p. 12</ref> \n\n[[File:Pictures For Illustrating Ritchie Ii Book.

As part of this work, a team from ''Peony'' safely detonated a mine close to ''Terror's'' mooring.<ref>Parker 2013 p. 215</ref> Despite the monitor's efforts to protect the harbour using her anti-aircraft guns, the convoy was unable to offload the majority of its cargo due to the frequent air attacks and sailed on to Tobruk on 20 February. ''Terror'' remained in port together with the minesweeper ''Fareham'' and corvette ''Salvia'' to protect the naval parties clearing the harbour.<ref>Bechthold 2017 pp. 128\u2013129; Playfair 1956 p. 12; Brown 2013 p. 64</ref> \n\n''Terror'' was subjected to continued bombing attacks while in harbour and a near miss early on 22 February caused significant damage and flooding of the decks. Haynes protested the lack of air support to Cunningham along with the dangers of remaining at anchor, stating that it was only a matter of time before ''Terror'' received a direct hit. Accepting this assessment, Cunningham ordered the ship to sail for Tobruk on the evening tide with ''Fareham'' and ''Salvia''.<ref>Brown 2013 p. 64</ref> As they were exiting the harbour the monitor triggered two magnetic mines in the previously cleared channel; although again not a direct hit, the explosions in close proximity caused further damage and flooding.<ref>Bechthold 2017 p. 129</ref> On the evening of 23 February she was attacked once more by German [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive-bombers from III/[[StG 2]] under the command of [[Helmut Mahlke]]. The ''gruppe'', which had been initially set up as an anti-shipping unit by the [[Kriegsmarine]], had been drafted in to attack shipping in the vicinity.<ref>Smith 2011, pp. 267\u2013268</ref> The attack occurred while the ship was {{convert|90|miles|km}} from Tobruk; the near misses of this final assault leaving the ship critically damaged. Further floodwater disabled the electric generators and pumps and extinguished the boiler furnaces. The majority of the crew were evacuated to ''Fareham'' and ''Salvia'' with a skeleton crew of officers and anti-aircraft gunners remaining on board to operate the ship. ''Terror'' was taken under tow by ''Fareham'' in an attempt to reach Tobruk and additional ships were scrambled from Alexandria and Tobruk. However, the monitor continued to take on water and it was accepted that she would never reach port. ''Terror'' was [[scuttled]] through the opening of the [[seacock]]s and the use of [[depth charges]] on the morning of 24 February, {{convert|25|miles|km}} to the north west of [[Derna, Libya|Derna]]. The remaining crew were evacuated successfully.<ref>Bechthold 2017 p. 129; Brown 2013 p. 64; Crossley 2013 c. 7, para. 8</ref>{{efn-lr|Bechthold (2017) gives the date of the sinking as 26 February, however Brown (2013), Crossley (2013) and Buxton (2008) agree that her final damage was taken on the evening of 23 February and she was scuttled during the night.

Completed in 1916, she was assigned to the [[Dover Patrol]] where her primary duties involved bombarding German targets on the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|Belgian coast]], particularly at the ports of [[Zeebrugge]] and [[Ostend]]. In October 1917 ''Terror'' was hit by three torpedoes, taking severe damage to the bow and had to be towed into [[Portsmouth]] for repair. In April 1918 she participated in the [[Zeebrugge raid]] and provided gunnery support for the [[Fifth Battle of Ypres]] in September of the same year.\n\nAfter the war the monitor was attached to [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']], the Royal Navy's gunnery school in Portsmouth and participated in gunnery trials in the 1920s. In January 1934 ''Terror'' became the base ship at [[Singapore Naval Base|Sembawang Naval Base]] in [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] where she remained for the rest of the decade. From May 1939 to the end of the year she underwent an extensive refit in Singapore's dockyards.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War and the completion of her refit, ''Terror'' was ordered home to Europe in January 1940. From early March the monitor served in the Mediterranean where she defended [[Siege of Malta (1940)|Malta]] from Italian air raids before supporting the land-based assault of Italian positions in North Africa at the end of the year. In January 1941 the ship assisted with the capture of [[Bardia]] and [[Tobruk]] before she attempted to defend [[Benghazi]] from German air attacks in February. Suffering damage from two air attacks and two mines on 22 and 23 February, ''Terror'' was [[scuttled]] off the coast of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] in the early hours of 24 February. The crew were evacuated to the [[minesweeper]] {{HMS|Fareham|J89|2}} and [[corvette]] {{HMS|Salvia|K97|2}} prior to her sinking.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the First World War, the Royal Navy developed several classes of ships which were designed to give close support to troops ashore through the use of [[Naval Gunfire Support|naval bombardment]].<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 1; Buxton 2008 c. 1</ref> Termed [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]], they owed little to the monitors of the 19th century, though they shared the characteristics of poor seaworthiness, shallow [[Draft (hull)|draught]] and heavy armament in turrets. The size of the various monitor classes of the Royal Navy and their armaments varied greatly. The {{sclass-|Marshal Ney|monitor|4}} was the United Kingdom's first attempt at a monitor carrying {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} guns.<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 24</ref> Following construction of the first two of the ''Marshall Ney-class'', another four were ordered in May 1915, with the [[Harland and Wolff]] [[shipyard]] at [[Govan]] receiving a contract to construct two hulls, which were given [[yard number]]s 492 and 493. However, all four were cancelled in June when it was realised that there were insufficient gun turrets to complete both the [[battleship]], {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}}, and the monitors before 1917.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 8.1</ref>\n\nBy August 1915, {{HMS|Marshal Ney||2}}, the first of its class, had revealed a very poor performance in its sea trials. Its engines would not start reliably and were prone to stalling,<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 25</ref> making it impossible for the ship to achieve even the minimum standard for the trial of four hours of continuous sailing at full power. The vessel was also difficult to steer.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 4.2, para. 3</ref> Disappointed by the failure, the [[Admiralty]] began the design of a replacement class on 6 September, which incorporated lessons learned from all of the previous classes of monitor commissioned during the war. Some of the main modifications were an increase in the power supply to guarantee a speed of {{convert|12|kn}} and a change to the angles and lines of the hull to improve steering. Another significant change was to raise the top of the [[anti-torpedo bulge]] above the waterline and reduce its width; both changes would improve the stability and maneuverability of the ship at sea. The bulge was fitted along each side of the ship and was intended to absorb the impact of any explosions. To maintain protection while reducing the bulge's width, its inner compartment was made water tight and filled with 70 steel tubes, rather than leaving the inner compartment open to the sea as in previous designs.<ref name=\"Brown1999p148\">Brown 1999 p. 148</ref><ref name=\"Buxton8.2p2\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.2</ref>\n\n==Design and construction==\nThe new design, which would later be named the ''Erebus''-class, was for a vessel {{convert|405|ft|m|abbr=on|lk=on|1}} long, {{convert|88|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on|1}} [[Beam (nautical)|wide]] with a draught of {{convert|11|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on|1}}.

However, the new monitor only fired a small number of shots, as it was felt wiser to conserve her guns for more important targets. On 24 September the ship made an attempt to bombard the port of [[Zeebrugge]] but this was soon aborted when the weather conditions prevented the accurate observation of the [[Indirect fire|fall of shot]] and any subsequent correction of trajectory. Poor weather conditions continued for the rest of 1916 and the patrol made no further attempts that year to bombard the Belgian coast. During the winter of 1916 and 1917, ''Terror'' acted as a [[guard ship]] for merchant vessels anchored at [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]], following a spate of attacks by German destroyers.<ref name=\"Buxton8.4\">Buxton 2008 Chapter 8.4</ref>\n\nIn early 1917, ''Terror'' and the rest of the patrol made several aborted attempts to bombard the [[lock gate]]s of the Bruges Canal at Zeebrugge but the operation had to be postponed each time. Reasons for postponement included snapped towlines and poor weather conditions. However, the operation eventually commenced on the evening of 11 May with ''Terror'' acting as flagship for [[Vice-admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[Reginald Bacon]]. The flotilla anchored off Zeebrugge and began their bombardment at around 05:00 on 12 May, with the monitors {{HMS|Marshal Soult||2}} and ''Terror'' concentrating on the south lock gate and her sister ship ''Erebus'' concentrating on the north gate. Poor visibility and problems with [[Air Observation Post|spotting aircraft]] meant that the fall of shot couldn't be fully observed or their trajectories corrected. The German shore battery began to return fire but ceased after four rounds due to the same poor visibility, enhanced by a British [[smoke screen]]. The British bombardment was called off at 06:00 due to a change in the wind direction clearing their smoke screen and making their ships visible from the shore. The flotilla withdrew to Dover, in the mistaken belief that their bombardment had been successful. Subsequent aerial reconnaissance revealed damage to the surrounding area but the lock gates, the primary targets, were untouched.<ref>Buxton 2008 Chapter 4.3</ref><ref>Dunn, Chapter 14, Section: \"The bombardment of Zeebrugge, 12 May 1917\"</ref>\n\nA bombardment of [[Ostend]] on 5 June by ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'' was more successful, destroying or damaging several vessels and damaging the dockyard.<ref>Dunn 2017 chapter 17, section \"The bombardment of Ostend, 5 June 1957\"</ref>{{efn-lr|Crossley (2013) makes the claim that [[SM UC-70|U-boat UC.70]] was destroyed in the 5 June attack.

[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Bruton was advised by a salvage expert to sail the ship stern-first to Portsmouth to reduce pressure on the bow but chose to disregard the advice. The ship sailed first to Dover on 21 October but on the next leg of the journey to Portsmouth two days later, in heavy seas, a major leak developed off [[Hastings]]. The crew evacuated while a tug boat maintained a line to the ship. They were able to reboard ''Terror'' the next day and brought her back into Dover harbour. During the second attempt to reach Portsmouth on 27 October, Bruton again refused to sail the ship backwards but changed his mind after the salvage expert left the ship. She was then towed backwards to Portsmouth, where it took until early January to repair the damage.<ref>Dunn, Chapter 13, Section: \"New monitors\"</ref>  A [[Court-martial|Court of Inquiry]] was called into the 23 October abandonment.

In 1920, Leo wrote his first printed sheet, ''Il Marchese'', at the age of 15. Following he wrote the monthly magazine ''Zibaldone dei giovani'' (1921), ''Il Toro'' (1923) and ''Il Dominio'' (1924), arousing attention for his young age and the style of writing. After the high school, Longanesi attended the [[University of Bologna]], gaining a bachelor's decree of law.\n\nAfter University, Longanesi became member of the worldly elite of the city, attending social circles, literary caf\u00e9s and nighthawk pubs, becoming friend to leading intellectual such as [[Galvano Della Volpe]], [[Giorgio Morandi]] and [[Vincenzo Cardarelli]], and young rising politicians like [[Leandro Arpinati]], [[Dino Grandi]] and [[Italo Balbo]], all future Fascist leading figures. During this time Longanesi became interested to politics, and in 1924 started a collaboration with ''L'Assalto'' (\"The Assault\"), a Fascist newspaper in Bologna. In the same year, he knew Mino Maccari, a famous painter, who introduced him in the socialite circles of Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cimmino|first=Alessandra|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/leopoldo-longanesi_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Longanesi, Leo|work=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|volume=65|editor=Treccani|date=2005}}</ref> With Maccari and famous writer [[Curzio Malaparte]], Longanesi started a cultural movement called ''Strapaese'' (literally \"great country\"), who saw the [[Italian Fascism]] as bearer of rural traditions and countrymen virtues.<ref name=Barbirati/> Living between Rome and Bologna, Longanesi with the magazine ''Il Selvaggio'' (\"The Savage\") from 1925 to 1929, and founded the weekly magazine ''L'Italiano'' (\"The Italian\"), from 1926 to 1942, headsquartered in Bologna, along with Maccari, American playwright [[Henry Furst]] and writer [[Giovanni Comisso]], former legionnaire of [[Italian Regency of Carnaro|Fiume]] with [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].

The cause of his dismissal was strong and irriverent piece on Senator Giuseppe Tanari, financer of the ''[[squadrismo]]'' (literally \"squadronism\"), a radical tendency inside Fascism, which members attacked, assaulted and sometimes killed political dissidents. His article was motivated by a fact happened on May 1931: Longanesi attended an displaying of conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] at the Bologna Communal Theatre, attended also by [[Galeazzo Ciano]], son-in-law of Mussolini, and Arpinati, Longanesi's old friend. At the end of the piece, Ciano and Arpinati called Toscanini to play ''[[Giovinezza]]'' (\"Youth\"), a popular song among the Fascists. Due to Toscanini refusal, Ciano and Arpinati left the theatre disappointed, and at the exit Toscanini was assaulted and slapped by radical Fascists for his dissent.

Despite his criticisms, Longanesi was chosen by the regime to organize a literary exhibition on Mussolini for the 10th anniversary of the [[March on Rome]], opened on 28 October 1932. After the began of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] in 1935, Longanesi gained the role of chief of the propaganda.

Despite the immediate success of the magazine, ''Omnibus'' was forced to close on 2 February 1939 by the [[Ministry of Popular Culture]] (Minculpop), apparently without reason but probably for the collaborations to the magazine by Jewish intellectuals like Moravia and anti-fascists like Pannunzio.

Longanesi was skeptical, despite the initial popular enthusiasm, of the Italian entrance in the [[Second World War]], thought that will be the ruin of Italy.<ref name=IC>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetculturale.it/it/493/leo-longanesi-la-fabbrica-del-dissenso-sommario|title=Leo Longanesi: la fabbrica del dissenso|website=Internet Culturale|date=2011}}</ref> Despite his personal beliefs, and faithful to his controversial and ecleptic nature, Longanesi chose to stay loyal to the Fascist regime, also working for ''Primato'' magazine, directed by former Public Education Minister [[Giuseppe Bottai]], and inventing war slogan such as \"''Taci! Il nemico ti ascolta''\" (Shut up! Enemy is listening you), \"''La patria si serve anche facendo la sentinella ad un bidone di benzina''\" (The fatherland could be served also keeping watch on an petrol barrel) and \"''Una pistola puntata contro l'Italia''\" (A gun aimed on Italy). After the failure of the [[Greco-Italian War]] in 1941 and [[Tunisian Campaign]] in 1942, Italy fell in crisis and grew always more subjected to Germany. On 25 July 1943, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Mussolini [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|overthrow the Fascism]], and Longanesi, along with Pannunzio and Benedetti wrote a piece that celebrate the apparent return of freedom and hope for the Italian retreat from war. However, the new Prime Minister [[Pietro Badoglio]] secretly sign the [[armistice of Cassibile]] with Allied Powers on 3 September 1943, while all Italy is under German direct military influences, and on 8 September with [[Badoglio Proclamation|a proclamation]], announce the switch of side from Axis to Allies, after which he fled to [[Brindisi]] with the [[House of Savoy|royal family]] and the government, left military and public authorities without orders. Like Italy broke up in a German-occupied north and an Allied-occupied south, on 16 September Longanesi fled from Rome to south, with his friends Mario Soldati, [[Steno (director)|Steno]] and [[Riccardo Freda]], arriving in the Molisian town of [[Vinchiaturo]] on 29 September.<ref name=Castellani>{{cite web|last=Castellani|first=Massimiliano|url=http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerArticolo.php?storyId=59048783ebf75|title=Nel luglio del 1943 Longanesi si ciment\u00f2 nel cinema girando \u201cDieci minuti di vita\u201d.

However, also in this case, Longanesi rapidly grew critical on the new anti-fascist political class, composed by old opportunists and new ambitious figures, united in a climate of political [[trasformismo|chameleontism]].<ref name=IC/> On 5 June 1944, Rome was finally liberated, and Longanesi moved again to the capital on 1 July, writing the comedy ''Il suo cavallo'' (\"His horse\"), a mockery of Mussolini depicted similar to Shakepseare's [[Richard III (Shakespeare)|Richard III]].\n\n===Post-war, political activism and death===\nOn January 1946, with the end of the war, Longanesi moved to [[Milan]] with his family, while his parents moved to [[Imola]], in the native [[Romagna]]. Shortly after, Longanesi accepted the offer of the industrialist Giovanni Monti, and founded the publishing house [[Longanesi|Longanesi & C.]]. on 1 February 1946. Simultaneously, he started the publishing of ''Il Libraio'' (\"The Bookseller\"), a bibliographic magazine, active from 1946 to 1949. Politically, Longanesi became a prominent opponent to the new republican democracy that substituted the Fascism, stating that: {{quote|Italy is a democracy in which one third of the citizens sigh for the past dictatorship, another wait for the Soviet one, and the last are conforming with the next of the Christian Democrats.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sorgi|first=Marcello|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/05/18/cultura/i-anni-di-longanesi-nellantologia-di-buttafuoco-hTMRw53S3FACNDjMfEwJOJ/pagina.html|title=I 70 anni di Longanesi nell\u2019antologia di Buttafuoco|newspaper=La Stampa|date=27 September 2017}}</ref>}} In his pieces, he jokes on both anti-fascists (\"There is who believe to be an anti-fascist only because Fascism never noticed him\") and ex-fascists reused in the new system (\"There is a question that we must never do: 'Where we have met before?'\").<ref>{{cite book|last1=Poma|first1=Stefano|last2=Veltri|first2=Elio|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=xoBdCQAAQBAJ|title=Il 25 aprile|work=L'italiano: Pensieri critici su un popolo acritico|editor=L'Universale|date=2015}}</ref>\n\nLonganesi was also a staunch [[anti-communist]]. During the [[Italian general election, 1948|1948 election]], fearing a victor of the Soviet-sponsored [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]], Longanesi and his favourite Indro Montanelli campaigned for the \"less worse\" [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC), printing and publishing pamphlets, fliers, posters and hosting ''Radio Garibaldi'', an illegal FM in Milan.<ref name=Merlo/><ref name=L&M/> After the defeat of the Front, Longanesi left ''Il Libraio'', and in 1950 Longanesi founded the magazine ''[[Il Borghese]]'', collaborating with Montanelli, Giovanni Ansaldo, Giuseppe Prezzolini, [[Giovanni Spadolini]], Alberto Savinio, Mario Tedeschi, Ennio Flaiano, Colette Rosselli, [[Irene Brin]], [[Goffredo Parise]], Mario Missiroli and [[Piero Buscaroli]]. In the mind of Longanesi, ''Il Borghese'' should will be expression of a new right-wing anti-communist movement, who he named \"Brothers of Italy's League\", organizing political circles in several cities. The movement rapidly grew, attracting both unsatisfied electors and excluded ones (especially farmers) by the 1950s [[Italian economic miracle|economic miracle]]. Longanesi and his followers thought that the new [[media culture]] and [[consumerism]] would destroying the traditions, disfiguring Italian landscapes and barbarising culture, also criticized the nullification of classes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Longanesi|first=Leo|title=La sua signora|date=1957}}</ref> He was hardly critical on the government, calling him unable to balance old traditions and modernity, and on democratic policy of [[universal suffrage]], stating:{{quote|The danger of democracies is the universal suffrage, so the masses. Leave liberty to the masses means lose liberty.}}\n\nIn early 1950s, Longanesi tried to transform his movement in a large right-wing party, formed by former Fascists, monarchists, Catholics, liberals and conservatives.<ref>{{cite news|last=Veneziani|first=Marcello|url=http://www.milanopost.info/2017/09/26/leo-longanesi-mori-insieme-alla-borghesia/|title=Leo Longanesi mor\u00ec insieme alla borghesia|newspaper=Il Tempo (re-edited by Milano Post)|date=26 September 2017}}</ref> He also visited the mayor of Naples [[Achille Lauro]], exponent of the monarchist [[Monarchist National Party|PNM]], to convince him to join and finance the movement, but his refusal and the lack of political ambitions of Longanesi caused the failure of the project.<ref>{{cite news|last=Veneziani|first=Marcello|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/quando-solista-longanesi-sognava-duetto-lauro-1069948.html|title=Quando il solista Longanesi sognava il duetto con Lauro|newspaper=il Giornale|date=23 November 2014}}</ref> However, Longanesi still supported the idea of national party, and in 1955 he organized a conference with the title \"What is the right[-wing] in Italy?\". Soon, his criticisms both on government and neo-fascists caused his isolation. In 1956, his patron Giovanni Monti purposed a separation between ''Il Borghese'' and Longanesi & Co., and the refusal of Longanesi was used a justification for oust him out the administration council. Thanks to some unknown connection in [[Confindustria]], as reported by his friend Giovanni Ansaldo, Longanesi was able to maintain ''Il Borghese'' for himself paying \u20a45,000,000. Always Ansaldo later told that Monti's operation was forced by governative pressures, especially from President [[Giovanni Gronchi]], a left-leaning Christian Democrat who personally disdained Longanesi and ''Il Borghese'', and hoped that without money it will be closed and Longanesi ruined.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ansaldo|first=Giovanni|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=_H5oAAAAMAAJ|title=Anni freddi|editor=Il Mulino|date=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mazzuca|first=Alberto|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=oQHqjwEACAAJ|title=Penne al vetriolo|editor=Minerva|date=2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 September 1957, while in his office, Longanesi suffered a heart attack.

By the marriage Longanesi had three children: Virginia (born 19 December 1939), Caterina (born 25 December 1941) and Paolo (born 6 April 1945).\n\nWhile at home, Longanesi performed his painting passion, causing some arguments with the wife for the style of his works, characterized by [[surrealism]]. He also believed in traditional and superstitious cures, such as using rabbit skin to handle [[sciatica]]. He also owned a collections of guns, passion inherited by his father, who was director of a gunpowder factory.<ref>{{cite news|last=Melati|first=Piero|url=http://www.repubblica.it/venerdi/articoli/2016/05/17/news/longanesi_teneva_famiglia_questa-139991077/|title=Anche Leo Longanesi teneva famiglia.

In 1926, he wrote his first great work, the \"Vade-mecum of the perfect Fascist\".

On July of the same year, Longanesi is chosen to direct ''L'Assalto'', who managed before 1931, when he resigned. The cause of his dismissal was strong and irriverent piece on Senator Giuseppe Tanari, financer of the ''[[squadrismo]]'' (literally \"squadronism\"), a radical tendency inside Fascism, which members attacked, assaulted and sometimes killed political dissidents. His article was motivated by a fact happened on May 1931: Longanesi attended an displaying of conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] at the Bologna Communal Theatre, attended also by [[Galeazzo Ciano]], son-in-law of Mussolini, and Arpinati, Longanesi's old friend. At the end of the piece, Ciano and Arpinati called Toscanini to play ''[[Giovinezza]]'' (\"Youth\"), a popular song among the Fascists. Due to Toscanini refusal, Ciano and Arpinati left the theatre disappointed, and at the exit Toscanini was assaulted and slapped by radical Fascists for his dissent.

He also moved ''L'Italiano'' and ''Il Selvaggio'' magazines in the capital, nevertheless both magazines were in decline and Longanesi directed them almost alone. Despite his criticisms, Longanesi was chosen by the regime to organize a literary exhibition on Mussolini for the 10th anniversary of the [[March on Rome]], opened on 28 October 1932. After the began of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] in 1935, Longanesi gained the role of chief of the propaganda. For his services to the Fascism, Longanesi requested the direction of any big newspaper, gaining a refuse by the regime, that feared that new magazines and papers, espacially under the direction of critics of the dictatorship, would undermined the Fascist's strict control over the press.<ref>{{cite book|last=Granata|first=Ivano|title=L'\u00abOmnibus\u00bb di Leo Longanesi.

After a month, however, Longanesi was fired for an unpleasanted photographical service on the regime.\n\nOn 3 April 1937, Longanesi created a new magazine: ''Omnibus'', an illsutrated news magazine on literature and arts, later described as the \"father of the Italian magazines\", especially for his use of photographs and images.<ref>{{cite news|last=Poma|first=Stefano|url=http://www.luniversaleditore.it/2017/11/22/omnibus-settimanale-cambio-giornalismo-italiano/|title=Omnibus, il settimanale che cambi\u00f2 il giornalismo italiano|newspaper=l'Universale|date=22 November 2017|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203015340/http://www.luniversaleditore.it/2017/11/22/omnibus-settimanale-cambio-giornalismo-italiano/|archive-date=3 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The magazine was published by [[Angelo Rizzoli]] (for the first 6 months by Arnoldo [[Mondadori]]), and presented notable and rising journalists and artists such as [[Indro Montanelli]], [[Alberto Moravia]], [[Vitaliano Brancati]], [[Ennio Flaiano]], [[Mario Soldati]], [[Mario Pannunzio]], [[Arrigo Benedetti]] and [[Alberto Savinio]]. Despite the immediate success of the magazine, ''Omnibus'' was forced to close on 2 February 1939 by the [[Ministry of Popular Culture]] (Minculpop), apparently without reason but probably for the collaborations to the magazine by Jewish intellectuals like Moravia and anti-fascists like Pannunzio. However, thanks again to his high livel connections, in 1940 Longanesi was appointed by the Minculpop itself as its technical-artistic consultant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Liucci|first=Raffaele|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=-fRkAAAAMAAJ|title=L'Italia borghese di Longanesi|editor=Marsilio|date=2002|page=48}}</ref> In the same period he was also chosen by Rizzoli as director of a book series, ''Il sof\u00e0 delle Muse'' (\"The Muses' sofa\"), publishing successful works like [[The Tartar Steppe]] (1940), [[Don Giovanni in Sicilia (novel)|Don Giovanni in Sicily]] (1941) and The Truth about Motta affair (1937, reedited in 1941).\n\n===Second World War===\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy declared war to [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[United Kingdom]], in alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] and other Fascist-inspired nations of the [[Axis Powers]]. Longanesi was skeptical, despite the initial popular enthusiasm, of the Italian entrance in the [[Second World War]], thought that will be the ruin of Italy.<ref name=IC>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetculturale.it/it/493/leo-longanesi-la-fabbrica-del-dissenso-sommario|title=Leo Longanesi: la fabbrica del dissenso|website=Internet Culturale|date=2011}}</ref> Despite his personal beliefs, and faithful to his controversial and ecleptic nature, Longanesi chose to stay loyal to the Fascist regime, also working for ''Primato'' magazine, directed by former Public Education Minister [[Giuseppe Bottai]], and inventing war slogan such as \"''Taci! Il nemico ti ascolta''\" (Shut up! Enemy is listening you), \"''La patria si serve anche facendo la sentinella ad un bidone di benzina''\" (The fatherland could be served also keeping watch on an petrol barrel) and \"''Una pistola puntata contro l'Italia''\" (A gun aimed on Italy). After the failure of the [[Greco-Italian War]] in 1941 and [[Tunisian Campaign]] in 1942, Italy fell in crisis and grew always more subjected to Germany. On 25 July 1943, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Mussolini [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|overthrow the Fascism]], and Longanesi, along with Pannunzio and Benedetti wrote a piece that celebrate the apparent return of freedom and hope for the Italian retreat from war. However, the new Prime Minister [[Pietro Badoglio]] secretly sign the [[armistice of Cassibile]] with Allied Powers on 3 September 1943, while all Italy is under German direct military influences, and on 8 September with [[Badoglio Proclamation|a proclamation]], announce the switch of side from Axis to Allies, after which he fled to [[Brindisi]] with the [[House of Savoy|royal family]] and the government, left military and public authorities without orders. Like Italy broke up in a German-occupied north and an Allied-occupied south, on 16 September Longanesi fled from Rome to south, with his friends Mario Soldati, [[Steno (director)|Steno]] and [[Riccardo Freda]], arriving in the Molisian town of [[Vinchiaturo]] on 29 September.<ref name=Castellani>{{cite web|last=Castellani|first=Massimiliano|url=http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerArticolo.php?storyId=59048783ebf75|title=Nel luglio del 1943 Longanesi si ciment\u00f2 nel cinema girando \u201cDieci minuti di vita\u201d.

However, also in this case, Longanesi rapidly grew critical on the new anti-fascist political class, composed by old opportunists and new ambitious figures, united in a climate of political [[trasformismo|chameleontism]].<ref name=IC/> On 5 June 1944, Rome was finally liberated, and Longanesi moved again to the capital on 1 July, writing the comedy ''Il suo cavallo'' (\"His horse\"), a mockery of Mussolini depicted similar to Shakepseare's [[Richard III (Shakespeare)|Richard III]].\n\n===Post-war, political activism and death===\nOn January 1946, with the end of the war, Longanesi moved to [[Milan]] with his family, while his parents moved to [[Imola]], in the native [[Romagna]]. Shortly after, Longanesi accepted the offer of the industrialist Giovanni Monti, and founded the publishing house [[Longanesi|Longanesi & C.]]. on 1 February 1946. Simultaneously, he started the publishing of ''Il Libraio'' (\"The Bookseller\"), a bibliographic magazine, active from 1946 to 1949. Politically, Longanesi became a prominent opponent to the new republican democracy that substituted the Fascism, stating that: {{quote|Italy is a democracy in which one third of the citizens sigh for the past dictatorship, another wait for the Soviet one, and the last are conforming with the next of the Christian Democrats.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sorgi|first=Marcello|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/05/18/cultura/i-anni-di-longanesi-nellantologia-di-buttafuoco-hTMRw53S3FACNDjMfEwJOJ/pagina.html|title=I 70 anni di Longanesi nell\u2019antologia di Buttafuoco|newspaper=La Stampa|date=27 September 2017}}</ref>}} In his pieces, he jokes on both anti-fascists (\"There is who believe to be an anti-fascist only because Fascism never noticed him\") and ex-fascists reused in the new system (\"There is a question that we must never do: 'Where we have met before?'\").<ref>{{cite book|last1=Poma|first1=Stefano|last2=Veltri|first2=Elio|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=xoBdCQAAQBAJ|title=Il 25 aprile|work=L'italiano: Pensieri critici su un popolo acritico|editor=L'Universale|date=2015}}</ref>\n\nLonganesi was also a staunch [[anti-communist]]: during the [[Italian general election, 1948|1948 election]], fearing a victor of the Soviet-sponsored [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]], Longanesi and his favourite Indro Montanelli campaigned for the \"less worse\" [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC), printing and publishing pamphlets, fliers, posters and hosting ''Radio Garibaldi'', an illegal FM in Milan.<ref name=Merlo/><ref name=L&M/> After the defeat of the Front, Longanesi left ''Il Libraio'', and in 1950 Longanesi founded the magazine ''[[Il Borghese]]'', collaborating with Montanelli, Giovanni Ansaldo, Giuseppe Prezzolini, [[Giovanni Spadolini]], Alberto Savinio, Mario Tedeschi, Ennio Flaiano, Colette Rosselli, [[Irene Brin]], [[Goffredo Parise]], Mario Missiroli and [[Piero Buscaroli]]. In the mind of Longanesi, ''Il Borghese'' should will be expression of a new right-wing anti-communist movement, who he named \"Brothers of Italy's League\", organizing political circles in several cities. The movement rapidly grew, attracting both unsatisfied electors and excluded ones (especially farmers) by the 1950s [[Italian economic miracle|economic miracle]]. Longanesi and his followers thought that the new [[media culture]] and [[consumerism]] would destroying the traditions, disfiguring Italian landscapes and barbarising culture, also criticized the nullification of classes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Longanesi|first=Leo|title=La sua signora|date=1957}}</ref> He was hardly critical on the government, calling him unable to balance old traditions and modernity, and on democratic policy of [[universal suffrage]], stating:{{quote|The danger of democracies is the universal suffrage, so the masses. Leave liberty to the masses means lose liberty.}}\n\nIn early 1950s, Longanesi tried to transform his movement in a large right-wing party, formed by former Fascists, monarchists, Catholics, liberals and conservatives.<ref>{{cite news|last=Veneziani|first=Marcello|url=http://www.milanopost.info/2017/09/26/leo-longanesi-mori-insieme-alla-borghesia/|title=Leo Longanesi mor\u00ec insieme alla borghesia|newspaper=Il Tempo (re-edited by Milano Post)|date=26 September 2017}}</ref> He also visited the mayor of Naples [[Achille Lauro]], exponent of the monarchist [[Monarchist National Party|PNM]], to convince him to join and finance the movement, but his refusal and the lack of political ambitions of Longanesi caused the failure of the project.<ref>{{cite news|last=Veneziani|first=Marcello|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/quando-solista-longanesi-sognava-duetto-lauro-1069948.html|title=Quando il solista Longanesi sognava il duetto con Lauro|newspaper=il Giornale|date=23 November 2014}}</ref> However, Longanesi still supported the idea of national party, and in 1955 he organized a conference with the title \"What is the right[-wing] in Italy?\". Soon, his criticisms both on government and neo-fascists caused his isolation. In 1956, his patron Giovanni Monti purposed a separation between ''Il Borghese'' and Longanesi & Co., and the refusal of Longanesi was used a justification for oust him out the administration council. Thanks to some unknown connection in [[Confindustria]], as reported by his friend Giovanni Ansaldo, Longanesi was able to maintain ''Il Borghese'' for himself paying \u20a45,000,000. Always Ansaldo later told that Monti's operation was forced by governative pressures, especially from President [[Giovanni Gronchi]], a left-leaning Christian Democrat who personally disdained Longanesi and ''Il Borghese'', and hoped that without money it will be closed and Longanesi ruined.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ansaldo|first=Giovanni|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=_H5oAAAAMAAJ|title=Anni freddi|editor=Il Mulino|date=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mazzuca|first=Alberto|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=oQHqjwEACAAJ|title=Penne al vetriolo|editor=Minerva|date=2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 September 1957, while in his office, Longanesi suffered a heart attack.

By the marriage Longanesi had three children: Virginia (born 19 December 1939), Caterina (born 25 December 1941) and Paolo (born 6 April 1945).\n\nWhile at home, Longanesi performed his painting passion, causing some arguments with the wife for the style of his works, characterized by [[surrealism]].
