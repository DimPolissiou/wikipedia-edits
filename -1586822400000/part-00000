Developing agents achieve this conversion by [[Redox|reducing]] the [[silver halide]]s, which are pale-colored, into [[silver]] metal, which is black (when a fine particle).<ref name=Ullmann>Karlheinz Keller et al. ''Photography'' in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a20_001}}</ref>  The conversion occurs within the gelatine matrix. The special feature of photography is that the developer acts more quickly on those particles of silver halides that have been exposed to light. Paper left in developer will eventually reduce all the silver halides and turn black. Generally, the longer a developer is allowed to work, the darker the image.\n\n==Chemical composition of developers==\nThe developer typically consists of a mixture of chemical compounds prepared as an aqueous solution.  For black-and-white photography, three main components of this mixture are:<ref name=Wall>Wall, E.J. (1890). ''Dictionary of Photography''. London: Hassel, Watson and Viney.</ref><sup>:115</sup>\n\n*developing agents. Popular developing agents are [[metol]] (monomethyl-p-aminophenol hemisulfate), [[phenidone]] (1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidinone), [[dimezone]] (4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpyrazolidin-3-one), and [[hydroquinone]] (benzene-1,4-diol).  \n*Alkaline agent such as [[sodium carbonate]], [[borax]], or [[sodium hydroxide]] to create the appropriately high [[pH]]\n*[[sodium sulfite]] to delay oxidation of the developing agents by atmospheric [[oxygen]].\n\nNotable standard formulas include Eastman Kodak D-76 film developer, D-72 print developer, and D-96 motion picture negative developer.<ref>\"[https://archive.org/stream/KodakDataBookVolume12/KodakDataBookVolume12_djvu.txt Full text of \"Kodak Data Book Volume 1 & 2\"]\". Accessed 30 September 2017</ref>\n\nHydroquinone is superadditive with metol, meaning that it acts to \"recharge\" the metol after it has been oxidised in the process of reducing silver in the emulsion. Sulfite in a developer not only acts to prevent aerial oxidation of the developing agents in solution, it also facilitates the regeneration of metol by hydroquinone (reducing compensation and adjacency effects) and in high enough concentrations acts as a silver halide solvent. The original lithographic developer contained formaldehyde (often added as paraformaldehyde powder) in a low sulfite/bisulfite solution.\n\nMost developers also contain small amounts of [[potassium bromide]] to modify and restrain the action of the developer<ref name=Wall/><sup>:218-219</sup> to suppress ''chemical fogging''. Developers for high contrast work have higher concentrations of hydroquinone and lower concentrations of metol and tend to use strong [[alkali]]s such as [[sodium hydroxide]] to push the pH up to around pH 11 to 12.\n\nMetol is difficult to dissolve in solutions of high salt content and instructions for mixing developer formulae therefore almost always list metol first. It is important to dissolve chemicals in the order in which they are listed. Some photographers add a pinch of sodium sulfite before dissolving the metol to prevent oxidation, but large amounts of sulfite in solution will make it very slow for metol to dissolve.\n\nBecause metol is relatively toxic and can cause skin sensitisation, modern commercial developers often use [[phenidone]] or [[dimezone S]] (4-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidone) instead. Hydroquinone can also be toxic to the human operator as well as environment; some modern developers replace it with [[ascorbic acid]], or vitamin C. This, however, suffers from poor stability. Ascorbate developers may have the advantage of being compensating and sharpness-enhancing, as oxidation by-products formed during development are acidic, meaning they retard development in and adjacent to areas of high activity. This also explains why ascorbate developers have poor keeping properties, as oxidised ascorbate is both ineffective as a developing agent and lowers the pH of the solution, making the remaining developing agents less active. Recently, claims for practical methods to improve the stability of ascorbate developers have been made by several experimenters {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.\n\nOther developing agents in use are [[p-aminophenol]], [[glycin]] (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)glycine), [[pyrogallol]], and [[catechol]]. When used in low sulfite developer composition, the latter two compounds cause gelatin to harden and stain in the vicinity of developing grains. Generally, the optical density of the stain increases in the heavily exposed (and heavily developed) area. This is a property that is highly sought after by some photographers because it increases negative contrast in relation to density, meaning that highlight detail can be captured without \"blocking\" (reaching high enough density that detail and tonality are severely compromised). Hydroquinone shares this property. However, the staining effect only appears in solutions with very little sulfite, and most hydroquinone developers contain substantial quantities of sulfite.\n\nIn the early days of photography, a wide range of developing agents were used, including [[chlorohydroquinone]], [[ferrous oxalate]],<ref name=Wall/><sup>:131</sup> [[hydroxylamine]], [[ferrous lactate]], [[ferrous citrate]], [[Eikonogen]], [[atchecin]], [[antipyrin]], [[Acetanilide|acetanilid]] and [[Amidol]] (which unusually required mildly acidic conditions).\n\nDevelopers also contain water softening agent to prevent calcium scum formation (e.g., EDTA salts, sodium tripolyphosphate, NTA salts, etc.).\n\nThe original lithographic developer was based upon a low sulfite/bisulfite developer with formaldehyde (added as the powder paraformaldehyde). The very low sulfite, high hydroquinone and high alkalinity encouraged \"infectious development\" (exposed developing silver halide crystals collided with unexposed silver halide crystals, causing them to also reduce) which enhanced the edge effect in line images.  These high energy developers had a short tray life, but when used within their tray life provided consistent usable results.\n\nModern lithographic developers contain hydrazine compounds, tetrazolium compounds and other amine contrast boosters to increase contrast without relying on the classic hydroquinone-only lithographic developer formulation. The modern formulae are very similar to rapid access developers (except for those additives) and therefore they enjoy long tray life. However, classic lithographic developers using hydroquinone alone suffers very poor tray life and inconsistent results.\n\n==Development==\nThe developer selectively reduces [[silver halide]] crystals in the emulsion to metallic [[silver]], but only those having [[latent image]] centres created by action of light.<ref>{{cite web|last=Woodworth|first=Chuck|title=How Film Works|url=http://www.unc.edu/~jimlee/film.htm|publisher=BYG Publishing|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref> The light sensitive layer or emulsion consists of silver halide crystals in a gelatin base. Two photons of light must be absorbed by one silver halide crystal to form a stable two atom silver metal crystal. The developer used generally will only reduce silver halide crystals that have an existing silver crystal. Faster exposure or lower light level films usually have larger grains because those images capture less light. Fine grain films, like Kodachrome, require more light to increase the chance that the halide crystal will absorb at least two quanta of light as they have a smaller cross sectional size.  Therefore, silver halide crystal size is proportional to film speed. The metallic silver image has dark (black) appearance. Once the desired level of reduction is achieved the development process is halted by washing in a dilute acid and then the undeveloped silver halide is removed by dissolving it in a thiosulfate solution, a process called ''[[photographic fixer|fixing]]''. Most commercial film developers use a dual solution or \"push\" (pushes the films speed) development (compensating developer, like Diafine) procedure where the reducing agent e.g. hydroquinone solution soaks into and swells the gelatin then the film is introduced into the alkaline solution which activates (lowers reduction potential) of the developer. The areas with the most light exposure use up the tiny amount of developer in the gelatin and stop making silver crystal before the film at that point is totally opaque. The areas that received the least light continue to develop because they haven't used up their developer. There is less contrast, but time is not critical and films from several customers and different exposures will develop satisfactorily.\n\nThe time over which development takes place, and the type of developer, affect the relationship between the density of silver in the developed image and the quantity of light. This study is called [[sensitometry]] and was pioneered by F Hurter & V C Driffield in the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Papagiannakis|first=E. E. Krieziz, D. P. Chrissoulidis & A.

There are three distinct processes used here. The [[C-41 process]] is used for almost all colour negative films and in this process [[dye coupler]]s in the emulsion react with the oxidized [[Color Developing Agent 4|colour developing agent]] in the developer solution to generate the visible dyes. An almost identical process is then used to produce colour prints from films. The developing agents used are derivates of [[paraphenylene diamine]].\n\nIn colour negative films,<ref>Photographic Almanac, 1956, p. 429\u2013423</ref> there are 3 types of dye couplers.  There are the normal cyan, magenta and yellow dye forming couplers, but also there is a magenta coloured cyan masking coupler and a yellow coloured magenta masking coupler.  These form respectively normal cyan dye, and magenta dye, but form an orange positive mask to correct colour.  In addition, there is a third type of coupler called a DIR (Developer Inhibitor Release) coupler.  This coupler releases a powerful inhibitor during dye formation, which affects edge effects and causes effects between layers to enhance overall image quality.\n\n==Reversal film development==\nIn [[Ektachrome]]-type ([[E-6 process]])<ref>{{cite web|title=KODAK PROFESSIONAL Chemicals, Process E-6|url=http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/j83/j83.pdf|publisher=Kodak|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>  transparencies, the film is first processed in an unusual developer containing [[phenidone]] and Hydroquinone-monosulfonate.  This black and white developer is used for 6:00 at 100.4[[Fahrenheit|\u00b0F]] (38[[Celsius|\u00b0C]]), with more time yielding \"push\" processing to increase the apparent film speed by reducing the Dmax, or maximum density. The first developer is the most critical step in Process E-6. The solution is essentially a black-and-white film developer, because it forms only a negative silver image in each layer of the film; no dye images are yet formed. Then, the film goes directly into the first wash for 2:00 at 100&nbsp;\u00b0F, which acts as a controlled [[stop bath]]. Next, the film goes into the reversal bath. This step prepares the film for the colour developer step. In this reversal bath, a chemical reversal agent is absorbed into the emulsion, with no chemical reaction taking place until the film enters the colour developer. The reversal process can also be carried out using 800 footcandle-seconds of light, which is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems.\n\nNext, the film is developed to completion in the colour developer bath, which contains [[Color Developing Agent 3|CD-3]] as the colour developing agent. When film enters the colour developer, the reversal agent absorbed by the emulsion in the reversal bath chemically fogs (or \"exposes\") the unexposed silver halide (if it has not already been fogged by light in the previous step). The colour developer acts on the chemically exposed silver halide to form a positive silver image. However, the metallic silver image formed in the first developer, which is a negative image, is not a part of the reaction that takes place in this step. What is being reacted in this stage is the \"leftover\" of the negative image, that is, a positive image.  \nAs the colour development progresses, metallic silver image is formed, but more importantly, the colour developing agent is oxidised. Oxidised colour developer molecules react with the couplers to form colour dyes ''in situ.'' Thus colour dye is formed at the site of development in each of the three layers of the film. Each layer of the film contains different couplers, which react with the same oxidised developer molecules but form different colour dyes. Next, the film goes into the pre-bleach (formerly conditioner) bath, which has a precursor of formaldehyde (as a dye preservative) and EDTA to \"kick off\" the bleach. Next, the film goes into a bleach solution. The bleach converts metallic silver into silver bromide, which is converted to soluble silver compounds in the fixer. The C-41 color negative process introduced in 1972 uses ferric EDTA. Reversal processes have used ferric EDTA at least since the introduction of the E-6 process in 1976. For [[Kodachrome]] ferric EDTA is used at least in the current [[K-14 process|K-14]] process. During bleaching, ferric EDTA is changed to ferrous EDTA before fixing, and final wash. \n: {{chem2|Fe^{3+}EDTA + Ag + Br- -> Fe^{2+}EDTA + AgBr}}\nPreviously [[potassium ferricyanide]] was often used as bleach. The most common processing chemistry for such films is [[E-6 process|E6]], derived from a long line of developers produced for the [[Ektachrome]] range of films.\n\nEktachrome papers are also available.\n\nStandard black and white stock can also be reversal processed to give black and white slides.<ref>Advanced Photography, 1980, p. 345</ref> After 'first development,' the initial silver image is then removed (e.g. using a potassium bichromate/sulfuric acid bleach, which requires a subsequent \"clearing bath\" to remove the chromate stain from the film). The unfixed film is then fogged (physically or chemically) and 'second-developed'.  However, the process works best with slow films such as Ilford Pan-F processed to give a high [[Gamma correction#Photography|gamma]]. Kodak's chemistry kit for reversing Panatomic-X (\"Direct Positive Film Developing Outfit\") used sodium bisulfate in place of sulfuric acid in the bleach, and used a fogging developer that was inherently unstable, and had to be mixed and used within a two-hour period. (If two rolls, the maximum capacity of a single pint of redeveloper, were to be processed in succession, the redeveloper had to be mixed while the first roll was in the first developer.)\n\n==Proprietary methods==\nThe [[K-14 process]] for [[Kodachrome]] films involves adding all the dyes to the emulsion during development.  Special equipment was needed to process Kodachrome. Since 2010, there has been no commercial entity that processes Kodachrome anywhere in the world.\n\nIn colour print development the [[Ilfochrome|Ilfochrome, or Cibachrome]], process also uses a print material with the dye-stuffs present and which are bleached out in appropriate places during developing. The chemistry involved here is wholly different from C41 chemistry; (it uses azo-dyes which are much more resistant to fading in sunlight).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| last= The [[British Journal]]\n| title = Photographic Almanac\n| publisher = Henry Greenwood and Co Ltd\n| year= 1956\n| location = London\n}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| first = M J \n| last= Langford\n| title = Advanced Photography\n| publisher = Focal Press\n| year= 1980\n| location = London\n}}\n{{photography subject}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Photographic Developer}}\n[[Category:Photographic chemicals]]\n[[Category:Photographic processes]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Bo\u00eete avec 5 doses de r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur universel en poudre au g\u00e9nol-hydroquinone de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Guilleminot 02.jpg|thumb|Developer powder using genol-hydroquinone.]]\nIn the [[Photographic processing|processing of photographic films]], plates or papers, the '''photographic developer''' (or just '''developer''') is one or more chemicals that convert the [[latent image]] to a visible image.

G.|title=Electromagnetics and optics|year=1992|publisher=World Scientific|location=River Edge, N.J.|isbn=978-9810208493|page=397|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IyTYgqCIQfcC&pg=PA397&lpg=PA397&dq=F+Hurter+%26+V+C+Driffield#v=onepage&q=F%20Hurter%20%26%20V%20C%20Driffield&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Colour development==\nIn colour and [[chromogenic]] black-and-white photography, a similar development process is used except that the reduction of silver simultaneously oxidizes the paraphenylene colour developing agent which then takes part in the production of dye-stuffs in the emulsion by reacting with the appropriate couplers. There are three distinct processes used here. The [[C-41 process]] is used for almost all colour negative films and in this process [[dye coupler]]s in the emulsion react with the oxidized [[Color Developing Agent 4|colour developing agent]] in the developer solution to generate the visible dyes. An almost identical process is then used to produce colour prints from films. The developing agents used are derivates of [[paraphenylene diamine]].\n\nIn colour negative films,<ref>Photographic Almanac, 1956, p. 429\u2013423</ref> there are 3 types of dye couplers.  There are the normal cyan, magenta and yellow dye forming couplers, but also there is a magenta coloured cyan masking coupler and a yellow coloured magenta masking coupler.  These form respectively normal cyan dye, and magenta dye, but form an orange positive mask to correct colour.  In addition, there is a third type of coupler called a DIR (Developer Inhibitor Release) coupler.  This coupler releases a powerful inhibitor during dye formation, which affects edge effects and causes effects between layers to enhance overall image quality.\n\n==Reversal film development==\nIn [[Ektachrome]]-type ([[E-6 process]])<ref>{{cite web|title=KODAK PROFESSIONAL Chemicals, Process E-6|url=http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/j83/j83.pdf|publisher=Kodak|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>  transparencies, the film is first processed in an unusual developer containing [[phenidone]] and Hydroquinone-monosulfonate.  This black and white developer is used for 6:00 at 100.4[[Fahrenheit|\u00b0F]] (38[[Celsius|\u00b0C]]), with more time yielding \"push\" processing to increase the apparent film speed by reducing the Dmax, or maximum density. The first developer is the most critical step in Process E-6. The solution is essentially a black-and-white film developer, because it forms only a negative silver image in each layer of the film; no dye images are yet formed. Then, the film goes directly into the first wash for 2:00 at 100&nbsp;\u00b0F, which acts as a controlled stop bath. Next, the film goes into the reversal bath. This step prepares the film for the colour developer step. In this reversal bath, a chemical reversal agent is absorbed into the emulsion, with no chemical reaction taking place until the film enters the colour developer. The reversal process can also be carried out using 800 footcandle-seconds of light, which is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems.\n\nNext, the film is developed to completion in the colour developer bath, which contains [[Color Developing Agent 3|CD-3]] as the colour developing agent. When film enters the colour developer, the reversal agent absorbed by the emulsion in the reversal bath chemically fogs (or \"exposes\") the unexposed silver halide (if it has not already been fogged by light in the previous step). The colour developer acts on the chemically exposed silver halide to form a positive silver image. However, the metallic silver image formed in the first developer, which is a negative image, is not a part of the reaction that takes place in this step. What is being reacted in this stage is the \"leftover\" of the negative image, that is, a positive image.  \nAs the colour development progresses, metallic silver image is formed, but more importantly, the colour developing agent is oxidised. Oxidised colour developer molecules react with the couplers to form colour dyes ''in situ.'' Thus colour dye is formed at the site of development in each of the three layers of the film. Each layer of the film contains different couplers, which react with the same oxidised developer molecules but form different colour dyes. Next, the film goes into the pre-bleach (formerly conditioner) bath, which has a precursor of formaldehyde (as a dye preservative) and EDTA to \"kick off\" the bleach. Next, the film goes into a bleach solution. The bleach converts metallic silver into silver bromide, which is converted to soluble silver compounds in the fixer. The C-41 color negative process introduced in 1972 uses ferric EDTA. Reversal processes have used ferric EDTA at least since the introduction of the E-6 process in 1976. For [[Kodachrome]] ferric EDTA is used at least in the current [[K-14 process|K-14]] process. During bleaching, ferric EDTA is changed to ferrous EDTA before fixing, and final wash. \n: {{chem2|Fe^{3+}EDTA + Ag + Br- -> Fe^{2+}EDTA + AgBr}}\nPreviously [[potassium ferricyanide]] was often used as bleach. The most common processing chemistry for such films is [[E-6 process|E6]], derived from a long line of developers produced for the [[Ektachrome]] range of films.\n\nEktachrome papers are also available.\n\nStandard black and white stock can also be reversal processed to give black and white slides.<ref>Advanced Photography, 1980, p. 345</ref> After 'first development,' the initial silver image is then removed (e.g. using a potassium bichromate/sulfuric acid bleach, which requires a subsequent \"clearing bath\" to remove the chromate stain from the film). The unfixed film is then fogged (physically or chemically) and 'second-developed'.  However, the process works best with slow films such as Ilford Pan-F processed to give a high [[Gamma correction#Photography|gamma]]. Kodak's chemistry kit for reversing Panatomic-X (\"Direct Positive Film Developing Outfit\") used sodium bisulfate in place of sulfuric acid in the bleach, and used a fogging developer that was inherently unstable, and had to be mixed and used within a two-hour period. (If two rolls, the maximum capacity of a single pint of redeveloper, were to be processed in succession, the redeveloper had to be mixed while the first roll was in the first developer.)\n\n==Proprietary methods==\nThe [[K-14 process]] for [[Kodachrome]] films involves adding all the dyes to the emulsion during development.  Special equipment was needed to process Kodachrome. Since 2010, there has been no commercial entity that processes Kodachrome anywhere in the world.\n\nIn colour print development the [[Ilfochrome|Ilfochrome, or Cibachrome]], process also uses a print material with the dye-stuffs present and which are bleached out in appropriate places during developing. The chemistry involved here is wholly different from C41 chemistry; (it uses azo-dyes which are much more resistant to fading in sunlight).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| last= The [[British Journal]]\n| title = Photographic Almanac\n| publisher = Henry Greenwood and Co Ltd\n| year= 1956\n| location = London\n}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| first = M J \n| last= Langford\n| title = Advanced Photography\n| publisher = Focal Press\n| year= 1980\n| location = London\n}}\n{{photography subject}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Photographic Developer}}\n[[Category:Photographic chemicals]]\n[[Category:Photographic processes]]\n", "name_user": "SuddenFrost", "label": "safe", "comment": "Linked tostop bath.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_developer"}

It is the third entry in the ''Houkai'' series and [[spiritual successor]] to ''Houkai Gakuen'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fangcun.gg.en.aisa&hl=en_US|title=Guns Girl - Honkai Gakuen - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> using many characters from the previous title in a separate story. The game is notable for incorporating a variety of genres from [[hack and slash]] and [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] to elements of [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], [[shoot 'em up]] and [[dungeon crawl]]ing across multiple single and multiplayer modes.\n\nIn addition to the mobile game, the storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' has players control a team of up to three characters, known as \"Valkyries\", in real-time combat against various enemies. During battle, players may freely move their character around the battlefield and switch between their three deployed Valkyries to adapt to various enemy types. Each Valkyrie has unique attack, evasion, switch, and ultimate skills, as well as a [[rock-paper-scissors]]-based character type to fulfill different team roles. Valkyrie stats and skills can be customized with various weapons and equipment, which can be improved by using in-game resources. New equipment (known as \"Stigmata\"), weapons, and Valkyries can obtained either through in-game crafting or through a [[Gacha game|gacha]] system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSingle-player game modes include the \"Story\" campaign, consisting of short stages punctuated by dialogue in [[cutscene]]s and [[full motion video]]s (FMVs), \"Chronicles\", a series of brief side stories that explore Valkyries' backstories, and \"Open World\", allowing exploration of a large open-ended field to gather materials and complete various challenge tasks, coupled with its own storyline. The game features various multiplayer cooperative and competitive modes such as \"Co-Op Raid\", where players team up to unlock legendary weapons; \"Memorial Arena\", where players compete against a set of bosses for the highest score; and \"Dirac Sea\", where players attempt to progress as far as possible through a gauntlet of battles to compete for high scores. Players are able to join groups of other players, called \"Armadas\", which allow for more opportunities for events and rewards. Armadas allow for limited requesting of materials and resources from other players in the Armada.\n\nOutside of battles, ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' allows players to interact with the Valkyrie and Stigmata characters through the \"Dorm\" mode. Upon completing character specific tasks, different characters may be able to move into the dorms, whereupon new character information and dialogues between those characters can be seen. Players can craft various pieces of furniture and design the layout of the dorm rooms to increase the \"comfort\" of the Valkyries and Stigmata therein. Greater comfort levels allow players to level up their dorm limits for more elaborate decoration. Players are able to visit and view each other's decorated dorm layouts.\n\nSecondary gameplay mechanics include various [[minigame]]s incorporating [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[shoot 'em up]] elements that allow players to gather various crafting and experience materials. Limited-time seasonal events may also include gameplay styles such as [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon crawling]] and [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] which are not normally seen in the main gameplay modes.\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' is set in an alternate version of Earth, plagued by catastrophes resulting from \"Honkai\" (roughly translates to \"the collapse\"). Honkai is largely viewed as a malevolent force with a will of its own, able to corrupt humans into undead creatures, manifest itself in the form of various monsters, and select various individuals known as \"Herrschers\" to imbue with god-like powers able to trigger apocalyptic events. The Honkai is a cyclic phenomenon, returning to end civilization on Earth each time it gets too advanced - the Previous Era ended 50,000 years prior to the game's start, after the 14th Herrscher defeated humanity.  \n\nIn the present day, various global factions exist to combat or take advantage of the power of Honkai. These include \"Schicksal\", a European-based peace keeping organization that deploys human warriors known as Valkyries to combat the Honkai; \"Anti-Entropy\", formerly the North American branch of Schicksal that objected to the use of human soldiers in favor of mechanized robots; and \"World Serpent\", a shadow organization manipulating events since the end of the Previous Era. \n\nPrior to the story's start, three Herrscher awakenings (or \"Impacts\") have occurred in the Current Era: the Herrscher of Reason who became the leader of Anti-Entropy instead of fighting humanity, the Herrscher of the Void who was sealed away by Schicksal under mysterious circumstances, and the Herrscher of Lightning who was prevented from fully awakening and sent to train her powers as a Valkyrie at Schicksal's St.Freya school.   \n\n=== Story ===\n{{plot|date=April 2020}}\nThe storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe game's story starts with three Valkyries-in-training (Kiana Kaslana, Mei Raiden, and Bronya Zaychik) boarding the ''Selene'', a hostile flying battleship. The three take control of the battleship, then subdue Bronya when she is abruptly controlled malevolently. Following the successful mission, the girls take a graduation exam, during which a mysterious voice contacts Kiana and informs her of her lost parents, Siegfried Kaslana and Cecilia Schariac.\n\nThe Valkyries then dispatch to Schicksal's Oceania Branch to recover the Gem of Desire following a local Honkai Eruption that decimated the area. The trio discovers Wendy, who was implanted with the Gem of Desire, and learn that Wendy triggered the Honkai Eruption due to a hatred of Schicksal, which had crippled Wendy. Bronya is controlled again and attacks, causing Wendy to transform into a Herrscher. Although Mei and Kiana are able to subdue both girls, Anti-Entropy forces appear and Bronya kidnaps Wendy and Mei. The Valkyries subsequently track Anti-Entropy to the hijacked ME Corp with Bronya's assistance. There, Bronya destroys the biochip in her brain to free herself from Cocolia's control and enable the Valkyries to escape, but leaving Wendy behind.\n\nSearching for a way to revive Bronya, Theresa Apocalypse creates a virtual datascape to find data on the biochip. Kiana is transported to a recreation of Siberia during the year 2000 in the midst of the 2nd Honkai War. Kiana meets virtual recreations of her parents, Siegfried and Cecilia, and while Siegfried is badly injured, Kiana and Cecilia team up and successfully defeat a recreation of 2nd Herrscher, Sirin. Upon Sirin's defeat, it is revealed that the events that Kiana experienced were a hallucination created from Kiana's desires by Sirin. Fu Hua captures Kiana and takes her to Schicksal HQ.\n\nTheresa, Mei, and Himeko ally with Anti-Entropy forces and storm Schicksal HQ to save Kiana, breaching its defenses with the ''Selene'' and the ''Hyperion''. While the Valkyries are successful in infiltrating Schicksal HQ, Rita Rossweisse and Fu Hua captures Himeko and Tesla. Otto Apocalypse successfully reawakens Sirin using Kiana's body as a host. Sirin dispatches Mei, Theresa, and the Anti-Entropy forces and engages Fu Hua in combat, stealing the 3rd Herrscher's power in the process. Himeko and Tesla, with Fu Hua's help, obtain a vial of anti-Honkai serum and a prototype Battlesuit imbued with a Herrscher's power. Himeko dons the Battlesuit and engages Sirin, fighting her to a standstill. Einstein uses the ''Selene''<nowiki/>'s cannon on Sirin, forcing her to retreat into \"Imaginary Space\" with Himeko being pulled in as well. Himeko duels with Sirin in the Imaginary Space and injects the anti-Honkai serum into Sirin, causing her to revert to Kiana. Suffering massive losses, the remaining Valkyries and Anti-Entropy retreat, and the world is left devastated in the wake of Sirin's attack. Himeko and Kiana both go missing.\n\nFour months after Sirin's attack, Mei, Theresa, and Bronya attempt to meet with an intel dealer named Gray Serpent in Arc City who claims to have seen the Herrscher of the Void, unaware that Otto Apocalypse had dispatched Rita to obtain his information as well. Rita seems to kill Gray Serpent and steals his cybernetic implants, leading the Valkyries to capture a cyborg girl called the Ningyo. Before they can extract the Ningyo's information, Rita intercepts the Valkyries, steals the data, and formats the Ningyo's memory. While Einstein and Tesla attempt to retrieve the Ningyo's lost memories, the team is contacted by Cocolia, who convinces them to help find the Gem of Desire. Gray Serpent, seeking payment for the Valkyrie's theft of the Ningyo, hacks into the ''Selene''. When Bronya follows Gray Serpent into virtual space, he traps Bronya in a data labyrinth formed from her memories to deter her. Bronya is able to escape, though she witnesses a record of the 1st Herrscher, Welt Young, and Einstein battling the World Serpent, who is sealed within the Sea of Quanta.\n\nBronya, Theresa, and Einstein travel to The Deep, where Bronya is reunited with Cocolia and childhood friends Rosalia and Liliya. Cocolia informs the trio that the Gem of Desire was lost in the Sea of Quanta, and must be retrieved. While Einstein prepares to enter the Eye of the Deep, a portal leading to the Sea of Quanta, Bronya attempts to reconcile with Cocolia. When Einstein discovers Cocolia scheming with Gray Serpent, Gray Serpent attacks Einstein and she vanishes. A swarm of Honkai emerges from the Eye of the Deep and attacks, leading Bronya to dive into the Sea of Quanta alone. In the Sea, Bronya is greeted by Joachim, a fragment of Welt Young. Joachim sends Bronya to multiple pocket universes as a test, during which Bronya is reunited with Seele Vollerei (Bronya's childhood friend who became stuck in quantum state following a failed X-10 Project years ago). In efforts to guide Seele out of the quanta, they resolve to escape together.\n\nAfter clearing some honkai beasts and being separated, Seele and Bronya reunite and try to escape the labyrinth. The two girls reach the edge of the Quanta but are caught by tentacles. Bronya makes a sacrifice and cuts the tentacles binding Seele, succumbing to the tentacles herself. However, Seele dislikes her powerlessness and the Dark Seele finally agreesto lend her power to Seele, and they use their combined power to rescue Bronya.\n\nBack to Kiana; after recapturing control of her body, she has been living in exile alone in the Arc City in order not to hurt others with the Herrscher personality. One night, she is fighting with Honkai beasts when Sirin seeks the opportunity to torment and brainwash Kiana, attempting to reawake the Herrscher. Fortunately, Fu Hua reaches Kiana's mind and drive Sirin away. Kiana holds hatred towards Fu Hua at first, but Fu Hua tells Kiana that their spirits are combined forever due to the power of Key of Deity, and that Kiana must learn to control the Herrscher power by herself. Under Fu Hua's training, Kiana finally succeeds, and returns to fighting against Honkai in Arc City.\n\n==Development==\nThe production team for ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' grew from a 7-person start to employing over 200 employees in 2018.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilibili.com/read/cv1141716/|title=\u5d29\u574f3\u4e0a\u7ebf\u4e24\u5e74 \u8001\u73a9\u5bb6\u4eec\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u96c6\u9526|last=\u6bcf\u65e5\u6e38\u620f\u83cc|website=www.bilibili.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> [[Mihoyo]] offers small amounts of in-game currency to users that fill out surveys about their experience in the game, allowing the game's [[Developer (software)|developers]] to adjust future events and tweak the game.

The continual updates and overhauls to ''Honkai Impact 3rd'''s events and mechanics make many of the reviews written (when the game released) inaccurate representations of the gameplay and quality of the game presently. Reviews say that the game has changed through ups and downs as it tweaked its system and tested in-game events to be ultimately more engaging and enjoyable.<ref name=\":02\" /> Similarly, many article guides exist for gameplay elements that no longer exist within the game, such as the base. The majority of recent articles (as of March 2020) concerning or mentioning ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' either announce its PC release, or mention it while featuring [[Genshin Impact]], Mihoyo's upcoming release. \n\nIn an article from 2017, ''Ungeek.com'' says that the game has some later-game systems that are unintuitive, and cites the large download size for a mobile game as a negative.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ungeek.ph/2017/11/honkai-impact-3-review-taking-mobile-anime-games-to-a-whole-new-level/|title=Honkai Impact 3 Review {{!}} Taking Mobile Anime Games to a Whole New Level!|last=Ki-Chan|first=Cosplayer|date=2017-11-28|website=Ungeek|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> The review praised the game's visual quality and the ease of learning to play the game, as well as the overall quality of the game, and positively recommended it.<ref name=\":22\" /> The article mentioned that the quality of the game was comparable to console games.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n== Weaponry ==\nThere are two types of equipment in the game: weapon and Stigmata. Each Valkyries has a certain weight bearing value. All kinds of weapons or Stigmata have some weight bearing values. The load value of the Stigmata worn by the player cannot exceed the upper limit of the character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bh3.mihoyo.com/valkyries|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Weapons ===\nEach Valkyrie can wear one weapon, and can only wear the corresponding type of weapon. The weapon types in the game include artillery, gun, sword, sickle, Samurai sword, cross, etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.17173.com/z/bh3/wuqi.shtml|title=weapon|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> these weapons have different weapon skills and attribute effects. If players want to obtain various weapons, they can obtain them through shop purchases, collection of weapon fragments synthesis, extraction from supplies, part of daily activity output and other ways. After players obtain various weapons, they can upgrade and evolve the weapons to improve their attribute effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honkaiimpact3.gamepedia.com/Weapon|title=weapon|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stigmata ===\nEach Valkyrie can wear three Stigmata. Players can gain attack, life, defense, understanding, and other attribute effects after wearing various Stigmata.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.17173.com/z/bh3/shengheng.shtml|title=stigmata inf|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Stigmata system can be divided into three types: upper, middle and lower. It can be divided into three attributes: attack, defense, and auxiliary. Each type of Stigmata cannot be cross-matched. Some Stigmata have their own Stigmata skills, while others don't. Players can also activate the hidden suit effect when wearing the Stigmata of the specified two or three-piece suit. In order to obtain all kinds of Stigmata, players can obtain all kinds of Stigmata by supplying cards and challenging all kinds of Dungeon levels. After players obtain various Stigmata, they can strengthen, evolve, cultivate and other operations to improve the attribute effect of Stigmata<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honkaiimpact3.gamepedia.com/Stigmata|title=stigamata|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Item boost ==\n=== Boost ===\nPlayers can enhance the attribute effect of these two kinds of equipment by strengthening weapons and Stigmata. Among them, Stigmata strengthening needs to consume some soul crystals, while weapon strengthening needs to consume ether crystals, Gemini ether crystals, etc. Players use reinforcement materials to strengthen these two kinds of equipment, which can enhance the experience value of the equipment. When the experience value of the equipment reaches the upper limit, the enhancement level of the two equipment will be increased, and the equipment can get a better attribute effect bonus. Players can obtain soul crystal or etheric crystal through logistics terminal, Valkyrie training base, scenario copy, etc.\n\n=== Evolution ===\nPlayers can improve the attribute effect of these two kinds of equipment by evolving weapons and Stigmata. All weapons or Stigmata can upgrade the star level through evolution function. After evolution, basic attributes and load value of weapons or Stigmata will be increased, and the upper-level limit will be increased at the same time. The more advanced weapons or Stigmata require evolutionary materials, the more difficult it is to obtain them. Players can obtain some evolutionary materials by challenging all kinds of scenario copies, extracting from supplies, purchasing in stores, etc.\n\n==Perk ==\nWhen players get high-level Stigmata, the Stigmata are often in the effect of not being identified. Players need to identify the Stigmata through sliding operation in the detailed interface of looking at the Stigmata. The Stigmata passing the identification will have an additional skill called \"affixes\". After identification, the affixes of Stigmata are completely random. If you are not satisfied with the current affixation skills, you can \"reset the affixes\" by swallowing the same traces. The affixation skills that can appear after swallowing are also randomization. Players can choose whether to keep the old affixes or adopt new affixes after swallowing. Even if the effect is unsatisfactory, it will not cause waste\n\n== Consumables ==\n=== Currency ===\n\nThere are gold coins and crystals in the game, each of which has different uses and obtaining methods. Among them, the gold coin can be obtained from the facilities in the home besides dropping through the copy, which is the most commonly used currency in the game. Players can use the crystal to exchange gold coins. When they exchange gold coins for the first time every day, they consume less crystal and have a critical hit effect. When they are lucky, they can use less crystal to exchange for 40000-50000 gold coins.\n\nCrystal is the hard currency in the game, which can be used to exchange most of the items in the game. For krypton free players, in addition to signing in and reaching the level challenge, they can complete some special tasks, and also get crystal supplement, or get some crystals by recharging \n\nCrystal can be exchanged for gold coins, physical strength, store consumption, supplies, etc.\n\n=== Other consumables ===\nThe consumables in the game include physical potions, sodas, etheric crystals, soul crystals, etc. These consumables can mainly increase the character's physical strength, strengthen Stigmata or weapons, etc. all consumables can be stacked in the backpack, and the players will consume these consumables, and the number of stacks will continue to decrease. Players can obtain all kinds of consumables through scenario copy, supply, activity reward, etc\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://honkaiimpact3.mihoyo.com/asia Official Asian website]\n* [https://honkaiimpact3.mihoyo.com/global Official global website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Honkai Impact 3rd}}\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Action role-playing video games]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:Gacha games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:Mobile games]]\n[[Category:Video games containing battle passes]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in China]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia video game articles for reassessment]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|3D action role-playing mobile game}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Honkai Impact 3rd\n| image = \n| developer = [[miHoYo]]\n| publisher = \n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| director = \n| producer = \n| designer = \n| programmer = \n| artist = \n| writer = \n| composer = \n| series = ''Honkai''\n| platforms = [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]]\n| released = {{vgrelease|[[PRC|CN]]|October 14, 2016|TW|May 18, 2017|[[Japan|JP]]|February 22, 2017|[[South Korea|KR]]|October 17, 2017|[[Southeast Asia|SEA]]|November, 2017|[[North America|NA]] and [[EU]]|March 28, 2018}}\n| genre = [[Action role-playing]], [[hack and slash]]\n| modes = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n}}\n\n'''''Honkai Impact 3rd'''''  (Chinese: \u5d29\u574f3) is a [[free-to-play]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[mobile game]] developed by [[miHoYo]]. It is the third entry in the ''Houkai'' series and [[spiritual successor]] to ''Houkai Gakuen'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fangcun.gg.en.aisa&hl=en_US|title=Guns Girl - Honkai Gakuen - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> using many characters from the previous title in a separate story. The game is notable for incorporating a variety of genres from [[hack and slash]] and [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] to elements of [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], [[shoot 'em up]] and [[dungeon crawl]]ing across multiple single and multiplayer modes.\n\nIn addition to the mobile game, the storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' has players control a team of up to three characters, known as \"Valkyries\", in real-time combat against various enemies. During battle, players may freely move their character around the battlefield and switch between their three deployed Valkyries to adapt to various enemy types. Each Valkyrie has unique attack, evasion, switch, and ultimate skills, as well as a [[rock-paper-scissors]]-based character type to fulfill different team roles. Valkyrie stats and skills can be customized with various weapons and equipment, which can be improved by using in-game resources. New equipment (known as \"Stigmata\"), weapons, and Valkyries can obtained either through in-game crafting or through a [[Gacha game|gacha]] system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSingle-player game modes include the \"Story\" campaign, consisting of short stages punctuated by dialogue in [[cutscene]]s and [[full motion video]]s (FMVs), \"Chronicles\", a series of brief side stories that explore Valkyries' backstories, and \"Open World\", allowing exploration of a large open-ended field to gather materials and complete various challenge tasks, coupled with its own storyline. The game features various multiplayer cooperative and competitive modes such as \"Co-Op Raid\", where players team up to unlock legendary weapons; \"Memorial Arena\", where players compete against a set of bosses for the highest score; and \"Dirac Sea\", where players attempt to progress as far as possible through a gauntlet of battles to compete for high scores. Players are able to join groups of other players, called \"Armadas\", which allow for more opportunities for events and rewards. Armadas allow for limited requesting of materials and resources from other players in the Armada.\n\nOutside of battles, ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' allows players to interact with the Valkyrie and Stigmata characters through the \"Dorm\" mode. Upon completing character specific tasks, different characters may be able to move into the dorms, whereupon new character information and dialogues between those characters can be seen. Players can craft various pieces of furniture and design the layout of the dorm rooms to increase the \"comfort\" of the Valkyries and Stigmata therein. Greater comfort levels allow players to level up their dorm limits for more elaborate decoration. Players are able to visit and view each other's decorated dorm layouts.\n\nSecondary gameplay mechanics include various [[minigame]]s incorporating [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[shoot 'em up]] elements that allow players to gather various crafting and experience materials. Limited-time seasonal events may also include gameplay styles such as [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon crawling]] and [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] which are not normally seen in the main gameplay modes.\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' is set in an alternate version of Earth, plagued by catastrophes resulting from \"Honkai\" (roughly translates to \"the collapse\"). Honkai is largely viewed as a malevolent force with a will of its own, able to corrupt humans into undead creatures, manifest itself in the form of various monsters, and select various individuals known as \"Herrschers\" to imbue with god-like powers able to trigger apocalyptic events. The Honkai is a cyclic phenomenon, returning to end civilization on Earth each time it gets too advanced - the Previous Era ended 50,000 years prior to the game's start, after the 14th Herrscher defeated humanity.  \n\nIn the present day, various global factions exist to combat or take advantage of the power of Honkai. These include \"Schicksal\", a European-based peace keeping organization that deploys human warriors known as Valkyries to combat the Honkai; \"Anti-Entropy\", formerly the North American branch of Schicksal that objected to the use of human soldiers in favor of mechanized robots; and \"World Serpent\", a shadow organization manipulating events since the end of the Previous Era. \n\nPrior to the story's start, three Herrscher awakenings (or \"Impacts\") have occurred in the Current Era: the Herrscher of Reason who became the leader of Anti-Entropy instead of fighting humanity, the Herrscher of the Void who was sealed away by Schicksal under mysterious circumstances, and the Herrscher of Lightning who was prevented from fully awakening and sent to train her powers as a Valkyrie at Schicksal's St.Freya school.   \n\n=== Story ===\n{{plot|date=April 2020}}\nThe storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe game's story starts with three Valkyries-in-training (Kiana Kaslana, Mei Raiden, and Bronya Zaychik) boarding the ''Selene'', a hostile flying battleship. The three take control of the battleship, then subdue Bronya when she is abruptly controlled malevolently. Following the successful mission, the girls take a graduation exam, during which a mysterious voice contacts Kiana and informs her of her lost parents, Siegfried Kaslana and Cecilia Schariac.\n\nThe Valkyries then dispatch to Schicksal's Oceania Branch to recover the Gem of Desire following a local Honkai Eruption that decimated the area. The trio discovers Wendy, who was implanted with the Gem of Desire, and learn that Wendy triggered the Honkai Eruption due to a hatred of Schicksal, which had crippled Wendy. Bronya is controlled again and attacks, causing Wendy to transform into a Herrscher. Although Mei and Kiana are able to subdue both girls, Anti-Entropy forces appear and Bronya kidnaps Wendy and Mei. The Valkyries subsequently track Anti-Entropy to the hijacked ME Corp with Bronya's assistance. There, Bronya destroys the biochip in her brain to free herself from Cocolia's control and enable the Valkyries to escape, but leaving Wendy behind.\n\nSearching for a way to revive Bronya, Theresa Apocalypse creates a virtual datascape to find data on the biochip. Kiana is transported to a recreation of Siberia during the year 2000 in the midst of the 2nd Honkai War. Kiana meets virtual recreations of her parents, Siegfried and Cecilia, and while Siegfried is badly injured, Kiana and Cecilia team up and successfully defeat a recreation of 2nd Herrscher, Sirin. Upon Sirin's defeat, it is revealed that the events that Kiana experienced were a hallucination created from Kiana's desires by Sirin. Fu Hua captures Kiana and takes her to Schicksal HQ.\n\nTheresa, Mei, and Himeko ally with Anti-Entropy forces and storm Schicksal HQ to save Kiana, breaching its defenses with the ''Selene'' and the ''Hyperion''. While the Valkyries are successful in infiltrating Schicksal HQ, Rita Rossweisse and Fu Hua captures Himeko and Tesla. Otto Apocalypse successfully reawakens Sirin using Kiana's body as a host. Sirin dispatches Mei, Theresa, and the Anti-Entropy forces and engages Fu Hua in combat, stealing the 3rd Herrscher's power in the process. Himeko and Tesla, with Fu Hua's help, obtain a vial of anti-Honkai serum and a prototype Battlesuit imbued with a Herrscher's power. Himeko dons the Battlesuit and engages Sirin, fighting her to a standstill. Einstein uses the ''Selene''<nowiki/>'s cannon on Sirin, forcing her to retreat into \"Imaginary Space\" with Himeko being pulled in as well. Himeko duels with Sirin in the Imaginary Space and injects the anti-Honkai serum into Sirin, causing her to revert to Kiana. Suffering massive losses, the remaining Valkyries and Anti-Entropy retreat, and the world is left devastated in the wake of Sirin's attack. Himeko and Kiana both go missing.\n\nFour months after Sirin's attack, Mei, Theresa, and Bronya attempt to meet with an intel dealer named Gray Serpent in Arc City who claims to have seen the Herrscher of the Void, unaware that Otto Apocalypse had dispatched Rita to obtain his information as well. Rita seems to kill Gray Serpent and steals his cybernetic implants, leading the Valkyries to capture a cyborg girl called the Ningyo. Before they can extract the Ningyo's information, Rita intercepts the Valkyries, steals the data, and formats the Ningyo's memory. While Einstein and Tesla attempt to retrieve the Ningyo's lost memories, the team is contacted by Cocolia, who convinces them to help find the Gem of Desire. Gray Serpent, seeking payment for the Valkyrie's theft of the Ningyo, hacks into the ''Selene''. When Bronya follows Gray Serpent into virtual space, he traps Bronya in a data labyrinth formed from her memories to deter her. Bronya is able to escape, though she witnesses a record of the 1st Herrscher, Welt Young, and Einstein battling the World Serpent, who is sealed within the Sea of Quanta.\n\nBronya, Theresa, and Einstein travel to The Deep, where Bronya is reunited with Cocolia and childhood friends Rosalia and Liliya. Cocolia informs the trio that the Gem of Desire was lost in the Sea of Quanta, and must be retrieved. While Einstein prepares to enter the Eye of the Deep, a portal leading to the Sea of Quanta, Bronya attempts to reconcile with Cocolia. When Einstein discovers Cocolia scheming with Gray Serpent, Gray Serpent attacks Einstein and she vanishes. A swarm of Honkai emerges from the Eye of the Deep and attacks, leading Bronya to dive into the Sea of Quanta alone. In the Sea, Bronya is greeted by Joachim, a fragment of Welt Young. Joachim sends Bronya to multiple pocket universes as a test, during which Bronya is reunited with Seele Vollerei (Bronya's childhood friend who became stuck in quantum state following a failed X-10 Project years ago). In efforts to guide Seele out of the quanta, they resolve to escape together.\n\nAfter clearing some honkai beasts and being separated, Seele and Bronya reunite and try to escape the labyrinth. The two girls reach the edge of the Quanta but are caught by tentacles. Bronya makes a sacrifice and cuts the tentacles binding Seele, succumbing to the tentacles herself. However, Seele dislikes her powerlessness and the Dark Seele finally agreesto lend her power to Seele, and they use their combined power to rescue Bronya.\n\nBack to Kiana; after recapturing control of her body, she has been living in exile alone in the Arc City in order not to hurt others with the Herrscher personality. One night, she is fighting with Honkai beasts when Sirin seeks the opportunity to torment and brainwash Kiana, attempting to reawake the Herrscher. Fortunately, Fu Hua reaches Kiana's mind and drive Sirin away. Kiana holds hatred towards Fu Hua at first, but Fu Hua tells Kiana that their spirits are combined forever due to the power of Key of Deity, and that Kiana must learn to control the Herrscher power by herself.

The continual updates and overhauls to ''Honkai Impact 3rd'''s events and mechanics make many of the reviews written (when the game released) inaccurate representations of the gameplay and quality of the game presently. Reviews say that the game has changed through ups and downs as it tweaked its system and tested in-game events to be ultimately more engaging and enjoyable.<ref name=\":02\" /> Similarly, many article guides exist for gameplay elements that no longer exist within the game, such as the base. The majority of recent articles (as of March 2020) concerning or mentioning ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' either announce its PC release, or mention it while featuring [[Genshin Impact]], Mihoyo's upcoming release. \n\nIn an article from 2017, ''Ungeek.com'' says that the game has some later-game systems that are unintuitive, and cites the large download size for a mobile game as a negative.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ungeek.ph/2017/11/honkai-impact-3-review-taking-mobile-anime-games-to-a-whole-new-level/|title=Honkai Impact 3 Review {{!}} Taking Mobile Anime Games to a Whole New Level!|last=Ki-Chan|first=Cosplayer|date=2017-11-28|website=Ungeek|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> The review praised the game's visual quality and the ease of learning to play the game, as well as the overall quality of the game, and positively recommended it.<ref name=\":22\" /> The article mentioned that the quality of the game was comparable to console games.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n== Weaponry ==\nThere are two types of equipment in the game: weapon and Stigmata. Each Valkyries has a certain weight bearing value. All kinds of weapons or Stigmata have some weight bearing values. The load value of the Stigmata worn by the player cannot exceed the upper limit of the character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bh3.mihoyo.com/valkyries|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Weapons ===\nEach Valkyrie can wear one weapon, and can only wear the corresponding type of weapon. The weapon types in the game include artillery, gun, sword, sickle, Samurai sword, cross, etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.17173.com/z/bh3/wuqi.shtml|title=weapon|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> these weapons have different weapon skills and attribute effects. If players want to obtain various weapons, they can obtain them through shop purchases, collection of weapon fragments synthesis, extraction from supplies, part of daily activity output and other ways. After players obtain various weapons, they can upgrade and evolve the weapons to improve their attribute effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honkaiimpact3.gamepedia.com/Weapon|title=weapon|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stigmata ===\nEach Valkyrie can wear three Stigmata. Players can gain attack, life, defense, understanding, and other attribute effects after wearing various Stigmata.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.17173.com/z/bh3/shengheng.shtml|title=stigmata inf|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Stigmata system can be divided into three types: upper, middle and lower. It can be divided into three attributes: attack, defense, and auxiliary. Each type of Stigmata cannot be cross-matched. Some Stigmata have their own Stigmata skills, while others don't. Players can also activate the hidden suit effect when wearing the Stigmata of the specified two or three-piece suit. In order to obtain all kinds of Stigmata, players can obtain all kinds of Stigmata by supplying cards and challenging all kinds of Dungeon levels. After players obtain various Stigmata, they can strengthen, evolve, cultivate and other operations to improve the attribute effect of Stigmata<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honkaiimpact3.gamepedia.com/Stigmata|title=stigamata|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Item boost ==\n=== Boost ===\nPlayers can enhance the attribute effect of these two kinds of equipment by strengthening weapons and Stigmata. Among them, Stigmata strengthening needs to consume some soul crystals, while weapon strengthening needs to consume ether crystals, Gemini ether crystals, etc. Players use reinforcement materials to strengthen these two kinds of equipment, which can enhance the experience value of the equipment. When the experience value of the equipment reaches the upper limit, the enhancement level of the two equipment will be increased, and the equipment can get a better attribute effect bonus. Players can obtain soul crystal or etheric crystal through logistics terminal, Valkyrie training base, scenario copy, etc.\n\n=== Evolution ===\nPlayers can improve the attribute effect of these two kinds of equipment by evolving weapons and Stigmata. All weapons or Stigmata can upgrade the star level through evolution function. After evolution, basic attributes and load value of weapons or Stigmata will be increased, and the upper-level limit will be increased at the same time. The more advanced weapons or Stigmata require evolutionary materials, the more difficult it is to obtain them. Players can obtain some evolutionary materials by challenging all kinds of scenario copies, extracting from supplies, purchasing in stores, etc.\n\n==Perk ==\nWhen players get high-level Stigmata, the Stigmata are often in the effect of not being identified. Players need to identify the Stigmata through sliding operation in the detailed interface of looking at the Stigmata. The Stigmata passing the identification will have an additional skill called \"affixes\". After identification, the affixes of Stigmata are completely random. If you are not satisfied with the current affixation skills, you can \"reset the affixes\" by swallowing the same traces. The affixation skills that can appear after swallowing are also randomization. Players can choose whether to keep the old affixes or adopt new affixes after swallowing. Even if the effect is unsatisfactory, it will not cause waste\n\n== Consumables ==\n=== Currency ===\n\nThere are gold coins and crystals in the game, each of which has different uses and obtaining methods. Among them, the gold coin can be obtained from the facilities in the home besides dropping through the copy, which is the most commonly used currency in the game. Players can use the crystal to exchange gold coins. When they exchange gold coins for the first time every day, they consume less crystal and have a critical hit effect. When they are lucky, they can use less crystal to exchange for 40000-50000 gold coins.\n\nCrystal is the hard currency in the game, which can be used to exchange most of the items in the game. For krypton free players, in addition to signing in and reaching the level challenge, they can complete some special tasks, and also get crystal supplement, or get some crystals by recharging \n\nCrystal can be exchanged for gold coins, physical strength, store consumption, supplies, etc.\n\n=== Other consumables ===\nThe consumables in the game include physical potions, sodas, etheric crystals, soul crystals, etc. These consumables can mainly increase the character's physical strength, strengthen Stigmata or weapons, etc. all consumables can be stacked in the backpack, and the players will consume these consumables, and the number of stacks will continue to decrease. Players can obtain all kinds of consumables through scenario copy, supply, activity reward, etc\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://honkaiimpact3.mihoyo.com/asia Official Asian website]\n* [https://honkaiimpact3.mihoyo.com/global Official global website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Honkai Impact 3rd}}\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Action role-playing video games]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:Gacha games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:Mobile games]]\n[[Category:Video games containing battle passes]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in China]]\n", "name_user": "DriftWrench2k", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honkai_Impact_3rd"}
