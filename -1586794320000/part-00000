He was named Gaja Ratna Tuladhar and belonged to a merchant family with a business house in [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]]. His father engaged in trade in Tibet before becoming a Buddhist monk taking up the name [[Dhammalok Mahasthavir]].\n\nGaja Ratna was eight years old when his father Das Ratna took him along to Lhasa in 1923 as his mother had died and he couldn't be left behind in Kathmandu.<ref>Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999).

There he decided that he wanted to study Buddhism in [[Sri Lanka]], and in 1929, he sailed to [[Colombo]]. He enrolled in the Vidyalankara Pirivena Buddhist college and became a novice monk, and was given the name Aniruddha.<ref>Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999). ''A Pilgrimage in China.''

Page 40.</ref> After spending five years in Sri Lanka and becoming proficient in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], Pali, [[Sanskrit]] and English, he went to [[Kusinagar]], India.\n\nAniruddha then traveled to Burma (now known as [[Myanmar]]) for further studies in Buddhism. A year later in 1937, he received higher ordination in [[Moulmein]]. He lived in Moulmein for 10 years studying Burmese and Buddhist literature. In the midst of his study, [[World War II]] came to Burma, and he had to keep moving to escape the fighting.<ref name=\"lumbini\" />\n\n==Return to Nepal==\nAniruddha returned to Nepal in 1946, and became the first editor of ''[[Dharmodaya]]'', a Buddhist magazine in [[Nepal Bhasa]] which started publication in 1947 from [[Kalimpong]].\n\nLater, he moved to Lumbini and dedicated himself to developing it as a place of pilgrimage. Lumbini was then a vacant patch surrounded by jungle. The spot, marked by an [[Ashokan pillar]], had been rediscovered in 1896.<ref>{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.lumbinitrust.org/articles/view/35| title =Major Events Happened in Lumbini| work = | publisher =Lumbini Development Trust| date=2011| accessdate = 10 May 2012}}</ref> Aniruddha built a monastery and a rest house, and extended assistance to pilgrims.<ref>National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States (1968).

He was named Gaja Ratna Tuladhar and belonged to a merchant family with a business house in [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]]. His father engaged in trade in Tibet before becoming a Buddhist monk taking up the name [[Dhammalok Mahasthavir]].\n\nGaja Ratna was eight years old when his father Das Ratna took him along to Lhasa in 1923 as his mother had died and he couldn't be left behind in Kathmandu.<ref>Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999).

There he decided that he wanted to study Buddhism in [[Sri Lanka]], and in 1929, he sailed to [[Colombo]]. He enrolled in the Vidyalankara Pirivena Buddhist college and became a novice monk, and was given the name Aniruddha.<ref>Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999). ''A Pilgrimage in China.''

A year later in 1937, he received higher ordination in [[Moulmein]]. He lived in Moulmein for 10 years studying Burmese and Buddhist literature. In the midst of his study, [[World War II]] came to Burma, and he had to keep moving to escape the fighting.<ref name=\"lumbini\" />\n\n==Return to Nepal==\nAniruddha returned to Nepal in 1946, and became the first editor of ''[[Dharmodaya]]'', a Buddhist magazine in [[Nepal Bhasa]] which started publication in 1947 from [[Kalimpong]].\n\nLater, he moved to Lumbini and dedicated himself to developing it as a place of pilgrimage. Lumbini was then a vacant patch surrounded by jungle. The spot, marked by an [[Ashokan pillar]], had been rediscovered in 1896.<ref>{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.lumbinitrust.org/articles/view/35| title =Major Events Happened in Lumbini| work = | publisher =Lumbini Development Trust| date=2011| accessdate = 10 May 2012}}</ref> Aniruddha built a monastery and a rest house, and extended assistance to pilgrims.<ref>National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States (1968).

This taste of freedom was, however, momentary for after the establishment of the Civil Government occurred in the Philippines in the year 1903, Bombon was ceded to the municipality of Calabanga .\n\nThe municipality of Bombon also became a barrio of Magarao, now another town in the second district.

He had also two daughters, Irene Buenagua Fernandez and Lydia Buenagua Guerrero, both retired teachers, and three other sons, Salvador, Melchor, and Diogenes Buenagua who are all still residing in Bombon.
