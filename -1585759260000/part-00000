The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba.

After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

women consistently since [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]].\n\n[[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], and the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], are the only teams to win multiple gold medals at the men's tournament since its introduction. The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] after beating the United States once again in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8259676/2012-london-olympics-brazil-shocks-us-women-volleyball-gold|title=Brazil wins women's volleyball gold|work=espn.go.com|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

Many outspoken or militarily active Loyalists were forced to flee, especially to their stronghold of New York City. [[William Franklin]], the royal governor of New Jersey and son of Patriot leader [[Benjamin Franklin]], became the leader of the Loyalists after his release from a Patriot prison in 1778.  He worked to build Loyalist military units to fight in the war, but the number of volunteers was much fewer than London expected.\n\nWhen their cause was defeated, about 15 percent of the Loyalists (65,000\u201370,000 people) fled to other parts of the [[British Empire]], to Britain itself, or to [[British North America]] (now Canada).  The southern Loyalists moved mostly to Florida, which had remained loyal to the Crown, and to British Caribbean possessions, often bringing along their slaves.  Northern Loyalists largely migrated to [[Upper Canada|Ontario]], [[Lower Canada|Quebec]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Nova Scotia]].

Elsewhere there were few British troops and the Patriots seized control of all levels of government, as well as supplies of arms and gunpowder. Vocal Loyalists recruited people to their side, often with the encouragement and assistance of royal governors. In the South Carolina back country, Loyalist recruitment oustripped that of Patriots. A [[Siege of Savage's Old Fields|brief siege]] at [[Ninety Six, South Carolina]] in the fall of 1775 was followed by a rapid rise in Patriot recruiting, and a [[Snow Campaign]] involving thousands of partisan militia resulted in the arrest or flight of most of the back country Loyalist leadership. North Carolina back country Scots and former [[War of the Regulation|Regulators]] joined forces in early 1776, but they were broken as a force at the [[Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]].\n\nBy July 4, 1776, the Patriots had gained control of virtually all territory in the Thirteen Colonies and expelled all royal officials. No one who openly proclaimed their loyalty to the Crown was allowed to remain, so Loyalists fled or kept quiet. Some of those who remained later gave aid to invading British armies or joined uniformed Loyalist regiments.<ref>Calhoun (1973){{Page needed|date=January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe British were forced out of Boston by March 17, 1776. They regrouped at Halifax and attacked [[Province of New York|New York]] in August, defeating [[George Washington]]'s army at [[Long Island]] and capturing [[New York City]] and its vicinity, and they occupied the mouth of the [[Hudson River]] until 1783. British forces seized control of other cities, including [[Philadelphia]] (1777), [[Savannah, Georgia]] (1778\u201383), and [[Charleston, South Carolina]] (1780\u201382). But 90% of the colonial population lived outside the cities, with the effective result that Congress represented 80 to 90 percent of the population. The British removed their governors from colonies where the Patriots were in control, but Loyalist civilian government was re-established in coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]<ref name = \"Gerogian\">[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2709 Georgia Encyclop\u00e6dia].</ref> from 1779 to 1782, despite presence of Patriot forces in the northern part of Georgia. Essentially, the British were only able to maintain power in areas where they had a strong military presence.\n\n===Numbers of Loyalists===\nHistorian Robert Calhoon wrote in 2000, concerning the proportion of Loyalists to Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies:\n\n{{quote|Historians' best estimates put the proportion of adult white male loyalists somewhere between 15 and 20 percent. Approximately half the colonists of European ancestry tried to avoid involvement in the struggle\u2014some of them deliberate pacifists, others recent immigrants, and many more simple apolitical folk. The patriots received active support from perhaps 40 to 45 percent of the white populace, and at most no more than a bare majority.<ref>Robert M.

Many active [[Church of England]] members became Loyalists. Some recent arrivals from Britain, especially those from Scotland, had a high Loyalist proportion. Loyalists in the southern colonies were suppressed by the local Patriots, who controlled local and state government. Many people\u2014including former [[War of the Regulation|Regulators]] in [[History of North Carolina|North Carolina]] \u2014 refused to join the rebellion, as they had earlier protested against corruption by local authorities who later became Revolutionary leaders. The oppression by the local [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Whigs]] during the Regulation led to many of the residents of backcountry North Carolina sitting out the Revolution or siding with the Loyalists.<ref name=\"Calhoon 1973\"/>\n\nIn areas under Patriot control, Loyalists were subject to [[Confiscation|confiscation of property]], and outspoken supporters of the king were threatened with public humiliation such as [[tarring and feathering]], or physical attack. It is not known how many Loyalist civilians were harassed by the Patriots, but the treatment was a warning to other Loyalists not to take up arms. In September 1775, [[William Drayton]] and Loyalist leader Colonel Thomas Fletchall signed a treaty of neutrality in the interior community of [[Ninety Six, South Carolina|Ninety Six]], [[South Carolina]].<ref>See [http://www.nps.gov/revwar/revolution_day_by_day/1775_main.html online NPS.gov]</ref> For actively aiding the British army when it occupied Philadelphia, two residents of the city were tried for treason, convicted, and executed by returning Patriot forces.<ref>{{cite book|author=Louis P.

Many of the slaves in the South joined the Loyalists with intentions of gaining freedom and escaping the South. About 800 did so; some helped rout the Virginia militia at the [[Battle of Kemp's Landing]] and fought in the [[Battle of Great Bridge]] on the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], wearing the motto \"Liberty to Slaves\", but this time they were defeated. The remains of their regiment were then involved in the evacuation of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], after which they served in the [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] area. Eventually the camp that they had set up there suffered an outbreak of smallpox and other diseases. This took a heavy toll, putting many of them out of action for some time. The survivors joined other British units and continued to serve throughout the war. Black colonials were often the first to come forward to volunteer and a total of 12,000 African Americans served with the British from 1775 to 1783.

About 4,000 Black Loyalists went to the British colonies of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]], where the British promised them land. They founded communities across the two provinces, many of which still exist today. Over 2,500 settled in [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia]], instantly making it the largest [[Free Negro|free black]] community in North America. However, the inferior grants of land they were given and the prejudices of white Loyalists in nearby [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]] who regularly harassed the settlement in events such as the [[Shelburne riots|Shelburne Riots]] in 1784, made life very difficult for the community.<ref name=\"blackloyalist.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110054520/http://www.blackloyalist.com/historypage2.html]</ref> In 1791 Britain's [[Sierra Leone Company]] offered to transport dissatisfied black Loyalists to the British colony of [[Sierra Leone]] in West Africa, with the promise of better land and more equality.

[[French Canadians]] had been satisfied by the British government's [[Quebec Act]] of 1774, which offered religious and linguistic toleration; in general, they did not sympathize with a rebellion that they saw as being led by Protestants from [[New England]], who were their commercial rivals and hereditary enemies. Most of the [[English language|English-speaking]] settlers had arrived following the British [[Conquest of 1760|conquest of Canada]] in 1759\u20131760, and were unlikely to support separation from Britain. The older British colonies, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Nova Scotia]] (including what is now [[New Brunswick]]) also remained loyal and contributed military forces in support of the Crown.\n\nIn late 1775 the [[Continental Army]] [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|sent a force into Quebec]], led by General [[Richard Montgomery]] and Colonel [[Benedict Arnold]], with the goal of convincing the residents of Quebec to join the Revolution. Although only a minority of Canadians openly expressed loyalty to King George, about 1,500 militia fought for the King in the [[Siege of Fort St. Jean]]. In the region south of Montreal that was occupied by the Continentals, some inhabitants supported the rebellion and raised two regiments to join the Patriot forces.<ref name = \"Wade\">Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians'' (1955) 1:67\u20139.</ref>\n\nIn [[Nova Scotia]], there were many Yankee settlers originally from New England, and they generally supported the principles of the revolution. The allegiance toward the rebellion waned as American Privateers [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution|raided Nova Scotia communities]] throughout the war. As well, the Nova Scotia government used the law to convict people for sedition and treason for supporting the rebel cause. There was also the influence of an influx of recent immigration from the British isles, and they remained neutral during the war, and the influx was greatest in Halifax.<ref>George Rawlyck, ''A People Highly Favoured Of God.

The Continental forces would be driven from Quebec in 1776, after the breakup of ice on the St. Lawrence River and the arrival of British transports in May and June. There would be no further serious attempt to challenge British control of present-day Canada until the [[War of 1812]].\n\nIn 1777, 1,500 Loyalist militia took part in the [[Saratoga campaign]] in New York, and surrendered with General [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October.  For the rest of the war, Quebec acted as a base for raiding expeditions, conducted primarily by Loyalists and Indians, against frontier communities.\n\n===Military service===\n{{Main|Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution}}\n\nThe Loyalists rarely attempted any political organization. They were often passive unless regular British army units were in the area. The British, however, assumed a highly activist Loyalist community was ready to mobilize and planned much of their strategy around raising Loyalist regiments. The British provincial line, consisting of Americans enlisted on a regular army status, enrolled 19,000 Loyalists (50 units and 312 companies). The maximum strength of the Loyalist provincial line was 9,700 in December 1780.<ref>Smith 264\u20137.</ref><ref name=\"Calhoon502\">Calhoon 502.</ref> In all about 19,000 at one time or another were soldiers or militia in British forces.<ref>Smith, p 267</ref>  Loyalists from South Carolina fought for the British in the [[Battle of Camden]]. The British forces at the [[Battle of Monck's Corner]] and the [[Battle of Lenud's Ferry]] consisted entirely of Loyalists with the exception of the commanding officer ([[Banastre Tarleton]]).<ref>Wilson, David.

About 13,000 went to Britain (including 5,000 free blacks). The total is 60\u201362,000 whites. A precise figure cannot be known because the records were incomplete and not accurate, and small numbers continued to leave after 1783. The 50,000 or-so white departures represented about 10% of the Loyalists (at 20-25% of the white population).<ref>{{cite book|author=Maya Jasanoff|title=Liberty's Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGKsn09oVwQC&pg=PA357|year=2012|publisher=Random House |page=357|isbn=9781400075478}}</ref> Loyalists (especially soldiers and former officials) could choose evacuation. Loyalists whose roots were not yet deeply embedded in the United States were more likely to leave; older people who had familial bonds and had acquired friends, property, and a degree of social respectability were more likely to remain in the US.<ref>Lohrenz (1998)</ref> The vast majority of the half-million white Loyalists, about 20-25% of the total number of whites, remained in the U.S. Starting in the mid\u20131780s a small percentage of those who had left returned to the United States. The exiles amounted to about 2% of the total US population of 3 million at the end of the war in 1783.\n\nAfter 1783 some former Loyalists, especially Germans from Pennsylvania, emigrated to Canada to take advantage of the British government's offer of free land. Many departed the fledgling U.S. because they faced continuing hostility. In another migration-motivated mainly by economic rather than political reasons-<ref>''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', \"Loyalists\"; and ''Liberty's Exiles'', Maya Jasanoff, pp.&nbsp;206\u2013208.</ref> more than 20,000 and perhaps as many as 30,000 \"Late Loyalists\" arrived in Ontario in the 1790s attracted by [[John Graves Simcoe|Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe]]'s policy of land and low taxes, one-fifth those in the US and swearing an oath{{when|date=May 2019}} of allegiance to the King.\n\nThe 36,000 or so who went to Nova Scotia were not well-received by the 17,000 Nova Scotians, who were mostly descendants of New Englanders settled there before the Revolution.<ref>Neil MacKinnon, ''This Unfriendly Soil: The Loyalist Experience in Nova Scotia, 1783\u20131791'' (1989)</ref>  \"They [the Loyalists]\", Colonel Thomas Dundas wrote in 1786, \"have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of Nova Scotia, who are even more disaffected towards the British Government than any of the new States ever were.

He was arrested, tried and executed in [[Toronto]], and later became heralded as a patriot to the movement which led to Canadian self governance.\n\nThe wealthiest and most prominent Loyalist exiles went to Great Britain to rebuild their careers; many received pensions. Many Southern Loyalists, taking along their slaves, went to the [[West Indies]], particularly to the [[Abaco Islands]] in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]].\n\nMany Loyalists brought their slaves with them to Canada (mostly to areas that later became [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]]) where [[Slavery in Canada|slavery was legal]]. An imperial law in 1790 assured prospective immigrants to Canada that their slaves would remain their property.<ref>Patrick Bode, \"Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves.\" ''Beaver'' 1993 73(3): 17\u201319</ref>\n\nThousands of [[Iroquois]] and other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were expelled from New York and other states and resettled in Canada. The descendants of one such group of Iroquois, led by [[Joseph Brant]] (Thayendenegea), settled at [[Six Nations of the Grand River]], the largest [[First Nations]] [[Indian reserve|reserve]] in Canada. (The remainder, under the leadership of [[Cornplanter]] (John Abeel) and members of his family, stayed in New York.) A group of African-American Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia but emigrated again for [[Sierra Leone]] after facing [[discrimination]] there.\n\nMany of the Loyalists were forced to abandon substantial properties to America restoration of or compensation for these lost properties was a major issue during the negotiation of the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1794. The British Government eventually settled several thousand claims for more than 3.5 million Pounds Sterling,{{citation needed|reason=Lead says 3.0 million; neither cites a reference|date=May 2019}} an enormous sum of money worth at that time.\n\n==Return of some expatriates==\nThe great majority of Loyalists never left the United States; they stayed on and were allowed to be citizens of the new country. Some became nationally prominent leaders, including [[Samuel Seabury]], who was the first Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and [[Tench Coxe]]. There was a small, but significant trickle of returnees who found life in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick too difficult. Perhaps 10% of the refugees to New Brunswick returned to the States as did an unknown number from Nova Scotia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Christopher |title=The Loyalists : revolution, exile, settlement |date=1984 |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |isbn=978-0771060939 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/loyalists00chri/page/244 244\u2013252] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/loyalists00chri/page/244 }}</ref>  Some Massachusetts Tories settled in the Maine District. Nevertheless, the vast majority never returned. Captain Benjamin Hallowell, who as Mandamus Councilor in Massachusetts served as the direct representative of the Crown, was considered by the insurgents as one of the most hated men in the Colony, but as a token of compensation when he returned from England in 1796, his son was allowed to regain the family house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jphs.org/colonial/capt-benjamin-hallowell-homestead.html|title=Jamaica Plain Historical Society - 'Colonial Era' Editor - - Capt Benjamin Hallowell Homestead|website=www.jphs.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904235939/http://www.jphs.org/colonial/capt-benjamin-hallowell-homestead.html|archivedate=2008-09-04}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexander Hamilton]] enlisted the help of the Tories (ex-Loyalists) in New York in 1782\u201385 to forge an alliance with moderate Whigs to wrest the State from the power of the [[George Clinton (vice president)|Clinton]] faction. Moderate Whigs in other States who had not been in favor of separation from Britain but preferred a negotiated settlement which would have maintained ties to the Mother Country mobilized to block radicals. Most States had rescinded anti-Tory laws by 1787, although the accusation of being a Tory was heard for another generation. Several hundred who had left for Florida returned to Georgia in 1783\u201384. South Carolina which had seen a bitter bloody internal civil war in 1780-82 adopted a policy of reconciliation that proved more moderate than any other state. About 4500 white Loyalists left when the war ended, but the majority remained behind. The state government successfully and quickly reincorporated the vast majority. During the war, pardons were offered to Loyalists who switched sides and joined the Patriot forces. Others were required to pay a 10% fine of the value of the property.  The legislature named 232 Loyalists liable for confiscation of their property, but most appealed and were forgiven.<ref>Rebecca Brannon, ''From Revolution to Reunion: The Reintegration of the South Carolina Loyalists'' (Univ of South Carolina Press, 2016).</ref> In Connecticut much to the disgust of the Radical Whigs the moderate Whigs were advertising in New York newspapers in 1782-83 that Tories who would make no trouble would be welcome on the grounds that their skills and money would help the State's economy. The Moderates prevailed. All anti-Tory laws were repealed in early 1783 except for the law relating to confiscated Tory estates: \"... the problem of the loyalists after 1783 was resolved in their favor after the War of Independence ended.\" In 1787 the last of any discriminatory laws were rescinded.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zeichner |first1=Oscar |title=The Rehabilitation of Loyalists in Connecticut |journal=The New England Quarterly |date=June 1938 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=308\u2013330|doi=10.2307/360711 |jstor=360711 }}</ref>\n\n==Impact of the departure of Loyalist leaders==\nThe departure of so many royal officials, rich merchants and landed gentry destroyed the hierarchical networks that had dominated most of the colonies.  A major result was that a Patriot/Whig elite supplanted royal officials and affluent Tories.<ref>The Forging of the New Nation, 1781-1789, Robert B. Morris, 1987, p. 163.</ref>  In New York, the departure of key members of the De Lancey, De Peyster, Walton and Cruger families undercut the interlocking families that largely owned and controlled the Hudson Valley.  Likewise in Pennsylvania, the departure of powerful families\u2014Penn, Allen, Chew, Shippen\u2014destroyed the cohesion of the old upper class there.  Massachusetts passed an act banishing forty-six Boston merchants in 1778, including members of some of Boston's wealthiest families.  The departure of families such as the Ervings, Winslows, Clarks, and Lloyds deprived Massachusetts of men who had hitherto been leaders of networks of family and clients. The bases of the men who replaced them were much different.  One rich Patriot in Boston noted in 1779 that \"fellows who would have cleaned my shoes five years ago, have amassed fortunes and are riding in chariots.\"  New men became rich merchants but they shared a spirit of republican equality that replaced the former elitism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon S.

Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon Patriots had to fight against.  Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war most remained in the new nation.  By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. \"In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.\"<ref>Francis Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (1995) pp 154-55, quote p 155.

The British government acted in expectation of that, especially in the southern campaigns in 1780\u201381. In practice, the number of Loyalists in military service was far lower than expected since Britain could not effectively protect them except in those areas where Britain had military control. The British were often suspicious of them, not knowing whom they could fully trust in such a conflicted situation; they were often looked down upon.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Devoss |first1=David |title=Divided Loyalties |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/divided-loyalties-107489501/ |website=smithsonianmag.com |publisher=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |accessdate=11 July 2019 |language=English |date=January 2004 |quote=Curiously, Tories suffered even at the hands of British officers who, for the most part, dismissed them as ignorant provincials.

Many outspoken or militarily active Loyalists were forced to flee, especially to their stronghold of New York City. [[William Franklin]], the royal governor of New Jersey and son of Patriot leader [[Benjamin Franklin]], became the leader of the Loyalists after his release from a Patriot prison in 1778.  He worked to build Loyalist military units to fight in the war, but the number of volunteers was much fewer than London expected.\n\nWhen their cause was defeated, about 15 percent of the Loyalists (65,000\u201370,000 people) fled to other parts of the [[British Empire]], to Britain itself, or to [[British North America]] (now Canada).  The southern Loyalists moved mostly to Florida, which had remained loyal to the Crown, and to British Caribbean possessions, often bringing along their slaves.  Northern Loyalists largely migrated to [[Upper Canada|Ontario]], [[Lower Canada|Quebec]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Nova Scotia]].  They called themselves [[United Empire Loyalist|United Empire Loyalists]].  Most were compensated with Canadian land or British cash distributed through formal claims procedures.  Loyalists who left the US received \u00a33 million{{citation needed|reason=Body of article says 3.5 millon; neither claims cites a source|date=May 2019}} or about 37% of their losses from the British government.

Others recalled the dreadful experiences of many [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebels after the failure of the last Jacobite rebellion as recently as 1745 who often lost their lands when the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] government won.<ref>See also N.

Elsewhere there were few British troops and the Patriots seized control of all levels of government, as well as supplies of arms and gunpowder. Vocal Loyalists recruited people to their side, often with the encouragement and assistance of royal governors. In the South Carolina back country, Loyalist recruitment oustripped that of Patriots. A [[Siege of Savage's Old Fields|brief siege]] at [[Ninety Six, South Carolina]] in the fall of 1775 was followed by a rapid rise in Patriot recruiting, and a [[Snow Campaign]] involving thousands of partisan militia resulted in the arrest or flight of most of the back country Loyalist leadership. North Carolina back country Scots and former [[War of the Regulation|Regulators]] joined forces in early 1776, but they were broken as a force at the [[Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]].\n\nBy July 4, 1776, the Patriots had gained control of virtually all territory in the Thirteen Colonies and expelled all royal officials. No one who openly proclaimed their loyalty to the Crown was allowed to remain, so Loyalists fled or kept quiet. Some of those who remained later gave aid to invading British armies or joined uniformed Loyalist regiments.<ref>Calhoun (1973){{Page needed|date=January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe British were forced out of Boston by March 17, 1776. They regrouped at Halifax and attacked [[Province of New York|New York]] in August, defeating [[George Washington]]'s army at [[Long Island]] and capturing [[New York City]] and its vicinity, and they occupied the mouth of the [[Hudson River]] until 1783. British forces seized control of other cities, including [[Philadelphia]] (1777), [[Savannah, Georgia]] (1778\u201383), and [[Charleston, South Carolina]] (1780\u201382). But 90% of the colonial population lived outside the cities, with the effective result that Congress represented 80 to 90 percent of the population. The British removed their governors from colonies where the Patriots were in control, but Loyalist civilian government was re-established in coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]<ref name = \"Gerogian\">[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2709 Georgia Encyclop\u00e6dia].</ref> from 1779 to 1782, despite presence of Patriot forces in the northern part of Georgia. Essentially, the British were only able to maintain power in areas where they had a strong military presence.\n\n===Numbers of Loyalists===\nHistorian Robert Calhoon wrote in 2000, concerning the proportion of Loyalists to Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies:\n\n{{quote|Historians' best estimates put the proportion of adult white male loyalists somewhere between 15 and 20 percent. Approximately half the colonists of European ancestry tried to avoid involvement in the struggle\u2014some of them deliberate pacifists, others recent immigrants, and many more simple apolitical folk. The patriots received active support from perhaps 40 to 45 percent of the white populace, and at most no more than a bare majority.<ref>Robert M.

Many people\u2014including former [[War of the Regulation|Regulators]] in [[History of North Carolina|North Carolina]] \u2014 refused to join the rebellion, as they had earlier protested against corruption by local authorities who later became Revolutionary leaders. The oppression by the local [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Whigs]] during the Regulation led to many of the residents of backcountry North Carolina sitting out the Revolution or siding with the Loyalists.<ref name=\"Calhoon 1973\"/>\n\nIn areas under Patriot control, Loyalists were subject to [[Confiscation|confiscation of property]], and outspoken supporters of the king were threatened with public humiliation such as [[tarring and feathering]], or physical attack. It is not known how many Loyalist civilians were harassed by the Patriots, but the treatment was a warning to other Loyalists not to take up arms. In September 1775, [[William Drayton]] and Loyalist leader Colonel Thomas Fletchall signed a treaty of neutrality in the interior community of [[Ninety Six, South Carolina|Ninety Six]], [[South Carolina]].<ref>See [http://www.nps.gov/revwar/revolution_day_by_day/1775_main.html online NPS.gov]</ref> For actively aiding the British army when it occupied Philadelphia, two residents of the city were tried for treason, convicted, and executed by returning Patriot forces.<ref>{{cite book|author=Louis P.

Many of the slaves in the South joined the Loyalists with intentions of gaining freedom and escaping the South. About 800 did so; some helped rout the Virginia militia at the [[Battle of Kemp's Landing]] and fought in the [[Battle of Great Bridge]] on the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], wearing the motto \"Liberty to Slaves\", but this time they were defeated. The remains of their regiment were then involved in the evacuation of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], after which they served in the [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] area. Eventually the camp that they had set up there suffered an outbreak of smallpox and other diseases. This took a heavy toll, putting many of them out of action for some time. The survivors joined other British units and continued to serve throughout the war. Black colonials were often the first to come forward to volunteer and a total of 12,000 African Americans served with the British from 1775 to 1783.

The British honored the pledge of freedom in New York City through the efforts of General [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], who recorded the names of African Americans who had supported the British in a document called the [[Book of Negroes]], which granted freedom to slaves who had escaped and assisted the British. About 4,000 Black Loyalists went to the British colonies of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]], where the British promised them land. They founded communities across the two provinces, many of which still exist today. Over 2,500 settled in [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia]], instantly making it the largest [[Free Negro|free black]] community in North America. However, the inferior grants of land they were given and the prejudices of white Loyalists in nearby [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]] who regularly harassed the settlement in events such as the [[Shelburne riots|Shelburne Riots]] in 1784, made life very difficult for the community.<ref name=\"blackloyalist.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110054520/http://www.blackloyalist.com/historypage2.html]</ref> In 1791 Britain's [[Sierra Leone Company]] offered to transport dissatisfied black Loyalists to the British colony of [[Sierra Leone]] in West Africa, with the promise of better land and more equality.

However, many of Quebec's inhabitants remained neutral, resisting service to either the British or the Americans.\n\nAlthough some Canadians took up arms in support of the rebellion, the majority remained loyal to the King. [[French Canadians]] had been satisfied by the British government's [[Quebec Act]] of 1774, which offered religious and linguistic toleration; in general, they did not sympathize with a rebellion that they saw as being led by Protestants from [[New England]], who were their commercial rivals and hereditary enemies. Most of the [[English language|English-speaking]] settlers had arrived following the British [[Conquest of 1760|conquest of Canada]] in 1759\u20131760, and were unlikely to support separation from Britain. The older British colonies, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Nova Scotia]] (including what is now [[New Brunswick]]) also remained loyal and contributed military forces in support of the Crown.\n\nIn late 1775 the [[Continental Army]] [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|sent a force into Quebec]], led by General [[Richard Montgomery]] and Colonel [[Benedict Arnold]], with the goal of convincing the residents of Quebec to join the Revolution. Although only a minority of Canadians openly expressed loyalty to King George, about 1,500 militia fought for the King in the [[Siege of Fort St. Jean]]. In the region south of Montreal that was occupied by the Continentals, some inhabitants supported the rebellion and raised two regiments to join the Patriot forces.<ref name = \"Wade\">Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians'' (1955) 1:67\u20139.</ref>\n\nIn [[Nova Scotia]], there were many Yankee settlers originally from New England, and they generally supported the principles of the revolution. The allegiance toward the rebellion waned as American Privateers [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution|raided Nova Scotia communities]] throughout the war. As well, the Nova Scotia government used the law to convict people for sedition and treason for supporting the rebel cause. There was also the influence of an influx of recent immigration from the British isles, and they remained neutral during the war, and the influx was greatest in Halifax.<ref>George Rawlyck, ''A People Highly Favoured Of God.

The Continental forces would be driven from Quebec in 1776, after the breakup of ice on the St. Lawrence River and the arrival of British transports in May and June. There would be no further serious attempt to challenge British control of present-day Canada until the [[War of 1812]].\n\nIn 1777, 1,500 Loyalist militia took part in the [[Saratoga campaign]] in New York, and surrendered with General [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October.  For the rest of the war, Quebec acted as a base for raiding expeditions, conducted primarily by Loyalists and Indians, against frontier communities.\n\n===Military service===\n{{Main|Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution}}\n\nThe Loyalists rarely attempted any political organization. They were often passive unless regular British army units were in the area. The British, however, assumed a highly activist Loyalist community was ready to mobilize and planned much of their strategy around raising Loyalist regiments. The British provincial line, consisting of Americans enlisted on a regular army status, enrolled 19,000 Loyalists (50 units and 312 companies). The maximum strength of the Loyalist provincial line was 9,700 in December 1780.<ref>Smith 264\u20137.</ref><ref name=\"Calhoon502\">Calhoon 502.</ref> In all about 19,000 at one time or another were soldiers or militia in British forces.<ref>Smith, p 267</ref>  Loyalists from South Carolina fought for the British in the [[Battle of Camden]].

A precise figure cannot be known because the records were incomplete and not accurate, and small numbers continued to leave after 1783. The 50,000 or-so white departures represented about 10% of the Loyalists (at 20-25% of the white population).<ref>{{cite book|author=Maya Jasanoff|title=Liberty's Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGKsn09oVwQC&pg=PA357|year=2012|publisher=Random House |page=357|isbn=9781400075478}}</ref> Loyalists (especially soldiers and former officials) could choose evacuation.

The exiles amounted to about 2% of the total US population of 3 million at the end of the war in 1783.\n\nAfter 1783 some former Loyalists, especially Germans from Pennsylvania, emigrated to Canada to take advantage of the British government's offer of free land. Many departed the fledgling U.S. because they faced continuing hostility. In another migration-motivated mainly by economic rather than political reasons-<ref>''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', \"Loyalists\"; and ''Liberty's Exiles'', Maya Jasanoff, pp.&nbsp;206\u2013208.</ref> more than 20,000 and perhaps as many as 30,000 \"Late Loyalists\" arrived in Ontario in the 1790s attracted by [[John Graves Simcoe|Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe]]'s policy of land and low taxes, one-fifth those in the US and swearing an oath{{when|date=May 2019}} of allegiance to the King.\n\nThe 36,000 or so who went to Nova Scotia were not well-received by the 17,000 Nova Scotians, who were mostly descendants of New Englanders settled there before the Revolution.<ref>Neil MacKinnon, ''This Unfriendly Soil: The Loyalist Experience in Nova Scotia, 1783\u20131791'' (1989)</ref>  \"They [the Loyalists]\", Colonel Thomas Dundas wrote in 1786, \"have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of Nova Scotia, who are even more disaffected towards the British Government than any of the new States ever were.

He was arrested, tried and executed in [[Toronto]], and later became heralded as a patriot to the movement which led to Canadian self governance.\n\nThe wealthiest and most prominent Loyalist exiles went to Great Britain to rebuild their careers; many received pensions. Many Southern Loyalists, taking along their slaves, went to the [[West Indies]], particularly to the [[Abaco Islands]] in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]].\n\nMany Loyalists brought their slaves with them to Canada (mostly to areas that later became [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]]) where [[Slavery in Canada|slavery was legal]]. An imperial law in 1790 assured prospective immigrants to Canada that their slaves would remain their property.<ref>Patrick Bode, \"Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves.\" ''Beaver'' 1993 73(3): 17\u201319</ref>\n\nThousands of [[Iroquois]] and other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were expelled from New York and other states and resettled in Canada.

(The remainder, under the leadership of [[Cornplanter]] (John Abeel) and members of his family, stayed in New York.) A group of African-American Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia but emigrated again for [[Sierra Leone]] after facing [[discrimination]] there.\n\nMany of the Loyalists were forced to abandon substantial properties to America restoration of or compensation for these lost properties was a major issue during the negotiation of the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1794. The British Government eventually settled several thousand claims for more than 3.5 million Pounds Sterling,{{citation needed|reason=Lead says 3.0 million; neither cites a reference|date=May 2019}} an enormous sum of money worth at that time.\n\n==Return of some expatriates==\nThe great majority of Loyalists never left the United States; they stayed on and were allowed to be citizens of the new country. Some became nationally prominent leaders, including [[Samuel Seabury]], who was the first Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and [[Tench Coxe]]. There was a small, but significant trickle of returnees who found life in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick too difficult.

Moderate Whigs in other States who had not been in favor of separation from Britain but preferred a negotiated settlement which would have maintained ties to the Mother Country mobilized to block radicals. Most States had rescinded anti-Tory laws by 1787, although the accusation of being a Tory was heard for another generation. Several hundred who had left for Florida returned to Georgia in 1783\u201384. South Carolina which had seen a bitter bloody internal civil war in 1780-82 adopted a policy of reconciliation that proved more moderate than any other state. About 4500 white Loyalists left when the war ended, but the majority remained behind. The state government successfully and quickly reincorporated the vast majority. During the war, pardons were offered to Loyalists who switched sides and joined the Patriot forces. Others were required to pay a 10% fine of the value of the property.

Morris, 1987, p. 163.</ref>  In New York, the departure of key members of the De Lancey, De Peyster, Walton and Cruger families undercut the interlocking families that largely owned and controlled the Hudson Valley.  Likewise in Pennsylvania, the departure of powerful families\u2014Penn, Allen, Chew, Shippen\u2014destroyed the cohesion of the old upper class there.  Massachusetts passed an act banishing forty-six Boston merchants in 1778, including members of some of Boston's wealthiest families.  The departure of families such as the Ervings, Winslows, Clarks, and Lloyds deprived Massachusetts of men who had hitherto been leaders of networks of family and clients. The bases of the men who replaced them were much different.  One rich Patriot in Boston noted in 1779 that \"fellows who would have cleaned my shoes five years ago, have amassed fortunes and are riding in chariots.\"  New men became rich merchants but they shared a spirit of republican equality that replaced the former elitism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon S.

Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon Patriots had to fight against.

Initially the tournament was played in the year following the Olympic Games, except for 1973 when no tournament was held, but since [[1991 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|1991]] the World Cup has been awarded in the year preceding the Olympic Games. The current champion is [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], which won its third title at the [[2019 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|2019 tournament]].\n\nThe current format of the competition involves 12 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], competing in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks. The World Cup (with exception of the 2019 edition) acts as the first qualification event for the following year's [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] with the top two teams qualifying.\n\nThe 13 World Cup tournaments have been won by six different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout this article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> have won six times (four as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]). The other World Cup winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] with 3 titles; [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] with 2 titles; and [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] and [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), with one title each.\n\nThis tournament should not be confused with the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe World Cup was created in 1965 with the purpose of partially filling the gap between the two most important volleyball tournaments, the [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|World Championship]], which take place in alternating 4-year cycles. The establishment of a third international competition would leave only one in every four years with no major events. The World Cup has a smaller entry than the World Championship, with at most 12 teams.\n\nThe World Cup was to be held in the year following the Olympic Games. The first two tournaments were for men's volleyball only; in 1973, a women's tournament was also introduced. Originally, each tournament had a different host, but in 1977 the competition was transferred to [[Japan]] on a permanent basis.\n\nIn the 1990s, the installment of annual international events such as the [[FIVB Volleyball World League|World League]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] made the original motivations for the creation of the World Cup obsolete. Instead of letting a consolidated event disappear for lack of interest, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] decided to change its format in 1991: it would be held in the year preceding, and not following, the Olympic Games; and it would be considered a first international Olympic qualification tournament, granting the winners a direct berth in the games.\n\nThis move saved the competition. The possibility of securing an early berth for the Olympic Games, thus avoiding extraneous and in some cases tight continental qualification procedures, became a consistent motivation for the national federations to participate in the World Cup. In 1995, the number of Olympic spots granted at the competition was increased to three, as it remained until 2011. In 2015 the number of spots was only two again.\n\n===Winners===\n[[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] (considered as the inheritors of the records of the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]), [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] are the only teams that have won the Men's World Cup more than once.\n\nThe Soviets took the gold at the opening edition of the tournament, in 1965. Four years later, the winner was also a socialist nation, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]].\n\nScheduled for [[Uruguay]], the 1973 edition was cancelled. In 1977, competition was resumed in Japan, and the Soviet Union came back for two wins in a row. In 1985, they were once again runners-up, but lost the decisive match to United States in five sets. In 1989, [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]] surprised the world and beat a rising [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] to take the gold.\n\nWith the competition now set as a qualifying event for the Olympic Games, the Soviet Union, led by Dmitri Fomin won the title in 1991, at the brink of dissolution. The Italians, who hadn't participated in this edition, finally conquered their gold medal in 1995. Inheriting a large part of the former Soviet volleyball programme, Russia were the winners in 1999.\n\nThe following two editions, played in 2003 and 2007 respectively, were won by favorites Brazil. In 2011, Russia regained the title, while the 2015 edition was won by the United States for the second time. Brazil won the title for the third time in 2019.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe World Cup is the most stable from all competition formulas employed by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]. The following rules apply:\n\n*The competition takes place in Japan.\n*Twelve teams participate in each event: ten qualified, two per invitation.\n**[[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] are always pre-qualified as host nation.\n**The winners of the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|FIVB World Championship]] in the previous year are automatically granted a spot.\n**The champion and runner-up of each continental tournament of that year are granted two spots.\n**Since the 1999 edition, only teams not yet qualified for the following Olympic Games can compete in the World Cup; hence hosts of the following year's Olympic Games are not allowed to compete. There will be an exception for the 2019 World Cup, as the tournament will be hosted by Japan and the country will host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].\n*The competition is divided in exactly two phases (called \"legs\").\n**Teams are divided in two pools.\n***At the first leg, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool.\n**At the second leg, each team plays one match against all the teams in the other pool.\n**Matches take place continuously through two weeks, with one-day breaks every two or three days. Each day, six matches are played.\n**Final standings are calculated by usual volleyball criteria: match points, numbers of matches won, sets ratio (the total number of sets won divided by the total number of sets lost), points ratio, direct confrontation.\n*Top two teams in overall standings, regardless of pools, qualify for the following [[Olympic Games]].\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in the case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%;

Men's World Cup]\n}}\n\nThe '''FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup''' is an international [[volleyball]] competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of ''{{lang|fr|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball}}'' ([[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]), the sport's global governing body. Initially the tournament was played in the year following the Olympic Games, except for 1973 when no tournament was held, but since [[1991 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|1991]] the World Cup has been awarded in the year preceding the Olympic Games. The current champion is [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], which won its third title at the [[2019 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|2019 tournament]].\n\nThe current format of the competition involves 12 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], competing in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks. The World Cup (with exception of the 2019 edition) acts as the first qualification event for the following year's [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] with the top two teams qualifying.\n\nThe 13 World Cup tournaments have been won by six different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout this article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> have won six times (four as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]). The other World Cup winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] with 3 titles; [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] with 2 titles; and [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] and [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), with one title each.\n\nThis tournament should not be confused with the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe World Cup was created in 1965 with the purpose of partially filling the gap between the two most important volleyball tournaments, the [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|World Championship]], which take place in alternating 4-year cycles. The establishment of a third international competition would leave only one in every four years with no major events. The World Cup has a smaller entry than the World Championship, with at most 12 teams.\n\nThe World Cup was to be held in the year following the Olympic Games. The first two tournaments were for men's volleyball only; in 1973, a women's tournament was also introduced. Originally, each tournament had a different host, but in 1977 the competition was transferred to [[Japan]] on a permanent basis.\n\nIn the 1990s, the installment of annual international events such as the [[FIVB Volleyball World League|World League]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] made the original motivations for the creation of the World Cup obsolete. Instead of letting a consolidated event disappear for lack of interest, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] decided to change its format in 1991: it would be held in the year preceding, and not following, the Olympic Games; and it would be considered a first international Olympic qualification tournament, granting the winners a direct berth in the games.\n\nThis move saved the competition. The possibility of securing an early berth for the Olympic Games, thus avoiding extraneous and in some cases tight continental qualification procedures, became a consistent motivation for the national federations to participate in the World Cup. In 1995, the number of Olympic spots granted at the competition was increased to three, as it remained until 2011. In 2015 the number of spots was only two again.\n\n===Winners===\n[[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] (considered as the inheritors of the records of the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]), [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] are the only teams that have won the Men's World Cup more than once.\n\nThe Soviets took the gold at the opening edition of the tournament, in 1965. Four years later, the winner was also a socialist nation, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]].\n\nScheduled for [[Uruguay]], the 1973 edition was cancelled. In 1977, competition was resumed in Japan, and the Soviet Union came back for two wins in a row. In 1985, they were once again runners-up, but lost the decisive match to United States in five sets. In 1989, [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]] surprised the world and beat a rising [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] to take the gold.\n\nWith the competition now set as a qualifying event for the Olympic Games, the Soviet Union, led by Dmitri Fomin won the title in 1991, at the brink of dissolution. The Italians, who hadn't participated in this edition, finally conquered their gold medal in 1995. Inheriting a large part of the former Soviet volleyball programme, Russia were the winners in 1999.\n\nThe following two editions, played in 2003 and 2007 respectively, were won by favorites Brazil. In 2011, Russia regained the title, while the 2015 edition was won by the United States for the second time. Brazil won the title for the third time in 2019.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe World Cup is the most stable from all competition formulas employed by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]. The following rules apply:\n\n*The competition takes place in Japan.\n*Twelve teams participate in each event: ten qualified, two per invitation.\n**[[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] are always pre-qualified as host nation.\n**The winners of the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|FIVB World Championship]] in the previous year are automatically granted a spot.\n**The champion and runner-up of each continental tournament of that year are granted two spots.\n**Since the 1999 edition, only teams not yet qualified for the following Olympic Games can compete in the World Cup; hence hosts of the following year's Olympic Games are not allowed to compete. There will be an exception for the 2019 World Cup, as the tournament will be hosted by Japan and the country will host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].\n*The competition is divided in exactly two phases (called \"legs\").\n**Teams are divided in two pools.\n***At the first leg, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool.\n**At the second leg, each team plays one match against all the teams in the other pool.\n**Matches take place continuously through two weeks, with one-day breaks every two or three days. Each day, six matches are played.\n**Final standings are calculated by usual volleyball criteria: match points, numbers of matches won, sets ratio (the total number of sets won divided by the total number of sets lost), points ratio, direct confrontation.\n*Top two teams in overall standings, regardless of pools, qualify for the following [[Olympic Games]].\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in the case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%;
