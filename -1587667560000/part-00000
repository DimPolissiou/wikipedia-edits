In 1873, with 2,000 residents, Brampton was incorporated as a town. The city was once known as \"The Flower Town of Canada\", a title based on its large [[greenhouse]] industry. Today, Brampton's major economic sectors include advanced manufacturing, [[retail]] administration, [[logistics]], [[information and communication technologies|information, and communication technologies]], food and beverage, [[life sciences]], and business services. Mass [[Immigration to Canada|immigration]] notably from the [[Indian subcontinent]] has greatly increased Brampton's population \u2013 from 10,000 in the 1950s to over 600,000 today.\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Haggert.gif|thumb|right|upright|[[John Haggert]], Brampton's first mayor]]\n\n{{main|History of Brampton}}\n{{see also|List of mayors of Brampton|Brampton Fall Fair|Brampton Library}}\n\nPrior to the 1800s, all real business in [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]] took place at Martin Salisbury's tavern. One mile distant at the corner of Main and Queen streets, now the recognised centre of Brampton, William Buffy's tavern was the only significant building.  At the time, the area was referred to as \"Buffy's Corners\". By 1834, John Elliott laid out the area in lots for sale, calling it \"Brampton\", which was soon adopted by others.<ref name=100years>\"Brampton's Beginning\" in ''Bramptons's 100th Anniversary as an Incorporated Town: 1873\u20131973'', Brampton: The Corporation of the Town of Brampton and the Brampton Centennial Committee, 1973, originally published in Ross Cumming, ed., ''Historical Atlas of Peel County'', n.p.: Walker and Miles, 1877.</ref>\n\nIn 1853, a small agricultural fair was set up by the newly initiated County Agricultural Society of the County of Peel, and was held at the corner of Main and Queen streets. Grains, produce, roots, and dairy products were up for sale. Horses and cattle, along with other lesser livestock, were also sold at market. This agricultural fair eventually became the modern [[Brampton Fall Fair]].\n\nIn that same year Brampton was incorporated as a village.<ref name=100years /> In 1866, the town became the county seat and the location of the [[Peel County Courthouse]] which was built in 1865-66; a three-storey County gaol was added at the rear in 1867.\n\nEdward Dale, an immigrant from [[Dorking]], England, established a flower nursery in Brampton<ref name=\"nursery\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.brampton.ca/en/Arts-Culture-Tourism/heritage/Pages/Brampton's-History.aspx\n  | title = Discover Brampton's History\n  | publisher = City of Brampton\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-08\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100221032242/http://www.brampton.ca/en/Arts-Culture-Tourism/heritage/Pages/Brampton%27s-History.aspx\n  | archivedate = 2010-02-21\n  }}</ref> shortly after his arrival in 1863.<ref name=\"bost\" /> Dale's Nursery became the town's largest<ref name=\"nursery\" /> and most prominent employer, developed a flower grading system,<ref name=\"bost\" /> and established a global export market for its products.<ref name=\"nursery\" /> The company [[chimney]] was a town landmark,<ref name=\"bost\" /> until [[Brampton City Council|Brampton Town Council]] allowed it to be torn down in 1977.<ref name=\"bost\" /> At its height, the company had 140 greenhouses,<ref name=\"acresof\">{{cite book\n |url          = http://acresofglass.com/\n |title        = Acres of Glass: The Story of the Dale Estate and How Brampton Became \"The Flower Town of Canada\"\n |last         = O'Hara\n |first        = Dale\n |publisher    = Eastendbooks\n |date         = September 2007\n |isbn         = 978-1-896973-39-5\n |accessdate   = 2010-04-08\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619202006/http://www.acresofglass.com/\n |archive-date = 2009-06-19\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> and was the largest [[Floriculture|cut flower]] business in North America,<ref name=\"floriculture\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.catchthespiritbrampton.com/flowertown.php\n  | title = Brampton's FlowerTown Heritage\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-08\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708123544/http://www.catchthespiritbrampton.com/flowertown.php\n  | archivedate = 2011-07-08\n  }}</ref> producing 20 million blooms and introducing numerous rose and orchid varietals and species to the market.<ref name=\"floriculture\" /> It also spurred the development of other nurseries in the town.

In 1907, the library received a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, set up by United States steel [[magnate]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]], to build a new, expanded library; it serves several purposes, featuring the [[Brampton Library]]. The [[Carnegie libraries]] were built on the basis of communities coming up with matching funds and guaranteeing maintenance.\n\nIn 1902, Sir [[William James Gage|William J. Gage]] (owner of Gage Publishing, a publishing house specializing in school text books) purchased a 3.25 acres (1.3 hectares) part of the gardens and lawns of the Alder Lea estate (now called Alderlea) that had been built on Main Street by Kenneth Chisolm in 1867 to 1870.

After several meetings in Clairville Hall, they decided to found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company. In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family's house on Queen Street West. The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business in what is now Brampton.\n\nIn 1974, the two townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore were incorporated into Brampton. The small pine added to the centre of the shield on the Brampton city flag represents Chinguacousy, honouring the [[Chippewa]] chief ''Shinguacose,'' \"The Small Pine.\" After this merger, outlying communities such as [[Bramalea, Ontario|Bramalea]], [[Heart Lake (Ontario)|Heart Lake]] and [[Professor's Lake]], [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], [[Tullamore, Ontario|Tullamore]], and [[Mayfield, Ontario|Mayfield]], were developed.\n\nIn 1963, the town established ''The Flower Festival of Brampton'', based on the ''[[Portland Rose Festival|Rose Festival]]'' of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] in the United States.

Located in the former [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]], it was Canada's first satellite community developed by one of the country's largest real estate developers, ''Bramalea Limited.'' The name \"Bramalea\" was created by the farmer William Sheard, who combined \"BRAM\" from Brampton, \"MAL\" from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now part of the city of [[Mississauga]]), and \"LEA\", an [[Old English]] word meaning meadow or grassland.  He sold the land to Brampton Leasing (the former name of the developer) and built one of Bramalea's first houses on Dixie Road.\n\nThe community was developed according to its detailed [[Strategic planning|master plan]], which included provisions for a parkland trail system and a \"downtown\" to include essential services and a [[shopping centre]]. The downtown's centrepiece was the Civic Centre, built in 1972 to include the city hall and library. Directly across Team Canada Drive, a shopping centre named [[Bramalea City Centre]] was built. These developments were connected by a long tunnel, planned to provide protection from winter weather. But, the tunnel has long since been closed due to safety issues. Urbanists have also found that pedestrians at street level make for much livelier and safer streets. Other features included a police station, fire hall, bus terminal, and a collection of seniors' retirement homes.\n\nEach phase of the new city was marked with progressing first letters of [[street name]]s. Development started with the \"A\" section, with street names such as Argyle, Avondale, and Aloma. Developers then created a \"B\" section, \"C\" section, and so forth. Children on the boundaries of these divisions would regularly compete in street hockey games, pitting, for example, the \"D\" section versus the \"E\" section.\n\nThe community was initially developed with a large number of recreational facilities, including tennis courts, playgrounds, hockey/lacrosse rinks and swimming pools. An extensive parkland trail and sidewalk system connects the entire community.\n\n===Region of Peel===\n[[File:pelbrm.PNG|thumb|right|Brampton in the Region of Peel]]\n[[File:Brampton City Hall.jpg|thumb|Brampton's City Hall]]\n\nIn 1974, the Ontario provincial government decided to update [[Peel County, Ontario|Peel County]]'s structure. It amalgamated a series of villages into the City of Mississauga. In addition, it created the new City of Brampton from the greater portion of the Townships of Chinguacousy and [[Toronto Gore Township, Ontario|Toronto Gore]], including Bramalea and the other communities such as Claireville, Ebenezer, Victoria, Springbrook, Churchville, [[Coleraine, Ontario|Coleraine]], and Huttonville. While only [[Huttonville, Ontario|Huttonville]] and [[Churchville, Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Churchville]] still exist as identifiable communities, other names like Claireville are re-emerging as names of new developments.\n\nThe province converted Peel County into the [[Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Regional Municipality of Peel]]. Brampton retained its role as the administrative centre of Peel Region, which it already had as [[county seat]]. The regional council chamber, the [[Peel Regional Police]] force, the public health department, and the region's only major museum, the [[Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives]], are all located in Brampton.\n\nThis change had its critics among those with a strong sense of local identities. Bramptonians feared urban sprawl would dissolve their town's personality.  Bramalea residents took pride in the built-from-scratch and organised structure that had come with their new city and did not want to give it up. Others in Bramalea accept they are part of Brampton, and they make up the tri-city area: Brampton, Heart Lake, Bramalea.\n\nIn 1972, Bramalea had built its civic centre. Two years later, when Brampton and Bramalea merged, the new city's council chambers and other facilities were installed in the Bramalea building. They were moved from Brampton's modest downtown locale. The library systems of Brampton and Bramalea were joined, resulting in a system of four locations.\n\nSome have questioned the [[Regional Municipality of Peel, Ontario#The Region's future|future of Peel Region]] as encompassing all of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon. The Mississauga council, led by Mayor [[Hazel McCallion]], voted to become a single-tier municipality and asked the provincial government to be separated from Peel Region. They argued the city has outgrown the need for a regional layer of government, and that Mississauga is being held back by supporting Brampton and Caledon with its municipal taxes.\n\n===Development as a city===\n[[File:Main Street Brampton.jpg|thumb|Main Street in downtown Brampton]] The early 1980s brought new residential development, as Brampton released large tracts of land to developers. In 1995 the large new suburban community of Springdale was developed, contributing to what people consider urban sprawl. This area had its largest boom in 1999, when development started to appear as far north as the city's border with [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]]. The region has designated this border as the line of demarcation for urban development until 2021. Neighbouring communities not part of Peel Region have also been dramatically affected by the city's sudden spurt. Part of the boundary between Brampton and [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]], for example, is nearly completely urbanized.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Cineplex Odeon]] closed the Capitol Theatre in Brampton. The City bought the facility in 1981 under the leadership of councillor Diane Sutter. It adapted the former [[vaudeville]] venue and movie house as a performing arts theatre, to be used also as a live music venue. It was renamed the Heritage Theatre. Renovations and maintenance were expensive. In 1983, Toronto consultants Woods Gordon reported to the City that, rather than continue \"pouring money\" into the Heritage, they should construct a new 750-seat facility with up-to-date features. This recommendation was adopted, and the city designated the 2005/06 as the Heritage Theatre's \"grand finale\" season. The city funded construction of the new [[Rose Theatre, Brampton|Rose Theatre]], which opened in September 2006.\n\n[[Carabram]] was founded in 1982, the result of volunteers from different ethnic communities wanting to organise a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship. The name was loosely related to Toronto's Caravan Festival of Cultures. Carabram's first event featured [[Italy|Italian]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], and [[West Indian]] pavilions. By 2003, the fair had 18 pavilions attracting 45,000 visitors. The national government of Canada had an anchor pavilion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for Carabram's 25th Anniversary in 2009.\n\nBrampton has grown to become one of the most diverse cities in Canada. In 1996, the city was 13% South Asian and 8.2% Black.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Statistics Canada |title=Electronic Area Profiles: Brampton |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census96/data/profiles/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=202027&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=35782&PRID=0&PTYPE=3&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=1996&THEME=34&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0  |accessdate=March 7, 2019 }}</ref> By 2016, the South Asian community grew exponentially to represent 44.3% of the city's population, while the Black population grew to 14%.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Census Profile, 2016 Census\nBrampton, Ontario and Peel, Regional municipality, Ontario</ref> Responding to a growing multi-cultural population, the Peel Board of Education introduced evening [[English language learning and teaching|English as a Second Language]] (ESL) classes at high schools. Originally taught by volunteers, the classes eventually were scheduled as daytime courses taught by paid instructors. In the 1980s, the public and Catholic board expanded its languages programs, offering night classes in 23 languages. These were introduced due to requests by parents, who wanted their children to learn their ancestral languages and heritage.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mayor Ken Whillans gained approval and funding for construction of a new city hall in Brampton's downtown. The facility was designed by local architects and constructed by Inzola Construction. Whillians did not get to see the opening of the new hall because of his death in August of that same year. With the return of city government to downtown Brampton, politicians and businesses allied to revitalize the core.\n\nChanges continue to reflect the growth of the city. In 1992 the City purchased the Brampton Fairgrounds, to be used for other development. The Agricultural Society relocated in 1997 outside the boundaries of the city to Heart Lake and Old School roads. In 1997 the Health Services Restructuring Commission (HSRC) decided to amalgamate [[Georgetown Hospital|Georgetown and District Memorial Hospital]], [[Etobicoke General Hospital]], and [[Peel Memorial Hospital]] as the [[William Osler Health Centre]]. It became what is now the province's 6th-largest hospital corporation.\n\nBrampton's 2003 Sesquicentennial celebrations boosted community spirit, reviving the tradition of a summer parade (with 100 floats), and creating other initiatives. To commemorate the town's history, the city under Mayor Fennell reintroduced floral projects to the community. These have included more plantings around town, the revival in 2005 of the city Parade, and participation in the Canada [[Communities in Bloom]] project.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nBrampton has a total land area of {{convert|265|sqkm}}. The City of Brampton is bordered by Highway 50 ([[Vaughan]]) to the East, Winston Churchill Boulevard ([[Halton Hills]]) to the West, Mayfield Road ([[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]]) to the north (except for a small neighbourhood, [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], which is part of Brampton despite extending somewhat north of Mayfield Road) and the [[hydro corridor]] ([[Mississauga]]) to the south except at Finch Avenue (at this point, Finch Avenue serves as the border between the two cities).\n\nBrampton features a [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') which is typical to much of [[Peel Region, Ontario|Peel Region]] and the rest of the Greater Toronto Area.\n\n{{Pearson Airport weatherbox}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = 30%;\n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    = Brampton annexed Chinguacousy Township\u2014including the highly populated communities of Bramalea and Heart Lake\u2014in 1974.<br />The 2011 population count was revised in 2016.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n|1858|50\n|1871|2090\n|1881|2920\n|1891|3252\n|1901|2748\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|3412\n|1921|4527\n|1931|5532\n|1941|5975\n|1951|8389\n|1961|18467\n|1971|41211\n|1981|149030\n|1991|234445\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|268251\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|325428\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|433806\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|523906\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|593638\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=4 | Visible minority and Aboriginal population ([[Canada 2016 Census]])\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Population group!!

In 1907, the library received a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, set up by United States steel [[magnate]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]], to build a new, expanded library; it serves several purposes, featuring the [[Brampton Library]]. The [[Carnegie libraries]] were built on the basis of communities coming up with matching funds and guaranteeing maintenance.\n\nIn 1902, Sir [[William James Gage|William J.

After several meetings in Clairville Hall, they decided to found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company. In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family's house on Queen Street West. The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business in what is now Brampton.\n\nIn 1974, the two townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore were incorporated into Brampton. The small pine added to the centre of the shield on the Brampton city flag represents Chinguacousy, honouring the [[Chippewa]] chief ''Shinguacose,'' \"The Small Pine.\" After this merger, outlying communities such as [[Bramalea, Ontario|Bramalea]], [[Heart Lake (Ontario)|Heart Lake]] and [[Professor's Lake]], [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], [[Tullamore, Ontario|Tullamore]], and [[Mayfield, Ontario|Mayfield]], were developed.\n\nIn 1963, the town established ''The Flower Festival of Brampton'', based on the ''[[Portland Rose Festival|Rose Festival]]'' of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] in the United States.

Located in the former [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]], it was Canada's first satellite community developed by one of the country's largest real estate developers, ''Bramalea Limited.'' The name \"Bramalea\" was created by the farmer William Sheard, who combined \"BRAM\" from Brampton, \"MAL\" from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now part of the city of [[Mississauga]]), and \"LEA\", an [[Old English]] word meaning meadow or grassland.  He sold the land to Brampton Leasing (the former name of the developer) and built one of Bramalea's first houses on Dixie Road.\n\nThe community was developed according to its detailed [[Strategic planning|master plan]], which included provisions for a parkland trail system and a \"downtown\" to include essential services and a [[shopping centre]]. The downtown's centrepiece was the Civic Centre, built in 1972 to include the city hall and library. Directly across Team Canada Drive, a shopping centre named [[Bramalea City Centre]] was built. These developments were connected by a long tunnel, planned to provide protection from winter weather. But, the tunnel has long since been closed due to safety issues. Urbanists have also found that pedestrians at street level make for much livelier and safer streets. Other features included a police station, fire hall, bus terminal, and a collection of seniors' retirement homes.\n\nEach phase of the new city was marked with progressing first letters of [[street name]]s. Development started with the \"A\" section, with street names such as Argyle, Avondale, and Aloma. Developers then created a \"B\" section, \"C\" section, and so forth. Children on the boundaries of these divisions would regularly compete in street hockey games, pitting, for example, the \"D\" section versus the \"E\" section.\n\nThe community was initially developed with a large number of recreational facilities, including tennis courts, playgrounds, hockey/lacrosse rinks and swimming pools. An extensive parkland trail and sidewalk system connects the entire community.\n\n===Region of Peel===\n[[File:pelbrm.PNG|thumb|right|Brampton in the Region of Peel]]\n[[File:Brampton City Hall.jpg|thumb|Brampton's City Hall]]\n\nIn 1974, the Ontario provincial government decided to update [[Peel County, Ontario|Peel County]]'s structure. It amalgamated a series of villages into the City of Mississauga. In addition, it created the new City of Brampton from the greater portion of the Townships of Chinguacousy and [[Toronto Gore Township, Ontario|Toronto Gore]], including Bramalea and the other communities such as Claireville, Ebenezer, Victoria, Springbrook, Churchville, [[Coleraine, Ontario|Coleraine]], and Huttonville. While only [[Huttonville, Ontario|Huttonville]] and [[Churchville, Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Churchville]] still exist as identifiable communities, other names like Claireville are re-emerging as names of new developments.\n\nThe province converted Peel County into the [[Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Regional Municipality of Peel]]. Brampton retained its role as the administrative centre of Peel Region, which it already had as [[county seat]]. The regional council chamber, the [[Peel Regional Police]] force, the public health department, and the region's only major museum, the [[Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives]], are all located in Brampton.\n\nThis change had its critics among those with a strong sense of local identities. Bramptonians feared urban sprawl would dissolve their town's personality.  Bramalea residents took pride in the built-from-scratch and organised structure that had come with their new city and did not want to give it up. Others in Bramalea accept they are part of Brampton, and they make up the tri-city area: Brampton, Heart Lake, Bramalea.\n\nIn 1972, Bramalea had built its civic centre. Two years later, when Brampton and Bramalea merged, the new city's council chambers and other facilities were installed in the Bramalea building. They were moved from Brampton's modest downtown locale. The library systems of Brampton and Bramalea were joined, resulting in a system of four locations.\n\nSome have questioned the [[Regional Municipality of Peel, Ontario#The Region's future|future of Peel Region]] as encompassing all of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon. The Mississauga council, led by Mayor [[Hazel McCallion]], voted to become a single-tier municipality and asked the provincial government to be separated from Peel Region. They argued the city has outgrown the need for a regional layer of government, and that Mississauga is being held back by supporting Brampton and Caledon with its municipal taxes.\n\n===Development as a city===\n[[File:Main Street Brampton.jpg|thumb|Main Street in downtown Brampton]] The early 1980s brought new residential development, as Brampton released large tracts of land to developers. In 1995 the large new suburban community of Springdale was developed, contributing to what people consider urban sprawl. This area had its largest boom in 1999, when development started to appear as far north as the city's border with [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]]. The region has designated this border as the line of demarcation for urban development until 2021. Neighbouring communities not part of Peel Region have also been dramatically affected by the city's sudden spurt. Part of the boundary between Brampton and [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]], for example, is nearly completely urbanized.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Cineplex Odeon]] closed the Capitol Theatre in Brampton. The City bought the facility in 1981 under the leadership of councillor Diane Sutter. It adapted the former [[vaudeville]] venue and movie house as a performing arts theatre, to be used also as a live music venue. It was renamed the Heritage Theatre. Renovations and maintenance were expensive. In 1983, Toronto consultants Woods Gordon reported to the City that, rather than continue \"pouring money\" into the Heritage, they should construct a new 750-seat facility with up-to-date features. This recommendation was adopted, and the city designated the 2005/06 as the Heritage Theatre's \"grand finale\" season. The city funded construction of the new [[Rose Theatre, Brampton|Rose Theatre]], which opened in September 2006.\n\n[[Carabram]] was founded in 1982, the result of volunteers from different ethnic communities wanting to organise a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship. The name was loosely related to Toronto's Caravan Festival of Cultures. Carabram's first event featured [[Italy|Italian]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], and [[West Indian]] pavilions. By 2003, the fair had 18 pavilions attracting 45,000 visitors. The national government of Canada had an anchor pavilion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for Carabram's 25th Anniversary in 2009.\n\nBrampton has grown to become one of the most diverse cities in Canada. In 1996, the city was 13% South Asian and 8.2% Black.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Statistics Canada |title=Electronic Area Profiles: Brampton |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census96/data/profiles/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=202027&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=35782&PRID=0&PTYPE=3&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=1996&THEME=34&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0  |accessdate=March 7, 2019 }}</ref> By 2016, the South Asian community grew exponentially to represent 44.3% of the city's population, while the Black population grew to 14%.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Census Profile, 2016 Census\nBrampton, Ontario and Peel, Regional municipality, Ontario</ref> Responding to a growing multi-cultural population, the Peel Board of Education introduced evening [[English language learning and teaching|English as a Second Language]] (ESL) classes at high schools. Originally taught by volunteers, the classes eventually were scheduled as daytime courses taught by paid instructors. In the 1980s, the public and Catholic board expanded its languages programs, offering night classes in 23 languages. These were introduced due to requests by parents, who wanted their children to learn their ancestral languages and heritage.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mayor Ken Whillans gained approval and funding for construction of a new city hall in Brampton's downtown. The facility was designed by local architects and constructed by Inzola Construction. Whillians did not get to see the opening of the new hall because of his death in August of that same year. With the return of city government to downtown Brampton, politicians and businesses allied to revitalize the core.\n\nChanges continue to reflect the growth of the city. In 1992 the City purchased the Brampton Fairgrounds, to be used for other development. The Agricultural Society relocated in 1997 outside the boundaries of the city to Heart Lake and Old School roads. In 1997 the Health Services Restructuring Commission (HSRC) decided to amalgamate [[Georgetown Hospital|Georgetown and District Memorial Hospital]], [[Etobicoke General Hospital]], and [[Peel Memorial Hospital]] as the [[William Osler Health Centre]]. It became what is now the province's 6th-largest hospital corporation.\n\nBrampton's 2003 Sesquicentennial celebrations boosted community spirit, reviving the tradition of a summer parade (with 100 floats), and creating other initiatives. To commemorate the town's history, the city under Mayor Fennell reintroduced floral projects to the community.

To restore the Earth's balance, Lord Shiva requested [[Wise old man|Sage]] [[Agasthya]] to travel South. Agasthya however, expressed his wish to witness the wedding. Lord Shiva assured to grant divine vision to the sage, which would enable him to witness the wedding from any part of the world.\n\nAgasthya travelled southward and resided in Kalasa from where he watched the wedding.

Santara or Bhairarasa is the name of a medieval ruling dynasty of Karnataka, India.\n\nJinadatta Raya or Jindutt Rai, a Jain prince from Mathura in Northern India was the supposed founder of the dynasty. He is said to have migrated to the town of [[Humcha]] with an idol of the Jain deity Padmavati, laying the foundation of the kingdom in Humcha. The area covered by their kingdom included territories in the Malenadu region as well as the coastal districts of Karnataka. The dynasty founded by Jinadatta appears to have split into two branches by the 12 century C.E. One branch being stationed in Hosagunda of Shimoga district and Kalasa in the Western ghats, chikkamagalur district. Gradually these branches (or only the Kalasa branch) shifted their capitals to Keravashe (14&nbsp;km north-east of Karkala) and Karkala both in the old South Canara district. Hence the territory they ruled was also known as the Kalasa-Karkala kingdom.\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] mentions that the Bhairarasas or Santaras were among the powerful [[Bunt (community)|Bunt]]<ref>[[Edgar Thurston|Thurston, Edgar]]; [[K.

It is the sequel to the 2001 game ''[[Toki Tori]]''. The game was originally announced in December 2011 with an intended release for Spring 2012 for [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[iOS]] devices (and was later announced as a [[Wii U]] game), but the game was pushed back due to longer than expected development times. The game was released on April 4, 2013 for [[Wii U]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Toki Tori 2 Wii U Release Date Revealed|url=http://gameslatestnews.com/2013/03/21/toki-tori-2-wii-u-release-date-revealed-1436/|work=GamesLatestNews|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref> and on July 11, 2013 on Steam for Windows and for Mac OS X.\n\nOn September 12, 2013, an updated version called '''''Toki Tori 2+''''' was released for the Wii U, adding new music and puzzles. ''Toki Tori 2+'' made its [[Linux]] debut with [[Humble Bundle]] X launched on January 3, 2014.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/toki-tori-2--two-tribes-and-linux.2975 |title=Toki Tori 2+, Two Tribes And Linux| publisher=Gamingonlinux|date=21 January 2014}}</ref> The game was later released in Japan and published by Rainy Frog on September 3, 2014.<ref name=\"TT2 Japan\"/> ''Toki Tori 2+'' launched for the [[Nintendo Switch]] on February 23, 2018.<ref name=\"NL cites Switch release\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay in ''Toki Tori 2'' is very different compared to its predecessor, the main difference being the absence of items for Toki Tori to use. These are replaced by two skills that Toki Tori has during the game that are used to manipulate the environment and the creatures within it, the first one being Whistle which generally causes creatures to move closer to Toki Tori as well as being used to whistle songs that perform various actions. The other ability available to Toki Tori is Stomp. Stomp generally scares creatures into moving away from Toki Tori as well as breaking some parts of the environment. There are also other elements that make up the game, for example if Toki Tori walks into water his feathers will become wet which can then be used for other tasks such as walking through cut grass while wet will cause it to grow so it can be used.[[File:Toki Tori 2.jpg|thumb|left|Toki Tori 2+ ingame screenshot]]\n\nThe game also features various features that are new to the series, one of these features being the Tokidex. The Tokidex is one of the collectables in the game, as the game is played the player can use a song to bring up the camera which is controlled via the Wii U controller (or through the keyboard on the computer version). This camera is then used to take pictures of the creatures that appear in the world, the player is rewarded for collecting pictures of every creature in the game.\n\n==Development==\nBefore the game was announced it was hinted at numerous times by Two Tribes, the main example of this was a [[QR Code]] that could be found in the Windows/Mac port of ''[[Edge (video game)|Edge]]'' which led to a countdown timer, when this countdown timer ended it changed to show a picture of a buried Toki Tori skeleton with a hole in the ground next to it.<ref>Toki Tori 2 Dig Picture http://www.twotribes.com/09d6ee2cea36f247/</ref> After the countdown ended, Toki Tori 2 was announced shortly after.\n\nWhen the game was announced was when work was started on the game and at this point Two Tribes invited fans to become part of the development process by providing access to an alpha build of the game through Steam, this started off as a concept art viewer but as new features for the game were created they were implemented into the alpha, such as the level editor.

It is the sequel to the 2001 game ''[[Toki Tori]]''. The game was originally announced in December 2011 with an intended release for Spring 2012 for [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[iOS]] devices (and was later announced as a [[Wii U]] game), but the game was pushed back due to longer than expected development times. The game was released on April 4, 2013 for [[Wii U]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Toki Tori 2 Wii U Release Date Revealed|url=http://gameslatestnews.com/2013/03/21/toki-tori-2-wii-u-release-date-revealed-1436/|work=GamesLatestNews|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref> and on July 11, 2013 on Steam for Windows and for Mac OS X.\n\nOn September 12, 2013, an updated version called '''''Toki Tori 2+''''' was released for the Wii U, adding new music and puzzles. ''Toki Tori 2+'' made its [[Linux]] debut with [[Humble Bundle]] X launched on January 3, 2014.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/toki-tori-2--two-tribes-and-linux.2975 |title=Toki Tori 2+, Two Tribes And Linux| publisher=Gamingonlinux|date=21 January 2014}}</ref> The game was later released in Japan and published by Rainy Frog on September 3, 2014.<ref name=\"TT2 Japan\"/> ''Toki Tori 2+'' launched for the [[Nintendo Switch]] on February 23, 2018.<ref name=\"NL cites Switch release\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay in ''Toki Tori 2'' is very different compared to its predecessor, the main difference being the absence of items for Toki Tori to use. These are replaced by two skills that Toki Tori has during the game that are used to manipulate the environment and the creatures within it, the first one being Whistle which generally causes creatures to move closer to Toki Tori as well as being used to whistle songs that perform various actions. The other ability available to Toki Tori is Stomp. Stomp generally scares creatures into moving away from Toki Tori as well as breaking some parts of the environment. There are also other elements that make up the game, for example if Toki Tori walks into water his feathers will become wet which can then be used for other tasks such as walking through cut grass while wet will cause it to grow so it can be used.[[File:Toki Tori 2.jpg|thumb|left|Toki Tori 2+ ingame screenshot]]\n\nThe game also features various features that are new to the series, one of these features being the Tokidex. The Tokidex is one of the collectables in the game, as the game is played the player can use a song to bring up the camera which is controlled via the Wii U controller (or through the keyboard on the computer version). This camera is then used to take pictures of the creatures that appear in the world, the player is rewarded for collecting pictures of every creature in the game.\n\n==Development==\nBefore the game was announced it was hinted at numerous times by Two Tribes, the main example of this was a [[QR Code]] that could be found in the Windows/Mac port of ''[[Edge (video game)|EDGE]]'' which led to a countdown timer, when this countdown timer ended it changed to show a picture of a buried Toki Tori skeleton with a hole in the ground next to it.<ref>Toki Tori 2 Dig Picture http://www.twotribes.com/09d6ee2cea36f247/</ref> After the countdown ended, Toki Tori 2 was announced shortly after.\n\nWhen the game was announced was when work was started on the game and at this point Two Tribes invited fans to become part of the development process by providing access to an alpha build of the game through Steam, this started off as a concept art viewer but as new features for the game were created they were implemented into the alpha, such as the level editor. Two Tribes also implemented an input recording function in the alpha which allowed them to ask players to complete tasks or levels in the alpha and then send their recording to Two Tribes for it to be used to improve the game as well as fix bugs.\n\nThe level editor for the Wii U was cancelled due to lower than anticipated sales and various technical difficulties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twotribes.com/message/wii-u-level-editor-on-ice/|title=Wii U Level Editor On Ice|work=twotribes.com|publisher=[[Two Tribes B.V.]]|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn October 22, 2013, Two Tribes announced that the planned iOS version was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iphoneclub.nl/198933/ios-game-update-pitfall-is-game-van-de-week-nieuwe-trailer-toki-tori-2-dynamite-jack-en-koopjes/|title=iOS game-update: Pitfall is Game van de Week, nieuwe trailer Toki Tori 2, Dynamite Jack en koopjes|last=Vroegop|first=Bastiaan|date=10 August 2012|work=iPhoneclub|language=Dutch|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TwoTribesGames/status/392025891267969024|title=@TwoTribesGames|date=22 October 2013|work=[[Twitter]]|publisher=Twitter, Inc.|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn February 16, 2018, ''Toki Tori 2+'' appeared for pre-order on the [[Nintendo Switch]] [[Nintendo eShop|eShop]] without prior announcements, and officially launching for the platform seven days later in North America, Europe, and Australia.

Chesterton]], in his book ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' (1908), asserts that there have been substantial disagreements about faith from the time of the New Testament and Jesus, but that the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] all argued against changing the teachings of Christ, as did the earliest church fathers including [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Polycarp]].{{refn|group=note|See [[False prophets#New Testament|false prophet]], the [[antichrist]], the [[gnostic]] [[Nicolaitanes]] from the [[Book of Revelation]] and [[Man of Sin]].}}\n\n===Diversity===\n{{Main|Diversity in early Christian theology}}\n\nThe [[Ante-Nicene period]] (2nd-3rd century) saw the rise of a great number of Christian [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s and [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] with strong unifying characteristics lacking in the apostolic period. They had different interpretations of [[Bible|Scripture]], particularly the [[Christology|divinity of Jesus]] and the nature of the [[Trinity]]. Some of the major [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s and [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] with different interpretations of [[Bible|Scripture]] than the Proto-Orthodox church were:\n*[[Gnosticism]] (particularly [[Valentinianism]]) \u2013 reliance on revealed knowledge from an unknowable God, a distinct divinity from the [[Demiurge]] who created and oversees the material world.\n*[[Marcionism]] \u2013 the [[God the Father|God]] of [[Jesus]] was a different God from the [[Yahweh|God]] of the [[Old Testament]].\n*[[Montanism]] \u2013 relied on [[Prophecy|prophetic]] [[revelation]]s from the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].\n*[[Adoptionism]] \u2013 Jesus was not born the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]], but was adopted at his [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] or [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]].\n*[[Docetism]] \u2013 Jesus was pure spirit and his physical form an illusion.\n\n===Proto-orthodoxy===\n{{Main|Proto-orthodoxy}}\n\nBefore AD&nbsp;313, the \"heretical\" nature of some beliefs was a matter of much debate within the churches, and there was no true mechanism in place to resolve the various differences of beliefs. Heresy was to be approached by the leader of the church according to Eusebius, author of ''The Church History''.\n\nEarly attacks upon alleged heresies formed the matter of [[Tertullian]]'s ''Prescription Against Heretics'' (in 44 chapters, written from Rome), and of Irenaeus' ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (''ca'' 180, in five volumes), written in Lyon after his return from a visit to Rome. The letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] and [[Polycarp of Smyrna]] to various churches warned against false teachers, and the ''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'' accepted by many Christians as part of Scripture in the 2nd century, warned about [[Judaizing|mixing Judaism with Christianity]], as did other writers, leading to decisions reached in the [[first ecumenical council]], which was convoked by the Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325, in response to further disruptive polemical controversy within the Christian community, in that case [[Arianism|Arianist]] disputes over the nature of the Trinity.\n\nIrenaeus ({{circa|130}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{circa|202}}) was the first to argue that his \"orthodox\" position was the same faith that Jesus gave to the [[Twelve apostles|apostles]], and that the identity of the apostles, their successors, and the teachings of the same were all well-known public knowledge. This was therefore an early argument supported by [[apostolic succession]]. Irenaeus first established the doctrine of four gospels and no more, with the synoptic gospels interpreted in the light of ''[[Gospel of John|John]]''. Irenaeus' opponents, however, claimed to have received secret teachings from Jesus via other apostles which were not publicly known. Gnosticism is predicated on the existence of such hidden knowledge, but brief references to private teachings of Jesus have also survived in the canonic Scripture as did warning by the Christ that there would be [[false prophet]]s or false teachers. Irenaeus' opponents also claimed that the wellsprings of divine inspiration were not dried up, which is the doctrine of [[continuing revelation]].\n\n==Late Antiquity (313\u2013476) and Early Middle Ages (476\u2013799)==\n{{Main|Christianity in late antiquity|History of Christianity of the Middle Ages}}\n\n===Christology===\n{{Main|Christology}}\n\nThe earliest controversies in Late Antiquity were generally [[Christology|Christological]] in nature, concerning the interpretation of Jesus' (eternal) divinity and humanity. In the 4th century, [[Arius]] and [[Arianism]] held that Jesus, while not merely mortal, was not eternally divine and was, therefore, of lesser status than [[God the Father]].{{refn|group=note|{{Bibleverse||John|14:28}}}} Arianism was condemned at the Council of Nicea (325), but nevertheless dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favoured them. [[Trinitarianism]] held that God the Father, [[God the Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]] were all strictly one being with three [[Hypostasis (Christianity)|hypostases]]. The [[Euchites]], a 4th-century [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] sect from Macedonia held that the Threefold God transformed himself into a single hypostasis in order to unite with the souls of the perfect. They were anti-clerical and rejected baptism and the sacraments, believing that the passions could be overcome and perfection achieved through prayer.\n\nMany groups held [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic beliefs]], maintaining that reality was composed into two radically opposing parts: matter, usually seen as evil, and spirit, seen as good. [[Docetism]] held that Jesus' humanity was merely an illusion, thus denying the incarnation. Others held that both the material and spiritual worlds were created by God and were therefore both good, and that this was represented in the unified divine and human natures of Christ.<ref>R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 58</ref>\n\nThe [[Orthodox Christianity|orthodox]] teaching, as it developed in response to these interpretations, is that Christ was fully divine and at the same time fully human, and that the three persons of the [[Trinity]] are co-equal and co-eternal.\n\n===Legal suppression of heresies===\n{{Main|History of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance}}\n\nIt was only after the legalisation of Christianity, which began under [[Constantine I]] in AD&nbsp;313 that the various beliefs of the proto-orthodox Church began to be made uniform and formulated as dogma, through the ''canons'' promulgated by the [[Ecumenical council|General Councils]]. The first known usage of the term 'heresy' in a civil legal context was in 380 by the \"[[Edict of Thessalonica]]\" of Theodosius I. Prior to the issuance of this edict, the Church had no state-sponsored support for any particular legal mechanism to counter what it perceived as 'heresy'. By this edict, in some senses, the line between the Catholic Church's spiritual authority and the Roman State's jurisdiction was blurred. One of the outcomes of this blurring of Church and State was a sharing of State powers of legal enforcement between Church and State authorities, with the state enforcing what it determined to be orthodox teaching.\n\nWithin five years of the official 'criminalization' of heresy by the emperor, the first Christian heretic, [[Priscillian]], was executed in 385 by Roman officials. For some years after the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[list of Christian denominations|Protestant denominations]] were also known to execute those whom they considered heretics.\n\nThe edict of [[Theodosius II]] (435) provided severe punishments for those who had or spread writings of Nestorius.<ref name=\"Thompson2009\">{{cite book|author=Jay E.

These were mostly concerned with Christological disputes:\n#The [[First Council of Nicaea|First Ecumenical Council]] was convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325 and presided over by the Patriarch [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]], with over 300 bishops condemning the view of [[Arius]] that the Son is a created being inferior to the Father.{{refn|group=note|300 bishops, as well as Constantine I, were present at the Council. Constantine had invited all 1800 bishops of the Christian church (about 1000 in the east and 800 in the west). The number of participating bishops cannot be accurately stated; Socrates Scholasticus and Epiphanius of Salamis counted 318; Eusebius of Caesarea, only 250.}} Each phrase in the [[Nicene Creed]], formulated at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] (AD 325), addresses some aspect that had been under passionate discussion prior to Constantine I. Nevertheless, Arianism dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favoured them.\n#The [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] was held at Constantinople in 381, presided over by the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, with 150 bishops, defining the nature of the Holy Spirit against those asserting His inequality with the other persons of the Trinity. This council also condemned Arianism.\n#The [[First Council of Ephesus|Third Ecumenical Council]] is that of Ephesus, a stronghold of Cyrillian Christianity, in 431. It was presided over by the Patriarch of Alexandria, with 250 bishops and was mired in controversy because of the absences of the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch, the absence of the Syrian Clergy, and violence directed against Nestorius and his supporters. It affirmed that Mary is the \"Bearer\" of God (''[[Theotokos]]''), contrary to the teachings of [[Nestorius]], and it anathematized Nestorius. A mirror Council held by Nestorius (Patriarch of Antioch) and the Syrian clergy affirmed Mary as Christokos, \"Bearer\" of Christ, and anathematized [[Cyril of Alexandria]].\n#The [[Council of Chalcedon|Fourth Ecumenical Council]] is that of Chalcedon in 451, with the Patriarch of Constantinople presiding over 500 bishops. This council affirmed that Jesus has two natures, is truly God and truly man, distinct yet always in perfect union. This was based largely on [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo the Great's]] ''Tome''. Thus, it condemned [[Monophysitism]] and would be influential in refuting [[Monothelitism]].\n#The [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council]] is the second of Constantinople in 553, interpreting the decrees of Chalcedon and further explaining the relationship of the two natures of Jesus; it also condemned the teachings of [[Origen]] on the pre-existence of the soul, etc.\n#The [[Third Council of Constantinople|Sixth Ecumenical Council]] is the third of Constantinople in 681; it declared that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the [[Monothelites]].\n#The [[Second Council of Nicaea|Seventh Ecumenical Council]] was called under the Empress Regent [[Irene of Athens]] in 787, known as the second of Nicaea. It supports the [[veneration]] of [[icon]]s while forbidding their worship. It is often referred to as \"The Triumph of Orthodoxy\"\n\nNot all of these Councils have been universally recognised as [[Ecumenical Council|ecumenical]]. In addition, the [[Catholic Church]] has convened numerous other councils which it deems as having the same authority, making a total of twenty-one Ecumenical Councils recognised by the Catholic Church. The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] accepts only the first two, and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] only three. [[Pope Sergius I]] rejected the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692 (see also [[Pentarchy]]). The Fourth Council of Constantinople of [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|869\u2013870]] and [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|879\u2013880]] is disputed by Catholicism and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Present-day [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarians]], such as [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] and other [[Mormonism|Mormons]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], reject all seven Councils.\n\nSome Eastern Orthodox consider the following council to be ecumenical, although this is not universally agreed upon:\n#The [[Fifth Council of Constantinople]] was actually a series of councils held between 1341 and 1351. It affirmed the [[hesychastic]] theology of St. [[Gregory Palamas]] and condemned the philosopher [[Barlaam of Calabria]].\n#In addition to these councils there have been a number of significant councils meant to further define the Eastern Orthodox position. They are the Synods of [[Constantinople]] in 1484, 1583, 1755, 1819, and 1872, the Synod of [[Ia\u015fi]] (Jassy), 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox Synod of [[Jerusalem]], 1672.\n\nWithin the Eastern Orthodox Church, the role of the ecumenical councils was to better define the Orthodox canon of faith; however, the Eastern Orthodox Church authorities are not known to have authorized the use of violence in the persecution of heretics with nearly the frequency of their Western counterparts. Some individual examples of the execution of Orthodox heretics do exist, however, such as the execution of [[Avvakum]] in 1682. Far more typically, the Eastern Orthodox response to a heresy would rather be (and still is) to merely \"excommunicate\" the individuals involved.\n\n==High Middle Ages (800\u20131299) and Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance (1300\u20131520) ==\n[[File:Titelkupfer Index librorum prohibitorum.jpg|thumb|This 1711 illustration for the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' depicts the Holy Ghost supplying the book burning fire.]]\n{{Main|Medieval history of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131300)|l1=High Middle Ages|Medieval history of Christianity#Late Middle Ages (1300\u20131499|l2=Late Middle Ages}}\n\nFrom the late 11th century onward, heresy once again came to be a concern for Catholic authorities, as reports became increasingly common. The reasons for this are still not fully understood, but the causes for this new period of heresy include popular response to the 11th-century clerical reform movement, greater lay familiarity with the Bible, exclusion of lay people from sacramental activity, and more rigorous definition and supervision of Catholic dogma. The question of how heresy should be suppressed was not resolved, and there was initially substantial clerical resistance to the use of physical force by secular authorities to correct spiritual deviance. As heresy was viewed with increasing concern by the papacy, however, the \"secular arm\" was used more frequently and freely during the 12th century and afterward.\n\n===Medieval heresies===\nThere were many Christian [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s, [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] and individuals throughout the Middle Ages whose teachings were deemed heretical by the established church, such as:\n*[[Paulicianism|Paulicians]] \u2013 an [[Armenia]]n group (6th to 9th centuries) who sought a return to the purity of the church at the time of [[Paul the Apostle]]. \n*[[Tondrakians]] - an [[Armenia]]n group (9th to 11th centuries) who advocated the abolition of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Church]] along with all its traditional rites.\n*[[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] \u2013 a group arising in the 11th century in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and the [[Balkans]] who sought a return to the spirituality of the early Christians and opposed established forms of government and church.\n*[[Gundolfo]] \u2013 an itinerant 11th century preacher near [[Lille]], [[France]], who taught that [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] was achieved through a virtuous life of abandoning the world, restraining the appetites of the flesh, earning food by the labor of hands, doing no injury to anyone, and extending charity to everyone of their own faith.\n*[[Catharism|Cathars]] \u2013 a major Christian movement in the [[Languedoc]] region of southern [[France]] from the 11th to 13th centuries. The Cathars believed that human [[soul]]s were the spirits of [[angel]]s trapped within the physical creation of an evil god. Through living a pure and sinless life, the soul could become perfect and free from the snare of matter.\n*[[Arnoldists]] \u2013 a 12th century group from [[Lombardy]] who criticized the wealth of the [[Catholic Church]] and preached against [[baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]].\n*[[Peter of Bruys|Petrobrusians]] were 12th century followers of Peter of Bruys in southeastern [[France]] who rejected the authority of the [[Church Fathers]] and of the Catholic Church, opposing [[clerical celibacy]], [[infant baptism]], [[prayers for the dead]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]] music.\n*[[Henry of Lausanne|Henricans]] were 12th century followers of Henry of Lausanne in France. They rejected the [[Catholic theology|doctrinal]] and disciplinary authority of the [[Catholic Church|church]], did not recognize any form of [[worship]] or [[Liturgy#Christianity|liturgy]] and denied the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]].\n*[[Waldensians]] \u2013 a movement that began in the 12th century in [[Lyon]], [[France]], and still exists today. They held that [[Apostolic poverty]] was the way to spiritual perfection and rejected what they perceived as the [[Religious images in Christian theology|idolatry]] of the [[Catholic Church]].\n*[[Humiliati]] - a 12th century group from northern Italy who embraced poverty, charity and [[Mortification in Roman Catholic teaching|mortification]]. Initially approved by the church, they were suppressed for disobedience in 1571.\n*[[Heresy of the Free Spirit|Brethren of the Free Spirit]] \u2013 a term applied in the 13th century to those, primarily in the [[Low Countries]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Bohemia]] and northern [[Italy]], who believed that the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] were unnecessary for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]], that the [[soul]] could be perfected through imitating the life of [[Christ]], and that the perfected soul was free of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and beyond all [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|ecclesiastical]], [[Christian ethics|moral]] and secular law.\n*[[Apostolic Brethren]] (later known as [[Dulcinian]]s) \u2013 a 13th to 14th century sect from northern Italy founded by [[Gerard Segarelli]] and continued by [[Fra Dolcino]] of [[Novara]]. The Apostolic Brethren rejected the worldliness of the church and sought a life of perfect sanctity, in complete poverty, with no fixed domicile, no care for the morrow, and no vows.\n*[[Fraticelli]] (or Spiritual Franciscans) \u2013 [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] extremists through the 13th to 15th centuries who regarded the wealth of the Church as scandalous.\n*[[Adamites#Neo-Adamits|Neo-Adamites]] \u2013 a term applied in the 13th to 15th century to those, including [[Taborites]], [[Picards]] and some [[Beghards]], who wished to return to the purity of the life of [[Adam]] by [[Intentional community|living communally]], practicing social and religious [[Christian naturism|nudity]], embracing [[free love]] and rejecting [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]] and individual ownership of property.\n*[[Nicholas of Basel]] \u2013 a 14th century [[Basel|Swiss]] leader who, after a spiritual experience, taught that he had the authority to use [[Bishop|episcopal]] and [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priestly]] powers (even though he was not ordained), that submission to his direction was necessary for attaining spiritual perfection, and that his followers could not [[Christian views on sin|sin]] even though they committed crimes or disobeyed both the [[Catholic Church|Church]] and [[pope]].\n*[[Lollardy|Lollards]] \u2013 the 14th century followers of [[John Wycliffe]]. They advocated [[Bible translations into English|translating the Bible into English]], rejected [[baptism]] and [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]], and denied the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]].\n\n===Inquisition===\nIn the late 12th century, the Roman Catholic Church instituted the [[Inquisition]], an official body charged with the suppression of heresy. This began as an extension and more rigorous enforcement of pre-existing episcopal powers (possessed, but little used, by bishops in the early Middle Ages) to inquire about and suppress heresy, but later became the domain of selected [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Franciscans]]<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08026a.htm|title= Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition|website=New Advent|access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref> under the direct power of the Pope. The use of torture to extract confessions was authorized by Innocent IV in 1252.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition\"/> The Inquisition was active in several nations of [[Europe]], particularly where it had fervent support from the civil authority. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] was particularly brutal in its methods, which included the [[burning at the stake]] of many heretics. However, it was initiated and substantially controlled by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand of Spain]] rather than the Church; King Ferdinand used political leverage to obtain the Church's tacit approval.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229) was part of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]'s efforts to crush the [[Cathars]]. It is linked to the movement now known as the [[Medieval Inquisition]]. Another example of a medieval heretic movement is the [[Hussite]] movement in the [[Czech lands]] in the early 15th century. The last person to be burned alive at the stake on orders from Rome was [[Giordano Bruno]], executed in 1600 for a collection of heretical beliefs including [[Copernicus|Copernicanism]], belief of an unlimited universe with innumerable inhabited worlds, opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about the Trinity, divinity of Christ, and Incarnation.\n\n== Reformation and Modern Era (1520\u2013present) ==\n[[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]], who played an instrumental part in the formation of the [[Lutheran Church]]es condemned [[Johannes Agricola]] and his doctrine of [[antinomianism]]\u2013the belief that Christians were free from the moral law contained in the [[Ten Commandments]]\u2013as a heresy.<ref name=\"SeelyeSelby2018\"/> Traditional Lutheranism, espoused by Luther himself, teaches that after justification, \"the Law of God continued to guide people in how they were to live before God\".<ref name=\"SeelyeSelby2018\">{{cite book |last1=Seelye |first1=James E. |last2=Selby |first2=Shawn |title=Shaping North America: From Exploration to the American Revolution |date=2018 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=9781440836695 |page=50 |language=English}}</ref>\n\nThe [[39 Articles]] of the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] of the [[Methodist Church]]es condemn [[Pelagianism]].<ref name=\"Wilson2011\">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kenneth |title=Methodist Theology |date=2011 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=9780567317469 |page=87 |language=English}}</ref>\n\n[[John Wesley]], the founder of the Methodist tradition, harshly criticized antinomianism,<ref name=\"YrigoyenWarrick2013\"/> considering it the \"worst of all heresies\".<ref name=\"Hurst1903\">{{cite book|last=Hurst|first=John Fletcher|title=John Wesley the Methodist: A Plain Account of His Life and Work|url=https://archive.org/details/johnwesleymetho00hursgoog|year=1903|publisher=Eaton & Mains|language=English|page=[https://archive.org/details/johnwesleymetho00hursgoog/page/n210 200]}}</ref> He taught that Christian believers are bound to follow the [[Ten Commandments|moral law]] for their [[sanctification]].<ref name=\"YrigoyenWarrick2013\">{{cite book |last1=Jr. |first1=Charles Yrigoyen |last2=Warrick |first2=Susan E. |title=Historical Dictionary of Methodism |date=7 November 2013 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |language=English |isbn=9780810878945 |page=30}}</ref> Methodist Christians thus teach the necessity of following the moral law as contained in the Ten Commandments, citing [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus']] teaching, \"If ye love me, keep my commandments\" (cf.

The number of people executed as heretics as sentenced by various church authorities is not known; however it most certainly numbers into the [[Spanish Inquisition#Death tolls|several thousands]]. Coincidentally, the first heretic executed had been a Spaniard, [[Priscillian]]; the most notorious organization known for the persecution of heretics had been based in Spain, the [[Spanish Inquisition]], and the last heretic executed had been a Spaniard, [[Cayetano Ripoll]]. Thus, the era of the execution of heretics by the Catholic Church had come to an end.\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic response to Protestantism==\n{{Main|Roman Catholic teachings on heresy}}\nWell into the 20th century, Catholics defined Protestants as heretics. Thus, [[Hilaire Belloc]], in his time one of the most conspicuous speakers for Catholicism in Britain, was outspoken about the \"Protestant heresy\". He even defined [[Islam]] as being \"a Christian heresy\", on the grounds that Muslims accept many of the tenets of Christianity but deny the [[divinity of Christ]].\n\nHowever, in the second half of the century, and especially in the wake of the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Catholic Church, in the spirit of ecumenism, tended to diminish the effects of [[Protestantism]] as a formal heresy by referring to many Protestants who, as material heretics, \"through no fault of their own do not know Christ and his Church\",<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/847.htm CCC 847]</ref> even though the teachings of Protestantism are indeed formally heretical from a Catholic perspective. Modern usage in ecumenical contexts favors referring to Protestants as \"separated brethren\".{{refn|group=note|In his book ''The Meaning of Christian Brotherhood'', [[Pope Benedict XVI]] wrote that: \"The difficulty in the way of giving an answer is a profound one. Ultimately it is due to the fact that there is no appropriate category in Catholic thought for the phenomenon of Protestantism today (one could say the same of the relationship to the separated churches of the East). It is obvious that the old category of 'heresy' is no longer of any value. Heresy, for Scripture and the early Church, includes the idea of a personal decision against the unity of the Church, and heresy's characteristic is pertinacia, the obstinacy of him who persists in his own private way. This, however, cannot be regarded as an appropriate description of the spiritual situation of the Protestant Christian. In the course of a now centuries-old history, Protestantism has made an important contribution to the realization of Christian faith, fulfilling a positive function in the development of the Christian message and, above all, often giving rise to a sincere and profound faith in the individual non-Catholic Christian, whose separation from the Catholic affirmation has nothing to do with the pertinacia characteristic of heresy. Perhaps we may here invert a saying of St. Augustine's: that an old schism becomes a heresy. The very passage of time alters the character of a division, so that an old division is something essentially different from a new one. Something that was once rightly condemned as heresy cannot later simply become true, but it can gradually develop its own positive ecclesial nature, with which the individual is presented as his church and in which he lives as a believer, not as a heretic. This organization of one group, however, ultimately has an effect on the whole. The conclusion is inescapable, then: Protestantism today is something different from heresy in the traditional sense, a phenomenon whose true theological place has not yet been determined.<ref name=\"XVI1993\">{{cite book|title=The Meaning of Christian Brotherhood |year=1993 |publisher=Ignatius Press |isbn=9780898704464 |page=88 |author=Pope Benedict XVI}}</ref>}}\n\nSome of the doctrines of Protestantism that the Catholic Church considers heretical are the belief that the [[Bible]] is the only supremely authoritative source and rule of faith and practice in Christianity (''[[sola scriptura]]''), that only by faith alone can anyone ever be lead to salvation and not by works (''[[sola fide]]''), that the [[Pope]] does not necessarily have universal jurisdiction over the whole Church by any divine right, that the Catholic Church cannot be \"the sole Church of Christ\", and that there is not a sacramental and ministerial priesthood exclusively received by ecclesiastical ordination, but rather that the only Christian priesthood can be a universal [[priesthood of all believers]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm Protestantism]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Catholic teachings on heresy]]\n*[[Christian heresy in the modern era]]\n*[[History of Christianity]]\n*[[Infallibility of the Church]]\n*[[List of movements declared heretical by the Catholic Church]]\n*[[List of people burned as heretics]]\n*[[Pelagius]]\n*[[Diversity in early Christian theology]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- V -->\n* {{Cite book | editor1-last=Gregory | editor1-first=Andrew |editor2-last=Tuckett | editor2-first=Christopher | year = 2015 | title =The Oxford Handbook of Early Christian Apocrypha |publisher = Oxford University Press }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Clifton |first=Chas S. |title=Encyclopedia of Heresies and Heretics |isbn=0-7607-0823-1 |year=1992 |publisher=Barnes and Noble Books |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofhe00chas }}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Edwards|first=Mark|year=2009|title=Catholicity and Heresy in the Early Church|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9acTl-jAkAC}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Slade|first=Darren M.|title=Arabia Haeresium Ferax (Arabia Bearer of Heresies): Schismatic Christianity's Potential Influence on Muhammad and the Qur'an|journal=American Theological Inquiry|date=January 2014|volume=7|issue=1|pages=43\u201353|url=https://www.academia.edu/7928101/Arabia_Haeresium_Ferax_Arabia_Bearer_of_Heresies_Schismatic_Christianity_s_Potential_Influence_on_Muhammad_and_the_Qur_an|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202093241/http://atijournal.org/ATI_Vol7_No1.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-02|via=|df=}}\n{{Beliefs condemned by the Catholic Church}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Heresy}}\n[[Category:Heresy in Christianity| ]]\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Formal denial or doubt of a core doctrine of the Christian faith}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2009}}\n{{Historical Christian theology}}\n'''Heresy in Christianity''' denotes the formal denial or doubt of a core doctrine of the Christian faith<ref name=\"NIDCC-heresy\"/> as defined by one or more of the [[Christian churches]].<ref name=\"ODCC-heresy\"/>\n\nIn [[Western Christianity]], [[heresy]] most commonly refers to those beliefs which were declared to be [[anathema]] by any of the [[ecumenical council]]s recognized by the [[Catholic Church]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In the [[Eastern Christianity|East]], the term \"heresy\" is eclectic and can refer to anything at variance with [[Holy Tradition|Church tradition]].

Chesterton]], in his book ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' (1908), asserts that there have been substantial disagreements about faith from the time of the New Testament and Jesus, but that the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] all argued against changing the teachings of Christ, as did the earliest church fathers including [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Polycarp]].{{refn|group=note|See [[False prophets#New Testament|false prophet]], the [[antichrist]], the [[gnostic]] [[Nicolaitanes]] from the [[Book of Revelation]] and [[Man of Sin]].}}\n\n===Diversity===\n{{Main|Diversity in early Christian theology}}\n\nThe [[Ante-Nicene period]] (2nd-3rd century) saw the rise of a great number of Christian [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s and [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] with strong unifying characteristics lacking in the apostolic period. They had different interpretations of [[Bible|Scripture]], particularly the [[Christology|divinity of Jesus]] and the nature of the [[Trinity]]. Some of the major [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s and [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] with different interpretations of [[Bible|Scripture]] than the Proto-Orthodox church were:\n*[[Gnosticism]] (particularly [[Valentinianism]]) \u2013 reliance on revealed knowledge from an unknowable God, a distinct divinity from the [[Demiurge]] who created and oversees the material world.\n*[[Marcionism]] \u2013 the [[God the Father|God]] of [[Jesus]] was a different God from the [[Yahweh|God]] of the [[Old Testament]].\n*[[Montanism]] \u2013 relied on [[Prophecy|prophetic]] [[revelation]]s from the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].\n*[[Adoptionism]] \u2013 Jesus was not born the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]], but was adopted at his [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] or [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]].\n*[[Docetism]] \u2013 Jesus was pure spirit and his physical form an illusion.\n\n===Proto-orthodoxy===\n{{Main|Proto-orthodoxy}}\n\nBefore AD&nbsp;313, the \"heretical\" nature of some beliefs was a matter of much debate within the churches, and there was no true mechanism in place to resolve the various differences of beliefs. Heresy was to be approached by the leader of the church according to Eusebius, author of ''The Church History''.\n\nEarly attacks upon alleged heresies formed the matter of [[Tertullian]]'s ''Prescription Against Heretics'' (in 44 chapters, written from Rome), and of Irenaeus' ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (''ca'' 180, in five volumes), written in Lyon after his return from a visit to Rome. The letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] and [[Polycarp of Smyrna]] to various churches warned against false teachers, and the ''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'' accepted by many Christians as part of Scripture in the 2nd century, warned about [[Judaizing|mixing Judaism with Christianity]], as did other writers, leading to decisions reached in the [[first ecumenical council]], which was convoked by the Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325, in response to further disruptive polemical controversy within the Christian community, in that case [[Arianism|Arianist]] disputes over the nature of the Trinity.\n\nIrenaeus ({{circa|130}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{circa|202}}) was the first to argue that his \"orthodox\" position was the same faith that Jesus gave to the [[Twelve apostles|apostles]], and that the identity of the apostles, their successors, and the teachings of the same were all well-known public knowledge. This was therefore an early argument supported by [[apostolic succession]]. Irenaeus first established the doctrine of four gospels and no more, with the synoptic gospels interpreted in the light of ''[[Gospel of John|John]]''. Irenaeus' opponents, however, claimed to have received secret teachings from Jesus via other apostles which were not publicly known. Gnosticism is predicated on the existence of such hidden knowledge, but brief references to private teachings of Jesus have also survived in the canonic Scripture as did warning by the Christ that there would be [[false prophet]]s or false teachers. Irenaeus' opponents also claimed that the wellsprings of divine inspiration were not dried up, which is the doctrine of [[continuing revelation]].\n\n==Late Antiquity (313\u2013476) and Early Middle Ages (476\u2013799)==\n{{Main|Christianity in late antiquity|History of Christianity of the Middle Ages}}\n\n===Christology===\n{{Main|Christology}}\n\nThe earliest controversies in Late Antiquity were generally [[Christology|Christological]] in nature, concerning the interpretation of Jesus' (eternal) divinity and humanity. In the 4th century, [[Arius]] and [[Arianism]] held that Jesus, while not merely mortal, was not eternally divine and was, therefore, of lesser status than [[God the Father]].{{refn|group=note|{{Bibleverse||John|14:28}}}} Arianism was condemned at the Council of Nicea (325), but nevertheless dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favoured them. [[Trinitarianism]] held that God the Father, [[God the Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]] were all strictly one being with three [[Hypostasis (Christianity)|hypostases]]. The [[Euchites]], a 4th-century [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] sect from Macedonia held that the Threefold God transformed himself into a single hypostasis in order to unite with the souls of the perfect. They were anti-clerical and rejected baptism and the sacraments, believing that the passions could be overcome and perfection achieved through prayer.\n\nMany groups held [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic beliefs]], maintaining that reality was composed into two radically opposing parts: matter, usually seen as evil, and spirit, seen as good. [[Docetism]] held that Jesus' humanity was merely an illusion, thus denying the incarnation. Others held that both the material and spiritual worlds were created by God and were therefore both good, and that this was represented in the unified divine and human natures of Christ.<ref>R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 58</ref>\n\nThe [[Orthodox Christianity|orthodox]] teaching, as it developed in response to these interpretations, is that Christ was fully divine and at the same time fully human, and that the three persons of the [[Trinity]] are co-equal and co-eternal.\n\n===Legal suppression of heresies===\n{{Main|History of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance}}\n\nIt was only after the legalisation of Christianity, which began under [[Constantine I]] in AD&nbsp;313 that the various beliefs of the proto-orthodox Church began to be made uniform and formulated as dogma, through the ''canons'' promulgated by the [[Ecumenical council|General Councils]]. The first known usage of the term 'heresy' in a civil legal context was in 380 by the \"[[Edict of Thessalonica]]\" of Theodosius I. Prior to the issuance of this edict, the Church had no state-sponsored support for any particular legal mechanism to counter what it perceived as 'heresy'. By this edict, in some senses, the line between the Catholic Church's spiritual authority and the Roman State's jurisdiction was blurred. One of the outcomes of this blurring of Church and State was a sharing of State powers of legal enforcement between Church and State authorities, with the state enforcing what it determined to be orthodox teaching.\n\nWithin five years of the official 'criminalization' of heresy by the emperor, the first Christian heretic, [[Priscillian]], was executed in 385 by Roman officials. For some years after the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[list of Christian denominations|Protestant denominations]] were also known to execute those whom they considered heretics.\n\nThe edict of [[Theodosius II]] (435) provided severe punishments for those who had or spread writings of Nestorius.<ref name=\"Thompson2009\">{{cite book|author=Jay E.

The number of participating bishops cannot be accurately stated; Socrates Scholasticus and Epiphanius of Salamis counted 318; Eusebius of Caesarea, only 250.}} Each phrase in the [[Nicene Creed]], formulated at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] (AD 325), addresses some aspect that had been under passionate discussion prior to Constantine I. Nevertheless, Arianism dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favoured them.\n#The [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] was held at Constantinople in 381, presided over by the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, with 150 bishops, defining the nature of the Holy Spirit against those asserting His inequality with the other persons of the Trinity. This council also condemned Arianism.\n#The [[First Council of Ephesus|Third Ecumenical Council]] is that of Ephesus, a stronghold of Cyrillian Christianity, in 431. It was presided over by the Patriarch of Alexandria, with 250 bishops and was mired in controversy because of the absences of the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch, the absence of the Syrian Clergy, and violence directed against Nestorius and his supporters. It affirmed that Mary is the \"Bearer\" of God (''[[Theotokos]]''), contrary to the teachings of [[Nestorius]], and it anathematized Nestorius. A mirror Council held by Nestorius (Patriarch of Antioch) and the Syrian clergy affirmed Mary as Christokos, \"Bearer\" of Christ, and anathematized [[Cyril of Alexandria]].\n#The [[Council of Chalcedon|Fourth Ecumenical Council]] is that of Chalcedon in 451, with the Patriarch of Constantinople presiding over 500 bishops. This council affirmed that Jesus has two natures, is truly God and truly man, distinct yet always in perfect union. This was based largely on [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo the Great's]] ''Tome''. Thus, it condemned [[Monophysitism]] and would be influential in refuting [[Monothelitism]].\n#The [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council]] is the second of Constantinople in 553, interpreting the decrees of Chalcedon and further explaining the relationship of the two natures of Jesus; it also condemned the teachings of [[Origen]] on the pre-existence of the soul, etc.\n#The [[Third Council of Constantinople|Sixth Ecumenical Council]] is the third of Constantinople in 681; it declared that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the [[Monothelites]].\n#The [[Second Council of Nicaea|Seventh Ecumenical Council]] was called under the Empress Regent [[Irene of Athens]] in 787, known as the second of Nicaea. It supports the [[veneration]] of [[icon]]s while forbidding their worship. It is often referred to as \"The Triumph of Orthodoxy\"\n\nNot all of these Councils have been universally recognised as [[Ecumenical Council|ecumenical]]. In addition, the [[Catholic Church]] has convened numerous other councils which it deems as having the same authority, making a total of twenty-one Ecumenical Councils recognised by the Catholic Church. The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] accepts only the first two, and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] only three. [[Pope Sergius I]] rejected the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692 (see also [[Pentarchy]]). The Fourth Council of Constantinople of [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|869\u2013870]] and [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|879\u2013880]] is disputed by Catholicism and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Present-day [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarians]], such as [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] and other [[Mormonism|Mormons]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], reject all seven Councils.\n\nSome Eastern Orthodox consider the following council to be ecumenical, although this is not universally agreed upon:\n#The [[Fifth Council of Constantinople]] was actually a series of councils held between 1341 and 1351. It affirmed the [[hesychastic]] theology of St. [[Gregory Palamas]] and condemned the philosopher [[Barlaam of Calabria]].\n#In addition to these councils there have been a number of significant councils meant to further define the Eastern Orthodox position. They are the Synods of [[Constantinople]] in 1484, 1583, 1755, 1819, and 1872, the Synod of [[Ia\u015fi]] (Jassy), 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox Synod of [[Jerusalem]], 1672.\n\nWithin the Eastern Orthodox Church, the role of the ecumenical councils was to better define the Orthodox canon of faith; however, the Eastern Orthodox Church authorities are not known to have authorized the use of violence in the persecution of heretics with nearly the frequency of their Western counterparts. Some individual examples of the execution of Orthodox heretics do exist, however, such as the execution of [[Avvakum]] in 1682. Far more typically, the Eastern Orthodox response to a heresy would rather be (and still is) to merely \"excommunicate\" the individuals involved.\n\n==High Middle Ages (800\u20131299) and Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance (1300\u20131520) ==\n[[File:Titelkupfer Index librorum prohibitorum.jpg|thumb|This 1711 illustration for the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' depicts the Holy Ghost supplying the book burning fire.]]\n{{Main|Medieval history of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131300)|l1=High Middle Ages|Medieval history of Christianity#Late Middle Ages (1300\u20131499|l2=Late Middle Ages}}\n\nFrom the late 11th century onward, heresy once again came to be a concern for Catholic authorities, as reports became increasingly common. The reasons for this are still not fully understood, but the causes for this new period of heresy include popular response to the 11th-century clerical reform movement, greater lay familiarity with the Bible, exclusion of lay people from sacramental activity, and more rigorous definition and supervision of Catholic dogma. The question of how heresy should be suppressed was not resolved, and there was initially substantial clerical resistance to the use of physical force by secular authorities to correct spiritual deviance. As heresy was viewed with increasing concern by the papacy, however, the \"secular arm\" was used more frequently and freely during the 12th century and afterward.\n\n===Medieval heresies===\nThere were many Christian [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s, [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] and individuals throughout the Middle Ages whose teachings were deemed heretical by the established church, such as:\n*[[Paulicianism|Paulicians]] \u2013 an [[Armenia]]n group (6th to 9th centuries) who sought a return to the purity of the church at the time of [[Paul the Apostle]]. \n*[[Tondrakians]] - an [[Armenia]]n group (9th to 11th centuries) who advocated the abolition of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Church]] along with all its traditional rites.\n*[[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] \u2013 a group arising in the 11th century in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and the [[Balkans]] who sought a return to the spirituality of the early Christians and opposed established forms of government and church.\n*[[Gundolfo]] \u2013 an itinerant 11th century preacher near [[Lille]], [[France]], who taught that [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] was achieved through a virtuous life of abandoning the world, restraining the appetites of the flesh, earning food by the labor of hands, doing no injury to anyone, and extending charity to everyone of their own faith.\n*[[Catharism|Cathars]] \u2013 a major Christian movement in the [[Languedoc]] region of southern [[France]] from the 11th to 13th centuries. The Cathars believed that human [[soul]]s were the spirits of [[angel]]s trapped within the physical creation of an evil god. Through living a pure and sinless life, the soul could become perfect and free from the snare of matter.\n*[[Arnoldists]] \u2013 a 12th century group from [[Lombardy]] who criticized the wealth of the [[Catholic Church]] and preached against [[baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]].\n*[[Peter of Bruys|Petrobrusians]] were 12th century followers of Peter of Bruys in southeastern [[France]] who rejected the authority of the [[Church Fathers]] and of the Catholic Church, opposing [[clerical celibacy]], [[infant baptism]], [[prayers for the dead]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]] music.\n*[[Henry of Lausanne|Henricans]] were 12th century followers of Henry of Lausanne in France. They rejected the [[Catholic theology|doctrinal]] and disciplinary authority of the [[Catholic Church|church]], did not recognize any form of [[worship]] or [[Liturgy#Christianity|liturgy]] and denied the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]].\n*[[Waldensians]] \u2013 a movement that began in the 12th century in [[Lyon]], [[France]], and still exists today. They held that [[Apostolic poverty]] was the way to spiritual perfection and rejected what they perceived as the [[Religious images in Christian theology|idolatry]] of the [[Catholic Church]].\n*[[Humiliati]] - a 12th century group from northern Italy who embraced poverty, charity and [[Mortification in Roman Catholic teaching|mortification]]. Initially approved by the church, they were suppressed for disobedience in 1571.\n*[[Heresy of the Free Spirit|Brethren of the Free Spirit]] \u2013 a term applied in the 13th century to those, primarily in the [[Low Countries]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Bohemia]] and northern [[Italy]], who believed that the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] were unnecessary for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]], that the [[soul]] could be perfected through imitating the life of [[Christ]], and that the perfected soul was free of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and beyond all [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|ecclesiastical]], [[Christian ethics|moral]] and secular law.\n*[[Apostolic Brethren]] (later known as [[Dulcinian]]s) \u2013 a 13th to 14th century sect from northern Italy founded by [[Gerard Segarelli]] and continued by [[Fra Dolcino]] of [[Novara]]. The Apostolic Brethren rejected the worldliness of the church and sought a life of perfect sanctity, in complete poverty, with no fixed domicile, no care for the morrow, and no vows.\n*[[Fraticelli]] (or Spiritual Franciscans) \u2013 [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] extremists through the 13th to 15th centuries who regarded the wealth of the Church as scandalous.\n*[[Adamites#Neo-Adamits|Neo-Adamites]] \u2013 a term applied in the 13th to 15th century to those, including [[Taborites]], [[Picards]] and some [[Beghards]], who wished to return to the purity of the life of [[Adam]] by [[Intentional community|living communally]], practicing social and religious [[Christian naturism|nudity]], embracing [[free love]] and rejecting [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]] and individual ownership of property.\n*[[Nicholas of Basel]] \u2013 a 14th century [[Basel|Swiss]] leader who, after a spiritual experience, taught that he had the authority to use [[Bishop|episcopal]] and [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priestly]] powers (even though he was not ordained), that submission to his direction was necessary for attaining spiritual perfection, and that his followers could not [[Christian views on sin|sin]] even though they committed crimes or disobeyed both the [[Catholic Church|Church]] and [[pope]].\n*[[Lollardy|Lollards]] \u2013 the 14th century followers of [[John Wycliffe]]. They advocated [[Bible translations into English|translating the Bible into English]], rejected [[baptism]] and [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]], and denied the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]].\n\n===Inquisition===\nIn the late 12th century, the Roman Catholic Church instituted the [[Inquisition]], an official body charged with the suppression of heresy. This began as an extension and more rigorous enforcement of pre-existing episcopal powers (possessed, but little used, by bishops in the early Middle Ages) to inquire about and suppress heresy, but later became the domain of selected [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Franciscans]]<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08026a.htm|title= Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition|website=New Advent|access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref> under the direct power of the Pope. The use of torture to extract confessions was authorized by Innocent IV in 1252.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition\"/> The Inquisition was active in several nations of [[Europe]], particularly where it had fervent support from the civil authority. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] was particularly brutal in its methods, which included the [[burning at the stake]] of many heretics. However, it was initiated and substantially controlled by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand of Spain]] rather than the Church; King Ferdinand used political leverage to obtain the Church's tacit approval.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229) was part of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]'s efforts to crush the [[Cathars]]. It is linked to the movement now known as the [[Medieval Inquisition]]. Another example of a medieval heretic movement is the [[Hussite]] movement in the [[Czech lands]] in the early 15th century. The last person to be burned alive at the stake on orders from Rome was [[Giordano Bruno]], executed in 1600 for a collection of heretical beliefs including [[Copernicus|Copernicanism]], belief of an unlimited universe with innumerable inhabited worlds, opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about the Trinity, divinity of Christ, and Incarnation.\n\n== Reformation and Modern Era (1520\u2013present) ==\n[[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]], who played an instrumental part in the formation of the [[Lutheran Church]]es condemned [[Johannes Agricola]] and his doctrine of [[antinomianism]]\u2013the belief that Christians were free from the moral law contained in the [[Ten Commandments]]\u2013as a heresy.<ref name=\"SeelyeSelby2018\"/> Traditional Lutheranism, espoused by Luther himself, teaches that after justification, \"the Law of God continued to guide people in how they were to live before God\".<ref name=\"SeelyeSelby2018\">{{cite book |last1=Seelye |first1=James E. |last2=Selby |first2=Shawn |title=Shaping North America: From Exploration to the American Revolution |date=2018 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=9781440836695 |page=50 |language=English}}</ref>\n\nThe [[39 Articles]] of the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] of the [[Methodist Church]]es condemn [[Pelagianism]].<ref name=\"Wilson2011\">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kenneth |title=Methodist Theology |date=2011 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=9780567317469 |page=87 |language=English}}</ref>\n\n[[John Wesley]], the founder of the Methodist tradition, harshly criticized antinomianism,<ref name=\"YrigoyenWarrick2013\"/> considering it the \"worst of all heresies\".<ref name=\"Hurst1903\">{{cite book|last=Hurst|first=John Fletcher|title=John Wesley the Methodist: A Plain Account of His Life and Work|url=https://archive.org/details/johnwesleymetho00hursgoog|year=1903|publisher=Eaton & Mains|language=English|page=[https://archive.org/details/johnwesleymetho00hursgoog/page/n210 200]}}</ref> He taught that Christian believers are bound to follow the [[Ten Commandments|moral law]] for their [[sanctification]].<ref name=\"YrigoyenWarrick2013\">{{cite book |last1=Jr. |first1=Charles Yrigoyen |last2=Warrick |first2=Susan E. |title=Historical Dictionary of Methodism |date=7 November 2013 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |language=English |isbn=9780810878945 |page=30}}</ref> Methodist Christians thus teach the necessity of following the moral law as contained in the Ten Commandments, citing [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus']] teaching, \"If ye love me, keep my commandments\" (cf.

The censuring of this statement was controversial even at the time because this had previously been a freely debated idea which had not resulted in charges of heresy.\n\nThe last case of an execution by the inquisition was that of the schoolmaster [[Cayetano Ripoll]], accused of [[deism]] by the waning [[Spanish Inquisition]] and hanged on 26 July 1826 in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] after a two-year trial.<ref>{{cite news|title=Daily TWiP - The Spanish Inquisition executes its last victim today in 1826|url= http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/805877-196/daily-twip---the-spanish-inquisition-executes.html |accessdate=8 June 2013 |date=26 July 2010}}</ref> Eight years later in 1834, Spain, the last remaining government to still be providing the Catholic Church with the right to pronounce and effect capital punishment, formally withdrew that right from the Church. The era of such absolute Church authority had lasted some 1,449 years, from AD&nbsp;385 through to 1834. The number of people executed as heretics as sentenced by various church authorities is not known; however it most certainly numbers into the [[Spanish Inquisition#Death tolls|several thousands]]. Coincidentally, the first heretic executed had been a Spaniard, [[Priscillian]]; the most notorious organization known for the persecution of heretics had been based in Spain, the [[Spanish Inquisition]], and the last heretic executed had been a Spaniard, [[Cayetano Ripoll]]. Thus, the era of the execution of heretics by the Catholic Church had come to an end.\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic response to Protestantism==\n{{Main|Roman Catholic teachings on heresy}}\nWell into the 20th century, Catholics defined Protestants as heretics. Thus, [[Hilaire Belloc]], in his time one of the most conspicuous speakers for Catholicism in Britain, was outspoken about the \"Protestant heresy\". He even defined [[Islam]] as being \"a Christian heresy\", on the grounds that Muslims accept many of the tenets of Christianity but deny the [[divinity of Christ]].\n\nHowever, in the second half of the century, and especially in the wake of the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Catholic Church, in the spirit of ecumenism, tended to diminish the effects of [[Protestantism]] as a formal heresy by referring to many Protestants who, as material heretics, \"through no fault of their own do not know Christ and his Church\",<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/847.htm CCC 847]</ref> even though the teachings of Protestantism are indeed formally heretical from a Catholic perspective. Modern usage in ecumenical contexts favors referring to Protestants as \"separated brethren\".{{refn|group=note|In his book ''The Meaning of Christian Brotherhood'', [[Pope Benedict XVI]] wrote that: \"The difficulty in the way of giving an answer is a profound one. Ultimately it is due to the fact that there is no appropriate category in Catholic thought for the phenomenon of Protestantism today (one could say the same of the relationship to the separated churches of the East). It is obvious that the old category of 'heresy' is no longer of any value. Heresy, for Scripture and the early Church, includes the idea of a personal decision against the unity of the Church, and heresy's characteristic is pertinacia, the obstinacy of him who persists in his own private way. This, however, cannot be regarded as an appropriate description of the spiritual situation of the Protestant Christian. In the course of a now centuries-old history, Protestantism has made an important contribution to the realization of Christian faith, fulfilling a positive function in the development of the Christian message and, above all, often giving rise to a sincere and profound faith in the individual non-Catholic Christian, whose separation from the Catholic affirmation has nothing to do with the pertinacia characteristic of heresy. Perhaps we may here invert a saying of St. Augustine's: that an old schism becomes a heresy. The very passage of time alters the character of a division, so that an old division is something essentially different from a new one. Something that was once rightly condemned as heresy cannot later simply become true, but it can gradually develop its own positive ecclesial nature, with which the individual is presented as his church and in which he lives as a believer, not as a heretic. This organization of one group, however, ultimately has an effect on the whole.
