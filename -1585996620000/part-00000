The film follows off-duty [[New York City Police Department]] officer [[John McClane]] ([[Bruce Willis]]) who is caught in a Los Angeles skyscraper on Christmas Eve during a heist led by criminal mastermind [[Hans Gruber (character)|Hans Gruber]] ([[Alan Rickman]]).\n\nMade for $28 million, ''Die Hard'' grossed over $141 million theatrically worldwide. Turning Willis into an action star, the film became a [[metonym]] for an action film in which a lone hero fights overwhelming odds. The film's success spurred creation of the ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, which includes four sequels, a number of video games, and a comic book. In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].

McClane is driven to the party by Argyle, a limousine driver. While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of a ex-[[West Germany|West German]] radical [[Hans Gruber (character)|Hans Gruber]] and his team: Karl Vreski and his brother Tony, Theo, Franco, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James. The group seizes the tower, disables communication to the outside world, and secures those inside as hostages except for McClane, who slips away, and Argyle, who gets stranded in the garage.\n\nGruber interrogates Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi for the code to the building's vault and reveals that he plans to steal $640 million in [[bearer bond]]s, with the terrorist act merely a distraction. Takagi refuses to cooperate and is killed by Gruber. McClane secretly watches, escapes, and sets off a fire alarm in an attempt to alert authorities. Eddie assures the fire department it is a false alarm. Gruber sends Tony to investigate. McClane kills Tony, pocketing his weapon and radio, which he then uses to alert the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], who suspect McClane of making a prank call. Sgt. Al Powell is sent to investigate. Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, who kills them both. Powell arrives, and finding nothing unusual, he prepares to leave, but McClane drops Marco's corpse onto his patrol car to gain his attention. Powell summons the LAPD, who lay siege to the building. McClane steals Heinrich's bag containing [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4 explosives]] and detonators.\n\nJames and Alexander use anti-tank missiles to disable a [[SWAT]] [[M8 Greyhound|armored car]] before McClane drops C-4 attached to an office chair and computer down the elevator shaft, blowing up their floor and killing them. Holly's coworker, Harry Ellis, attempts to mediate between Hans and McClane for the return of the detonators. McClane refuses, prompting Gruber to execute Ellis. While checking explosives attached to the roof, Gruber encounters McClane. Gruber masquerades as an escaped hostage; McClane offers him a gun and Gruber attempts to shoot McClane, but the gun is empty. Karl, Franco, and Fritz arrive; McClane kills Fritz and Franco but is forced to abandon the detonators.\n\nFBI agents take command of the siege, ordering the building's power shut off; this, as Gruber anticipated, disables the vault's final lock. Gruber demands a helicopter on the rooftop for transport to the Los Angeles airport, but the FBI prepare to double-cross him by sending two helicopter gunships. McClane discovers that Gruber intends to detonate the explosives on the roof, faking the deaths of his team so they can escape with the bearer bonds. While making final preparations, Gruber sees a news report by intrusive reporter Richard Thornburg that features McClane's children and deduces from a desk photo that McClane is Holly's husband. The criminals order the hostages to the roof, but Gruber takes Holly with him to use against McClane, who subdues Karl in a fight before heading up to the roof. After killing Uli, he sends the hostages downstairs as the FBI helicopters appear and shoot at McClane, believing him to be a terrorist. Gruber detonates the explosives, destroying the roof and one helicopter; McClane barely survives.\n\nTheo retrieves their getaway vehicle, an ambulance before Argyle rams it with the limo and knocks Theo unconscious. A weary McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining men, Eddie and Kristoff. After knocking Kristoff unconscious, McClane confronts Gruber and is ordered to surrender his submachine gun. McClane does this to spare Holly but distracts Gruber and Eddie by laughing, allowing him to grab a concealed pistol taped to his back that contains two bullets. McClane wounds Gruber and kills Eddie; Gruber crashes through a window but grabs onto Holly's wrist. Gruber makes a last-ditch attempt to kill the pair, but McClane removes Holly's wristwatch, and Gruber falls to his death.\n\nOutside, McClane and Holly meet Powell. Karl emerges and attempts to shoot McClane, but is killed by Powell. Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo. Thornburg arrives and attempts to interview McClane, but Holly punches him before she and McClane leave the area with Argyle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | footer = Bruce Willis in 2010 (left) and Alan Rickman in 2011; ''Die Hard'' was Rickman's first cinema appearance and Willis's second leading role in a major Hollywood production.\n   | image1 = Bruce Willis by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n   | width1 = 164\n   | image2 = Alan Rickman BAM 2011-01-15 n1.jpg\n   | width2 = 154\n  }}\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as [[John McClane]], a streetwise New York cop who has come to Los Angeles to reconcile with his wife\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Hans Gruber (character)|Hans Gruber]], an extremist recently expelled from a West German political terrorist group and the leader of the terrorists\n* [[Alexander Godunov]] as Karl Vreski, Hans's second-in-command and Tony's brother\n* [[Bonnie Bedelia]] as [[John McClane#Family|Holly Gennero-McClane]], John's estranged wife\n* [[Reginald VelJohnson]] as Sgt.

Willis initially turned down the role due to his contractual commitments to ''Moonlighting''. However, after his co-star [[Cybill Shepherd]] became pregnant, ''Moonlighting'' was shut down for 11 weeks which provided sufficient time for Willis to work on ''Die Hard''.<ref name=Independent1>{{cite news |last= Power |first= Ed  |title= Die Hard at 30: How the every-dude action movie defied expectations and turned Bruce Willis into a star |newspaper= The Independent |date= November 26, 2018 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/die-hard-at-30-anniversary-bruce-willis-john-mcclane-action-movie-christmas-john-mctiernan-a8642466.html |accessdate= November 27, 2018}}</ref> Willis was paid $5 million to star in the film, a figure virtually unheard of at the time for an actor who had, up to that point in time, starred in only one moderately successful film, and normally only paid to major stars such as [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Warren Beatty]]. Then-20th Century Fox president [[Leonard Goldberg]] justified the cost, stating the film was reliant on its lead actor, while other sources within the studio would state that Fox was desperate for a star for ''Die Hard'', intended to be its big summer action blockbuster, especially since they had already been turned down by so many other suitable actors.<ref name=\"DevWillisSalary\"/> As the studio didn't believe in Willis's action star appeal the marketing campaign's initial billboards and posters reflected this, and Willis's face was not a focal point,<ref name=\"DevOtherActors\"/> consistent with CinemaScore's suggestion to emphasize the film's action instead of a star without experience in such films.{{r|lawrence20160830}}\n\nWillis's first day on set was on November 2, 1987, when they shot the nighttime scene of him jumping with a fire hose around his waist as an explosion occurred behind  what appeared to be the top of the Nakatomi tower behind him, following the completion of that day's filming on ''Moonlighting'' at Lorimar Studios (now [[Sony Pictures Studios]]) in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=Independent1/>, In reality, he jumped from the roof of a five-story parking garage onto an airbag. The force of the explosion blew him out to the very edge of the airbag. When upon completing the stunt Willis inquired why they hadn't filmed such a dangerous scene at the end of production, he was told that if they had, then they would have run the expensive risk of having to reshoot the whole movie with another actor.<ref name=Independent1/>\n\nMcTiernan did not want the villains to be terrorists, considering them too mean. He chose to avoid the terrorists' politics in favor of making them thieves in pursuit of monetary gain, believing it would make the film more suitable for summer entertainment. The film's ending had not been finalized by the time filming had begun; one result is that the truck depicted as transporting the terrorists to the building is too small to house the ambulance that was later revealed to be inside it. Other scenes also lacked context: [[production designer]] Jackson De Govia had built the building's computer room before they knew what it would be used for. Likewise, the character of McClane had not been fully realized until almost halfway through production, when McTiernan and Willis decided that he was a man who did not like himself very much, but was doing the best he could in a bad situation. In the original script, ''Die Hard'' took place over three days, but McTiernan was inspired to have it take place over a single night by Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/>\n\nThe corporate headquarters of [[20th Century Fox]], [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]] in [[Century City]] (which had opened a year prior to the film's release), serves as the film's setting for both external and internal scenes. At the time of filming, the building was still under construction, and the setting for a scene of McClane exploring an unfinished floor complete with construction equipment was real\u2014after filming (and construction) was completed, the room used for that scene became the office of former President [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/inside-ronald-reagans-die-hard-635440 |title=Inside Ronald Reagan's Die Hard Office |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=2018-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005190728/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/inside-ronald-reagans-die-hard-635440 |archive-date=2018-10-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> De Govia came up with the idea to use the building. The Nakatomi building's 30th floor, where the hostages are held, was a recreation of the [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]-designed house [[Fallingwater]], including a large rock with water dripping from it. Govia's inspiration came from Japanese corporations of the time buying up American products, his rationale being that Nakatomi had bought Fallingwater and reassembled it in their own building. The building's logo originally was too reminiscent of a [[swastika]] for McTiernan; the final design is closer to a Samurai warrior's helmet. A 380-foot-long [[matte painting]] provided the city backdrop as viewed from inside the Nakatomi building's 30th floor. It featured animated lights and other lighting techniques to present both moving traffic and day and night cycles. {{as of|2011}}, the painting is still in Fox's inventory and is sometimes used in other films. For the film's night exterior shots, cinematographer [[Jan de Bont]] employed a 50mm T1.1 anamorphic lens - the fastest such lens available - and push-processed the film by an additional stop in order to capture the city lights.\n\nThe scene in which the SWAT [[M8 Greyhound|Greyhound armored vehicle]] knocks over a stair railing at the front of Fox Plaza required months of negotiations with Fox to gain approval. The end helicopter scene took six months of preparation, and the production was given only two hours in which to film it. It took three attempts above Fox Plaza, nine camera crews, and no one but crew members was allowed within 500 feet of the line of flight. The scene of McClane falling down a ventilation shaft and catching onto a lower opening was the result of an accident after Willis' stunt man fell. Editor [[Frank J. Urioste]] chose to use the unintentional scene in the final film.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/>\n\n''Die Hard'' was [[Alan Rickman]]'s first feature film role.<ref name=\"LegacyEmpire\"/> Rickman was cast after producer Joel Silver saw his performance as Vicomte de Valmont in the Broadway run of ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses''.<ref name=Independent1/> For his death scene, he was dropped {{convert|70|ft}} on a [[Chroma key|blue screen]] set. The shot used was the first take; Rickman was dropped sooner than he had been told he would be, so the look of fear on his face is genuine, an act that reportedly angered the actor.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/> The DVD text commentary track reveals that the shooting script did not originally include the meeting between McClane and Gruber pretending to be a hostage; it was only written in when it was discovered that Rickman could perform a convincing American accent.\n\n==Release==\nThe premiere of ''Die Hard'' took place on July 12, 1988, at the AVCO theater in Los Angeles, California.<ref name=\"Premiere\"/>\n''Die Hard'' had its inaugural British screening at the London Film Festival on 27 November 1988.<ref name=Independent1/>\n\n===Box office===\n''Die Hard'' opened in limited release in 21 theaters on July 15, 1988, earning $601,851\u2014an average of $28,659 per theater.

McTiernan said that he incorporated those themes into the film's soundtrack as an homage to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (which featured both pieces of music).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.com/talk/2008/02/die-hards-debt|title=Die Hard's Debt to A Clockwork Orange and Beethoven|access-date=2017-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229233731/http://www.amc.com/talk/2008/02/die-hards-debt|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref> Basing his score around thematic variations on well-known pieces is a concept that Kamen previously used in ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s [[Brandenburg Concertos|''Brandenburg Concerto No. 3'']] is playing during the party sequence near the film's beginning.\n\nAs the film has a Christmas setting, the score also features sleigh bells in some cues, as well as the Christmas pop standard \"[[Winter Wonderland]]\". Two 1987 pop songs are used as source music: near the film's beginning, limousine driver Argyle plays the rap song \"[[Christmas in Hollis]]\", performed by [[Run-DMC]], and, later, while talking on the phone in the limousine, Argyle is listening to [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Skeletons (Stevie Wonder song)|Skeletons]]\". The end credits of the film begin with the Christmas song \"[[Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!]]\" (performed by [[Vaughn Monroe]]) and continue with Beethoven's 9th Symphony.\n\nThe film's final four minutes were tracked with music from two other Twentieth Century Fox features; these were temporary tracks which the studio decided to leave in the film. The music heard when McClane and Powell see each other for the first time is from [[John Scott (composer)|John Scott]]'s score for the 1987 film ''[[Man on Fire (1987 film)|Man on Fire]]''. When Karl appears with his rifle, McTiernan decided that he did not like Kamen's produced music for the scene and chose to use a piece of temporary score that the production had purchased. The piece was part of the score composed by [[James Horner]] for the 1986 science fiction action film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/>\n\nSimilarly to ''Aliens'', the score by Michael Kamen was heavily edited, with music samples looped over and over and cues added to scenes.

Based on [[Roderick Thorp]]'s 1979 novel ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (Thorp novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'', it was produced by the Gordon Company and [[Silver Pictures]], and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film follows off-duty [[New York City Police Department]] officer [[John McClane]] ([[Bruce Willis]]) who is caught in a Los Angeles skyscraper on Christmas Eve during a heist led by criminal mastermind [[Hans Gruber (character)|Hans Gruber]] ([[Alan Rickman]]).\n\nMade for $28 million, ''Die Hard'' grossed over $141 million theatrically worldwide. Turning Willis into an action star, the film became a [[metonym]] for an action film in which a lone hero fights overwhelming odds. The film's success spurred creation of the ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, which includes four sequels, a number of video games, and a comic book. In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].

McClane is driven to the party by Argyle, a limousine driver. While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of a ex-[[West Germany|West German]] radical [[Hans Gruber (character)|Hans Gruber]] and his team: Karl Vreski and his brother Tony, Theo, Franco, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James. The group seizes the tower, disables communication to the outside world, and secures those inside as hostages except for McClane, who slips away, and Argyle, who gets stranded in the garage.\n\nGruber interrogates Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi for the code to the building's vault and reveals that he plans to steal $640 million in [[bearer bond]]s, with the terrorist act merely a distraction. Takagi refuses to cooperate and is killed by Gruber. McClane secretly watches, escapes, and sets off a fire alarm in an attempt to alert authorities. Eddie assures the fire department it is a false alarm. Gruber sends Tony to investigate. McClane kills Tony, pocketing his weapon and radio, which he then uses to alert the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], who suspect McClane of making a prank call. Sgt. Al Powell is sent to investigate. Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, who kills them both. Powell arrives, and finding nothing unusual, he prepares to leave, but McClane drops Marco's corpse onto his patrol car to gain his attention. Powell summons the LAPD, who lay siege to the building. McClane steals Heinrich's bag containing [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4 explosives]] and detonators.\n\nJames and Alexander use anti-tank missiles to disable a [[SWAT]] [[M8 Greyhound|armored car]] before McClane drops C-4 attached to an office chair and computer down the elevator shaft, blowing up their floor and killing them. Holly's coworker, Harry Ellis, attempts to mediate between Hans and McClane for the return of the detonators. McClane refuses, prompting Gruber to execute Ellis. While checking explosives attached to the roof, Gruber encounters McClane. Gruber masquerades as an escaped hostage; McClane offers him a gun and Gruber attempts to shoot McClane, but the gun is empty. Karl, Franco, and Fritz arrive; McClane kills Fritz and Franco but is forced to abandon the detonators.\n\nFBI agents take command of the siege, ordering the building's power shut off; this, as Gruber anticipated, disables the vault's final lock. Gruber demands a helicopter on the rooftop for transport to the Los Angeles airport, but the FBI prepare to double-cross him by sending two helicopter gunships. McClane discovers that Gruber intends to detonate the explosives on the roof, faking the deaths of his team so they can escape with the bearer bonds. While making final preparations, Gruber sees a news report by intrusive reporter Richard Thornburg that features McClane's children and deduces from a desk photo that McClane is Holly's husband. The criminals order the hostages to the roof, but Gruber takes Holly with him to use against McClane, who subdues Karl in a fight before heading up to the roof. After killing Uli, he sends the hostages downstairs as the FBI helicopters appear and shoot at McClane, believing him to be a terrorist. Gruber detonates the explosives, destroying the roof and one helicopter; McClane barely survives.\n\nTheo retrieves their getaway vehicle, an ambulance before Argyle rams it with the limo and knocks Theo unconscious. A weary McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining men, Eddie and Kristoff. After knocking Kristoff unconscious, McClane confronts Gruber and is ordered to surrender his submachine gun. McClane does this to spare Holly but distracts Gruber and Eddie by laughing, allowing him to grab a concealed pistol taped to his back that contains two bullets. McClane wounds Gruber and kills Eddie; Gruber crashes through a window but grabs onto Holly's wrist. Gruber makes a last-ditch attempt to kill the pair, but McClane removes Holly's wristwatch, and Gruber falls to his death.\n\nOutside, McClane and Holly meet Powell. Karl emerges and attempts to shoot McClane, but is killed by Powell. Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo. Thornburg arrives and attempts to interview McClane, but Holly punches him before she and McClane leave the area with Argyle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | footer = Bruce Willis in 2010 (left) and Alan Rickman in 2011; ''Die Hard'' was Rickman's first cinema appearance and Willis's second leading role in a major Hollywood production.\n   | image1 = Bruce Willis by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n   | width1 = 164\n   | image2 = Alan Rickman BAM 2011-01-15 n1.jpg\n   | width2 = 154\n  }}\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as [[John McClane]], a streetwise New York cop who has come to Los Angeles to reconcile with his wife\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Hans Gruber (character)|Hans Gruber]], an extremist recently expelled from a West German political terrorist group and the leader of the terrorists\n* [[Alexander Godunov]] as Karl Vreski, Hans's second-in-command and Tony's brother\n* [[Bonnie Bedelia]] as [[John McClane#Family|Holly Gennero-McClane]], John's estranged wife\n* [[Reginald VelJohnson]] as Sgt.

The latter novel was adapted into a 1968 [[The Detective (1968 film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Frank Sinatra]] and was a box-office success. When a movie based on Thorp's sequel went into production, the studio was contractually obligated to offer Sinatra the lead role in ''Die Hard''.<ref name=Independent1/> Sinatra, then in his early 70s, turned down the project.<ref name=Independent1/> The story was then changed to have no connection to ''The Detective''.<ref name=Independent1/> [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] declined the role as he wished to broaden his appeal by attempting comedy in what eventually became ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]''. Although it has been rumored that at this point the project was repurposed to be a sequel to Schwarzenegger's 1985 action film ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'', scriptwriter de Souza has denied this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolbadfilmclub.co.uk/2015/03/19/exclusive-interview-part-2-steven-e-desouza-writerdirector-of-street-fighter/|title=Exclusive Interview (Part 2): Steven E.

Willis initially turned down the role due to his contractual commitments to ''Moonlighting''. However, after his co-star [[Cybill Shepherd]] became pregnant, ''Moonlighting'' was shut down for 11 weeks which provided sufficient time for Willis to work on ''Die Hard''.<ref name=Independent1>{{cite news |last= Power |first= Ed  |title= Die Hard at 30: How the every-dude action movie defied expectations and turned Bruce Willis into a star |newspaper= The Independent |date= November 26, 2018 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/die-hard-at-30-anniversary-bruce-willis-john-mcclane-action-movie-christmas-john-mctiernan-a8642466.html |accessdate= November 27, 2018}}</ref> Willis was paid $5 million to star in the film, a figure virtually unheard of at the time for an actor who had, up to that point in time, starred in only one moderately successful film, and normally only paid to major stars such as [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Warren Beatty]]. Then-20th Century Fox president [[Leonard Goldberg]] justified the cost, stating the film was reliant on its lead actor, while other sources within the studio would state that Fox was desperate for a star for ''Die Hard'', intended to be its big summer action blockbuster, especially since they had already been turned down by so many other suitable actors.<ref name=\"DevWillisSalary\"/> As the studio didn't believe in Willis's action star appeal the marketing campaign's initial billboards and posters reflected this, and Willis's face was not a focal point,<ref name=\"DevOtherActors\"/> consistent with CinemaScore's suggestion to emphasize the film's action instead of a star without experience in such films.{{r|lawrence20160830}}\n\nWillis's first day on set was on November 2, 1987, when they shot the nighttime scene of him jumping with a fire hose around his waist as an explosion occurred behind  what appeared to be the top of the Nakatomi tower behind him, following the completion of that day's filming on ''Moonlighting'' at Lorimar Studios (now [[Sony Pictures Studios]]) in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=Independent1/>, In reality, he jumped from the roof of a five-story parking garage onto an airbag. The force of the explosion blew him out to the very edge of the airbag. When upon completing the stunt Willis inquired why they hadn't filmed such a dangerous scene at the end of production, he was told that if they had, then they would have run the expensive risk of having to reshoot the whole movie with another actor.<ref name=Independent1/>\n\nMcTiernan did not want the villains to be terrorists, considering them too mean. He chose to avoid the terrorists' politics in favor of making them thieves in pursuit of monetary gain, believing it would make the film more suitable for summer entertainment. The film's ending had not been finalized by the time filming had begun; one result is that the truck depicted as transporting the terrorists to the building is too small to house the ambulance that was later revealed to be inside it. Other scenes also lacked context: [[production designer]] Jackson De Govia had built the building's computer room before they knew what it would be used for. Likewise, the character of McClane had not been fully realized until almost halfway through production, when McTiernan and Willis decided that he was a man who did not like himself very much, but was doing the best he could in a bad situation. In the original script, ''Die Hard'' took place over three days, but McTiernan was inspired to have it take place over a single night by Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/>\n\nThe corporate headquarters of [[20th Century Fox]], [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]] in [[Century City]] (which had opened a year prior to the film's release), serves as the film's setting for both external and internal scenes. At the time of filming, the building was still under construction, and the setting for a scene of McClane exploring an unfinished floor complete with construction equipment was real\u2014after filming (and construction) was completed, the room used for that scene became the office of former President [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/inside-ronald-reagans-die-hard-635440 |title=Inside Ronald Reagan's Die Hard Office |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=2018-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005190728/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/inside-ronald-reagans-die-hard-635440 |archive-date=2018-10-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> De Govia came up with the idea to use the building. The Nakatomi building's 30th floor, where the hostages are held, was a recreation of the [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]-designed house [[Fallingwater]], including a large rock with water dripping from it. Govia's inspiration came from Japanese corporations of the time buying up American products, his rationale being that Nakatomi had bought Fallingwater and reassembled it in their own building. The building's logo originally was too reminiscent of a [[swastika]] for McTiernan; the final design is closer to a Samurai warrior's helmet. A 380-foot-long [[matte painting]] provided the city backdrop as viewed from inside the Nakatomi building's 30th floor. It featured animated lights and other lighting techniques to present both moving traffic and day and night cycles. {{as of|2011}}, the painting is still in Fox's inventory and is sometimes used in other films. For the film's night exterior shots, cinematographer [[Jan de Bont]] employed a 50mm T1.1 anamorphic lens - the fastest such lens available - and push-processed the film by an additional stop in order to capture the city lights.\n\nThe scene in which the SWAT [[M8 Greyhound|Greyhound armored vehicle]] knocks over a stair railing at the front of Fox Plaza required months of negotiations with Fox to gain approval. The end helicopter scene took six months of preparation, and the production was given only two hours in which to film it. It took three attempts above Fox Plaza, nine camera crews, and no one but crew members was allowed within 500 feet of the line of flight. The scene of McClane falling down a ventilation shaft and catching onto a lower opening was the result of an accident after Willis' stunt man fell. Editor [[Frank J. Urioste]] chose to use the unintentional scene in the final film.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/>\n\n''Die Hard'' was [[Alan Rickman]]'s first feature film role.<ref name=\"LegacyEmpire\"/> Rickman was cast after producer Joel Silver saw his performance as Vicomte de Valmont in the Broadway run of ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses''.<ref name=Independent1/> For his death scene, he was dropped {{convert|70|ft}} on a [[Chroma key|blue screen]] set. The shot used was the first take; Rickman was dropped sooner than he had been told he would be, so the look of fear on his face is genuine, an act that reportedly angered the actor.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/> The DVD text commentary track reveals that the shooting script did not originally include the meeting between McClane and Gruber pretending to be a hostage; it was only written in when it was discovered that Rickman could perform a convincing American accent.\n\n==Release==\nThe premiere of ''Die Hard'' took place on July 12, 1988, at the AVCO theater in Los Angeles, California.<ref name=\"Premiere\"/>\n''Die Hard'' had its inaugural British screening at the London Film Festival on 27 November 1988.<ref name=Independent1/>\n\n===Box office===\n''Die Hard'' opened in limited release in 21 theaters on July 15, 1988, earning $601,851\u2014an average of $28,659 per theater.

film was nominated for four [[61st Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]] ([[Stephen Hunter Flick]] and [[Richard Shorr]]), [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]] ([[Don Bassman|Don J. Bassman]], [[Kevin F. Cleary]], [[Richard Overton (sound engineer)|Richard Overton]] and [[Al Overton Jr.]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] ([[Richard Edlund]], [[Al DiSarro]], [[Brent Boates]] and Thaine Morris).<ref name=\"Oscars1989\"/> [[Michael Kamen]]'s score earned him a [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI TV/Film Music Award]] in 1989.<ref name=\"AccoBMI\"/>\n\n==Music==\nThe main theme from the finale of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] (commonly known as \"Ode to Joy\") is featured prominently in [[Michael Kamen]]'s score throughout the film, in many guises and variations (mostly as a [[leitmotif]] for Gruber and the terrorists), and thematic variations on \"[[Singin' in the Rain (song)|Singin' in the Rain]]\" are also featured, as the theme for the character Theo. McTiernan said that he incorporated those themes into the film's soundtrack as an homage to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (which featured both pieces of music).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.com/talk/2008/02/die-hards-debt|title=Die Hard's Debt to A Clockwork Orange and Beethoven|access-date=2017-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229233731/http://www.amc.com/talk/2008/02/die-hards-debt|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref> Basing his score around thematic variations on well-known pieces is a concept that Kamen previously used in ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s [[Brandenburg Concertos|''Brandenburg Concerto No. 3'']] is playing during the party sequence near the film's beginning.\n\nAs the film has a Christmas setting, the score also features sleigh bells in some cues, as well as the Christmas pop standard \"[[Winter Wonderland]]\". Two 1987 pop songs are used as source music: near the film's beginning, limousine driver Argyle plays the rap song \"[[Christmas in Hollis]]\", performed by [[Run-DMC]], and, later, while talking on the phone in the limousine, Argyle is listening to [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Skeletons (Stevie Wonder song)|Skeletons]]\". The end credits of the film begin with the Christmas song \"[[Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!]]\" (performed by [[Vaughn Monroe]]) and continue with Beethoven's 9th Symphony.\n\nThe film's final four minutes were tracked with music from two other Twentieth Century Fox features; these were temporary tracks which the studio decided to leave in the film. The music heard when McClane and Powell see each other for the first time is from [[John Scott (composer)|John Scott]]'s score for the 1987 film ''[[Man on Fire (1987 film)|Man on Fire]]''. When Karl appears with his rifle, McTiernan decided that he did not like Kamen's produced music for the scene and chose to use a piece of temporary score that the production had purchased. The piece was part of the score composed by [[James Horner]] for the 1986 science fiction action film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/>\n\nSimilarly to ''Aliens'', the score by Michael Kamen was heavily edited, with music samples looped over and over and cues added to scenes. The most notable example is the \"brass blast\" heard when John slams the chair at the window as he confronts Marco, then Heinrich appears and he kills him, and later when Hans Gruber falls to his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/die_hard.html|title=Filmtracks: Die Hard (Michael Kamen)|accessdate=2009-07-10|publisher=Filmtracks.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701235511/http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/die_hard.html|archive-date=2009-07-01|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe score as heard in the film was released by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] in February 2002, but was limited to 3,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.varesesarabande.com/details.asp?pid=VCL%2D0202%2D1004 |title=Die Hard by Michael Kamen |accessdate=2009-07-10 |publisher=Varesesarabande.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016021428/http://www.varesesarabande.com/details.asp?pid=VCL-0202-1004 |archivedate=October 16, 2007 }}</ref> It was subsequently reissued by La-La Land Records in November 2011, in a two-disc limited edition of 3,500 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lalalandrecords.com/Die.html|title=Die Hard by Michael Kamen|accessdate=2014-05-29|website=lalalandrecords.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529085641/http://www.lalalandrecords.com/Die.html|archivedate=2014-05-29}}</ref> In addition to the Kamen score, this release also includes the Monroe and Beethoven end credits pieces, Run-DMC's \"Christmas in Hollis,\" and the John Scott track from ''Man on Fire''.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe film spawned four sequels: ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' (1990), ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'' (2007), and ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'' (2013).
