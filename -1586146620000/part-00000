In this competition, teams design, build, and program robots to compete at tournaments. Students from Grades 6-12 may participate.  At tournaments, teams participate in qualifying matches where two teams vs two teams participate. In the Elimination Rounds, alliances of two teams are selected by the top-seeded teams, and the alliance who wins the finals is the winner of the tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr|title=VEX EDR|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe current challenge is  VEX Robotics Competition: Tower Takeover\n\n===Rules===\n\nMiddle and high school students have the same game and rules.

The team colors are red and blue.\n* No robot may exceed the dimensions of an 18\" cube until the match has begun.\n* At the start of the match is a 15-second autonomous period, where all four robots navigate the field entirely by themselves.\n* After the autonomous period is the driver control period, which is 1 minute and 45 seconds of manual control of the robot through a handheld controller.\n* Blue alliance can't come into the Red alliance's protected are and vice versa.\n* Intentionally removing the cubes from the field will result in a warning and a disqualification.\n\n=== <u>Current game: Tower Takeover</u> ===\nThe object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by stacking cubes in goals, and by placing cubes in towers.\nThere are five (5) neutral towers, two (2) alliance towers, twenty two (22) green cubes, twenty two (22) purple cubes, twenty two (22) orange cubes, and four (4) goals.\n\nCubes can be stacked in goals of your Alliance color, and can also be placed into towers which adds value to the colour of the cube placed.

The rules are nearly identical for this division as for the EDR division, but VEX U teams are allowed to take advantage of more customization and greater flexibility than other levels. Also, their robot creation is limited by the need to find effective costs and a restricted development environment in order to model a real-world situation. In addition, in past competitions, Vex U teams needed to create two different complementary robots, one big and one small, and program them to work together to defeat opponent teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roboticseducation.org/vex-u-competition-overview__trashed/vex-u-current-game/|title=VEXU|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the VEX U competition although very similar to VRC EDR competition, has some distinguishable rules to its division. Rather than being limited to an 18\" cube, in VEX U you have the availability to go up to a 24\" cube. The autonomous period is also extended in competitions to last 45 seconds, where all interaction with robots is strictly prohibited. As a result, the driver control period is shortened to a period of 75 seconds, immediately after the autonomous period.\n\nStarting in the 2016-2017 game Starstruck, rather than having the usual 2-robot vs 2-robot format, VEX U matches would be 1-team vs 1-team. However, this was replaced after the 2017-2018 season In the Zone, and the games since have reverted to the 2-robot vs 2-robot format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/vrc-inthezone/VRC-InTheZone-AppendixE-VEXU-20170817.pdf|title=Appendix E - Vex U}}</ref>\n\n==VEX IQ challenge==\nThe VEX IQ Challenge, presented by the Robotics Education & Competition Foundation, provides elementary and middle school students with exciting, open-ended robotics and research project challenges that enhance their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills through hands-on, student-centered learning. A VEX IQ Robotics set is used, with plastic pieces that snap together using pegs, and it is extremely easy to construct a robot. The students use a graphical software to program the robot. There are two parts to the contests: Robot Skills, which is a single robot trying to score as many points as possible, and the Teamwork Challenge, where two robots attempt to work together to complete the same task.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexiq/|title=VEX IQ|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== <u>Current game</u> ===\n\n'''The VEX IQ Challenge - Squared Away'''\n\nVEX IQ Challenge Squared Away is played on a 4\u2019x8\u2019 rectangular field.

The rules are nearly identical for this division as for the EDR division, but VEX U teams are allowed to take advantage of more customization and greater flexibility than other levels. Also, their robot creation is limited by the need to find effective costs and a restricted development environment in order to model a real-world situation. In addition, in past competitions, Vex U teams needed to create two different complementary robots, one big and one small, and program them to work together to defeat opponent teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roboticseducation.org/vex-u-competition-overview__trashed/vex-u-current-game/|title=VEXU|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the VEX U competition although very similar to VRC EDR competition, has some distinguishable rules to its division. Rather than being limited to an 18\" cube, in VEX U you have the availability to go up to a 24\" cube. The autonomous period is also extended in competitions to last 45 seconds, where all interaction with robots is strictly prohibited. As a result, the driver control period is shortened to a period of 75 seconds, immediately after the autonomous period.\n\nStarting in the 2016-2017 game Starstruck, rather than having the usual 2-robot vs 2-robot format, VEX U matches would be 1-team vs 1-team. However, this was replaced after the 2017-2018 season In the Zone, and the games since have reverted to the 2-robot vs 2-robot format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/vrc-inthezone/VRC-InTheZone-AppendixE-VEXU-20170817.pdf|title=Appendix E - Vex U}}</ref>\n\n==VEX IQ challenge==\nThe VEX IQ Challenge, presented by the Robotics Education & Competition Foundation, provides elementary and middle school students with exciting, open-ended robotics and research project challenges that enhance their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills through hands-on, student-centered learning. A VEX IQ Robotics set is used, with plastic pieces that snap together using pegs, and it is extremely easy to construct a robot. The students use a graphical software to program the robot.

The idea for the Breeders' Cup was proposed at the 1982 awards luncheon for the [[Kentucky Derby Festival]] by pet food heir [[John R. Gaines]] (1928\u20132005),<ref name=Duckworth/> a leading Thoroughbred owner and breeder who wanted to clean up the sport's image. The Cup was initially faced with much skepticism in the racing community, however with the vocal support of legendary trainer [[John A. Nerud|John Nerud]] and others, the Breeders' Cup was carried out, and subsequently experienced tremendous popularity domestically and abroad.\n\nThe prize money is largely supported by nomination fees paid by breeders for stallions and the resultant foals. In North America, participating stud farms pay an annual nomination fee for a given stallions that is equal to the stallion's advertised stud fee, plus an additional amount if the stallion has more than 50 foals in a given year. The cost to nominate a European stallion is 50% of their stud fee, while the nomination fee for a South American stallion is 25% of their stud fee. In North America, the breeders of the resultant foals must also pay a one-time nomination fee (currently $400) by October 15 of the year of birth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breeding & Nominations|url=http://www.breederscup.com/history-tradition/breeding-nominations|website=www.breederscup.com|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe races are operated by Breeders' Cup Limited, a company formed in 1982.

Winners of the  \"Win and You're In\" [[Breeders' Cup Challenge]] races automatically qualify. Other pre-entries are ranked by (1) a point system for [[Graded stakes race|graded stakes]] performance during the year, and (2) the judgment of a panel of racing experts. After pre-entries are taken approximately two weeks before the Breeders' Cup, the ranking determines eligibility in oversubscribed races. After pre-entry, any vacancies in the fields are filled by horses in order of panel preference.<ref name=HowItWorks />\n\n==Details==\nThrough 2006, there were eight races on the Breeders' Cup card, all classified as [[graded stakes race|Grade I]] races. In 2007, three races \u2013 the Dirt Mile, Filly and Mare Sprint, and Juvenile Turf \u2013 were added, all of them run the Friday before the remaining eight races.

Since 2013, the gender on both days is mixed between races.]]\nThe order of the races on the card has changed many times throughout the event's history, but the Turf and Classic are traditionally the last two races. The 2008 event was the first in which Day 1 of the event was dedicated to races for fillies and mares, with Day 2 featuring all other races. For 2009, the Marathon, open to runners of both sexes, was moved from Day 2 to be the opening race on Day 1, but all other races stayed on the day they had been run in 2008. In 2011, the Marathon was moved from Day 1 to Day 2, with the Juvenile Sprint becoming the first race overall (and also the only one on Day 1 open to males). The Marathon returned to Day 1 in 2012. Since 2013, the first day was no longer primarily devoted to races for fillies and mares, with the Dirt Mile and Juvenile Turf moving to Day 1 and the Filly & Mare Sprint and Filly & Mare Turf moving to Day 2.\n\nTwo other significant changes were made in 2013. First, the Juvenile Sprint (on dirt) was discontinued after only two runnings. That race had been widely perceived as a consolation prize for horses not good enough to run in the Juvenile.<ref name=Duckworth>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/horse-racing/story/_/id/9902828/oh-breeders-cup-world-championships |title=Oh, Breeders' Cup |first=Amanda |last=Duckworth |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref> Second, the Ladies' Classic returned to its original name of Distaff. When the latter announcement was made, Breeders' Cup president Craig Fravel said,<blockquote>We restored the Ladies' Classic to its original name due to feedback from our loyal fans who have a strong affinity for the Distaff. In recognition of our 30th year, the Distaff has provided us with some of racing's most remarkable moments, personified by such outstanding thoroughbreds as [[Lady's Secret]], [[Personal Ensign]], [[Azeri (horse)|Azeri]], [[Zenyatta]], and our two-time defending champion, [[Royal Delta]]. It is a fitting tribute to bring back the name Distaff to honor the rich history of the championships.<ref name=Duckworth/></blockquote>\n\nFor 2018, the sprint race for two-year olds was revived, now on turf as the Juvenile Turf Sprint.  According to officials, the turf races for two-year old horses have more entries than can fit within the Breeders' Cup limit of 12 to 14 horses, so they needed to add the third turf race for two-year old horses at 5.5 or six furlongs, depending on the track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint added to World Championship Program|url=http://www.breederscup.com/article/breeders-cup-juvenile-turf-sprint-added-world-championships-program|website=Breeders Cup Ltd|publisher=Breeders Cup Ltd|accessdate=6 February 2018|ref=BC2018}}</ref>\n\n==Winners and records==\n\n===Most wins and earnings===\nBreeders' Cup Wins \u2013 Jockey:<ref>{{cite web|title=Leading Breeders' Cup jockeys|url=http://stats.breederscup.com/bcosJockeysByMoneyPDF.cfm?jockeyRace=ALL&jockeyYear=ALL&jockeyID=|website=Breeders' Cup|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Mike E.

The idea for the Breeders' Cup was proposed at the 1982 awards luncheon for the [[Kentucky Derby Festival]] by pet food heir [[John R. Gaines]] (1928\u20132005),<ref name=Duckworth/> a leading Thoroughbred owner and breeder who wanted to clean up the sport's image. The Cup was initially faced with much skepticism in the racing community, however with the vocal support of legendary trainer [[John A. Nerud|John Nerud]] and others, the Breeders' Cup was carried out, and subsequently experienced tremendous popularity domestically and abroad.\n\nThe prize money is largely supported by nomination fees paid by breeders for stallions and the resultant foals. In North America, participating stud farms pay an annual nomination fee for a given stallions that is equal to the stallion's advertised stud fee, plus an additional amount if the stallion has more than 50 foals in a given year. The cost to nominate a European stallion is 50% of their stud fee, while the nomination fee for a South American stallion is 25% of their stud fee. In North America, the breeders of the resultant foals must also pay a one-time nomination fee (currently $400) by October 15 of the year of birth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breeding & Nominations|url=http://www.breederscup.com/history-tradition/breeding-nominations|website=www.breederscup.com|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe races are operated by Breeders' Cup Limited, a company formed in 1982.

Other pre-entries are ranked by (1) a point system for [[Graded stakes race|graded stakes]] performance during the year, and (2) the judgment of a panel of racing experts. After pre-entries are taken approximately two weeks before the Breeders' Cup, the ranking determines eligibility in oversubscribed races. After pre-entry, any vacancies in the fields are filled by horses in order of panel preference.<ref name=HowItWorks />\n\n==Details==\nThrough 2006, there were eight races on the Breeders' Cup card, all classified as [[graded stakes race|Grade I]] races. In 2007, three races \u2013 the Dirt Mile, Filly and Mare Sprint, and Juvenile Turf \u2013 were added, all of them run the Friday before the remaining eight races. Three more new races \u2013 a Turf Sprint, Juvenile Filly Turf and Marathon \u2013 were added for 2008.<ref name=\"news.bloodhorse.com\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bloodhorse.com/viewstory.asp?id=42402|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710222148/http://news.bloodhorse.com/viewstory.asp?id=42402|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 10, 2012|title=All Articles - BloodHorse.com|work=bloodhorse.com|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref> A Juvenile Sprint was added for 2011.\n[[File:Breeders Cup 2009 002 (4108584368).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The championship races in 2009 (pictured) were the second year to have a day devoted to female horses. Since 2013, the gender on both days is mixed between races.]]\nThe order of the races on the card has changed many times throughout the event's history, but the Turf and Classic are traditionally the last two races. The 2008 event was the first in which Day 1 of the event was dedicated to races for fillies and mares, with Day 2 featuring all other races. For 2009, the Marathon, open to runners of both sexes, was moved from Day 2 to be the opening race on Day 1, but all other races stayed on the day they had been run in 2008. In 2011, the Marathon was moved from Day 1 to Day 2, with the Juvenile Sprint becoming the first race overall (and also the only one on Day 1 open to males). The Marathon returned to Day 1 in 2012. Since 2013, the first day was no longer primarily devoted to races for fillies and mares, with the Dirt Mile and Juvenile Turf moving to Day 1 and the Filly & Mare Sprint and Filly & Mare Turf moving to Day 2.\n\nTwo other significant changes were made in 2013. First, the Juvenile Sprint (on dirt) was discontinued after only two runnings. That race had been widely perceived as a consolation prize for horses not good enough to run in the Juvenile.<ref name=Duckworth>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/horse-racing/story/_/id/9902828/oh-breeders-cup-world-championships |title=Oh, Breeders' Cup |first=Amanda |last=Duckworth |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref> Second, the Ladies' Classic returned to its original name of Distaff. When the latter announcement was made, Breeders' Cup president Craig Fravel said,<blockquote>We restored the Ladies' Classic to its original name due to feedback from our loyal fans who have a strong affinity for the Distaff. In recognition of our 30th year, the Distaff has provided us with some of racing's most remarkable moments, personified by such outstanding thoroughbreds as [[Lady's Secret]], [[Personal Ensign]], [[Azeri (horse)|Azeri]], [[Zenyatta]], and our two-time defending champion, [[Royal Delta]]. It is a fitting tribute to bring back the name Distaff to honor the rich history of the championships.<ref name=Duckworth/></blockquote>\n\nFor 2018, the sprint race for two-year olds was revived, now on turf as the Juvenile Turf Sprint.  According to officials, the turf races for two-year old horses have more entries than can fit within the Breeders' Cup limit of 12 to 14 horses, so they needed to add the third turf race for two-year old horses at 5.5 or six furlongs, depending on the track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint added to World Championship Program|url=http://www.breederscup.com/article/breeders-cup-juvenile-turf-sprint-added-world-championships-program|website=Breeders Cup Ltd|publisher=Breeders Cup Ltd|accessdate=6 February 2018|ref=BC2018}}</ref>\n\n==Winners and records==\n\n===Most wins and earnings===\nBreeders' Cup Wins \u2013 Jockey:<ref>{{cite web|title=Leading Breeders' Cup jockeys|url=http://stats.breederscup.com/bcosJockeysByMoneyPDF.cfm?jockeyRace=ALL&jockeyYear=ALL&jockeyID=|website=Breeders' Cup|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Mike E.
