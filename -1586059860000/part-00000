Later spectroscopic work confirmed this extraordinary temperature. In the mid-1950s [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]] calculated the properties of a gas at such a temperature and determined it was such a superb conductor of heat that it must extend way out into space, beyond the orbit of Earth. Also in the 1950s, [[Ludwig Biermann]] became interested in the fact that no matter whether a [[comet]] is headed towards or away from the Sun, its tail always points away from the Sun.

Furthermore, Parker was the first person to notice that the weakening effect of the gravity has the same effect on [[hydrodynamic]] flow as a [[de Laval nozzle]]: it incites a transition from [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] to [[supersonic]] flow.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eugene Parker |bibcode=1958ApJ...128..664P |title=Dynamics of the Interplanetary Gas and Magnetic Fields |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=128 |pages=664 |date=1958 |doi=10.1086/146579}}</ref>\n\nOpposition to Parker's hypothesis on the solar wind was strong.

Parker's model predicted that the wind should make the transition to supersonic flow at an altitude of about 4 solar radii from the [[photosphere]] (surface); but the transition (or \"sonic point\") now appears to be much lower, perhaps only 1 solar radius above the photosphere, suggesting that some additional mechanism accelerates the solar wind away from the Sun.

CMEs are caused by release of magnetic energy at the Sun. CMEs are often called \"solar storms\" or \"space storms\" in the popular media. They are sometimes, but not always, associated with [[solar flare]]s, which are another manifestation of magnetic energy release at the Sun. CMEs cause shock waves in the thin plasma of the heliosphere, launching electromagnetic [[wave]]s and accelerating particles (mostly [[proton]]s and [[electrons]]) to form showers of [[ionizing radiation]] that precede the CME.\n\nWhen a CME impacts the Earth's [[magnetosphere]], it temporarily deforms the Earth's [[magnetic field]], changing the direction of [[compass]] needles and inducing large electrical ground currents in Earth itself; this is called a [[geomagnetic storm]] and it is a global phenomenon. CME impacts can induce [[magnetic reconnection]] in Earth's [[Magnetosphere#Magnetic tails|magnetotail]] (the midnight side of the [[magnetosphere]]); this launches protons and electrons downward toward Earth's atmosphere, where they form the [[Aurora (phenomenon)|aurora]].\n\nCMEs are not the only cause of [[space weather]]. Different patches on the Sun are known to give rise to slightly different speeds and densities of wind depending on local conditions. In isolation, each of these different wind streams would form a spiral with a slightly different angle, with fast-moving streams moving out more directly and slow-moving streams wrapping more around the Sun. Fast moving streams tend to overtake slower streams that originate [[west]]ward of them on the Sun, forming turbulent co-rotating interaction regions that give rise to wave motions and accelerated particles, and that affect Earth's magnetosphere in the same way as, but more gently than, CMEs.\n\n==Solar System effects==\n{{Main|Space weather}}\n[[File:Heliospheric-current-sheet.gif|250px|thumb|The [[heliospheric current sheet]] results from the influence of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the plasma in the solar wind]]\n\nOver the Sun's lifetime, the interaction of its surface layers with the escaping solar wind has significantly decreased its surface rotation rate.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last=Endal | first=A.

The solar wind flows from left to right.]]\n\nWhere the solar wind intersects with a planet that has a well-developed [[magnetic field]] (such as Earth, Jupiter or Saturn), the particles are deflected by the [[Lorentz force]]. This region, known as the [[magnetosphere]], causes the particles to travel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere or surface. The magnetosphere is roughly shaped like a [[Sphere|hemisphere]] on the side facing the Sun, then is drawn out in a long wake on the opposite side. The boundary of this region is called the [[magnetopause]], and some of the particles are able to penetrate the magnetosphere through this region by partial reconnection of the magnetic field lines.<ref name=\"encrenaz\" />\n\n[[File:Solar Wind and Earth's magnetic field.png|thumb|Noon meridian section of magnetosphere]]\n\nThe solar wind is responsible for the overall shape of Earth's magnetosphere. Fluctuations in its speed, density, direction, and [[Interplanetary magnetic field|entrained magnetic field]] strongly affect Earth's local space environment. For example, the levels of ionizing radiation and radio interference can vary by factors of hundreds to thousands; and the shape and location of the magnetopause and bow [[shock wave]] upstream of it can change by several Earth radii, exposing [[Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous]] satellites to the direct solar wind. These phenomena are collectively called [[space weather]].\n\nFrom the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster]] mission, a new study has taken place that proposes that it is easier for the solar wind to infiltrate the magnetosphere than previously believed. A group of scientists directly observed the existence of certain waves in the solar wind that were not expected. A recent study shows that these waves enable incoming charged particles of solar wind to breach the magnetopause. This suggests that the magnetic bubble forms more as a filter than a continuous barrier. This latest discovery occurred through the distinctive arrangement of the four identical Cluster spacecraft, which fly in a controlled configuration through near-Earth space. As they sweep from the magnetosphere into interplanetary space and back again, the fleet provides exceptional three-dimensional insights on the phenomena that connect the sun to Earth.\n\nThe research characterised variances in formation of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) largely influenced by [[Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz instability]] (which occur at the interface of two fluids) as a result of differences in thickness and numerous other characteristics of the boundary layer. Experts believe that this was the first occasion that the appearance of Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz waves at the magnetopause had been displayed at high latitude dawnward orientation of the IMF. These waves are being seen in unforeseen places under solar wind conditions that were formerly believed to be undesired for their generation. These discoveries show how Earth's magnetosphere can be penetrated by solar particles under specific IMF circumstances. The findings are also relevant to studies of magnetospheric progressions around other planetary bodies. This study suggests that Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz waves can be a somewhat common, and possibly constant, instrument for the entrance of solar wind into terrestrial magnetospheres under various IMF orientations.<ref>NASA Study Using Cluster Reveals New Insights Into Solar Wind, NASA, Greenbelt, 2012, p.1</ref>\n\n===Atmospheres===\nThe solar wind affects other incoming [[cosmic ray]]s interacting with planetary atmospheres. Moreover, planets with a weak or non-existent magnetosphere are subject to atmospheric stripping by the solar wind.\n\n[[Venus]], the nearest and most similar planet to Earth, has 100 times denser atmosphere, with little or no geo-magnetic field. Space probes discovered a comet-like tail that extends to Earth's orbit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gr\u00fcnwaldt H|display-authors=etal |date=1997 |title=Venus tail ray observation near Earth |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=163\u20131166 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=active&cluster=13741676747552292586 | doi = 10.1029/97GL01159 |bibcode=1997GeoRL..24.1163G}}</ref>\n\nEarth itself is largely protected from the solar wind by [[Earth's magnetic field|its magnetic field]], which deflects most of the charged particles; however some of the charged particles are trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]. A smaller number of particles from the solar wind manage to travel, as though on an electromagnetic energy transmission line, to the Earth's upper atmosphere and [[ionosphere]] in the auroral zones. The only time the solar wind is observable on the Earth is when it is strong enough to produce phenomena such as the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and [[geomagnetic storm]]s. Bright auroras strongly heat the ionosphere, causing its plasma to expand into the magnetosphere, increasing the size of the plasma [[geosphere]] and injecting atmospheric matter into the solar wind. [[Geomagnetic storm]]s result when the pressure of plasmas contained inside the magnetosphere is sufficiently large to inflate and thereby distort the geomagnetic field.\n\nAlthough [[Mars]] is larger than Mercury and four times farther from the Sun, it is thought that the solar wind has stripped away up to a third of its original atmosphere, leaving a layer 1/100th as dense as the Earth's. It is believed the mechanism for this atmospheric stripping is gas caught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/solar-wind-ripping-chunks-mars/|title=Solar wind ripping chunks off Mars -|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072916/http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/solar-wind-ripping-chunks-mars/|archivedate=2016-03-04}}</ref> In 2015 the NASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution ([[MAVEN]]) mission measured the rate of atmospheric stripping caused by the magnetic field carried by the solar wind as it flows past Mars, which generates an electric field, much as a turbine on Earth can be used to generate electricity.

During coronal mass ejections, however, the magnetopause may get pressed into the surface of the planet, and under these conditions, the solar wind may interact freely with the planetary surface.\n\nThe Earth's [[Moon]] has no atmosphere or intrinsic [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]], and consequently its surface is bombarded with the full solar wind.

Parker's model predicted that the wind should make the transition to supersonic flow at an altitude of about 4 solar radii from the [[photosphere]] (surface); but the transition (or \"sonic point\") now appears to be much lower, perhaps only 1 solar radius above the photosphere, suggesting that some additional mechanism accelerates the solar wind away from the Sun.

CMEs are caused by release of magnetic energy at the Sun. CMEs are often called \"solar storms\" or \"space storms\" in the popular media. They are sometimes, but not always, associated with [[solar flare]]s, which are another manifestation of magnetic energy release at the Sun. CMEs cause shock waves in the thin plasma of the heliosphere, launching electromagnetic [[wave]]s and accelerating particles (mostly [[proton]]s and [[electrons]]) to form showers of [[ionizing radiation]] that precede the CME.\n\nWhen a CME impacts the Earth's [[magnetosphere]], it temporarily deforms the Earth's [[magnetic field]], changing the direction of [[compass]] needles and inducing large electrical ground currents in Earth itself; this is called a [[geomagnetic storm]] and it is a global phenomenon. CME impacts can induce [[magnetic reconnection]] in Earth's [[Magnetosphere#Magnetic tails|magnetotail]] (the midnight side of the [[magnetosphere]]); this launches protons and electrons downward toward Earth's atmosphere, where they form the [[Aurora (phenomenon)|aurora]].\n\nCMEs are not the only cause of [[space weather]]. Different patches on the Sun are known to give rise to slightly different speeds and densities of wind depending on local conditions. In isolation, each of these different wind streams would form a spiral with a slightly different angle, with fast-moving streams moving out more directly and slow-moving streams wrapping more around the Sun. Fast moving streams tend to overtake slower streams that originate [[west]]ward of them on the Sun, forming turbulent co-rotating interaction regions that give rise to wave motions and accelerated particles, and that affect Earth's magnetosphere in the same way as, but more gently than, CMEs.\n\n==Solar System effects==\n{{Main|Space weather}}\n[[File:Heliospheric-current-sheet.gif|250px|thumb|The [[heliospheric current sheet]] results from the influence of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the plasma in the solar wind]]\n\nOver the Sun's lifetime, the interaction of its surface layers with the escaping solar wind has significantly decreased its surface rotation rate.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last=Endal | first=A.

The solar wind flows from left to right.]]\n\nWhere the solar wind intersects with a planet that has a well-developed [[magnetic field]] (such as Earth, Jupiter or Saturn), the particles are deflected by the [[Lorentz force]]. This region, known as the [[magnetosphere]], causes the particles to travel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere or surface. The magnetosphere is roughly shaped like a [[Sphere|hemisphere]] on the side facing the Sun, then is drawn out in a long wake on the opposite side. The boundary of this region is called the [[magnetopause]], and some of the particles are able to penetrate the magnetosphere through this region by partial reconnection of the magnetic field lines.<ref name=\"encrenaz\" />\n\n[[File:Solar Wind and Earth's magnetic field.png|thumb|Noon meridian section of magnetosphere]]\n\nThe solar wind is responsible for the overall shape of Earth's magnetosphere. Fluctuations in its speed, density, direction, and [[Interplanetary magnetic field|entrained magnetic field]] strongly affect Earth's local space environment. For example, the levels of ionizing radiation and radio interference can vary by factors of hundreds to thousands; and the shape and location of the magnetopause and bow [[shock wave]] upstream of it can change by several Earth radii, exposing [[Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous]] satellites to the direct solar wind. These phenomena are collectively called [[space weather]].\n\nFrom the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster]] mission, a new study has taken place that proposes that it is easier for the solar wind to infiltrate the magnetosphere than previously believed. A group of scientists directly observed the existence of certain waves in the solar wind that were not expected. A recent study shows that these waves enable incoming charged particles of solar wind to breach the magnetopause. This suggests that the magnetic bubble forms more as a filter than a continuous barrier. This latest discovery occurred through the distinctive arrangement of the four identical Cluster spacecraft, which fly in a controlled configuration through near-Earth space. As they sweep from the magnetosphere into interplanetary space and back again, the fleet provides exceptional three-dimensional insights on the phenomena that connect the sun to Earth.\n\nThe research characterised variances in formation of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) largely influenced by [[Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz instability]] (which occur at the interface of two fluids) as a result of differences in thickness and numerous other characteristics of the boundary layer. Experts believe that this was the first occasion that the appearance of Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz waves at the magnetopause had been displayed at high latitude dawnward orientation of the IMF. These waves are being seen in unforeseen places under solar wind conditions that were formerly believed to be undesired for their generation. These discoveries show how Earth's magnetosphere can be penetrated by solar particles under specific IMF circumstances. The findings are also relevant to studies of magnetospheric progressions around other planetary bodies. This study suggests that Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz waves can be a somewhat common, and possibly constant, instrument for the entrance of solar wind into terrestrial magnetospheres under various IMF orientations.<ref>NASA Study Using Cluster Reveals New Insights Into Solar Wind, NASA, Greenbelt, 2012, p.1</ref>\n\n===Atmospheres===\nThe solar wind affects other incoming [[cosmic ray]]s interacting with planetary atmospheres. Moreover, planets with a weak or non-existent magnetosphere are subject to atmospheric stripping by the solar wind.\n\n[[Venus]], the nearest and most similar planet to Earth, has 100 times denser atmosphere, with little or no geo-magnetic field. Space probes discovered a comet-like tail that extends to Earth's orbit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gr\u00fcnwaldt H|display-authors=etal |date=1997 |title=Venus tail ray observation near Earth |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=163\u20131166 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=active&cluster=13741676747552292586 | doi = 10.1029/97GL01159 |bibcode=1997GeoRL..24.1163G}}</ref>\n\nEarth itself is largely protected from the solar wind by [[Earth's magnetic field|its magnetic field]], which deflects most of the charged particles; however some of the charged particles are trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]. A smaller number of particles from the solar wind manage to travel, as though on an electromagnetic energy transmission line, to the Earth's upper atmosphere and [[ionosphere]] in the auroral zones. The only time the solar wind is observable on the Earth is when it is strong enough to produce phenomena such as the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and [[geomagnetic storm]]s. Bright auroras strongly heat the ionosphere, causing its plasma to expand into the magnetosphere, increasing the size of the plasma [[geosphere]] and injecting atmospheric matter into the solar wind. [[Geomagnetic storm]]s result when the pressure of plasmas contained inside the magnetosphere is sufficiently large to inflate and thereby distort the geomagnetic field.\n\nAlthough [[Mars]] is larger than Mercury and four times farther from the Sun, it is thought that the solar wind has stripped away up to a third of its original atmosphere, leaving a layer 1/100th as dense as the Earth's. It is believed the mechanism for this atmospheric stripping is gas caught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/solar-wind-ripping-chunks-mars/|title=Solar wind ripping chunks off Mars -|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072916/http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/solar-wind-ripping-chunks-mars/|archivedate=2016-03-04}}</ref> In 2015 the NASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution ([[MAVEN]]) mission measured the rate of atmospheric stripping caused by the magnetic field carried by the solar wind as it flows past Mars, which generates an electric field, much as a turbine on Earth can be used to generate electricity.

During coronal mass ejections, however, the magnetopause may get pressed into the surface of the planet, and under these conditions, the solar wind may interact freely with the planetary surface.\n\nThe Earth's [[Moon]] has no atmosphere or intrinsic [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]], and consequently its surface is bombarded with the full solar wind. The [[Apollo program|Project Apollo missions]] deployed passive aluminum collectors in an attempt to sample the solar wind, and lunar soil returned for study confirmed that the lunar [[regolith]] is enriched in atomic nuclei deposited from the solar wind. These elements may prove useful resources for lunar colonies.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Starukhina | first1 = L.

The point where the solar wind's strength is no longer great enough to push back the interstellar medium is known as the [[Heliosphere|heliopause]] and is often considered to be the outer border of the Solar System. The distance to the heliopause is not precisely known and probably depends on the current velocity of the solar wind and the local density of the interstellar medium, but it is far outside [[Pluto]]'s orbit.

The use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressors and cytostatic agents, organ transplantation, and in particular the emergence of AIDS in 1981 have set conditions for infection reactivation in chronic chagasic patients. Chagasic meningoencephalitis and myocarditis, separately or in association, have been observed more commonly in patients with AIDS (75\u201480% of cases) than in patients with other causes of immunosuppression. In some patients, chagasic encephalitis may be the first manifestation of AIDS. Many patients have the pseudotumoral form (brain \u2018chagoma\u2019), characterized by the presence of single or multiple necrotic-hemorrhagic nodular lesions, usually located in the white matter of the cerebral lobes and, in some cases, in the brain stem and cerebellum.

The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of [[the Voyage of the Beagle]] as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the [[Andes]] near [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near [[Valparaiso]], but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of [[symptom]]s, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life. Attempts to test Darwin's remains at [[Westminster Abbey]] by using modern [[PCR]] techniques were met with a refusal by the Abbey's [[curator]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adler D |title=Darwin's Illness |journal=Isr J Med Sci |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=218\u201321 |year=1989 |pmid=2496051}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n{{update-section|date=February 2020}}\nAs of 2007, Several experimental treatments showed promise in animal models.
