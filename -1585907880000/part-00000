Horan, then aged 11, taught himself how to play the guitar by following YouTube tutorials. His aunt discovered his talent one day when she was in the car with Horan as he started singing. She originally thought the radio was on. As a teenager, he performed at the Mullingar Arts Centre during a fund-raiser for the local football team, the Shamrocks.

[[Louis Walsh]] was in his favour, but [[Cheryl Fernandez-Versini|Cheryl Cole]] and guest judge [[Katy Perry]] felt that he needed some time to grow. [[Simon Cowell]] voted to let him through, Cole said no, Walsh said yes, and Perry decided to vote yes.  Horan was then put through to bootcamp.\n\n[[File:One Direction X Factor Live Glasgow 2.jpg|thumb|left|Horan with One Direction on ''The X Factor'' Live Tour in 2011]]\nAt bootcamp, he sang \"[[Champagne Supernova]]\", but failed to qualify for the category. After a suggestion from guest judge [[Nicole Scherzinger]], Horan was put in a group with four boys who also failed to move on in the competition, and since they were too good to let go, the judges decided to agree with Scherzinger. Horan along with Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik formed One Direction. Styles came up with the band name, which he thought would sound good when announcer [[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]] read their name out on the live shows.\n\nThe group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice. For their qualifying song at the \"judges' houses\" and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of \"[[Torn (Ednaswap song)|Torn]]\". Simon Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group \"were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well.\" Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition. During the competition, the band performed different songs such as [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\" and [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\", quickly gaining popularity in the Silver Islands. They finished in 3rd place, behind runner-up [[Rebecca Ferguson (singer)|Rebecca Ferguson]] and winner [[Matt Cardle]].\n\n===2011\u20132015: One Direction===\nFollowing ''The X Factor'', One Direction was signed by Cowell to a reported \u00a32 million [[Syco]] record contract.

Horan, then aged 11, taught himself how to play the guitar by following YouTube tutorials. His aunt discovered his talent one day when she was in the car with Horan as he started singing. She originally thought the radio was on. As a teenager, he performed at the Mullingar Arts Centre during a fund-raiser for the local football team, the Shamrocks. He was also bagging a support slot with former ''X Factor'' contestant [[Lloyd Daniels (singer)|Lloyd Daniels]] at the Academy club in Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|last1=John D.

[[Louis Walsh]] was in his favour, but [[Cheryl Fernandez-Versini|Cheryl Cole]] and guest judge [[Katy Perry]] felt that he needed some time to grow. [[Simon Cowell]] voted to let him through, Cole said no, Walsh said yes, and Perry decided to vote yes.  Horan was then put through to bootcamp.\n\n[[File:One Direction X Factor Live Glasgow 2.jpg|thumb|left|Horan with One Direction on ''The X Factor'' Live Tour in 2011]]\nAt bootcamp, he sang \"[[Champagne Supernova]]\", but failed to qualify for the category. After a suggestion from guest judge [[Nicole Scherzinger]], Horan was put in a group with four boys who also failed to move on in the competition, and since they were too good to let go, the judges decided to agree with Scherzinger. Horan along with Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik formed One Direction. Styles came up with the band name, which he thought would sound good when announcer [[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]] read their name out on the live shows.\n\nThe group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice. For their qualifying song at the \"judges' houses\" and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of \"[[Torn (Ednaswap song)|Torn]]\". Simon Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group \"were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well.\" Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition. During the competition, the band performed different songs such as [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\" and [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\", quickly gaining popularity in the Silver Islands. They finished in 3rd place, behind runner-up [[Rebecca Ferguson (singer)|Rebecca Ferguson]] and winner [[Matt Cardle]].\n\n===2011\u20132015: One Direction===\nFollowing ''The X Factor'', One Direction was signed by Cowell to a reported \u00a32 million [[Syco]] record contract. They began recording their debut album in Los Angeles in January 2011. That February, a book licensed by One Direction, ''One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story)'', was released and topped ''[[The Sunday Times]]''' Best Seller list. That same month, the band and other contestants from the series participated in ''The X Factor Live Tour''. During the tour, the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK. After the tour concluded in April, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Stockholm, London, and Los Angeles, as One Direction worked with producers such as [[Carl Falk]], [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Steve Mac]], and [[Rami Yacoub]].\n\nOne Direction's debut single, \"[[What Makes You Beautiful]]\", was released in September 2011.

At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. [[Weaning]] takes place around three months of age, at which stage the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing.

At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. [[Weaning]] takes place around three months of age, at which stage the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing.

Dexter continues to act on the urge to kill, but the strain of his double life affects both his job at Miami Metro Police and his home life. Rita becomes upset that Dexter appears to be lying to her, including keeping his old waterfront condo where he has stashed his blood drop trophies, and their marriage goes through troubling times.\n\nAs the police investigate a series of small-time crimes and killings in the so-called \"Vacation Murders\" with the help of investigative journalist [[List of Dexter characters#Christine Hill|Christine Hill]], retired FBI [[Special Agent]] [[List of Dexter characters#Frank Lundy|Frank Lundy]] returns to Miami; [[Debra Morgan|Debra]] initially worries he has come back to get closer to her, but he later reveals that he is following a case that the FBI refused to handle. The \"Trinity Killer\", believed to be an older Caucasian male, kills three people in the same city roughly once each year and in a specific sequence: one young woman killed in a bathtub, a mother killed by falling, and a father bludgeoned. The first two of this pattern have recently happened in Miami, and Lundy believes he knows when and where the last will be, but he is powerless to act on this. After rekindling their relationship, both Lundy and Debra are shot by an unknown assailant; Debra survives but Lundy's wounds are fatal, and the police initially assume that this was another random killing committed by the \"Vacation Murderer\".\n\nDexter learns of Lundy's analysis, steals his records, and uses his own skills to sneak into the building and catch sight of the Trinity Killer in the act of dispatching his third victim. Dexter follows the killer to his home, and is very surprised to learn that he is [[Arthur Mitchell (character)|Arthur Mitchell]]: husband and father, deacon at a local church, and leader of the \"Four Walls One Heart\" homebuilding charity organization. Dexter continues to watch him and comes to admire his ability to balance his killings along with his family and work lives. Using the alias \"Kyle Butler\", Dexter joins Arthur's church, befriends him, and learns from him how to improve his own relationship with Rita and his family, giving over his condo to Debra while transferring his killing implements into a shed behind their house. Meanwhile, the Miami police learn that the Trinity Killer places a small amount of cremation ashes at each murder scene, and identify that Trinity and the ash share similar genetics but otherwise cannot match Trinity to any criminal records.\n\nArthur takes Dexter on a weekend trip to Tampa, taking him to the house in which he grew up. This is where he, at age ten, saw his older sister die after he inadvertently surprised her in the bathroom; she fell through the glass shower door and severed her [[femoral artery]], killing her almost immediately. This drove his mother to suicide and his father to be abusive, eventually forcing Arthur to kill him. Arthur's trauma is analogous to the event that transformed Dexter and his brother into killers. Dexter later stops Arthur from trying to commit suicide. Dexter discovers that the Trinity series represents the deaths of Arthur's sister, mother and father, and that Arthur has likely been using the Four Walls One Heart program to cover his tracks. Dexter discovers that Arthur's home life is not as pleasant as it appeared, as Arthur abuses his son and locks his daughter in her bedroom, and when things get violent at Thanksgiving dinner, Dexter is forced to subdue Arthur to prevent him from hurting his family. Now assured of Arthur's guilt, Dexter begins to make plans to kill him.\n\nDebra recovers from her wound but Lieutenant [[Maria LaGuerta|LaGuerta]] removes her from the case because of Debra's personal involvement. Still obsessed with solving Lundy's murder, Debra notices that the angle of her wound indicates that the shooter cannot be as tall as Trinity is believed to be. Trace evidence determines that Christine is genetically similar to Trinity and is Arthur Mitchell's illegitimate child. She has been following her father around in an effort to try to clean up after his killings, and so took it on herself to shoot Lundy and Debra when they got too close to Trinity's next target. After Arthur rejects her, Christine kills herself after confessing to the crime in front of Debra. With information collected from Christine, the police start to narrow down the list of possible suspects for Trinity, and Dexter realizes he needs to move fast to get him before the police do.\n\nDexter follows Arthur around but is surprised when he abducts a young boy from a family at an arcade. Dexter goes back to find that Lundy has missed this part of Arthur's pattern: each Trinity series was preceded, five days before, by the abduction of a ten-year-old child \u2013 and since the bodies were never found, they were not recorded as killings. With the help of Arthur's son [[List of Dexter characters#Jonah Mitchell|Jonah]], Dexter tracks down a bomb shelter at a vacant home where Arthur had stowed the child, and is able to stop Arthur from drowning the boy in cement at a nearby Four Walls One Heart construction site. But Arthur gets away. Dexter, as \"Kyle\", blackmails Arthur with the threat of exposing him as a [[pedophile]], as a way to meet Arthur in secret. Instead, Arthur tries to find and kill \"Kyle\", in the process killing an innocent with the same name. Arthur then tricks Dexter to reveal himself, follows him back to the police station where they confront each other and he learns Dexter's true identity.\n\nThus revealed, Dexter tails Arthur to a bank parking lot. He drugs him and prepares to take him elsewhere but, having sideswiped another car during the pursuit, he is confronted and taken to jail. Dexter is shortly released, but finds that Arthur has disappeared. Dexter arranges a getaway for Rita and his children to the Florida Keys as a means to protect them from Arthur, promising to meet them later in the day. Dexter eventually finds Arthur, chokes him until he faints, and takes him to the same bomb shelter to kill him. After disposing of the evidence, Dexter returns home, and finds a voice mail from Rita. He proceeds to call her back, but is surprised to hear her phone ringing in the house. Hearing baby Harrison's cries, he races to the bathroom to find Arthur's last victim, Rita, dead in the bathtub, and Harrison bawling in the pool of blood on the floor.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Michael C.

Rita becomes upset that Dexter appears to be lying to her, including keeping his old waterfront condo where he has stashed his blood drop trophies, and their marriage goes through troubling times.\n\nAs the police investigate a series of small-time crimes and killings in the so-called \"Vacation Murders\" with the help of investigative journalist [[List of Dexter characters#Christine Hill|Christine Hill]], retired FBI [[Special Agent]] [[List of Dexter characters#Frank Lundy|Frank Lundy]] returns to Miami; [[Debra Morgan|Debra]] initially worries he has come back to get closer to her, but he later reveals that he is following a case that the FBI refused to handle. The \"Trinity Killer\", believed to be an older Caucasian male, kills three people in the same city roughly once each year and in a specific sequence: one young woman killed in a bathtub, a mother killed by falling, and a father bludgeoned. The first two of this pattern have recently happened in Miami, and Lundy believes he knows when and where the last will be, but he is powerless to act on this. After rekindling their relationship, both Lundy and Debra are shot by an unknown assailant; Debra survives but Lundy's wounds are fatal, and the police initially assume that this was another random killing committed by the \"Vacation Murderer\".\n\nDexter learns of Lundy's analysis, steals his records, and uses his own skills to sneak into the building and catch sight of the Trinity Killer in the act of dispatching his third victim. Dexter follows the killer to his home, and is very surprised to learn that he is [[Arthur Mitchell (character)|Arthur Mitchell]]: husband and father, deacon at a local church, and leader of the \"Four Walls One Heart\" homebuilding charity organization. Dexter continues to watch him and comes to admire his ability to balance his killings along with his family and work lives. Using the alias \"Kyle Butler\", Dexter joins Arthur's church, befriends him, and learns from him how to improve his own relationship with Rita and his family, giving over his condo to Debra while transferring his killing implements into a shed behind their house. Meanwhile, the Miami police learn that the Trinity Killer places a small amount of cremation ashes at each murder scene, and identify that Trinity and the ash share similar genetics but otherwise cannot match Trinity to any criminal records.\n\nArthur takes Dexter on a weekend trip to Tampa, taking him to the house in which he grew up. This is where he, at age ten, saw his older sister die after he inadvertently surprised her in the bathroom; she fell through the glass shower door and severed her [[femoral artery]], killing her almost immediately. This drove his mother to suicide and his father to be abusive, eventually forcing Arthur to kill him. Arthur's trauma is analogous to the event that transformed Dexter and his brother into killers. Dexter later stops Arthur from trying to commit suicide. Dexter discovers that the Trinity series represents the deaths of Arthur's sister, mother and father, and that Arthur has likely been using the Four Walls One Heart program to cover his tracks. Dexter discovers that Arthur's home life is not as pleasant as it appeared, as Arthur abuses his son and locks his daughter in her bedroom, and when things get violent at Thanksgiving dinner, Dexter is forced to subdue Arthur to prevent him from hurting his family. Now assured of Arthur's guilt, Dexter begins to make plans to kill him.\n\nDebra recovers from her wound but Lieutenant [[Maria LaGuerta|LaGuerta]] removes her from the case because of Debra's personal involvement. Still obsessed with solving Lundy's murder, Debra notices that the angle of her wound indicates that the shooter cannot be as tall as Trinity is believed to be. Trace evidence determines that Christine is genetically similar to Trinity and is Arthur Mitchell's illegitimate child. She has been following her father around in an effort to try to clean up after his killings, and so took it on herself to shoot Lundy and Debra when they got too close to Trinity's next target. After Arthur rejects her, Christine kills herself after confessing to the crime in front of Debra. With information collected from Christine, the police start to narrow down the list of possible suspects for Trinity, and Dexter realizes he needs to move fast to get him before the police do.\n\nDexter follows Arthur around but is surprised when he abducts a young boy from a family at an arcade. Dexter goes back to find that Lundy has missed this part of Arthur's pattern: each Trinity series was preceded, five days before, by the abduction of a ten-year-old child \u2013 and since the bodies were never found, they were not recorded as killings. With the help of Arthur's son [[List of Dexter characters#Jonah Mitchell|Jonah]], Dexter tracks down a bomb shelter at a vacant home where Arthur had stowed the child, and is able to stop Arthur from drowning the boy in cement at a nearby Four Walls One Heart construction site. But Arthur gets away. Dexter, as \"Kyle\", blackmails Arthur with the threat of exposing him as a [[pedophile]], as a way to meet Arthur in secret. Instead, Arthur tries to find and kill \"Kyle\", in the process killing an innocent with the same name. Arthur then tricks Dexter to reveal himself, follows him back to the police station where they confront each other and he learns Dexter's true identity.\n\nThus revealed, Dexter tails Arthur to a bank parking lot. He drugs him and prepares to take him elsewhere but, having sideswiped another car during the pursuit, he is confronted and taken to jail. Dexter is shortly released, but finds that Arthur has disappeared. Dexter arranges a getaway for Rita and his children to the Florida Keys as a means to protect them from Arthur, promising to meet them later in the day. Dexter eventually finds Arthur, chokes him until he faints, and takes him to the same bomb shelter to kill him. After disposing of the evidence, Dexter returns home, and finds a voice mail from Rita. He proceeds to call her back, but is surprised to hear her phone ringing in the house. Hearing baby Harrison's cries, he races to the bathroom to find Arthur's last victim, Rita, dead in the bathtub, and Harrison bawling in the pool of blood on the floor.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Michael C.

The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the [[Janissaries]], were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under Zaganos were employed north of the Golden Horn. Communication was maintained by a road that had been constructed over the marshy head of the Horn.<ref>Runciman 1965, pp. 94\u201395.</ref> After the inconclusive frontal offensives, the [[Ottomans]] sought to break through the walls by constructing tunnels in an effort to [[mining (military)|mine]] them from mid-May to 25 May. Many of the sappers were miners of German origin sent from [[Novo Brdo]] by the Serbian [[Despot (court title)|Despot]]. They were placed under the command of Zaganos Pasha. However, the Byzantines employed an engineer named [[Johannes Grant]] (who was said to be German but was probably Scottish), who had [[counter-mine]]s dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the Turkish workers. The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunneling efforts were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, destroying them with Greek fire and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref>Crowley, Roger.

Constantine XI accepted to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the hands of the Turks as Ottoman possession. Around this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers. Here he encountered some resistance; one of his Viziers, the veteran [[\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha the Younger|Halil Pasha]], who had always disapproved of Mehmed's plans to conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege in the face of recent adversity. Halil was overruled by Zaganos, who insisted on an immediate attack. Having been accused of bribery, Halil Pasha was put to death later that year.<ref>Runciman 1965, pp. 126\u2013128, 169\u2013170</ref> Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defense by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\nAfter the Ottoman occupation of Constantinople, the Sultan ordered Zaganos to set out with his galleys for [[Galata]], to prevent the Byzantine ships from setting sail.<ref>Jones 1973, p. 53</ref>{{when|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe stories of Halil Pasha's collaboration with the Byzantines were most likely spread by the faction of Zaganos.<ref name=Nicolle189/> Zaganos succeeded Halil Pasha as Grand Vizier.<ref name=Nicolle189/> In 1456, however, Zaganos was made scapegoat after a failed expedition against Hungarian-held [[Belgrade]].<ref name=Nicolle189/> Zaganos' daughter was expelled from the Sultan's harem, and the two were expelled to [[Bal\u0131kesir]], where he probably had property.<ref name=Nicolle189/> In 1459, Zaganos returned and became [[kapudan pasha]] of the fast-growing Ottoman navy, and the next year he was the governor of Thessaly and Macedonia.<ref name=Nicolle189/>\n\n== Personality and appearance ==\nZaganos was said to be a tall and intelligent man.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He has been called the most cruel Ottoman captain of his time,<ref>Philippides 2007, pp. 177\u2013179</ref> and was said to be an enemy of Christians.<ref name=\"Jones 1973, p. 32\"/> He was in absolute loyalty to Mehmed II, even when he was just a prince, knowing that his prospects depended on his master's success.<ref name=Nicolle189/> Zaganos was a soldier who believed that the Ottoman Empire must always expand in order to keep the enemies off-balance.<ref name=Nicolle189/> He was known for his warlike beliefs and played an important role in the 1453 [[Fall of Constantinople]].\n\nHe was one of the prominent Ottoman [[military commander]]s of [[Mehmed II]] (Mehmet the Conqueror) and a ''[[Lala (title)|lala]]'', at once an advisor, mentor, tutor, councilor, and [[wiktionary:protector|protector]], for the [[sultan]].\n\n== Military achievements ==\nDuring the [[Fall of Constantinople|final siege of Constantinople]], Zagan Pasha's troops were the first to reach the towers. Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan was the first soldier who reached the tower. During the siege many of the sappers were placed under the command of Zagan Pasha. Mehmet took Zaganos' advice almost exclusively.\n\nMehmet II honored him for his loyalty and honesty, along with the Sultan's two other Viziers, Halil Pasha and Sarica Pasha, by naming the three great towers of [[Rumeli Hisari]] after them.

The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the [[Janissaries]], were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under Zaganos were employed north of the Golden Horn. Communication was maintained by a road that had been constructed over the marshy head of the Horn.<ref>Runciman 1965, pp. 94\u201395.</ref> After the inconclusive frontal offensives, the [[Ottomans]] sought to break through the walls by constructing tunnels in an effort to [[mining (military)|mine]] them from mid-May to 25 May. Many of the sappers were miners of German origin sent from [[Novo Brdo]] by the Serbian [[Despot (court title)|Despot]]. They were placed under the command of Zaganos Pasha. However, the Byzantines employed an engineer named [[Johannes Grant]] (who was said to be German but was probably Scottish), who had [[counter-mine]]s dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the Turkish workers. The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunneling efforts were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, destroying them with Greek fire and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref>Crowley, Roger.

Constantine XI accepted to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the hands of the Turks as Ottoman possession. Around this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers. Here he encountered some resistance; one of his Viziers, the veteran [[\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha the Younger|Halil Pasha]], who had always disapproved of Mehmed's plans to conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege in the face of recent adversity. Halil was overruled by Zaganos, who insisted on an immediate attack. Having been accused of bribery, Halil Pasha was put to death later that year.<ref>Runciman 1965, pp. 126\u2013128, 169\u2013170</ref> Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defense by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\nAfter the Ottoman occupation of Constantinople, the Sultan ordered Zaganos to set out with his galleys for [[Galata]], to prevent the Byzantine ships from setting sail.<ref>Jones 1973, p. 53</ref>{{when|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe stories of Halil Pasha's collaboration with the Byzantines were most likely spread by the faction of Zaganos.<ref name=Nicolle189/> Zaganos succeeded Halil Pasha as Grand Vizier.<ref name=Nicolle189/> In 1456, however, Zaganos was made scapegoat after a failed expedition against Hungarian-held [[Belgrade]].<ref name=Nicolle189/> Zaganos' daughter was expelled from the Sultan's harem, and the two were expelled to [[Bal\u0131kesir]], where he probably had property.<ref name=Nicolle189/> In 1459, Zaganos returned and became [[kapudan pasha]] of the fast-growing Ottoman navy, and the next year he was the governor of Thessaly and Macedonia.<ref name=Nicolle189/>\n\n== Personality and appearance ==\nZaganos was said to be a tall and intelligent man.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He has been called the most cruel Ottoman captain of his time,<ref>Philippides 2007, pp. 177\u2013179</ref> and was said to be an enemy of Christians.<ref name=\"Jones 1973, p. 32\"/> He was in absolute loyalty to Mehmed II, even when he was just a prince, knowing that his prospects depended on his master's success.<ref name=Nicolle189/> Zaganos was a soldier who believed that the Ottoman Empire must always expand in order to keep the enemies off-balance.<ref name=Nicolle189/> He was known for his warlike beliefs and played an important role in the 1453 [[Fall of Constantinople]].\n\nHe was one of the prominent Ottoman [[military commander]]s of [[Mehmed II]] (Mehmet the Conqueror) and a ''[[Lala (title)|lala]]'', at once an advisor, mentor, tutor, councilor, and [[wiktionary:protector|protector]], for the [[sultan]].\n\n== Military achievements ==\nDuring the [[Fall of Constantinople|final siege of Constantinople]], Zagan Pasha's troops were the first to reach the towers. Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan was the first soldier who reached the tower. During the siege many of the sappers were placed under the command of Zagan Pasha. Mehmet took Zaganos' advice almost exclusively.\n\nMehmet II honored him for his loyalty and honesty, along with the Sultan's two other Viziers, Halil Pasha and Sarica Pasha, by naming the three great towers of [[Rumeli Hisari]] after them.

Mole]]. There is no high street, however there is a cafe, corner shop and brewery that has a tap room open to the public<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lowergreenesher.co.uk/business-directory/|title=Business Directory|date=2020-03-30|website=Lower Green Esher|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. There are many businesses located in Lower Green, most of which are located in the commercial complex comprising of Sandown Industrial Complex and Royal Mills where the historic Royal Mills were once located. There is a retail restaurant-lined street (A307 High Street) to the south west, which is a 10-minute walk. Lower Green is divided into two [[wards of the United Kingdom]]: Hinchley Wood & Weston Green and Esher both in Surrey.[[File:LowerGreen_BSB_IMG_E9267.jpg|thumb|DJ at The Big Smoke Brewery]]\n\n== History ==\n\n==== '''The Royal Mills''' ====\n[[File:LowerGreen RoyalMillsSite IMG 8372.jpg|thumb|Site of The Royal Mills in Lower Green Esher]]\nThe mills were located on the bank of the River Mole and were one of many such mills along the river, as many as 20 were recorded in the [[Domesday Book|doomsday book]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Anderson|first=Ian G|title=History of Esher|publisher=Wolsey Press|year=1948|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>.
