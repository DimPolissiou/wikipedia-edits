Reviewers must rate the product on a [[rating scale]] from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicate the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicate that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. Customers may comment or vote on the reviews, indicating whether they found a review helpful to them. If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100503005110/en/2010-Social-Shopping-Study-Reveals-Consumers%E2%80%99-Online |title=2010 Social Shopping Study Reveals Changes in Consumers' Online Shopping Habits and Usage of Customer Reviews |work=the e-tailing group, PowerReviews |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=January 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available\u2014the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Amazon.com |author=Spector, Robert |year=2002 |page=132}}</ref>\n\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by [[public relations]] companies on behalf of their clients<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnatibeacon.com/index.php?/contents/comments/amazon.com_rave_book_reviews_too_good_to_be_true |title=BEACON SPOTLIGHT: Amazon.com rave book reviews \u2013 too good to be true? |work=The Cincinnati Beacon |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004404/http://www.cincinnatibeacon.com/index.php?%2Fcontents%2Fcomments%2Famazon.com_rave_book_reviews_too_good_to_be_true |archivedate=May 2, 2014 }}</ref> and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works.\n\n=== Content search ===\n\"Search Inside the Book\" is a feature which allows customers to search for keywords in the full text of many books in the catalog.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com |title=Amazon's online reader ''Search Inside'' reference |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828044958/http://www.amazon.com/ |archivedate=August 28, 2010 |url-status=live |df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com |title=''Search Inside'' reference |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> The feature started with 120,000 titles (or 33 million pages of text) on October 23, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Ward |url=http://www.urlwire.com/news/102203.html |title=Amazon.com Launches \"Search Inside the Book\" Feature |publisher=Urlwire.com |date=October 23, 2003 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> There are about 300,000 books in the program.

It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14101911 |title=Amazon FAQ |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.<ref name=\"amazon\" /> Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers |title=Amazon.com Movers and shakers |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public.

Amazon started by focusing on business-to-consumer relationships between itself and its customers and business-to-business relationships between itself and its suppliers and then moved to facilitate customer-to-customer with the Amazon marketplace which acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions. The company lets anyone sell nearly anything using its platform. In addition to an affiliate program that lets anyone post Amazon links and earn a commission on click-through sales, there is now a program which lets those affiliates build entire websites based on Amazon's platform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/amazon2.htm |title=How Amazon Works |accessdate=December 15, 2011|date=January 25, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nSome other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=743056 |title=Help |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmazon also employs the use of [[drop shipping|drop shippers]] or meta sellers. These are members or entities that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true. As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in [[University Village, Seattle|University Village]] in Seattle.

Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14101911 |title=Amazon FAQ |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.<ref name=\"amazon\" /> Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers |title=Amazon.com Movers and shakers |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release [[point of sale]] data via the [[Nielsen BookScan]] service to verified authors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/help?topicID=200580390 |title=Amazon.com Author Central |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,<ref>{{cite web |title=Amazon Sales Estimator |publisher=Jungle Scout |url=http://www.junglescout.com/estimator/ |date=May 15, 2017}}</ref> though Amazon states:\n\n{{quote|text=Please keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers\u2014we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources|sign=Amazon.com Help<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14101911 |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Amazon.com |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n== Multi-level sales strategy ==\nAmazon employs a multi-level e-commerce strategy. Amazon started by focusing on business-to-consumer relationships between itself and its customers and business-to-business relationships between itself and its suppliers and then moved to facilitate customer-to-customer with the Amazon marketplace which acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions. The company lets anyone sell nearly anything using its platform. In addition to an affiliate program that lets anyone post Amazon links and earn a commission on click-through sales, there is now a program which lets those affiliates build entire websites based on Amazon's platform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/amazon2.htm |title=How Amazon Works |accessdate=December 15, 2011|date=January 25, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nSome other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=743056 |title=Help |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmazon also employs the use of [[drop shipping|drop shippers]] or meta sellers. These are members or entities that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true. As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in [[University Village, Seattle|University Village]] in Seattle.

Throughout the south of the country, in particular the [[Algarve]], destruction was rampant. The tsunami destroyed some coastal fortresses in the Algarve and, in the lower levels, it razed several houses. Almost all the coastal towns and villages of the Algarve were heavily damaged, except [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], which was protected by the sandy banks of [[Ria Formosa]]. In [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], the waves reached the top of the city walls. Other towns of different Portuguese regions, such as [[Peniche, Portugal|Peniche]], [[Cascais]], and even [[Covilh\u00e3]], which is located near the [[Serra da Estrela]] mountain range in central inland Portugal, were affected. The shock waves of the earthquake destroyed part of Covilh\u00e3's castle walls and its large towers. On the island of [[Madeira]], [[Funchal]] and many smaller settlements suffered significant damage. Almost all of the ports in the [[Azores]] archipelago suffered most of their destruction from the tsunami, with the sea penetrating about 150 m inland. Portuguese towns in northern Africa were also affected by the earthquake, such as [[Ceuta]] and [[El Jadida|Mazagon]], where the tsunami hit hard the coastal fortifications of both towns, in some cases going over it, and flooding the harbor area. In Spain, the tsunamis swept the [[Andalusia]]n Atlantic Coast, nearly destroying the city of [[C\u00e1diz|Cadiz]], killing at least 1/3 of its population.\n\n[[File:Tsunami Forecast Model Animation- Lisbon 1755.webm|thumb|left|2016 animation from [[NOAA]]]]\n[[File:Lisbon 1755 tsunami travel times.jpg|thumb|left|Calculated travel times (in hours) for the tsunami waves of 1 November 1755]]\n\nShocks from the earthquake were felt throughout [[Europe]]<ref>{{citation|jstor=104951|title=An Extraordinary and Surprising Agitation of the Waters, though without Any Perceptible Motion of the Earth, Having Been Observed in Various Parts of This Island, Both Maritime and Inland, on the Same Day, and Chiefly about the Time, That the More Violent Commotions of Both Earth and Waters so Extensively Affected Many Very Distant Parts of the Globe; the Following Accounts, Relating to the Former, Have Been Transmitted to the Society; in Which are Specified the Times and Places when and Where They Happened|journal=  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |series=Series I|volume=49|pages=351\u2013398|last1=Robertson|first1=John|last2=Webb|first2=Philip Carteret|last3=Adee|first3=Swithin|last4=Hodgson|first4=John|author5=Cranbrook|last6=Pringle|first6=John|last7=Mills|first7=Henry|last8=Birch|first8=Thomas|last9=Thomlinson|first9=Mr|last10=Philips|first10=Richard|last11=Crusius|first11=Lewis|last12=Blair|first12=John|last13=Parker|first13=Viscount|last14=Huxham|first14=John|last15=Borlase|first15=William|author16=Swanzey|last17=Arderon|first17=William|last18=Barber|first18=Thomas|last19=Harrison|first19=John|last20=Cowper|first20=Spencer|last21=Gardener|first21=Robert|last22=Colquhoun|first22=James|last23=Nicola|first23=L.|last24=Brocklesby|first24=Richard|author25=HEN TOM|last26=Steplin|first26=Joseph|last27=Hondt|first27=De|last28=Allamond|first28=Mons|year=1755|doi=10.1098/rstl.1755.0059|bibcode=1755RSPT...49..351R}}</ref><ref>''[[Memoirs of Jacques Casanova]]'', Book 2, Ch.

At least 34 looters were hanged in the chaotic aftermath of the disaster.  As a warning against looting, King [[Joseph I of Portugal]] ordered [[gallows]] to be constructed in several parts of the city.]]\n\nThe royal family escaped unharmed from the catastrophe: King [[Joseph I of Portugal]] and the court had left the city, after attending mass at sunrise, fulfilling the wish of one of the king's daughters to spend the holiday away from Lisbon. After the catastrophe, Joseph I developed a fear of living within walls, and the court was accommodated in a huge complex of tents and pavilions in the hills of [[Ajuda]], then on the outskirts of Lisbon. The king's [[claustrophobia]] never waned, and it was only after Joseph's death that his daughter [[Maria I of Portugal]] began building the royal [[Ajuda Palace]], which still stands on the site of the old tented camp. Like the king, the prime minister [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo]] (1st Marquis of Pombal) survived the earthquake. When asked what was to be done, Pombal reportedly replied \"Bury the dead and heal the living\",<ref>{{cite book |author=T. D. Kendrick|title= The Lisbon Earthquake |page=75|author-link= T. D. Kendrick }} Kendrick writes that the remark is apocryphal and is attributed to other sources in anti-Pombal literature.</ref> and set about organizing relief and rehabilitation efforts. Firefighters were sent to extinguish the raging flames, and teams of workers and ordinary citizens were ordered to remove the thousands of corpses before disease could spread. Contrary to custom and against the wishes of the Church, many corpses were loaded onto [[barge]]s and [[burial at sea|buried at sea]] beyond the mouth of the Tagus. To prevent disorder in the ruined city, the [[Portuguese Army]] was deployed and [[gallows]] were constructed at high points around the city to deter looters; more than thirty people were publicly executed.<ref>Gunn (2008), p. 77.</ref> The army prevented many able-bodied citizens from fleeing, pressing them into relief and reconstruction work.\n\nThe [[Project for the Royal Palace in Campo de Ourique]] was proposed as the new royal residence in 1760, but the plans were later abandoned due to a lack of priority or interest in a palace being built in the [[Campo de Ourique]] neighborhood of Lisbon.\n\nThe king and the prime minister immediately launched efforts to rebuild the city. On 4 December 1755, little more than a month after the earthquake, Manuel da Maia, chief engineer to the realm, presented his plans for the re-building of Lisbon. Maia presented four options from abandoning Lisbon to building a completely new city. The first plan was to rebuild the old city using re-cycled materials; this was the cheapest option. The second and third plans proposed widening certain streets. The fourth option boldly proposed razing the entire Baixa quarter and \"laying out new streets without restraint\". This last option was chosen by the king and his minister.<ref>Shrady, ''The Last Day'' pp. 152\u2013155.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gaiola pombalina.jpg|thumb|Model of the [[seismology|seismically]] protective wooden structure called \"[[gaiola (construction)|gaiola]] pombalina\" (pombaline cage), developed for the reconstruction of [[Pombaline Lower Town]] ]]\n\nIn less than a year, the city was cleared of debris.

Small wooden models were built for testing, and earthquakes were simulated by marching troops around them. Lisbon's \"new\" Lower Town, known today as the [[Pombaline Lower Town]] (''Baixa Pombalina''), is one of the city's famed attractions. Sections of other Portuguese cities, such as the [[Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Municipality|Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio]] in [[Algarve]], were also rebuilt along Pombaline principles.\n\nThe [[Casa Pia]], a Portuguese institution founded by Maria I (known as ''A Pia'', \"Maria the Pious\"), and organized by Police Intendant Pina Manique in 1780, was founded following the social disarray of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\n\n==Effect on society, economy and philosophy==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\nThe earthquake had wide-ranging effects on the lives of the populace and intelligentsia.

Voltaire's ''Candide'' attacks the notion that all is for the best in this, \"[[the best of all possible worlds]]\", a world closely supervised by a benevolent deity.  The Lisbon disaster provided a counterexample. As [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote, \"[t]he earthquake of Lisbon sufficed to cure Voltaire of the [[theodicy]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]\" (''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' 361).  [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was also influenced by the devastation following the earthquake, whose severity he believed was due to too many people living within the close quarters of the city. Rousseau used the earthquake as an argument against cities as part of his desire for a more naturalistic way of life.<ref name=\"Csmonitor.com\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-Issues/2010/1028/Japan-tsunami-is-small-compared-to-five-of-world-s-biggest-tsunamis/1755-Lisbon-tsunami | title=Japan tsunami is small compared to five of world's biggest tsunamis | journal=Christian Science Monitor| date=28 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[Immanuel Kant]] published three separate texts on the Lisbon earthquake.<ref>See:\n* Kant, I.

Kant's theory, which involved shifts in huge caverns filled with hot gases, was incorrect, but was one of the first systematic attempts to explain earthquakes in natural rather than supernatural terms. According to [[Walter Benjamin]], Kant's slim early book on the earthquake \"probably represents the beginnings of scientific geography in Germany. And certainly the beginnings of seismology\".\n\n[[Werner Hamacher]] has claimed that the earthquake's consequences extended into the vocabulary of philosophy, making the common metaphor of firm \"grounding\" for philosophers' arguments shaky and uncertain: \"Under the impression exerted by the Lisbon earthquake, which touched the European mind in one [of] its more sensitive epochs, the metaphor of ground and tremor completely lost their apparent innocence; they were no longer merely figures of speech\" (263).  Hamacher claims that the foundational certainty of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]' philosophy began to shake following the Lisbon earthquake.\n\n=== Politics ===\n[[File:Retrato do Marqu\u00eas de Pombal - escola portuguesa, s\u00e9c. XVIII.png|thumb|[[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal]]]]\nThe earthquake had a major impact on politics. The prime minister, [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal]], was the favorite of the king, but the [[Portuguese nobility|aristocracy]] despised him as an upstart son of a country squire. The prime minister, in turn, disliked the old nobles, whom he considered corrupt and incapable of practical action. Before 1 November 1755 there was a constant struggle for power and royal favor, but the competent response of the Marquis of Pombal effectively severed the power of the old aristocratic factions. However, silent opposition and resentment of King Joseph I began to rise, which would culminate with the attempted assassination of the king in 1758 and the subsequent elimination of the powerful [[Duke of Aveiro]] and the [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]].{{clarify|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Development of seismology==\n{{Main|Parochial Memories of 1758}}\nThe prime minister's response was not limited to the practicalities of reconstruction. He ordered a query sent to all [[parish]]es of the country regarding the earthquake and its effects. Questions included:\n* At what time did the earthquake begin, and how long did the earthquake last?\n* Did you perceive the shock to be greater from one direction than another? Example, from north to south? Did buildings seem to fall more to one side than the other?\n* How many people died and were any of them distinguished?\n* Did the sea rise or fall first, and how many [[Hand (unit)|hands]] did it rise above the normal?\n* If fire broke out, how long did it last and what damage did it cause?<ref>Shrady, ''The Last Day'', pp.145\u2013146</ref>\n\nThe answers to these and other questions are still archived in the [[Torre do Tombo]], the national historical archive. Studying and cross-referencing the priests' accounts, modern scientists were able to reconstruct the event from a scientific perspective. Without the questionnaire designed by the [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], this would have been impossible. Because the marquis was the first to attempt an objective scientific description of the broad causes and consequences of an earthquake, he is regarded as a forerunner of modern seismological scientists.{{by whom|date=October 2019}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nA fictionalized version of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake features as a main plot element of the 2014 [[video game]] ''[[Assassin's Creed Rogue]]'', developed and published by [[Ubisoft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft - here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=5 August 2014|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref> Notably, a similar earthquake occurs earlier in the story in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]], and possibly coincides with a real-world earthquake recorded there in [[List of earthquakes in Haiti|1751]].<ref>{{citation|title=Significant Earthquake Database|url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1|author=NGDC|publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|doi=10.7289/V5TD9V7K|year=1972|type=Data Set}}</ref>\n\nThe album [[1755 (album)|1755]] by the Portuguese [[Gothic metal|Gothic Metal]] band [[Moonspell]] is a concept album detailing the story of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

Throughout the south of the country, in particular the [[Algarve]], destruction was rampant. The tsunami destroyed some coastal fortresses in the Algarve and, in the lower levels, it razed several houses. Almost all the coastal towns and villages of the Algarve were heavily damaged, except [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], which was protected by the sandy banks of [[Ria Formosa]]. In [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], the waves reached the top of the city walls. Other towns of different Portuguese regions, such as [[Peniche, Portugal|Peniche]], [[Cascais]], and even [[Covilh\u00e3]], which is located near the [[Serra da Estrela]] mountain range in central inland Portugal, were affected. The shock waves of the earthquake destroyed part of Covilh\u00e3's castle walls and its large towers. On the island of [[Madeira]], [[Funchal]] and many smaller settlements suffered significant damage. Almost all of the ports in the [[Azores]] archipelago suffered most of their destruction from the tsunami, with the sea penetrating about 150 m inland. Portuguese towns in northern Africa were also affected by the earthquake, such as [[Ceuta]] and [[El Jadida|Mazagon]], where the tsunami hit hard the coastal fortifications of both towns, in some cases going over it, and flooding the harbor area. In Spain, the tsunamis swept the [[Andalusia]]n Atlantic Coast, nearly destroying the city of [[C\u00e1diz|Cadiz]], killing at least 1/3 of its population.\n\n[[File:Tsunami Forecast Model Animation- Lisbon 1755.webm|thumb|left|2016 animation from [[NOAA]]]]\n[[File:Lisbon 1755 tsunami travel times.jpg|thumb|left|Calculated travel times (in hours) for the tsunami waves of 1 November 1755]]\n\nShocks from the earthquake were felt throughout [[Europe]]<ref>{{citation|jstor=104951|title=An Extraordinary and Surprising Agitation of the Waters, though without Any Perceptible Motion of the Earth, Having Been Observed in Various Parts of This Island, Both Maritime and Inland, on the Same Day, and Chiefly about the Time, That the More Violent Commotions of Both Earth and Waters so Extensively Affected Many Very Distant Parts of the Globe; the Following Accounts, Relating to the Former, Have Been Transmitted to the Society; in Which are Specified the Times and Places when and Where They Happened|journal=  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |series=Series I|volume=49|pages=351\u2013398|last1=Robertson|first1=John|last2=Webb|first2=Philip Carteret|last3=Adee|first3=Swithin|last4=Hodgson|first4=John|author5=Cranbrook|last6=Pringle|first6=John|last7=Mills|first7=Henry|last8=Birch|first8=Thomas|last9=Thomlinson|first9=Mr|last10=Philips|first10=Richard|last11=Crusius|first11=Lewis|last12=Blair|first12=John|last13=Parker|first13=Viscount|last14=Huxham|first14=John|last15=Borlase|first15=William|author16=Swanzey|last17=Arderon|first17=William|last18=Barber|first18=Thomas|last19=Harrison|first19=John|last20=Cowper|first20=Spencer|last21=Gardener|first21=Robert|last22=Colquhoun|first22=James|last23=Nicola|first23=L.|last24=Brocklesby|first24=Richard|author25=HEN TOM|last26=Steplin|first26=Joseph|last27=Hondt|first27=De|last28=Allamond|first28=Mons|year=1755|doi=10.1098/rstl.1755.0059|bibcode=1755RSPT...49..351R}}</ref><ref>''[[Memoirs of Jacques Casanova]]'', Book 2, Ch.

At least 34 looters were hanged in the chaotic aftermath of the disaster.  As a warning against looting, King [[Joseph I of Portugal]] ordered [[gallows]] to be constructed in several parts of the city.]]\n\nThe royal family escaped unharmed from the catastrophe: King [[Joseph I of Portugal]] and the court had left the city, after attending mass at sunrise, fulfilling the wish of one of the king's daughters to spend the holiday away from Lisbon. After the catastrophe, Joseph I developed a fear of living within walls, and the court was accommodated in a huge complex of tents and pavilions in the hills of [[Ajuda]], then on the outskirts of Lisbon. The king's [[claustrophobia]] never waned, and it was only after Joseph's death that his daughter [[Maria I of Portugal]] began building the royal [[Ajuda Palace]], which still stands on the site of the old tented camp. Like the king, the prime minister [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo]] (1st Marquis of Pombal) survived the earthquake. When asked what was to be done, Pombal reportedly replied \"Bury the dead and heal the living\",<ref>{{cite book |author=T. D. Kendrick|title= The Lisbon Earthquake |page=75|author-link= T. D. Kendrick }} Kendrick writes that the remark is apocryphal and is attributed to other sources in anti-Pombal literature.</ref> and set about organizing relief and rehabilitation efforts. Firefighters were sent to extinguish the raging flames, and teams of workers and ordinary citizens were ordered to remove the thousands of corpses before disease could spread. Contrary to custom and against the wishes of the Church, many corpses were loaded onto [[barge]]s and [[burial at sea|buried at sea]] beyond the mouth of the Tagus. To prevent disorder in the ruined city, the [[Portuguese Army]] was deployed and [[gallows]] were constructed at high points around the city to deter looters; more than thirty people were publicly executed.<ref>Gunn (2008), p. 77.</ref> The army prevented many able-bodied citizens from fleeing, pressing them into relief and reconstruction work.\n\nThe [[Project for the Royal Palace in Campo de Ourique]] was proposed as the new royal residence in 1760, but the plans were later abandoned due to a lack of priority or interest in a palace being built in the [[Campo de Ourique]] neighborhood of Lisbon.\n\nThe king and the prime minister immediately launched efforts to rebuild the city. On 4 December 1755, little more than a month after the earthquake, Manuel da Maia, chief engineer to the realm, presented his plans for the re-building of Lisbon. Maia presented four options from abandoning Lisbon to building a completely new city. The first plan was to rebuild the old city using re-cycled materials; this was the cheapest option. The second and third plans proposed widening certain streets. The fourth option boldly proposed razing the entire Baixa quarter and \"laying out new streets without restraint\". This last option was chosen by the king and his minister.<ref>Shrady, ''The Last Day'' pp. 152\u2013155.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gaiola pombalina.jpg|thumb|Model of the [[seismology|seismically]] protective wooden structure called \"[[gaiola (construction)|gaiola]] pombalina\" (pombaline cage), developed for the reconstruction of [[Pombaline Lower Town]] ]]\n\nIn less than a year, the city was cleared of debris.

Sections of other Portuguese cities, such as the [[Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Municipality|Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio]] in [[Algarve]], were also rebuilt along Pombaline principles.\n\nThe [[Casa Pia]], a Portuguese institution founded by Maria I (known as ''A Pia'', \"Maria the Pious\"), and organized by Police Intendant Pina Manique in 1780, was founded following the social disarray of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\n\n==Effect on society, economy and philosophy==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\nThe earthquake had wide-ranging effects on the lives of the populace and intelligentsia.

The noted writer-philosopher [[Voltaire]] used the earthquake in ''[[Candide]]'' and in his ''[[Po\u00e8me sur le d\u00e9sastre de Lisbonne]]'' (\"Poem on the Lisbon disaster\"). Voltaire's ''Candide'' attacks the notion that all is for the best in this, \"[[the best of all possible worlds]]\", a world closely supervised by a benevolent deity.  The Lisbon disaster provided a counterexample. As [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote, \"[t]he earthquake of Lisbon sufficed to cure Voltaire of the [[theodicy]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]\" (''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' 361).  [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was also influenced by the devastation following the earthquake, whose severity he believed was due to too many people living within the close quarters of the city. Rousseau used the earthquake as an argument against cities as part of his desire for a more naturalistic way of life.<ref name=\"Csmonitor.com\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-Issues/2010/1028/Japan-tsunami-is-small-compared-to-five-of-world-s-biggest-tsunamis/1755-Lisbon-tsunami | title=Japan tsunami is small compared to five of world's biggest tsunamis | journal=Christian Science Monitor| date=28 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[Immanuel Kant]] published three separate texts on the Lisbon earthquake.<ref>See:\n* Kant, I.

Kant's theory, which involved shifts in huge caverns filled with hot gases, was incorrect, but was one of the first systematic attempts to explain earthquakes in natural rather than supernatural terms. According to [[Walter Benjamin]], Kant's slim early book on the earthquake \"probably represents the beginnings of scientific geography in Germany. And certainly the beginnings of seismology\".\n\n[[Werner Hamacher]] has claimed that the earthquake's consequences extended into the vocabulary of philosophy, making the common metaphor of firm \"grounding\" for philosophers' arguments shaky and uncertain: \"Under the impression exerted by the Lisbon earthquake, which touched the European mind in one [of] its more sensitive epochs, the metaphor of ground and tremor completely lost their apparent innocence; they were no longer merely figures of speech\" (263).  Hamacher claims that the foundational certainty of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]' philosophy began to shake following the Lisbon earthquake.\n\n=== Politics ===\n[[File:Retrato do Marqu\u00eas de Pombal - escola portuguesa, s\u00e9c. XVIII.png|thumb|[[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal]]]]\nThe earthquake had a major impact on politics. The prime minister, [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal]], was the favorite of the king, but the [[Portuguese nobility|aristocracy]] despised him as an upstart son of a country squire. The prime minister, in turn, disliked the old nobles, whom he considered corrupt and incapable of practical action. Before 1 November 1755 there was a constant struggle for power and royal favor, but the competent response of the Marquis of Pombal effectively severed the power of the old aristocratic factions. However, silent opposition and resentment of King Joseph I began to rise, which would culminate with the attempted assassination of the king in 1758 and the subsequent elimination of the powerful [[Duke of Aveiro]] and the [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]].{{clarify|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Development of seismology==\n{{Main|Parochial Memories of 1758}}\nThe prime minister's response was not limited to the practicalities of reconstruction. He ordered a query sent to all [[parish]]es of the country regarding the earthquake and its effects. Questions included:\n* At what time did the earthquake begin, and how long did the earthquake last?\n* Did you perceive the shock to be greater from one direction than another? Example, from north to south? Did buildings seem to fall more to one side than the other?\n* How many people died and were any of them distinguished?\n* Did the sea rise or fall first, and how many [[Hand (unit)|hands]] did it rise above the normal?\n* If fire broke out, how long did it last and what damage did it cause?<ref>Shrady, ''The Last Day'', pp.145\u2013146</ref>\n\nThe answers to these and other questions are still archived in the [[Torre do Tombo]], the national historical archive. Studying and cross-referencing the priests' accounts, modern scientists were able to reconstruct the event from a scientific perspective. Without the questionnaire designed by the [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], this would have been impossible. Because the marquis was the first to attempt an objective scientific description of the broad causes and consequences of an earthquake, he is regarded as a forerunner of modern seismological scientists.{{by whom|date=October 2019}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nA fictionalized version of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake features as a main plot element of the 2014 [[video game]] ''[[Assassin's Creed Rogue]]'', developed and published by [[Ubisoft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft - here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=5 August 2014|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref> Notably, a similar earthquake occurs earlier in the story in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]], and possibly coincides with a real-world earthquake recorded there in [[List of earthquakes in Haiti|1751]].<ref>{{citation|title=Significant Earthquake Database|url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1|author=NGDC|publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|doi=10.7289/V5TD9V7K|year=1972|type=Data Set}}</ref>\n\nThe album [[1755 (album)|1755]] by the Portuguese [[Gothic metal|Gothic Metal]] band [[Moonspell]] is a concept album detailing the story of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

Radha Krishna for Haarika & Haasine Creations. It features an ensemble cast of [[Allu Arjun]], [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]], [[Samantha Akkineni|Samantha Ruth Prabhu]], [[Nithya Menen]], [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]], [[Adah Sharma]], [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]], [[Sampath Raj]], [[Vennela Kishore]], [[Brahmanandam]] and [[Ali (actor)|Ali]]. [[Prakash Raj]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as Satyamurthy.\n\nThe film revolves around three characters; the first follows his heart, the second uses his brain and the third uses his brawn. The first is Viraj Anand, the son of a billionaire named Satyamurthy, who gives his money to creditors after his father's death. A creditor still owed money is Paida Sambasiva Rao (the second of the three), whose daughter Sameera falls in love with Anand. Sambasiva Rao informs Anand that he has to produce documentation of land sold by Satyamurthy to a landlord, Devaraj Naidu (the third of the three) to marry Sameera. The rest of the film focuses on the consequences faced by Anand and Sambasiva Rao's change in viewpoint toward Satyamurthy.\n\nIn addition to directing the film, Srinivas wrote its screenplay. Initially planned as a multilingual film shot in Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu, the producers filmed in Telugu and dubbed it into Malayalam with the same title. [[Devi Sri Prasad]] composed the score and [[Prasad Murella]] was its cinematographer. Production began on 10 April 2014 at [[Ramanaidu Studios]] in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. [[Principal photography]] began on 22 September 2014 in Hyderabad, lasting until mid-March 2015. Except for three songs filmed in [[Europe]], the rest of the film was shot in and around Hyderabad.\n\nThe Telugu version was released worldwide on 1375 screens on 9 April 2015 to a lukewarm response, and the Malayalam version was released on 24 April 2015. On a {{INR}}400{{ndash}}500-million budget, ''S/O Satyamurthy'' earned a distributor share of {{INR}}519 million and grossed {{INR}}1 billion. The film was an above average grosser based on the return on the distributors' investment of {{INR}}540 million. It is in seventh place on the all-time list of highest-grossing Telugu films at the global box office. With this film, Allu Arjun became the first Telugu actor with two consecutive films earning more than {{INR}}500&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nNarrator Viraj Anand is the younger son of Satyamurthy, a billionaire businessman who dies in an accident. Although Anand has {{INR}}3&nbsp;billion worth of property and stock which is worthless, he owes an equal amount. Paida Sambasiva Rao, one of Satyamurthy's creditors, suggests that Anand file for bankruptcy to protect his wealth but Anand wants to preserve his father's image. Anand's older brother becomes mentally unstable and, at Sambasiva Rao's advice, the father of Anand's fianc\u00e9e Pallavi cancels their upcoming wedding. Anand and his family move to a simpler home in Hyderabad, and he becomes the family's sole breadwinner. He joins his friend's event-management company as a wedding planner, and his assistant Param goes with him.\n\nAnand is assigned to plan a destination wedding at [[Ooty]], which turns out to be Pallavi's. There he meets Sameera (also known as Subbalakshmi), a diabetic, with whom he eventually falls in love. While planning Pallavi's marriage Anand faces many difficulties, including an attempt by Pallavi's uncle and his son to stop the marriage because of her father's mistreatment. Pallavi's father and uncle reconcile, and Anand is paid more than the agreed amount in gratitude. Sameera turns out to be Sambasiva Rao's daughter; the latter objects to their marriage, saying that Satyamurthy cheated him when he sold a {{convert|8000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} property illegally acquired by landlord Devaraj Naidu. The current market value of the land is half&nbsp;billion rupees. Sambasiva Rao tells Anand that he will agree to the marriage if Anand can deliver the land documents from Devaraj in four weeks.\n\nAnand and Param set out for house number 6 in Reddiarpatti to exchange the original documents for fake ones. Instead, they end up in house number 9 and reveal their intentions to Devaraj, who traps them without harm; Devaraj cannot hurt anyone in front of his wife, Lakshmi, from whom he has hidden his true self for twenty years. Sambasiva Rao's family is kidnapped and brought to Devaraj's house; the next day Anand saves Devaraj from the brother (Kumarasamy Naidu, Devaraj's henchman since five years) of his rival, Veerasamy Naidu. Impressed, Devaraj agrees to return the land documents if Anand becomes engaged to his sister Valli. However, Valli wants to marry Lakshmi's brother and threatens to kill Anand if he does not break their engagement.\n\nValli teases Sameera, acting as if she is in love with Anand (which makes Devaraj happy). Devaraj's brother-in-law Koda Rambabu goes to Reddiarpatti, mistakenly believing that Parandhamaiah is Sameera's lover and Valli's potential lover. He wants to stop the marriage, and at Anand's suggestion Rambabu and Sambasiva Rao ask Veerasamy to have his henchmen kill the bridegroom; this would stop the marriage on the last day of the four-week deadline imposed by Sambasiva Rao. Although Anand plans to help Valli elope with her cousin, Veerasamy's henchmen mistake him for Anand and try to kill him. Devaraj and Anand save her cousin; when Devaraj tries to kill Rambabu, Anand says that he was the mastermind behind the plan and wants the real land documents.\n\nNine minutes are left before Sambasiva Rao's deadline; as Anand and Devaraj duel, Anand's mother enters. Devaraj and his family are shocked, remembering that Satyamurthy was fatally injured when he saved Valli from an accident planned by Veerasamy. Before he died, Satyamurthy told Valli that he made a mistake selling illegally acquired land to his friend and wants to rectify it with the landlord. Devaraj and Sambasiva Rao are full of remorse, and Devaraj returns the land documents to Anand in accordance with Satyamurthy's last wish. Anand gives the papers to Sambasiva Rao, who apologises for his behaviour and Sameera reunites with him. Veerasamy dies in an accident, and Koda Rambabu is spared.\n\nAnand and Sambasiva Rao are on their way home with their families when Pallavi's father meets them with news that the market value of Anand's stock is now worth five&nbsp; billion rupees. An emotional Anand thanks his father at the spot where Satyamurthy saved Valli's life.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Allu Arjun]] as Viraj Anand\n*[[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]] as Devaraj Naidu\n*[[Prakash Raj]] as Satyamurthy ([[Guest appearance]])\n*[[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] as Paida Sambasiva Rao\n*[[Samantha Akkineni|Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] as Sameera / Subbalakshmi\n*[[Nithya Menen]] as Valli\n*[[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]] as Lakshmi\n*[[Adah Sharma]] as Pallavi Kolasani\n*[[Ali (actor)|Ali]] as Parandhamayya\n*[[Sindhu Tolani]] as Viraj Anand's sister-in-law\n*[[Pavitra Lokesh]] as Viraj Anand's mother\n*[[Brahmanandam]] as Koda Rambabu\n*[[M.

Radha Krishna for Haarika & Haasine Creations. It features an ensemble cast of [[Allu Arjun]], [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]], [[Samantha Akkineni|Samantha Ruth Prabhu]], [[Nithya Menen]], [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]], [[Adah Sharma]], [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]], [[Sampath Raj]], [[Vennela Kishore]], [[Brahmanandam]] and [[Ali (actor)|Ali]]. [[Prakash Raj]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as Satyamurthy.\n\nThe film revolves around three characters; the first follows his heart, the second uses his brain and the third uses his brawn. The first is Viraj Anand, the son of a billionaire named Satyamurthy, who gives his money to creditors after his father's death. A creditor still owed money is Paida Sambasiva Rao (the second of the three), whose daughter Sameera falls in love with Anand. Sambasiva Rao informs Anand that he has to produce documentation of land sold by Satyamurthy to a landlord, Devaraj Naidu (the third of the three) to marry Sameera. The rest of the film focuses on the consequences faced by Anand and Sambasiva Rao's change in viewpoint toward Satyamurthy.\n\nIn addition to directing the film, Srinivas wrote its screenplay. Initially planned as a multilingual film shot in Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu, the producers filmed in Telugu and dubbed it into Malayalam with the same title. [[Devi Sri Prasad]] composed the score and [[Prasad Murella]] was its cinematographer. Production began on 10 April 2014 at [[Ramanaidu Studios]] in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. [[Principal photography]] began on 22 September 2014 in Hyderabad, lasting until mid-March 2015. Except for three songs filmed in [[Europe]], the rest of the film was shot in and around Hyderabad.\n\nThe Telugu version was released worldwide on 1375 screens on 9 April 2015 to a lukewarm response, and the Malayalam version was released on 24 April 2015. On a {{INR}}400{{ndash}}500-million budget, ''S/O Satyamurthy'' earned a distributor share of {{INR}}519 million and grossed {{INR}}1 billion. The film was an above average grosser based on the return on the distributors' investment of {{INR}}540 million. It is in seventh place on the all-time list of highest-grossing Telugu films at the global box office. With this film, Allu Arjun became the first Telugu actor with two consecutive films earning more than {{INR}}500&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nNarrator Viraj Anand is the younger son of Satyamurthy, a billionaire businessman who dies in an accident. Although Anand has {{INR}}3&nbsp;billion worth of property and stock which is worthless, he owes an equal amount. Paida Sambasiva Rao, one of Satyamurthy's creditors, suggests that Anand file for bankruptcy to protect his wealth but Anand wants to preserve his father's image. Anand's older brother becomes mentally unstable and, at Sambasiva Rao's advice, the father of Anand's fianc\u00e9e Pallavi cancels their upcoming wedding. Anand and his family move to a simpler home in Hyderabad, and he becomes the family's sole breadwinner. He joins his friend's event-management company as a wedding planner, and his assistant Param goes with him.\n\nAnand is assigned to plan a destination wedding at [[Ooty]], which turns out to be Pallavi's. There he meets Sameera (also known as Subbalakshmi), a diabetic, with whom he eventually falls in love. While planning Pallavi's marriage Anand faces many difficulties, including an attempt by Pallavi's uncle and his son to stop the marriage because of her father's mistreatment. Pallavi's father and uncle reconcile, and Anand is paid more than the agreed amount in gratitude. Sameera turns out to be Sambasiva Rao's daughter; the latter objects to their marriage, saying that Satyamurthy cheated him when he sold a {{convert|8000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} property illegally acquired by landlord Devaraj Naidu. The current market value of the land is half&nbsp;billion rupees. Sambasiva Rao tells Anand that he will agree to the marriage if Anand can deliver the land documents from Devaraj in four weeks.\n\nAnand and Param set out for house number 6 in Reddiarpatti to exchange the original documents for fake ones. Instead, they end up in house number 9 and reveal their intentions to Devaraj, who traps them without harm; Devaraj cannot hurt anyone in front of his wife, Lakshmi, from whom he has hidden his true self for twenty years. Sambasiva Rao's family is kidnapped and brought to Devaraj's house; the next day Anand saves Devaraj from the brother (Kumarasamy Naidu, Devaraj's henchman since five years) of his rival, Veerasamy Naidu. Impressed, Devaraj agrees to return the land documents if Anand becomes engaged to his sister Valli. However, Valli wants to marry Lakshmi's brother and threatens to kill Anand if he does not break their engagement.\n\nValli teases Sameera, acting as if she is in love with Anand (which makes Devaraj happy). Devaraj's brother-in-law Koda Rambabu goes to Reddiarpatti, mistakenly believing that Parandhamaiah is Sameera's lover and Valli's potential lover. He wants to stop the marriage, and at Anand's suggestion Rambabu and Sambasiva Rao ask Veerasamy to have his henchmen kill the bridegroom; this would stop the marriage on the last day of the four-week deadline imposed by Sambasiva Rao. Although Anand plans to help Valli elope with her cousin, Veerasamy's henchmen mistake him for Anand and try to kill him. Devaraj and Anand save her cousin; when Devaraj tries to kill Rambabu, Anand says that he was the mastermind behind the plan and wants the real land documents.\n\nNine minutes are left before Sambasiva Rao's deadline; as Anand and Devaraj duel, Anand's mother enters. Devaraj and his family are shocked, remembering that Satyamurthy was fatally injured when he saved Valli from an accident planned by Veerasamy. Before he died, Satyamurthy told Valli that he made a mistake selling illegally acquired land to his friend and wants to rectify it with the landlord. Devaraj and Sambasiva Rao are full of remorse, and Devaraj returns the land documents to Anand in accordance with Satyamurthy's last wish. Anand gives the papers to Sambasiva Rao, who apologises for his behaviour and Sameera reunites with him. Veerasamy dies in an accident, and Koda Rambabu is spared.\n\nAnand and Sambasiva Rao are on their way home with their families when Pallavi's father meets them with news that the market value of Anand's stock is now worth five&nbsp; billion rupees. An emotional Anand thanks his father at the spot where Satyamurthy saved Valli's life.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Allu Arjun]] as Viraj Anand\n*[[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]] as Devaraj Naidu\n*[[Prakash Raj]] as Satyamurthy ([[Guest appearance]])\n*[[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] as Paida Sambasiva Rao\n*[[Samantha Akkineni|Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] as Sameera / Subbalakshmi\n*[[Nithya Menen]] as Valli\n*[[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]] as Lakshmi\n*[[Adah Sharma]] as Pallavi Kolasani\n*[[Ali (actor)|Ali]] as Parandhamayya\n*[[Sindhu Tolani]] as Viraj Anand's sister-in-law\n*[[Pavitra Lokesh]] as Viraj Anand's mother\n*[[Brahmanandam]] as Koda Rambabu\n*[[M.

Unlike products using Microsoft's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]],  Splashtop Remote uses its own closed, proprietary protocol.\n\n==Products==\nSplashtop products focus on remote computer access and collaboration for business professionals, IT, MSPs, support, help desk, education, and consumers. The products include:\n\n* '''Splashtop Business Access''' \u2013 a low cost, subscription-based [[remote desktop software|remote desktop software]] for business professionals<ref>https://www.pcmag.com/review/355522/splashtop-business-access</ref>\n* '''Splashtop Remote Support''' \u2013 subscription-based [[Remote support|remote support]] software focused on IT professionals and MSPs remotely managing computers and servers<ref>https://www.splashtop.com/press_release/splashtop-launches-splashtop-business-for-remote-support-the-simple-reliable-and-cost-effective-replacement-for-logmein-and-teamviewer</ref><ref>https://www.g2crowd.com/products/splashtop-remote-support/reviews</ref>\n* '''Splashtop SOS''' \u2013 subscription-based, on-demand remote support software used by technical support teams and help desks to remotely access and support computers and mobile devices<ref>https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/05/splashtop-debuts-sos-with-mobile-android-support-service.html</ref>\n* '''Splashtop Classroom''' \u2013 education classroom collaboration software allowing teachers to share content and application across computers, iPads and Chromebooks<ref>https://www.splashtop.com/press_release/splashtop-expands-education-suite-splashtop-classroom-allowing-teachers-share-content-applications-across-computers-ipads-chromebooks</ref>\n* '''Splashtop Personal''' \u2013 consumer-focused remote computer access software for personal use<ref>https://www.ostechnix.com/splashtop-a-better-alternative-to-logmein-and-teamviewer/</ref>\n* '''Mirroring360''' \u2013 screen mirroring and screen sharing for education and business<ref>https://www.cnet.com/news/mirror-your-iphone-or-ipad-to-your-pc/</ref>\n\n==Functionality==\nSplashtop remote desktop applications map the screen of the mobile device to the screen of the remote computer, so that users can interact with the remote computer using intuitive touch-to-click controls and zoom in using the pinch gesture. Gestures are used to replace mouse and keyboard controls. For example, a two-finger drag gesture is used to scroll within windows, generally mapping to the mouse wheel controller. iPhone or iPad native software keyboard, modified to include special keys, such as Ctrl, Alt, or Delete, is used for text input.\n\nThe products can establish connections between devices connected to a variety of networks, such as [[Wi-Fi]], [[3G]], or [[4G]]. No proximity between devices is required.\n\n==Compatibility==\nThe current versions of Splashtop Streamer are available for [[Microsoft Windows]] XP, 7, 8, and 10 including the Home Premium versions, which do not support [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]] as well as for Windows Server versions 2003, 2008 and 2016.

Splashtop enables users to connect to and control [[computer]]s from desktop and mobile devices<ref>[https://www.ostechnix.com/splashtop-a-better-alternative-to-logmein-and-teamviewer/]</ref>. Unlike products using Microsoft's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]],  Splashtop Remote uses its own closed, proprietary protocol.\n\n==Products==\nSplashtop products focus on remote computer access and collaboration for business professionals, IT, MSPs, support, help desk, education, and consumers. The products include:\n\n* '''Splashtop Business Access''' \u2013 a low cost, subscription-based [[remote desktop software|remote desktop software]] for business professionals<ref>https://www.pcmag.com/review/355522/splashtop-business-access</ref>\n* '''Splashtop Remote Support''' \u2013 subscription-based [[Remote support|remote support]] software focused on IT professionals and MSPs remotely managing computers and servers<ref>https://www.splashtop.com/press_release/splashtop-launches-splashtop-business-for-remote-support-the-simple-reliable-and-cost-effective-replacement-for-logmein-and-teamviewer</ref><ref>https://www.g2crowd.com/products/splashtop-remote-support/reviews</ref>\n* '''Splashtop SOS''' \u2013 subscription-based, on-demand remote support software used by technical support teams and help desks to remotely access and support computers and mobile devices<ref>https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/05/splashtop-debuts-sos-with-mobile-android-support-service.html</ref>\n* '''Splashtop Classroom''' \u2013 education classroom collaboration software allowing teachers to share content and application across computers, iPads and Chromebooks<ref>https://www.splashtop.com/press_release/splashtop-expands-education-suite-splashtop-classroom-allowing-teachers-share-content-applications-across-computers-ipads-chromebooks</ref>\n* '''Splashtop Personal''' \u2013 consumer-focused remote computer access software for personal use<ref>https://www.ostechnix.com/splashtop-a-better-alternative-to-logmein-and-teamviewer/</ref>\n* '''Mirroring360''' \u2013 screen mirroring and screen sharing for education and business<ref>https://www.cnet.com/news/mirror-your-iphone-or-ipad-to-your-pc/</ref>\n\n==Functionality==\nSplashtop remote desktop applications map the screen of the mobile device to the screen of the remote computer, so that users can interact with the remote computer using intuitive touch-to-click controls and zoom in using the pinch gesture. Gestures are used to replace mouse and keyboard controls. For example, a two-finger drag gesture is used to scroll within windows, generally mapping to the mouse wheel controller. iPhone or iPad native software keyboard, modified to include special keys, such as Ctrl, Alt, or Delete, is used for text input.\n\nThe products can establish connections between devices connected to a variety of networks, such as [[Wi-Fi]], [[3G]], or [[4G]]. No proximity between devices is required.\n\n==Compatibility==\nThe current versions of Splashtop Streamer are available for [[Microsoft Windows]] XP, 7, 8, and 10 including the Home Premium versions, which do not support [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]] as well as for Windows Server versions 2003, 2008 and 2016. Splashtop also has support for [[Mac OS X]] 10.7 (Lion) and later versions.  \n\nThe Splashtop Remote Desktop client application is available for the [[iPad]], [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]] from the [[Apple App Store]], as well as [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (including [[Kindle Fire]]), [[Windows]] and [[Macintosh|Mac]], and [[Chromebook]]. <ref>[https://www.splashtop.com/downloads Splashtop Streamer Download requirements]</ref>\n\n==Company history==\nSplashtop Inc.

After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895.

[[List of islands of Taiwan|Smaller islands]] include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the [[Penghu]] archipelago, the [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] near the Chinese coast, and some of the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nThe main island is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{cvt|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive.

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]].

This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones.

It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext.

In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese [[multiculturalism]] has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan.<ref>{{harvnb|Hsiau|2005|pp=125\u2013129}}; {{harvnb|Winckler|1994|pp=23\u201341}}</ref> [[Identity politics]], along with the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has led to distinct traditions in many areas, including [[Taiwanese cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Music of Taiwan|music]].\n\n[[File:2008TIBE Day1 Hall1 Opening TouhWang.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Wang Tuoh]], a Taiwanese writer, literary critic and politician]]\nOne of Taiwan's greatest attractions is the [[National Palace Museum]], which houses more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art and objects in the world.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028163715/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|title=Museum|archivedate=28 October 2009|work=archive.org}}</ref> The KMT moved this collection from the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War.

[[Karaoke]], drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms according to the number of guests in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to form all-encompassing and elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV's, equipped not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.\n\nTaiwan has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments.<ref>{{cite journal|author=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |authorlink=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |title=Convenience Stores Aim at Differentiation |journal=Taiwan Business Topics |volume=34 |issue=11 |url=http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558 |format=\u2013 <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AConvenience+Stores+Aim+at+Differentiation&as_publication=Taiwan+Business+TOPICS&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516161020/http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558 |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}</ref> They also provide a service for mailing packages.\n\nTaiwanese culture has also influenced other cultures.

In the 17th century, [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895.

From the name of the tribe, the Portuguese called the area around Ping'an as Tayowan, Taiyowan, Tyovon, Teijoan, Toyouan, and so forth.

[[List of islands of Taiwan|Smaller islands]] include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the [[Penghu]] archipelago, the [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] near the Chinese coast, and some of the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nThe main island is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{cvt|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive.

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]].

This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones.

It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext.

In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese [[multiculturalism]] has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan.<ref>{{harvnb|Hsiau|2005|pp=125\u2013129}}; {{harvnb|Winckler|1994|pp=23\u201341}}</ref> [[Identity politics]], along with the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has led to distinct traditions in many areas, including [[Taiwanese cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Music of Taiwan|music]].\n\n[[File:2008TIBE Day1 Hall1 Opening TouhWang.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Wang Tuoh]], a Taiwanese writer, literary critic and politician]]\nOne of Taiwan's greatest attractions is the [[National Palace Museum]], which houses more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art and objects in the world.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028163715/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|title=Museum|archivedate=28 October 2009|work=archive.org}}</ref> The KMT moved this collection from the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War.

[[Karaoke]], drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms according to the number of guests in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to form all-encompassing and elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV's, equipped not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.\n\nTaiwan has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments.<ref>{{cite journal|author=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |authorlink=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |title=Convenience Stores Aim at Differentiation |journal=Taiwan Business Topics |volume=34 |issue=11 |url=http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558 |format=\u2013 <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AConvenience+Stores+Aim+at+Differentiation&as_publication=Taiwan+Business+TOPICS&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516161020/http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558 |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}</ref> They also provide a service for mailing packages.\n\nTaiwanese culture has also influenced other cultures.

There are two major Italian diasporas in Italian history. The first diaspora began around 1880, two decades after the [[Risorgimento|Unification of Italy]], and ended in the 1920s to early-1940s with the rise of [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Fascism in Italy]]. The second diaspora started after the end of [[World War II]] and roughly concluded in the 1970s. These together constituted the largest voluntary emigration period in documented history. Between 1880-1980, about 15,000,000 Italians left the country permanently.<ref>Ben-Ghiat and Hom, \u201cIntroduction\u201d to Italian Mobilities (Routledge, 2016)</ref> By 1980, it was estimated that about 25,000,000 Italians were residing outside Italy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Russell|date=1978-01-01|title=Report: The Italian Diaspora|journal=Area|volume=10|issue=5|pages=386|jstor=20001401}}</ref> A third wave is being reported in present times, due to the socio-economic problems caused by the financial crisis of the early twenty-first century, especially amongst the youth. According to the Public Register of Italian Residents Abroad (AIRE), figures of Italians abroad rose from 3,106,251 in 2006 to 4,636,647 in 2015, growing by 49.3% in just ten years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/10/06/news/aumentano_espatri_italiani_migrantes-124460911/|title=Italiani all'estero, sempre pi\u00f9 giovani e settentrionali: +7,6% nel 2015|date=October 6, 2015|website=la Repubblica}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe so-called Italian Diaspora, indicating a large-scale migration of Italians away from their country during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, occurred in three different waves. The first wave occurred between the [[Risorgimento|unification of Italy]] in 1861 and 1900, the second wave occurred between 1900-40 during the beginning of [[World War I]], and the third wave occurred following [[World War II]] along with Europeans from various countries.<ref name=\"Pozzetta, George E. 1992\">Pozzetta, George E., Bruno Ramirez, and Robert F. Harney. The Italian Diaspora: Migration across the Globe. Toronto: Multicultural History Society of Ontario, 1992.</ref> Poverty was the main reason for leaving, specifically the lack of land as property became subdivided over generations; especially in the South of Italy where conditions were harsh.<ref name=\"Pozzetta, George E. 1992\"/> Secondary reasons for the diaspora include internal political and economic problems, as well as [[organized crime]] from economic difficulties in the former [[Kingdom of the two Sicilies]]. Until the 1860s, Italy was a partially [[rural society]] with many small towns and cities and almost no modern industry, in which land management practices, especially in the South and North-East, did not easily convince farmers to stay on the land and work the soil.<ref name=\"MacDonald\">{{cite journal | last = McDonald | first = J.S. | title = Some Socio-Economic Emigration Differentials in Rural Italy, 1902-1913 | journal = Economic Development and Cultural Change | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201372 |date=October 1958 | doi = 10.1086/449779 | issn = 0013-0079}}</ref> Another factor was related to the overpopulation of [[Southern Italy]] after the improvements of the socio-economic conditions, following the unification process.

The breakdown of [[feudalism]], however, and redistribution of land did not necessarily lead to small farmers in the south winding up with land of their own or land they could work and make profit from. Many remained landless, and plots grew smaller and smaller and so less and less productive as land was subdivided amongst heirs.<ref name=\"MacDonald\"/>\n\n[[File:\u00c9migration italienne par r\u00e9gions 1876-1915.jpg|thumb|400px|Estimates of the number of emigrants from 1876-1900 and 1901-1915, according to their region of origin.<ref name= Rosoli >{{cite web|url=http://www.emigrati.it/Emigrazione/Esodo.asp|title=Emigrazione Italiana: il pi\u00f9 grande esodo della Storia Moderna - emigrati.it|website=Emigrati.it|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref>]]\n\nBetween 1860 and World War I, 9,000,000 Italians left permanently of a total of 16 million who emigrated, most from the south and most travelling to North or South America.<ref name=\"Hatton\">{{cite journal | last = Hatton | first = Timothy J. and Jeffrey G.

Annual emigration averaged almost 220,000 in the period 1876-1900, and almost 650,000 from 1901 through 1915. Prior to 1900 the majority of Italian immigrants were from northern and central Italy. Two-thirds of the migrants who left Italy between 1870-1914 were men with traditional skills. Peasants were half of all migrants before 1896.<ref name=\"Italy's Many Diasporas\"/> As the number of Italian emigrants abroad increased, so did their [[remittance]]s, which encouraged further emigration, even in the face of factors that might logically be thought to decrease the need to leave, such as increased salaries at home. It has been termed \"persistent and path-dependent emigration flow\".<ref name=\"Hatton\"/> Friends and relatives who left first sent back money for tickets and helped relatives as they arrived. That tended to support an emigration flow since even improving conditions in the original country took a while to trickle down to potential emigrants to convince them not to leave. The emigrant flow was stemmed only by dramatic events, such as the outbreak of World War I, which greatly disrupted the flow of people trying to leave Europe, and the restrictions on immigration that were put in place by receiving countries. Examples of such restrictions in the United States were the [[Emergency Quota Act|Emergency Quota Act of 1921]] and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. Restrictive legislation to limit emigration from Italy was introduced by the fascist government of the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=\"Monticelli\"/>\n\nThe Italian diaspora did not affect all regions of the nation equally. In the second phase of emigration (1900 to World War I), slightly less than half of emigrants were from the south and most of them were from rural areas, as they were driven off the land by inefficient land management, lawlessness and sickness ([[pellagra]] and [[cholera]]). Robert Foerster, in ''Italian Emigration of our Times'' (1919) says, \"[Emigration has been]\u2026 well nigh expulsion; it has been exodus, in the sense of depopulation; it has been characteristically permanent\".<ref>Cited in {{cite journal | last = Abbott | first = Edith | title = Review of: Italian Emigration of our Times by Robert Foerster (1919) | journal = The American Political Science Review | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 523\u2013524 |date=August 1920 | doi = 10.2307/1946285 | publisher = American Political Science Association | last2 = Foerster | first2 = Robert F. | issn = 0003-0554 | jstor = 1946285}}</ref> The very large number of emigrants from Friuli Venezia Giulia, a region with a population of only 509,000 in 1870 until 1914 is due to the fact that many of those counted among the 1.407 million emigrants actually lived in the Austrian Littoral which had a larger polyglot population of Croats, Friulians, Italians and Slovenes than in the Italian Friuli.<ref>Emigration to Australia from Friuli Venezia Giulia, Francesco Fait</ref>  \n\n''[[Mezzadria]]'', a form of sharefarming where tenant families obtained a plot to work on from an owner and kept a reasonable share of the profits, was more prevalent in central Italy, which is one of the reasons that there was less emigration from that part of Italy. The south lacked entrepreneurs, and absentee landlords were common. Although owning land was the basic yardstick of wealth, farming there was socially despised. People invested not in agricultural equipment, but in such things as low-risk state bonds.<ref name=\"MacDonald\"/>\n\nThe rule that emigration from cities was negligible has an important exception, in [[Naples]].<ref name=\"MacDonald\"/> The city went from being the capital of its own kingdom in 1860 to being just another large city in Italy. The loss of bureaucratical jobs and the subsequently declining financial situation led to high unemployment in the area. In the early-1880s, epidemics of cholera also struck the city, causing many people to leave. The epidemics were the driving force behind the decision to rebuild entire sections of the city, an undertaking known as the \"''[[risanamento]]''\" (literally \"making healthy again\"), a pursuit that lasted until the start of World War I.\n\nDuring the first few years before the unification of Italy, emigration was not particularly controlled by the state. Emigrants were often in the hands of emigration agents whose job was to make money for themselves by moving emigrants. Such labor agents and recruiters were called padroni, translating to patron or boss.<ref name=\"Italy's Many Diasporas\"/> Abuses led to the first migration law in Italy, passed in 1888, to bring the many emigration agencies under state control.<ref name=\"Cometti\"/> On 31 January 1901, the Commissariat of Emigration was created, granting licenses to carriers, enforcing fixed ticket costs, keeping order at ports of embarkation, providing health inspection for those leaving, setting up hostels and care facilities and arranging agreements with receiving countries to help care for those arriving. The Commissariat tried to take care of emigrants before they left and after they arrived, such as dealing with the American laws that discriminated against alien workers (like the [[Alien Contract Labor Law]]) and even suspending, for a while, emigration to Brazil, where many migrants had wound up as virtual slaves on large coffee plantations.<ref name=\"Cometti\"/> The Commissariat also helped to set up remittances sent by emigrants from the United States back to their motherland, which turned into a constant flow of money amounting, by some accounts, to about 5% of the Italian [[GNP]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Glazier | first = Ira | title = Review of: The National Integration of Italian Return Migration: 1870-1929, by Dino Cinel, New York Cambridge U.

Foreign newspapers ran scare stories little different than those published forty years earlier (when, for example, on December 18, 1880, the ''[[New York Times]]'' ran an editorial, \"Undesirable Emigrants\", full of typical invective of the day against the \"promiscuous immigration\u2026 [of]\u2026the filthy, wretched, lazy, criminal dregs of the meanest sections of Italy\".) Somewhat toned down was an article of April 17, 1921 in the same newspaper, under the headline \"Italians Coming in Great Numbers\" and \"Number of Immigrants Will Be Limited Only By Capacity of Liners\" (there was now a limited number of ships available because of recent wartime losses) and that potential immigrants were thronging the quays in the cities of Genoa. Also:\n\n:\"\u2026The stranger walking through a city like Naples can easily realize the problem the government has to do with. The side streets\u2026are literally swarming with children, who sprawl in the paved roadway and on the sidewalks. They look dirty and happy\u2026Suburbs of Naples\u2026 swarm with children who, for number, can only be compared to those in Delhi, Agra and other cities in the East Indies\u2026.\"\n\nThe extreme economic difficulties of post-war Italy and the severe internal tensions within the country, which led to the rise of fascism, led 614,000 immigrants away in 1920, half of them going to the United States. When the fascists came to power in 1922, there was a general slowdown in the flow of emigrants from Italy, eventually. However, during the first five years of fascist rule, 1,500,000 people left Italy.<ref name=\"Cannistraro\">{{cite journal | last = Cannistraro | first = Philip V. and Gianfusto Rosoli | title = Fascist Emigration Policy in the 1930s: an Interpretative Framework | journal = International Migration Review | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 673\u2013692 | date = Winter 1979 | doi = 10.2307/2545181 | pmid = 12337317 | last2 = Rosoli | first2 = G | publisher = The Center for Migration Studies of New York, Inc. | issn = 0197-9183 | jstor = 2545181}}</ref> By then, the nature of the emigrants had changed; there was, for example, a marked increase in the rise of relatives outside the working age moving to be with their families, who had already left Italy.\n\n==By region==\n===Libya===\n{{See also|Italian settlers in Libya}}\n[[File:The first Locomotive arrived in Tripoli Harbor.jpg|thumb|Arrival of the first Italian locomotive in Tripoli, [[Italian Libya]], in 1912.]]\n[[Libya]] had some 150,000 [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italians settlers]] when Italy entered [[World War II]] in 1940, constituting about 18% of the total population in [[Italian Libya]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-46562/Libya|title=Libya - History, People, & Government|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref> The Italians in Libya resided (and many still do) in most major cities like [[Tripoli]] (37% of the city was Italian), [[Benghazi]] (31%), and [[Hun, Libya|Hun]] (3%).

While [[New Spain]] received many people from the Italian peninsula, it was after independence that Mexico attracted a larger number of migrants. Starting in the 1950s, Mexico created the \"Colonia Modelo\" in the coastal state of Veracruz, signing a treaty with the Kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia. The first of many agricultural colonies was formed near the city of [[Papantla]] by immigrants from [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]], and [[Sardinia]].  Internal conflicts in Mexico made the government forget about the plans, but the colonists moved on towards the coast and founded Colonia el Cristo and combined it with today's [[Gutierrez Zamora]] city, which to this day has a strong Italian culture and along with their neighbouring French towns of San Rafael and Jicaltepec and the Spanish emigres in Papantla thrived in the vanilla production.  This first failed agricultural colony turned success story opened the door for mass Italian immigration into Mexico who was looking to populate their lands. Many more came on their own to make \"La Merica\" in Mexico and then there were more governmental sponsored agricultural colonies in Veracruz, Puebla, Mexico City, Morelos, Jalisco and San Luis Potosi, the majority of these lost their original colonists as they went to larger cities and blended in with the local population while others preserved the Italian identity of their towns such as [[Colonia Manuel Gonzalez]] in [[Zentla]], [[Veracruz]] which was the second Italian colony but formed mainly by [[Lombards]], [[Trentinos]] and [[Venice|Venetians]], the [[Diez Gutierrez]] colony in San Luis Potosi near [[Ciudad de Maiz]] mainly formed of [[Austria]]n and [[Trento]] immigrants, and the most prosperous of all, [[Chipilo]] in the state of Puebla near the capital, which to this day preserves their Venetian dialect called [[chipile\u00f1o]] along with their gastronomy, dairy products and woodworking skills.  Southern Italians were not allowed to enter Mexico as they were deemed undesirable for their problems with the Mafia, but large numbers of immigrants from [[Calabria]], [[Campania]] and [[Sicily]] entered the country and went mainly to the cities instead of rural Mexico. The largest wave of immigration started in the 1850s and finished in the 1930s but a second wave started in the 1940s and finished in the mid 1950s.  There is a third wave today starting in 2007 going on to this day (2019) as the crisis in Italy heightens and Mexico once again opens her arms, but the immigrants today are well prepared in University and higher education with no prospects in Italy and Mexico facilitates work for them as they see Italy having a [[brain drain]]. Today there are over 2.5 million Mexicans of Italian background, either full or partial, and most have assimilated into the greater Mexican culture and contributed much to Mexican culture in all branches of society. Mexico has even had a President of Italian background, [[Manuel Maria Lombardini]].\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|Italian French|Italian German|Italian immigration to Switzerland|Italian British|Welsh Italians|Italian Scots|Swedish Italians}}\nItalian migration into what is today France has been going on, in different migrating cycles from the end of the nineteenth century to the present day.<ref name=\"france\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgesurveyo00robi |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgesurveyo00robi/page/143 143] |quote=5 million italians in france. |title=Cambridge Survey |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=2009-05-11|isbn=9780521444057|author1=Cohen, Robin|year=1995}}</ref> In addition, [[Corsica]] passed from the [[Republic of Genoa]] to France in 1770, and the area around [[Nice]] and [[Savoy]] from the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] to France in 1860.

It was those Italian migrants and their descendants who have had a significant impact on the culture, society and economy of Australia.\n\nThe 2006 Australian Census counted 199,124 persons who were born in Italy, and Italian is the fifth-most identified ancestry in Australia with 852,418 responses. Italian Australians experienced a low rate of return migration to Italy, relative to the Italian diaspora in other countries.\n\nUnlike Australia, New Zealand has never received much immigration from Italy. Several hundreds of them, mostly fishermen, made it in the late-1890s.

There are two major Italian diasporas in Italian history. The first diaspora began around 1880, two decades after the [[Risorgimento|Unification of Italy]], and ended in the 1920s to early-1940s with the rise of [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Fascism in Italy]]. The second diaspora started after the end of [[World War II]] and roughly concluded in the 1970s. These together constituted the largest voluntary emigration period in documented history. Between 1880-1980, about 15,000,000 Italians left the country permanently.<ref>Ben-Ghiat and Hom, \u201cIntroduction\u201d to Italian Mobilities (Routledge, 2016)</ref> By 1980, it was estimated that about 25,000,000 Italians were residing outside Italy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Russell|date=1978-01-01|title=Report: The Italian Diaspora|journal=Area|volume=10|issue=5|pages=386|jstor=20001401}}</ref> A third wave is being reported in present times, due to the socio-economic problems caused by the financial crisis of the early twenty-first century, especially amongst the youth.

The first wave occurred between the [[Risorgimento|unification of Italy]] in 1861 and 1900, the second wave occurred between 1900-40 during the beginning of [[World War I]], and the third wave occurred following [[World War II]] along with Europeans from various countries.<ref name=\"Pozzetta, George E. 1992\">Pozzetta, George E., Bruno Ramirez, and Robert F.

Until the 1860s, Italy was a partially [[rural society]] with many small towns and cities and almost no modern industry, in which land management practices, especially in the South and North-East, did not easily convince farmers to stay on the land and work the soil.<ref name=\"MacDonald\">{{cite journal | last = McDonald | first = J.S. | title = Some Socio-Economic Emigration Differentials in Rural Italy, 1902-1913 | journal = Economic Development and Cultural Change | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201372 |date=October 1958 | doi = 10.1086/449779 | issn = 0013-0079}}</ref> Another factor was related to the overpopulation of [[Southern Italy]] after the improvements of the socio-economic conditions, following the unification process.

The breakdown of [[feudalism]], however, and redistribution of land did not necessarily lead to small farmers in the south winding up with land of their own or land they could work and make profit from.

Annual emigration averaged almost 220,000 in the period 1876-1900, and almost 650,000 from 1901 through 1915. Prior to 1900 the majority of Italian immigrants were from northern and central Italy. Two-thirds of the migrants who left Italy between 1870-1914 were men with traditional skills. Peasants were half of all migrants before 1896.<ref name=\"Italy's Many Diasporas\"/> As the number of Italian emigrants abroad increased, so did their [[remittance]]s, which encouraged further emigration, even in the face of factors that might logically be thought to decrease the need to leave, such as increased salaries at home. It has been termed \"persistent and path-dependent emigration flow\".<ref name=\"Hatton\"/> Friends and relatives who left first sent back money for tickets and helped relatives as they arrived. That tended to support an emigration flow since even improving conditions in the original country took a while to trickle down to potential emigrants to convince them not to leave. The emigrant flow was stemmed only by dramatic events, such as the outbreak of World War I, which greatly disrupted the flow of people trying to leave Europe, and the restrictions on immigration that were put in place by receiving countries. Examples of such restrictions in the United States were the [[Emergency Quota Act|Emergency Quota Act of 1921]] and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. Restrictive legislation to limit emigration from Italy was introduced by the fascist government of the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=\"Monticelli\"/>\n\nThe Italian diaspora did not affect all regions of the nation equally. In the second phase of emigration (1900 to World War I), slightly less than half of emigrants were from the south and most of them were from rural areas, as they were driven off the land by inefficient land management, lawlessness and sickness ([[pellagra]] and [[cholera]]). Robert Foerster, in ''Italian Emigration of our Times'' (1919) says, \"[Emigration has been]\u2026 well nigh expulsion; it has been exodus, in the sense of depopulation; it has been characteristically permanent\".<ref>Cited in {{cite journal | last = Abbott | first = Edith | title = Review of: Italian Emigration of our Times by Robert Foerster (1919) | journal = The American Political Science Review | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 523\u2013524 |date=August 1920 | doi = 10.2307/1946285 | publisher = American Political Science Association | last2 = Foerster | first2 = Robert F. | issn = 0003-0554 | jstor = 1946285}}</ref> The very large number of emigrants from Friuli Venezia Giulia, a region with a population of only 509,000 in 1870 until 1914 is due to the fact that many of those counted among the 1.407 million emigrants actually lived in the Austrian Littoral which had a larger polyglot population of Croats, Friulians, Italians and Slovenes than in the Italian Friuli.<ref>Emigration to Australia from Friuli Venezia Giulia, Francesco Fait</ref>  \n\n''[[Mezzadria]]'', a form of sharefarming where tenant families obtained a plot to work on from an owner and kept a reasonable share of the profits, was more prevalent in central Italy, which is one of the reasons that there was less emigration from that part of Italy. The south lacked entrepreneurs, and absentee landlords were common. Although owning land was the basic yardstick of wealth, farming there was socially despised. People invested not in agricultural equipment, but in such things as low-risk state bonds.<ref name=\"MacDonald\"/>\n\nThe rule that emigration from cities was negligible has an important exception, in [[Naples]].<ref name=\"MacDonald\"/> The city went from being the capital of its own kingdom in 1860 to being just another large city in Italy. The loss of bureaucratical jobs and the subsequently declining financial situation led to high unemployment in the area. In the early-1880s, epidemics of cholera also struck the city, causing many people to leave. The epidemics were the driving force behind the decision to rebuild entire sections of the city, an undertaking known as the \"''[[risanamento]]''\" (literally \"making healthy again\"), a pursuit that lasted until the start of World War I.\n\nDuring the first few years before the unification of Italy, emigration was not particularly controlled by the state. Emigrants were often in the hands of emigration agents whose job was to make money for themselves by moving emigrants. Such labor agents and recruiters were called padroni, translating to patron or boss.<ref name=\"Italy's Many Diasporas\"/> Abuses led to the first migration law in Italy, passed in 1888, to bring the many emigration agencies under state control.<ref name=\"Cometti\"/> On 31 January 1901, the Commissariat of Emigration was created, granting licenses to carriers, enforcing fixed ticket costs, keeping order at ports of embarkation, providing health inspection for those leaving, setting up hostels and care facilities and arranging agreements with receiving countries to help care for those arriving. The Commissariat tried to take care of emigrants before they left and after they arrived, such as dealing with the American laws that discriminated against alien workers (like the [[Alien Contract Labor Law]]) and even suspending, for a while, emigration to Brazil, where many migrants had wound up as virtual slaves on large coffee plantations.<ref name=\"Cometti\"/> The Commissariat also helped to set up remittances sent by emigrants from the United States back to their motherland, which turned into a constant flow of money amounting, by some accounts, to about 5% of the Italian [[GNP]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Glazier | first = Ira | title = Review of: The National Integration of Italian Return Migration: 1870-1929, by Dino Cinel, New York Cambridge U.

Foreign newspapers ran scare stories little different than those published forty years earlier (when, for example, on December 18, 1880, the ''[[New York Times]]'' ran an editorial, \"Undesirable Emigrants\", full of typical invective of the day against the \"promiscuous immigration\u2026 [of]\u2026the filthy, wretched, lazy, criminal dregs of the meanest sections of Italy\".) Somewhat toned down was an article of April 17, 1921 in the same newspaper, under the headline \"Italians Coming in Great Numbers\" and \"Number of Immigrants Will Be Limited Only By Capacity of Liners\" (there was now a limited number of ships available because of recent wartime losses) and that potential immigrants were thronging the quays in the cities of Genoa. Also:\n\n:\"\u2026The stranger walking through a city like Naples can easily realize the problem the government has to do with.

When the fascists came to power in 1922, there was a general slowdown in the flow of emigrants from Italy, eventually. However, during the first five years of fascist rule, 1,500,000 people left Italy.<ref name=\"Cannistraro\">{{cite journal | last = Cannistraro | first = Philip V. and Gianfusto Rosoli | title = Fascist Emigration Policy in the 1930s: an Interpretative Framework | journal = International Migration Review | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 673\u2013692 | date = Winter 1979 | doi = 10.2307/2545181 | pmid = 12337317 | last2 = Rosoli | first2 = G | publisher = The Center for Migration Studies of New York, Inc. | issn = 0197-9183 | jstor = 2545181}}</ref> By then, the nature of the emigrants had changed; there was, for example, a marked increase in the rise of relatives outside the working age moving to be with their families, who had already left Italy.\n\n==By region==\n===Libya===\n{{See also|Italian settlers in Libya}}\n[[File:The first Locomotive arrived in Tripoli Harbor.jpg|thumb|Arrival of the first Italian locomotive in Tripoli, [[Italian Libya]], in 1912.]]\n[[Libya]] had some 150,000 [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italians settlers]] when Italy entered [[World War II]] in 1940, constituting about 18% of the total population in [[Italian Libya]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-46562/Libya|title=Libya - History, People, & Government|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref> The Italians in Libya resided (and many still do) in most major cities like [[Tripoli]] (37% of the city was Italian), [[Benghazi]] (31%), and [[Hun, Libya|Hun]] (3%).

While [[New Spain]] received many people from the Italian peninsula, it was after independence that Mexico attracted a larger number of migrants. Starting in the 1950s, Mexico created the \"Colonia Modelo\" in the coastal state of Veracruz, signing a treaty with the Kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia. The first of many agricultural colonies was formed near the city of [[Papantla]] by immigrants from [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]], and [[Sardinia]].  Internal conflicts in Mexico made the government forget about the plans, but the colonists moved on towards the coast and founded Colonia el Cristo and combined it with today's [[Gutierrez Zamora]] city, which to this day has a strong Italian culture and along with their neighbouring French towns of San Rafael and Jicaltepec and the Spanish emigres in Papantla thrived in the vanilla production.  This first failed agricultural colony turned success story opened the door for mass Italian immigration into Mexico who was looking to populate their lands. Many more came on their own to make \"La Merica\" in Mexico and then there were more governmental sponsored agricultural colonies in Veracruz, Puebla, Mexico City, Morelos, Jalisco and San Luis Potosi, the majority of these lost their original colonists as they went to larger cities and blended in with the local population while others preserved the Italian identity of their towns such as [[Colonia Manuel Gonzalez]] in [[Zentla]], [[Veracruz]] which was the second Italian colony but formed mainly by [[Lombards]], [[Trentinos]] and [[Venice|Venetians]], the [[Diez Gutierrez]] colony in San Luis Potosi near [[Ciudad de Maiz]] mainly formed of [[Austria]]n and [[Trento]] immigrants, and the most prosperous of all, [[Chipilo]] in the state of Puebla near the capital, which to this day preserves their Venetian dialect called [[chipile\u00f1o]] along with their gastronomy, dairy products and woodworking skills.  Southern Italians were not allowed to enter Mexico as they were deemed undesirable for their problems with the Mafia, but large numbers of immigrants from [[Calabria]], [[Campania]] and [[Sicily]] entered the country and went mainly to the cities instead of rural Mexico. The largest wave of immigration started in the 1850s and finished in the 1930s but a second wave started in the 1940s and finished in the mid 1950s.  There is a third wave today starting in 2007 going on to this day (2019) as the crisis in Italy heightens and Mexico once again opens her arms, but the immigrants today are well prepared in University and higher education with no prospects in Italy and Mexico facilitates work for them as they see Italy having a [[brain drain]]. Today there are over 2.5 million Mexicans of Italian background, either full or partial, and most have assimilated into the greater Mexican culture and contributed much to Mexican culture in all branches of society. Mexico has even had a President of Italian background, [[Manuel Maria Lombardini]].\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|Italian French|Italian German|Italian immigration to Switzerland|Italian British|Welsh Italians|Italian Scots|Swedish Italians}}\nItalian migration into what is today France has been going on, in different migrating cycles from the end of the nineteenth century to the present day.<ref name=\"france\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgesurveyo00robi |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgesurveyo00robi/page/143 143] |quote=5 million italians in france. |title=Cambridge Survey |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=2009-05-11|isbn=9780521444057|author1=Cohen, Robin|year=1995}}</ref> In addition, [[Corsica]] passed from the [[Republic of Genoa]] to France in 1770, and the area around [[Nice]] and [[Savoy]] from the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] to France in 1860.

As a result, today Bedford has the largest concentration of Italian families in the UK, and the third-highest number of Italian immigrants overall with around one-fifth of its overall population being of Italian descent.<ref>[[Italians in the United Kingdom#Since 1945]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jan/23/britishidentity.features113|title=Italians in Bedford|date=23 January 2006|accessdate=11 January 2018|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> In Hoddesdon, many Italians, mostly descending from Sicily, migrated there and across the [[Lea Valley]] in the 1950s due to opportunities working in local garden nurseries. They were drawn to the area by the rich agricultural landscape and better pay in comparison to back home. Today, the town's Italian community has had such a significant impact that an Italian consul, Carmelo Nicastro, was even elected for the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hertfordshirelife.co.uk/out-about/places/lee_valley_little_sicily_1_3977026|title=Lee Valley little Sicily|website=Hertfordshirelife.co.uk|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\n{{Main|Italian Australian|Italian community of Melbourne|Italian New Zealander}}\nItalians first arrived in Australia in the decades immediately following the Unification, but the most significant wave was after World War II ended in 1945, particularly from 1950-65. It was those Italian migrants and their descendants who have had a significant impact on the culture, society and economy of Australia.\n\nThe 2006 Australian Census counted 199,124 persons who were born in Italy, and Italian is the fifth-most identified ancestry in Australia with 852,418 responses. Italian Australians experienced a low rate of return migration to Italy, relative to the Italian diaspora in other countries.\n\nUnlike Australia, New Zealand has never received much immigration from Italy. Several hundreds of them, mostly fishermen, made it in the late-1890s. As of 2011, roughly 3,500 New Zealanders claim Italian heritage.\n\n==Numbers==\nAfter 1890, Italian contribution to the emigration flow to the [[New World]] was significant. By 1870, Italy had about 25,000,000 inhabitants (compared to 40,000,000 in Germany and 30,000,000 in the United Kingdom).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tacitus.nu/historical-atlas/population/italy.htm|title=Population of Italy|website=Tacitus.nu|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nA preliminary census done in 1861, after the annexation of the South, claimed that there were a mere 100,000 Italians living abroad.<ref name=\"Monticelli\">{{cite journal | last = Monticelli | first = Giuseppe Lucrezio | title = Italian Emigration: Basic Characteristic and Trends with Special Reference to the Last Twenty Years | journal = International Migration Review | volume = 1 | issue = 3, Special issue, The Italian Experience in Emigration | pages = 10\u201324 | date = Summer 1967 | doi = 10.2307/3002737 | publisher = The Center for Migration Studies of New York, Inc. | issn = 0197-9183 | jstor = 3002737}}</ref> The General Directorate of Statistics did not start compiling official emigration statistics until 1876.<ref name=\"Cometti\">{{cite journal | last = Cometti | first = Elizabeth | title = Trends in Italian Emigration | journal = The Western Political Quarterly | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 820\u2013834 |date=December 1958 | doi = 10.2307/443655 | publisher = University of Utah | issn = 0043-4078 | jstor = 443655}}</ref> Accurate figures on the decades between 1870 and World War I show how emigration increased dramatically during that period:\n\nItalian emigrants per 1,000 population:<ref>Hatton.
