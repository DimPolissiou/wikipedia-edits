For a brief time in 1968, he was a member of [[the Animals]], then known as [[Eric Burdon]] and the Animals, with whom he recorded one album, ''[[Love Is (The Animals album)|Love Is]]''. The album features a recording of [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]]'s \"Coloured Rain\", which includes a 4{{nbsp}}minute and 15 second guitar solo by Summers. The LP also included a reworked version of Dantalion's Chariot's sole single \"Madman Running Through the Fields\".\n\nAfter five years in Los Angeles, mostly spent studying [[classical guitar]] and composition at [[California State University, Northridge]], he returned to London with his American girlfriend Kate Lunken.\n\nIn London, Summers recorded and toured with acts including [[Kevin Coyne]], [[Jon Lord]], [[Joan Armatrading]], [[David Essex]], [[Neil Sedaka]] and [[Kevin Ayers]]. In October 1975 he participated in an orchestral rendition of [[Mike Oldfield]]'s seminal \"[[Tubular Bells]]\".\n\nIn 1977, Summers was invited by ex-[[Gong (band)|Gong]] bassist [[Mike Howlett]] to join his band [[Strontium 90 (band)|Strontium 90]], but was soon coaxed away by future Police bandmates Sting and Stewart Copeland.\n\n===The Police===\n{{Main|The Police}}\nSummers achieved international fame as the guitarist for [[the Police]], which he joined in 1977, eventually replacing original guitarist [[Henry Padovani]]. Emerging from London's punk scene, the Police gained international renown with many hit songs, including \"[[Message in a Bottle (song)|Message in a Bottle]]\", \"[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]\", \"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\", \"[[Every Breath You Take]]\", and \"[[Every Little Thing She Does is Magic]]\". During his time with the band, Summers twice won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, first in 1979 for \"[[Reggatta de Blanc]]\" (written with Copeland and Sting) and in 1980 for \"[[Behind My Camel]]\".\n\nAlthough Sting was the lead singer of the band, Summers occasionally contributed lead vocals, as in \"Be My Girl/Sally\" (1978), \"Friends\" (1980), \"Mother\" (1983), and \"Someone to Talk To\" (1983). Other notable Summers compositions from this period are \"Omegaman\" (which would have been released as the debut single from the 1981 ''[[Ghost in the Machine (The Police album)|Ghost in the Machine]]'' album had Sting not objected), \"Shambelle\" (1981), \"Once Upon a Daydream\", and \"Murder by Numbers\" both co-written with Sting (both 1983). In early 1984, after seven years together and record sales around eighty million, the Police disbanded.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-0-7119-5302-4|page=25|author=Welch, Chris |year=1996|publisher=Omnibus Press|location=London|title=The complete guide to the music of The Police and Sting}}</ref>\n\nThough not given songwriting credit, Summers wrote the guitar riff for \"Every Breath You Take\". It was recorded in one take with his 1961 [[Fender Stratocaster]] during the ''Synchronicity'' sessions. The song was number one for eight weeks. Sting won the 1983 Grammy Award for Song of the Year, and the Police won Best Pop Performance by a Duo Or Group With Vocal for this song. Summers provides an account of the session in his memoir, ''One Train Later''.<ref name=\"Memoir\">{{cite book |last=Summers |first1=Andy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMDFPefQCHkC&dq |title=One Train Later: A Memoir |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007 |isbn=978-1429909297 |accessdate=29 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAs a member of the Police, Summers created a trademark guitar sound, which relied heavily on a chorus effect. He explained in 2017 how the sound came about:\n\n<blockquote>\"I created it sort of out of necessity; my mission was 'We\u2019re going to play for two hours each night as a trio,' so I wanted to have this fantastic, coloured guitar sound that was different for every song. So, I used the Echoplex, then a chorus, and a few other pedals\u2026envelope filters. As we went on, I acquired more stuff and got a [[Pete Cornish]] board. But what was driving it was to invade and push the edge of what the guitar was supposed to sound like, and make it really interesting over a show. So, it wasn\u2019t just one straight sound all the time. I could move it around. And it was appreciated by many millions of people (laughs). Of course, it\u2019s very tired and a bit 'retro' now; I\u2019m not very keen on it anymore. But in those days it was new, fresh, and exciting.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/32439/andy-summers/ |title=Andy Summers: Creating Light From Dark |author=Prato, Greg (2017) |work=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]] |accessdate=February 17, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Post-Police===\n[[File:Andy Summers 1989.jpg|thumb|Summers in 1989]]\nSummers' solo career has included recording, touring, composing for films (including ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]'', ''[[Down and Out in Beverly Hills]]'', ''[[The Wild Life (1984 film)|The Wild Life]]'' and ''[[Weekend at Bernie's]]''), and exhibiting his photography in art galleries around the world.\n\nHe recorded the duet albums ''[[I Advance Masked]]'' (1982) and ''Bewitched'' (1984) with guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] of King Crimson, as well as duet albums with Victor Biglione, [[John Etheridge]], and Benjamin Verdery. His solo debut album, ''[[XYZ (Andy Summers album)|XYZ]]'', was released in 1987 and is the only non-instrumental album in his catalogue. Although it included pop material, such as the single \"Love is the Strangest Way\", it failed to dent the charts. In 1987 Sting invited Summers to perform on his second album ''[[...Nothing Like the Sun]]'', a favour the singer returned by playing bass on ''Charming Snakes'' (1990) and later contributing vocals to \"[['Round Midnight (song)|'Round Midnight]]\" on Summers' tribute album to [[Thelonious Monk]], ''Green Chimneys'', in 1999. In the mid-1990s Summers briefly returned to a more rock-oriented sound with ''Synesthesia'' (1995) and ''The Last Dance of Mr X'' (1997) before recording a string of jazz albums. \n\n[[File:AndySummers.jpg|thumb|Summers in 2006]]\n\n===The Police reunion===\n{{Main|The Police Reunion Tour}}\nDuring the 2007 Grammys Award show, the Police appeared, playing \"[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]\" and subsequently announcing that they would be going on tour.

For a brief time in 1968, he was a member of [[the Animals]], then known as [[Eric Burdon]] and the Animals, with whom he recorded one album, ''[[Love Is (The Animals album)|Love Is]]''. The album features a recording of [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]]'s \"Coloured Rain\", which includes a 4{{nbsp}}minute and 15 second guitar solo by Summers. The LP also included a reworked version of Dantalion's Chariot's sole single \"Madman Running Through the Fields\".\n\nAfter five years in Los Angeles, mostly spent studying [[classical guitar]] and composition at [[California State University, Northridge]], he returned to London with his American girlfriend Kate Lunken.\n\nIn London, Summers recorded and toured with acts including [[Kevin Coyne]], [[Jon Lord]], [[Joan Armatrading]], [[David Essex]], [[Neil Sedaka]] and [[Kevin Ayers]]. In October 1975 he participated in an orchestral rendition of [[Mike Oldfield]]'s seminal \"[[Tubular Bells]]\".\n\nIn 1977, Summers was invited by ex-[[Gong (band)|Gong]] bassist [[Mike Howlett]] to join his band [[Strontium 90 (band)|Strontium 90]], but was soon coaxed away by future Police bandmates Sting and Stewart Copeland.\n\n===The Police===\n{{Main|The Police}}\nSummers achieved international fame as the guitarist for [[the Police]], which he joined in 1977, eventually replacing original guitarist [[Henry Padovani]]. Emerging from London's punk scene, the Police gained international renown with many hit songs, including \"[[Message in a Bottle (song)|Message in a Bottle]]\", \"[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]\", \"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\", \"[[Every Breath You Take]]\", and \"[[Every Little Thing She Does is Magic]]\". During his time with the band, Summers twice won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, first in 1979 for \"[[Reggatta de Blanc]]\" (written with Copeland and Sting) and in 1980 for \"[[Behind My Camel]]\".\n\nAlthough Sting was the lead singer of the band, Summers occasionally contributed lead vocals, as in \"Be My Girl/Sally\" (1978), \"Friends\" (1980), \"Mother\" (1983), and \"Someone to Talk To\" (1983). Other notable Summers compositions from this period are \"Omegaman\" (which would have been released as the debut single from the 1981 ''[[Ghost in the Machine (The Police album)|Ghost in the Machine]]'' album had Sting not objected), \"Shambelle\" (1981), \"Once Upon a Daydream\", and \"Murder by Numbers\" both co-written with Sting (both 1983). In early 1984, after seven years together and record sales around eighty million, the Police disbanded.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-0-7119-5302-4|page=25|author=Welch, Chris |year=1996|publisher=Omnibus Press|location=London|title=The complete guide to the music of The Police and Sting}}</ref>\n\nThough not given songwriting credit, Summers wrote the guitar riff for \"Every Breath You Take\". It was recorded in one take with his 1961 [[Fender Stratocaster]] during the ''Synchronicity'' sessions. The song was number one for eight weeks. Sting won the 1983 Grammy Award for Song of the Year, and the Police won Best Pop Performance by a Duo Or Group With Vocal for this song. Summers provides an account of the session in his memoir, ''One Train Later''.<ref name=\"Memoir\">{{cite book |last=Summers |first1=Andy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMDFPefQCHkC&dq |title=One Train Later: A Memoir |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007 |isbn=978-1429909297 |accessdate=29 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAs a member of the Police, Summers created a trademark guitar sound, which relied heavily on a chorus effect. He explained in 2017 how the sound came about:\n\n<blockquote>\"I created it sort of out of necessity; my mission was 'We\u2019re going to play for two hours each night as a trio,' so I wanted to have this fantastic, coloured guitar sound that was different for every song. So, I used the Echoplex, then a chorus, and a few other pedals\u2026envelope filters. As we went on, I acquired more stuff and got a [[Pete Cornish]] board. But what was driving it was to invade and push the edge of what the guitar was supposed to sound like, and make it really interesting over a show. So, it wasn\u2019t just one straight sound all the time. I could move it around. And it was appreciated by many millions of people (laughs). Of course, it\u2019s very tired and a bit 'retro' now; I\u2019m not very keen on it anymore. But in those days it was new, fresh, and exciting.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/32439/andy-summers/ |title=Andy Summers: Creating Light From Dark |author=Prato, Greg (2017) |work=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]] |accessdate=February 17, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Post-Police===\n[[File:Andy Summers 1989.jpg|thumb|Summers in 1989]]\nSummers' solo career has included recording, touring, composing for films (including ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]'', ''[[Down and Out in Beverly Hills]]'', ''[[The Wild Life (1984 film)|The Wild Life]]'' and ''[[Weekend at Bernie's]]''), and exhibiting his photography in art galleries around the world.\n\nHe recorded the duet albums ''[[I Advance Masked]]'' (1982) and ''Bewitched'' (1984) with guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] of King Crimson, as well as duet albums with Victor Biglione, [[John Etheridge]], and Benjamin Verdery. His solo debut album, ''[[XYZ (Andy Summers album)|XYZ]]'', was released in 1987 and is the only non-instrumental album in his catalogue. Although it included pop material, such as the single \"Love is the Strangest Way\", it failed to dent the charts. In 1987 Sting invited Summers to perform on his second album ''[[...Nothing Like the Sun]]'', a favour the singer returned by playing bass on ''Charming Snakes'' (1990) and later contributing vocals to \"[['Round Midnight (song)|'Round Midnight]]\" on Summers' tribute album to [[Thelonious Monk]], ''Green Chimneys'', in 1999. In the mid-1990s Summers briefly returned to a more rock-oriented sound with ''Synesthesia'' (1995) and ''The Last Dance of Mr X'' (1997) before recording a string of jazz albums. \n\n[[File:AndySummers.jpg|thumb|Summers in 2006]]\n\n===The Police reunion===\n{{Main|The Police Reunion Tour}}\nDuring the 2007 Grammys Award show, the Police appeared, playing \"[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]\" and subsequently announcing that they would be going on tour.

He continues to record and tour as a solo artist, and as guitarist with [[Paul Rodgers|The Paul Rodgers Band]] and [[Bad Company]].  He is currently performing in the Las Vegas production of ''[[Raiding the Rock Vault]]''.\n\n==Career==\nHoward received his inspiration to pick up the guitar during the 1960s after seeing [[Dick Dale]], the guitarist in the surf band \"the Del-Tones\", and feeling the excitement from his playing. He studied violin and music theory at the [[Los Angeles City College|City College, Los Angeles]], and also played in a band called The Zoo.\n\nLeese had his first recording contract with [[Ed Cobb]]'s Sunburst label<ref>Not Sunburst Records of Huntsville, Alabama, but a Los Angeles based company.</ref> at the age of 15, as the band ''The Zoo'' with friend and drummer [[Mike Flicker]].  Later, when Flicker went to work for Jack Herschorn at [[Mushroom Studios]] in [[Vancouver]], Leese went with him as a production manager.  While there, he and Shelly Siegel started [[Mushroom Records (Canada)|Mushroom Records]].\n\nIt was at Mushroom Studios in 1974 that Leese helped produce a demo for [[Heart (band)|Heart]].  The next year, Mushroom Records signed Heart and released the group's first album ''[[Dreamboat Annie]]'' which Flicker produced.  Leese was assistant producer on the album, and was asked to join the band later that year. He played with the band until 1998, when the Wilson sisters put the band on hiatus for several years to pursue other projects and devote more time to their personal lives. Leese was Heart's guitarist, backing vocalist, keyboard player (best known for playing the Mini-Moog solo on the hit song \"Magic Man\") and song arranger. Aside from the Wilson sisters, Leese is the longest serving member of Heart.  Even though he left on good terms with the Wilsons, Leese has been vocal about his dislike of more recent versions of Heart indicating in a 2007 interview that the then-current lineup \"stinks\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Itter|first1=Scott|title=Secret Weapon: The Howard Leese Interview|url=http://www.drmusic.org/Howard_Leese__1.html|website=drmusic.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998 he joined the [[Paul Rodgers|Paul Rodgers Band]].

Leese''' (born June 13, 1951 in [[Hollywood]], [[California]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[guitarist]], record producer, and musical director who played with [[Heart (band)|Heart]] as guitarist and keyboardist for 23 years (1975 through 1998). He continues to record and tour as a solo artist, and as guitarist with [[Paul Rodgers|The Paul Rodgers Band]] and [[Bad Company]].  He is currently performing in the Las Vegas production of ''[[Raiding the Rock Vault]]''.\n\n==Career==\nHoward received his inspiration to pick up the guitar during the 1960s after seeing [[Dick Dale]], the guitarist in the surf band \"the Del-Tones\", and feeling the excitement from his playing. He studied violin and music theory at the [[Los Angeles City College|City College, Los Angeles]], and also played in a band called The Zoo.\n\nLeese had his first recording contract with [[Ed Cobb]]'s Sunburst label<ref>Not Sunburst Records of Huntsville, Alabama, but a Los Angeles based company.</ref> at the age of 15, as the band ''The Zoo'' with friend and drummer [[Mike Flicker]].  Later, when Flicker went to work for Jack Herschorn at [[Mushroom Studios]] in [[Vancouver]], Leese went with him as a production manager.  While there, he and Shelly Siegel started [[Mushroom Records (Canada)|Mushroom Records]].\n\nIt was at Mushroom Studios in 1974 that Leese helped produce a demo for [[Heart (band)|Heart]].  The next year, Mushroom Records signed Heart and released the group's first album ''[[Dreamboat Annie]]'' which Flicker produced.  Leese was assistant producer on the album, and was asked to join the band later that year. He played with the band until 1998, when the Wilson sisters put the band on hiatus for several years to pursue other projects and devote more time to their personal lives. Leese was Heart's guitarist, backing vocalist, keyboard player (best known for playing the Mini-Moog solo on the hit song \"Magic Man\") and song arranger. Aside from the Wilson sisters, Leese is the longest serving member of Heart.  Even though he left on good terms with the Wilsons, Leese has been vocal about his dislike of more recent versions of Heart indicating in a 2007 interview that the then-current lineup \"stinks\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Itter|first1=Scott|title=Secret Weapon: The Howard Leese Interview|url=http://www.drmusic.org/Howard_Leese__1.html|website=drmusic.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998 he joined the [[Paul Rodgers|Paul Rodgers Band]].

The invasion was performed because the British government feared that [[Iceland]] would be used by the Germans, who had recently [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|overrun Denmark]], which was in [[personal union]] with Iceland and which had previously been largely responsible for Iceland's foreign policy. The [[Government of Iceland]] issued a protest, charging that its neutrality had been \"flagrantly violated\" and \"its independence infringed\".{{uncited quote|date=May 2019}}\n\nAt the start of the war, the UK imposed strict export controls on Icelandic goods, preventing profitable shipments to Germany, as part of its naval blockade. The UK offered assistance to Iceland, seeking co-operation \"as a belligerent and an ally\",{{uncited quote|date=May 2019}} but [[Reykjav\u00edk]] refused and reaffirmed its neutrality. The German diplomatic presence in Iceland, along with the island's strategic importance, alarmed the UK government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sonic.net/~bstone/history/iceland.shtml |title=Iceland in the Second World War |accessdate=22 June 2008 |last=Stone |first=Bill |year=1998 |publisher=Stone & Stone}}</ref>\n\nAfter failing to persuade the Icelandic government to join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], the UK invaded on the morning of 10 May 1940. The initial force of 746 Royal Marines commanded by Colonel [[Robert Sturges]] disembarked at the capital Reykjav\u00edk. Meeting no resistance, the troops moved quickly to disable communication networks, secure strategic locations, and arrest German citizens. Requisitioning local transport, the troops moved to [[Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]], [[Kalda\u00f0arnes]], [[Sandskei\u00f0]], and [[Akranes]] to secure potential landing areas against the possibility of a German counterattack.\n\n== Invasion ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Further|Iceland during World War II}}\n{{History of Iceland}}\nDuring 1918, after a long period of Danish rule, Iceland had become an independent state in [[personal union]] with the Danish king and with common foreign affairs.{{sfn|Karlsson|2000|p=283}} The newly initiated [[Kingdom of Iceland]] declared itself a [[neutral country]] without a defence force.{{sfn|Karlsson|2000|p=283}} The treaty of union allowed for a revision to begin during 1941 and for unilateral termination three years after that, if no agreement was made.{{sfn|Karlsson|2000|p=283}} By 1928, all Icelandic political parties were in agreement that the union treaty would be terminated as soon as possible.{{sfn|Karlsson|2000|p=319}}\n\nOn 9 April 1940, German forces began [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], invading both Norway and Denmark. Denmark was subdued within a day and [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied]]. On the same day, the British government sent a message to the Icelandic government, stating that the UK was willing to assist Iceland in maintaining its independence but would require facilities in Iceland to do so. Iceland was invited to join the UK in the war \"as a belligerent and an ally.\" The Icelandic government rejected the offer.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=34}} On the next day, 10 April, the Icelandic parliament, the [[Al\u00feingi]] (or Althing), declared Danish King [[Christian X]] unable to perform his constitutional duties and assigned them to the government of Iceland, along with all other responsibilities previously performed by Denmark on behalf of Iceland.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=272}}\n\nWith [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II|Operation Valentine]] on 12 April 1940, the British occupied the [[Faroe Islands]]. After the German invasion of Denmark and Norway, the British government became increasingly concerned that Germany would soon try to establish a military presence in Iceland. They felt that this would constitute an intolerable threat to British control of the North [[Atlantic]]. Just as importantly, the British were eager to obtain bases in Iceland for themselves to strengthen their [[Northern Patrol]].{{sfn|Bittner|1983|pp=33\u201334}}\n\n=== Planning ===\nAs the military situation in Norway deteriorated, the [[Admiralty]] came to the conclusion that the UK could no longer do without bases in Iceland. On 6 May, [[Winston Churchill]] presented the case to the [[War Cabinet#Second World War|War Cabinet]]. Churchill maintained that if further negotiations with the Icelandic government were attempted, the Germans might learn of them and act first. A surer and more effective solution was to land troops unannounced and present the Icelandic government with a ''[[:wikt:fait accompli|fait accompli]]''. The War Cabinet approved the plan.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=38}}\n\nThe expedition was organised hastily and haphazardly.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=40}} Much of the operational planning was conducted en route. The force was supplied with few maps, most of poor quality, with one of them having been drawn from memory. No one of the expedition was fully fluent with the [[Icelandic language]].{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=363}}\n\nThe British planned to land all of their forces at Reykjav\u00edk. There, they would overcome any resistance and defeat local Germans.{{cn|date=December 2019}} To guard against a German counterattack by sea, they would secure the harbour and send troops by land to nearby [[Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]]. The British were also worried that the Germans might airlift troops, as they had done with great success in their [[Norwegian Campaign]]. To guard against this, troops would drive east to the landing grounds at [[Sandskei\u00f0]] and [[Kalda\u00f0arnes]]. Lastly, troops would be sent by land to the harbour at [[Akureyri]] and the landing ground at Melger\u00f0i in the north of the country.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=353}}\n\nThe UK [[Naval Intelligence Division]] (NID) expected resistance from three possible sources. Local Germans, who were thought to have some arms, might resist or even attempt some sort of coup. In addition, a German invasion force might already be prepared or begun immediately after the British landings. The NID also expected resistance from the Reykjav\u00edk police, consisting of some [[Military history of Iceland#Independent Iceland|60 armed men]]. If by chance a Danish patrol vessel were present in Reykjav\u00edk, the Danish sailors might assist the defenders.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=354}}{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=36}} This concern was needless, as the only Danish naval vessels abroad were in [[Greenland in World War II|Greenland]].<ref name=NSP>{{cite web |url=http://www.navalhistory.dk/English/History/1939_1945/us_safari.htm |title=The Big Scuttle \u2013 August 29, 1943 |first=S\u00f8ren |last=N\u00f8rby |website=Naval History.dk |year=2015 |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Operation Fork ===\n\n==== Force Sturges ====\n[[File:Christian X of Denmark.jpg|thumb|King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] was said by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' to be \"less unpopular in Iceland than any other Danish sovereign has ever been\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Iceland: Nobody's Baby|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=22 April 1940|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763855,00.html}}</ref>]]\nOn 3 May 1940, the [[43 Commando|2nd Royal Marine Battalion]] in [[Bisley, Surrey]] received orders from London to be ready to move at two hours' notice for an unknown destination. The battalion had been activated only the month before. Though there was a nucleus of active service officers, the troops were new recruits and only partially trained.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=41}} There was a shortage of weapons, which consisted only of rifles, pistols, and bayonets, while 50 of the marines had only just received their rifles and had not had a chance to fire them. On 4 May, the battalion received some modest additional equipment in the form of [[Bren light machine gun]]s, [[anti-tank gun]]s, and [[2-inch mortar]]s. With no time to spare, zeroing of the weapons and initial familiarisation shooting would have to be conducted at sea.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=42}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=352}}\n\nAssisting arms provided to the force consisted of two [[3.7 inch Mountain Howitzer|3.7 inch mountain howitzers]], four [[QF 2 pounder naval gun]]s, and two 4-inch coastal defence guns.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=42}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=352}} The guns were manned by troops from the artillery divisions of the Navy and the marines, none of whom had ever fired them.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=42}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=352}} They lacked searchlights, communication equipment, and gun directors.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=42}}\n\nColonel [[Robert Sturges]] was assigned to command the force. Aged 49, he was a highly regarded veteran of [[World War I]], having fought in the [[battle of Gallipoli]] and the [[battle of Jutland]].{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=352}} He was accompanied by a small intelligence detachment commanded by Major Humphrey Quill and a diplomatic mission managed by [[Charles Howard Smith]].{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=41}} Excluding those, the invasion force consisted of 746 troops.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=305}}\n\n==== Journey to Iceland ====\n[[File:HMS Berwick (65).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Berwick|65|6}} was the command ship of the operation]]\nOn 6 May, Force Sturges boarded trains for [[Greenock]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]]. To avoid drawing attention to itself, the force was divided into two different trains for the journey,{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=361}} but due to delays in rail travel, the troops arrived at the railway station in Greenock about the same time, losing the small degree of anonymity desired.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=361}} Additionally, security had been compromised by a dispatch [[Cleartext|uncoded]] and by the time the troops arrived in Greenock, many people{{who|date=May 2018}} knew that the destination was Iceland.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=41}}\n\nOn the morning of 7 May, the force headed to the harbour in Greenock, where they found the cruisers {{HMS|Berwick|65|2}} and {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|2}}, intended to take them to Iceland.

The acting chief of police, Einar Arnalds, surmised that it most likely originated from a British warship bringing the expected new ambassador.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=17}} This was correct, though it was not the whole story.\n\nWerner Gerlach, the German consul, was also alerted to the aircraft. Suspecting what was about to happen, he drove down to the harbour with a German associate.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|pp=380\u2013384}} With the use of binoculars, he confirmed his fears and then hurried back.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=11}} At home, he arranged for the burning of his documents and tried unsuccessfully to reach the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland|Icelandic foreign minister]] by telephone.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=30\u201332}}\n\n==== Down at the harbour ====\nAt 03:40, an Icelandic policeman saw a small fleet of warships approaching the harbour, but could not discern their nationality. He notified his superior, who notified Einar Arnalds, the acting chief of police.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=15\u201317}} The laws of neutrality to which Iceland had committed forbade more than three warships from a belligerent nation from making use of a neutral harbour at the same time. Any aeroplanes from such ships were forbidden from flying over neutral territorial waters.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=17}} Seeing that the approaching fleet was about to violate Icelandic neutrality in two ways, Arnalds began to investigate.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=17}} Down at the harbour, he viewed the ships for himself and decided they were probably British. He contacted the foreign ministry, which confirmed that he should go out to the fleet and announce to its commander that he was in violation of Icelandic neutrality.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=22\u201323}} Customs officers were ordered to prepare a boat.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nMeanwhile, marines on ''Berwick'' were being ordered aboard ''Fearless'', which would take them to the harbour. The seasickness and inexperience of the troops were causing delays and the officers were becoming frustrated.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=88}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=10}} Just before five o'clock in the morning, ''Fearless'', loaded with about 400 marines, began moving toward the harbour.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=24\u201325}} A small crowd had assembled, including several policemen still waiting for the customs boat. The British consul had received advance notice of the invasion and was waiting with his associates to assist the troops when they arrived. Uncomfortable with the crowd, Consul Shepherd turned to the Icelandic police. \"Would you mind ... getting the crowd to stand back a bit, so that the soldiers can get off the destroyer?\" he asked. \"Certainly,\" came the reply.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe ''Fearless'' started disembarking immediately once it docked.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=25}} Arnalds asked to speak with the captain of the destroyer, but was refused.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=28}} He then hastened to report to the Prime Minister, who ordered him not to interfere with the British troops and to try to prevent conflicts between them and Icelanders.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=28}} Down at the harbour, some of the locals protested against the arrival of the British. One Icelander snatched a rifle from a marine and stuffed a cigarette in it. He then threw it back to the marine and told him to be careful with it. An officer arrived to scold the marine.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=27}}\n\n==== Operations in Reykjav\u00edk ====\nThe British forces began their operations in Reykjav\u00edk by posting a guard at the post office and attaching a flyer to the door.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=33}} The flyer explained in broken Icelandic that British forces were occupying the city and asked for co-operation in dealing with local Germans.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=34}} The offices of [[S\u00edminn]] (telecommunication service), [[R\u00daV]] (broadcasting service), and the Meteorological Office were quickly occupied by the British to prevent news of the invasion from reaching Berlin.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=35}}\n\nMeanwhile, high priority was assigned to the capture of the German consulate. Arriving at the consulate, the British troops were relieved to find no sign of resistance and simply knocked on the door. Consul Gerlach opened, protested against the invasion, and reminded the British that Iceland was a neutral country. He was reminded, in turn, that Denmark had also been a neutral country.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=39}} The British discovered a fire upstairs in the building and found a pile of documents burning in the consul's bathtub. They extinguished the fire and salvaged a substantial number of records.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=43}}\n\nThe British had also expected resistance from the crew of ''Bahia Blanca'', a German freighter which had hit an iceberg in the [[Denmark Strait]] and whose 62-man crew had been rescued by an Icelandic trawler. The Naval Intelligence Division believed the Germans were actually reserve crews for the German submarines they thought were operating out of Iceland.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=356}} The unarmed Germans were captured without incident.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=47}}\n\n== Outcome ==\n{{main|Occupation of Iceland}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[File:Icelandic Army 1940.png|thumb|Icelandic police officers undergoing firearms instruction in 1940]]\n\nOn the evening of 10 May, the [[government of Iceland]] issued a protest, charging that its neutrality had been \"flagrantly violated\" and \"its independence infringed\", noting that compensation would be expected for all damage done. The British promised compensation, favourable business agreements, non-interference in Icelandic affairs, and the withdrawal of all forces at the end of the war. In the following days, air defence equipment was deployed in Reykjav\u00edk and a detachment of troops sent to [[Akureyri]]. However, the initial invasion force was ill-equipped, only partially trained and insufficient to the task of occupation and defence of the island.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=41}}\n\nOn 17 May, 4,000 additional troops of the [[Canadian Army]] arrived to relieve the marines. In July, elements of the [[2nd Canadian Division]] and [[3rd Canadian Division]] were landed. Commonwealth occupation forces eventually totalled 25,000 infantry with elements from the [[Royal Air Force]], Royal Navy and [[Royal Canadian Navy]].{{sfn|Fairchild|2000|pp=73\u201397}} One year after the invasion, forces from the still officially neutral United States were stationed on the island by agreement with the Icelandic government, relieving the bulk of British ground forces. U.S. forces grew considerably after the US joined the war on 7 December 1941, reaching as many as 30,000 army, navy and air force personnel at any one time. The RAF and RCAF continued to operate from two [[Royal Air Force station]]s through to the end of the war.\n\nThe UK invaded to forestall a German occupation, to provide a base for naval and air patrols, and to protect merchant shipping lanes from North America to Europe. In this the invasion was successful. However, the presence of British, Canadian, and US troops had a lasting impact on the country. Foreign troop numbers in some years equalled 25 percent of the population or almost 50 percent of the native male population. Icelanders were and remain divided about the war and occupation&nbsp;\u2013 what is sometimes referred to as \"blessa\u00f0 str\u00ed\u00f0i\u00f0\" or \"the Blessed War\". Some point to the subsequent economic revival, others to loss of sovereignty and social upheaval.\n\nThe occupation required the building of a network of roads, hospitals, harbours, airfields and bridges across the country, and this did have an enormous positive economic impact. However, the Icelanders severely censured the sexual relationships between troops and local women, which were causing considerable controversy and political turmoil.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Women were often accused of prostitution and of being traitors. Two-hundred and fifty-five children were born from these [[\u00c1standi\u00f0|liaisons]], the {{lang-is|\u00e1standsb\u00f6rn|lit=children of the situation|label=none}}.\n\nIn 1941, the Icelandic Minister of the Judiciary investigated \"The Situation\", and the police tracked 500+ women who had been having sex with the soldiers.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Many were upset that the foreign troops were \"taking away\" women, friends, and family. During 1942 two facilities opened to house such women who had relations with the soldiers. Both closed within a year, after investigations determined that most liaisons were consensual. About 332 Icelandic women married foreign soldiers.\n\nDuring the occupation, on 17 June 1944, Iceland declared itself a republic. The [[Keflav\u00edk Agreement]] signed during 1946 between the US and the Republic of Iceland stipulated that the American army would leave the country within six months, and Iceland would take possession of the Keflav\u00edk Airport. This did not happen for decades, and a substantial US military presence remained in Iceland until 30 September 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icelandicroots.com/post/2014/11/11/the-occupation-of-iceland-during-world-war-ii/|title=The Occupation of Iceland During World War II|last=|first=|date=November 11, 2014|website=Icelandic Roots|publisher=Icelandic Roots|access-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref> At the end of hostilities most British facilities were given to the Icelandic government.\n\nAlthough the British action was to forestall any risk of a German invasion, there is no evidence that the Germans had an invasion planned.

In a postwar interview, [[Walter Warlimont]] claimed that \"Hitler definitely was interested in occupying Iceland prior to [British] occupation.

The invasion was performed because the British government feared that [[Iceland]] would be used by the Germans, who had recently [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|overrun Denmark]], which was in [[personal union]] with Iceland and which had previously been largely responsible for Iceland's foreign policy. The [[Government of Iceland]] issued a protest, charging that its neutrality had been \"flagrantly violated\" and \"its independence infringed\".{{uncited quote|date=May 2019}}\n\nAt the start of the war, the UK imposed strict export controls on Icelandic goods, preventing profitable shipments to Germany, as part of its naval blockade. The UK offered assistance to Iceland, seeking co-operation \"as a belligerent and an ally\",{{uncited quote|date=May 2019}} but [[Reykjav\u00edk]] refused and reaffirmed its neutrality. The German diplomatic presence in Iceland, along with the island's strategic importance, alarmed the UK government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sonic.net/~bstone/history/iceland.shtml |title=Iceland in the Second World War |accessdate=22 June 2008 |last=Stone |first=Bill |year=1998 |publisher=Stone & Stone}}</ref>\n\nAfter failing to persuade the Icelandic government to join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], the UK invaded on the morning of 10 May 1940. The initial force of 746 Royal Marines commanded by Colonel [[Robert Sturges]] disembarked at the capital Reykjav\u00edk. Meeting no resistance, the troops moved quickly to disable communication networks, secure strategic locations, and arrest German citizens. Requisitioning local transport, the troops moved to [[Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]], [[Kalda\u00f0arnes]], [[Sandskei\u00f0]], and [[Akranes]] to secure potential landing areas against the possibility of a German counterattack.\n\n== Invasion ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Further|Iceland during World War II}}\n{{History of Iceland}}\nDuring 1918, after a long period of Danish rule, Iceland had become an independent state in [[personal union]] with the Danish king and with common foreign affairs.{{sfn|Karlsson|2000|p=283}} The newly initiated [[Kingdom of Iceland]] declared itself a [[neutral country]] without a defence force.{{sfn|Karlsson|2000|p=283}} The treaty of union allowed for a revision to begin during 1941 and for unilateral termination three years after that, if no agreement was made.{{sfn|Karlsson|2000|p=283}} By 1928, all Icelandic political parties were in agreement that the union treaty would be terminated as soon as possible.{{sfn|Karlsson|2000|p=319}}\n\nOn 9 April 1940, German forces began [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], invading both Norway and Denmark. Denmark was subdued within a day and [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied]]. On the same day, the British government sent a message to the Icelandic government, stating that the UK was willing to assist Iceland in maintaining its independence but would require facilities in Iceland to do so. Iceland was invited to join the UK in the war \"as a belligerent and an ally.\" The Icelandic government rejected the offer.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=34}} On the next day, 10 April, the Icelandic parliament, the [[Al\u00feingi]] (or Althing), declared Danish King [[Christian X]] unable to perform his constitutional duties and assigned them to the government of Iceland, along with all other responsibilities previously performed by Denmark on behalf of Iceland.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=272}}\n\nWith [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II|Operation Valentine]] on 12 April 1940, the British occupied the [[Faroe Islands]]. After the German invasion of Denmark and Norway, the British government became increasingly concerned that Germany would soon try to establish a military presence in Iceland. They felt that this would constitute an intolerable threat to British control of the North [[Atlantic]]. Just as importantly, the British were eager to obtain bases in Iceland for themselves to strengthen their [[Northern Patrol]].{{sfn|Bittner|1983|pp=33\u201334}}\n\n=== Planning ===\nAs the military situation in Norway deteriorated, the [[Admiralty]] came to the conclusion that the UK could no longer do without bases in Iceland. On 6 May, [[Winston Churchill]] presented the case to the [[War Cabinet#Second World War|War Cabinet]]. Churchill maintained that if further negotiations with the Icelandic government were attempted, the Germans might learn of them and act first. A surer and more effective solution was to land troops unannounced and present the Icelandic government with a ''[[:wikt:fait accompli|fait accompli]]''. The War Cabinet approved the plan.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=38}}\n\nThe expedition was organised hastily and haphazardly.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=40}} Much of the operational planning was conducted en route. The force was supplied with few maps, most of poor quality, with one of them having been drawn from memory. No one of the expedition was fully fluent with the [[Icelandic language]].{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=363}}\n\nThe British planned to land all of their forces at Reykjav\u00edk. There, they would overcome any resistance and defeat local Germans.{{cn|date=December 2019}} To guard against a German counterattack by sea, they would secure the harbour and send troops by land to nearby [[Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]]. The British were also worried that the Germans might airlift troops, as they had done with great success in their [[Norwegian Campaign]]. To guard against this, troops would drive east to the landing grounds at [[Sandskei\u00f0]] and [[Kalda\u00f0arnes]]. Lastly, troops would be sent by land to the harbour at [[Akureyri]] and the landing ground at Melger\u00f0i in the north of the country.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=353}}\n\nThe UK [[Naval Intelligence Division]] (NID) expected resistance from three possible sources. Local Germans, who were thought to have some arms, might resist or even attempt some sort of coup. In addition, a German invasion force might already be prepared or begun immediately after the British landings. The NID also expected resistance from the Reykjav\u00edk police, consisting of some [[Military history of Iceland#Independent Iceland|60 armed men]].

To avoid drawing attention to itself, the force was divided into two different trains for the journey,{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=361}} but due to delays in rail travel, the troops arrived at the railway station in Greenock about the same time, losing the small degree of anonymity desired.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=361}} Additionally, security had been compromised by a dispatch [[Cleartext|uncoded]] and by the time the troops arrived in Greenock, many people{{who|date=May 2018}} knew that the destination was Iceland.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=41}}\n\nOn the morning of 7 May, the force headed to the harbour in Greenock, where they found the cruisers {{HMS|Berwick|65|2}} and {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|2}}, intended to take them to Iceland. Boarding commenced but was fraught with problems and delays. Departure was delayed until 8 May, and even then a large amount of equipment and supplies had to be left on the piers.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=42}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=362}}\n\nAt 04:00 on 8 May, the cruisers departed for Iceland.

The cruisers were not designed to transport a force of the size assigned to them, and conditions were cramped.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=363}} Despite reasonably good weather, many of the marines developed severe [[seasickness]].

The acting chief of police, Einar Arnalds, surmised that it most likely originated from a British warship bringing the expected new ambassador.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=17}} This was correct, though it was not the whole story.\n\nWerner Gerlach, the German consul, was also alerted to the aircraft. Suspecting what was about to happen, he drove down to the harbour with a German associate.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|pp=380\u2013384}} With the use of binoculars, he confirmed his fears and then hurried back.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=11}} At home, he arranged for the burning of his documents and tried unsuccessfully to reach the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland|Icelandic foreign minister]] by telephone.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=30\u201332}}\n\n==== Down at the harbour ====\nAt 03:40, an Icelandic policeman saw a small fleet of warships approaching the harbour, but could not discern their nationality. He notified his superior, who notified Einar Arnalds, the acting chief of police.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=15\u201317}} The laws of neutrality to which Iceland had committed forbade more than three warships from a belligerent nation from making use of a neutral harbour at the same time. Any aeroplanes from such ships were forbidden from flying over neutral territorial waters.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=17}} Seeing that the approaching fleet was about to violate Icelandic neutrality in two ways, Arnalds began to investigate.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=17}} Down at the harbour, he viewed the ships for himself and decided they were probably British. He contacted the foreign ministry, which confirmed that he should go out to the fleet and announce to its commander that he was in violation of Icelandic neutrality.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=22\u201323}} Customs officers were ordered to prepare a boat.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nMeanwhile, marines on ''Berwick'' were being ordered aboard ''Fearless'', which would take them to the harbour. The seasickness and inexperience of the troops were causing delays and the officers were becoming frustrated.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=88}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=10}} Just before five o'clock in the morning, ''Fearless'', loaded with about 400 marines, began moving toward the harbour.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=24\u201325}} A small crowd had assembled, including several policemen still waiting for the customs boat. The British consul had received advance notice of the invasion and was waiting with his associates to assist the troops when they arrived. Uncomfortable with the crowd, Consul Shepherd turned to the Icelandic police. \"Would you mind ... getting the crowd to stand back a bit, so that the soldiers can get off the destroyer?\" he asked. \"Certainly,\" came the reply.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe ''Fearless'' started disembarking immediately once it docked.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=25}} Arnalds asked to speak with the captain of the destroyer, but was refused.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=28}} He then hastened to report to the Prime Minister, who ordered him not to interfere with the British troops and to try to prevent conflicts between them and Icelanders.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=28}} Down at the harbour, some of the locals protested against the arrival of the British. One Icelander snatched a rifle from a marine and stuffed a cigarette in it. He then threw it back to the marine and told him to be careful with it. An officer arrived to scold the marine.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=27}}\n\n==== Operations in Reykjav\u00edk ====\nThe British forces began their operations in Reykjav\u00edk by posting a guard at the post office and attaching a flyer to the door.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=33}} The flyer explained in broken Icelandic that British forces were occupying the city and asked for co-operation in dealing with local Germans.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=34}} The offices of [[S\u00edminn]] (telecommunication service), [[R\u00daV]] (broadcasting service), and the Meteorological Office were quickly occupied by the British to prevent news of the invasion from reaching Berlin.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=35}}\n\nMeanwhile, high priority was assigned to the capture of the German consulate. Arriving at the consulate, the British troops were relieved to find no sign of resistance and simply knocked on the door. Consul Gerlach opened, protested against the invasion, and reminded the British that Iceland was a neutral country. He was reminded, in turn, that Denmark had also been a neutral country.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=39}} The British discovered a fire upstairs in the building and found a pile of documents burning in the consul's bathtub. They extinguished the fire and salvaged a substantial number of records.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=43}}\n\nThe British had also expected resistance from the crew of ''Bahia Blanca'', a German freighter which had hit an iceberg in the [[Denmark Strait]] and whose 62-man crew had been rescued by an Icelandic trawler. The Naval Intelligence Division believed the Germans were actually reserve crews for the German submarines they thought were operating out of Iceland.{{sfn|Whitehead|1995|p=356}} The unarmed Germans were captured without incident.{{sfn|Whitehead|1999|p=47}}\n\n== Outcome ==\n{{main|Occupation of Iceland}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[File:Icelandic Army 1940.png|thumb|Icelandic police officers undergoing firearms instruction in 1940]]\n\nOn the evening of 10 May, the [[government of Iceland]] issued a protest, charging that its neutrality had been \"flagrantly violated\" and \"its independence infringed\", noting that compensation would be expected for all damage done. The British promised compensation, favourable business agreements, non-interference in Icelandic affairs, and the withdrawal of all forces at the end of the war. In the following days, air defence equipment was deployed in Reykjav\u00edk and a detachment of troops sent to [[Akureyri]]. However, the initial invasion force was ill-equipped, only partially trained and insufficient to the task of occupation and defence of the island.{{sfn|Bittner|1983|p=41}}\n\nOn 17 May, 4,000 additional troops of the [[Canadian Army]] arrived to relieve the marines. In July, elements of the [[2nd Canadian Division]] and [[3rd Canadian Division]] were landed. Commonwealth occupation forces eventually totalled 25,000 infantry with elements from the [[Royal Air Force]], Royal Navy and [[Royal Canadian Navy]].{{sfn|Fairchild|2000|pp=73\u201397}} One year after the invasion, forces from the still officially neutral United States were stationed on the island by agreement with the Icelandic government, relieving the bulk of British ground forces. U.S. forces grew considerably after the US joined the war on 7 December 1941, reaching as many as 30,000 army, navy and air force personnel at any one time. The RAF and RCAF continued to operate from two [[Royal Air Force station]]s through to the end of the war.\n\nThe UK invaded to forestall a German occupation, to provide a base for naval and air patrols, and to protect merchant shipping lanes from North America to Europe. In this the invasion was successful. However, the presence of British, Canadian, and US troops had a lasting impact on the country. Foreign troop numbers in some years equalled 25 percent of the population or almost 50 percent of the native male population. Icelanders were and remain divided about the war and occupation&nbsp;\u2013 what is sometimes referred to as \"blessa\u00f0 str\u00ed\u00f0i\u00f0\" or \"the Blessed War\". Some point to the subsequent economic revival, others to loss of sovereignty and social upheaval.\n\nThe occupation required the building of a network of roads, hospitals, harbours, airfields and bridges across the country, and this did have an enormous positive economic impact. However, the Icelanders severely censured the sexual relationships between troops and local women, which were causing considerable controversy and political turmoil.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Women were often accused of prostitution and of being traitors. Two-hundred and fifty-five children were born from these [[\u00c1standi\u00f0|liaisons]], the {{lang-is|\u00e1standsb\u00f6rn|lit=children of the situation|label=none}}.\n\nIn 1941, the Icelandic Minister of the Judiciary investigated \"The Situation\", and the police tracked 500+ women who had been having sex with the soldiers.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Many were upset that the foreign troops were \"taking away\" women, friends, and family. During 1942 two facilities opened to house such women who had relations with the soldiers. Both closed within a year, after investigations determined that most liaisons were consensual. About 332 Icelandic women married foreign soldiers.\n\nDuring the occupation, on 17 June 1944, Iceland declared itself a republic. The [[Keflav\u00edk Agreement]] signed during 1946 between the US and the Republic of Iceland stipulated that the American army would leave the country within six months, and Iceland would take possession of the Keflav\u00edk Airport. This did not happen for decades, and a substantial US military presence remained in Iceland until 30 September 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icelandicroots.com/post/2014/11/11/the-occupation-of-iceland-during-world-war-ii/|title=The Occupation of Iceland During World War II|last=|first=|date=November 11, 2014|website=Icelandic Roots|publisher=Icelandic Roots|access-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref> At the end of hostilities most British facilities were given to the Icelandic government.\n\nAlthough the British action was to forestall any risk of a German invasion, there is no evidence that the Germans had an invasion planned. There was, however, German ''interest'' in seizing Iceland. In a postwar interview, [[Walter Warlimont]] claimed that \"Hitler definitely was interested in occupying Iceland prior to [British] occupation.

In this connection, \"Kaliaganj\", nearest city to Raiganj, comes from \"Kalia\" meaning \"Krishna\", the central character of [[Mahabharata]]. \n\n==Geography==\n{{OSM Location map\n| width=350| height=400| zoom=9\n| coord={{coord|25|55|33|N|88|11|50|E}}| float=left|caption='''Cities and towns in the Uttar Dinajpur district'''<br/>M: municipal city/ town, CT: census town, R: rural/ urban centre, T: tourist centre <br/>Owing to space constraints in the small map, the actual locations in a larger map may vary slightly\n|mark-coord1={{coord|26|14|12|N|88|11|0|E}} | label-pos1=right|label1=Islampur | numbered1=M| mark-title1= [[Islampur, Uttar Dinajpur]] (M)|label-color1=#800000 |label-size1=13| mark-size1=14|shape1=l-circle|shape-color1=#800000|shape-outline1=white|label-offset-x1=2\n|mark-coord2= {{coord|25|37|25|N|88|7|12|E}} | label-pos2=right|label2=Raiganj| numbered2=M| mark-title2= [[Raiganj]] (M)|shape-color2=black| label-size2=14|label-color2=black <!-- make the subject of the article stand out with black colors --> \n|mark-coord3={{coord|25|37|48|N|88|19|12|E}} | label-pos3=bottom|label3=Kaliaganj| numbered3=M| mark-title3= [[Kaliaganj]] (M)\n|mark-coord4={{coord|25|53|33|N|87|50|20|E}} | label-pos4=right|label4=Dalkhola| numbered4=M| mark-title4= [[Dalkhola]] (M)\n|mark-coord5={{coord|26|22|23|N|88|18|27|E}} | label-pos5=right|label5=Chopra | numbered5=CT| mark-title5= [[Chopra, Uttar Dinajpur]] (CT)|shape-color5=#A40000\n|mark-coord6={{coord|26|8|57|N|88|2|12|E}} | label-pos6=right|label6=Hanskunda | numbered6=CT| mark-title6= [[Hanskunda]] (CT)|shape-color6=#A40000\n|mark-coord7={{coord|26|6|30|N|88|8|33|E}} | label-pos7=right|label7=Goalpokhar| numbered7=R| mark-title7= [[Goalpokhar]] (R)| shape-color7=#C42222\n|mark-coord8={{coord|26|1|16|N|87|57|9|E}} | label-pos8=right|label8=Chakulia| numbered8=R| mark-title8= [[Chakulia, Uttar Dinajpur]] (R)| shape-color8=#C42222\n|mark-coord9={{coord|25|50|3|N|87|55|6|E}} | label-pos9=right|label9=Karandighi| numbered9=R| mark-title9= [[Karandighi, Uttar Dinajpur]] (R)| shape-color9=#C42222\n|mark-coord10={{coord|25|39|56|N|88|13|14|E}} | label-pos10=right|label10=Hemtabad| numbered10=R| mark-title10= [[Hemtabad, Uttar Dinajpur]] (R)| shape-color10=#C42222\n|mark-coord11={{coord|25|35|56|N|88|6|0|E}} | label-pos11=left|label11=Nachhratpur|labela11= Katabari | numbered11=CT| mark-title11= [[Nachhratpur Katabari]] (CT)|shape-color11=#A40000\n|mark-coord12={{coord|25|34|8|N|88|6|43|E}} | label-pos12=bottom|label12=Kasba | numbered12=CT| mark-title12= [[Kasba, Uttar Dinajpur]] (CT)|shape-color12=#A40000\n|mark-coord13={{coord|25|27|31|N|88|10|20|E}} | label-pos13=right|label13=Itahar | numbered13=CT| mark-title13= [[Itahar, Uttar Dinajpur]] (CT)|shape-color13=#A40000\n|mark-coord14={{coord|25|38|38|N|88|26|22|E}} | label-pos14=right|label14=Radhikapur|labela14=checkpoint| numbered14=R| mark-title14= [[Radhikapur]] (R)| shape-color14=#C42222\n|mark-coord15={{coord|25|39|13|N|88|6|15|E}} | label-pos15=top|label15=Raiganj|labela15=Wildlife Sanctuary| numbered15=T|shape-color15=green| mark-title15= [[Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary]] (T) \n|mark-coord16={{coord|25.9613|88.0524}}| label16=India| label-color16 = black| label-angle16=-70| label-pos16=bottom| label-size16=10| mark-size16=0| mark-title16 =none      \n|mark-coord17={{coord|25.9513|88.1224}}| label17=Bangladesh| label-color17 = black| label-angle17=-70| label-pos17=bottom| label-size17=10| mark-size17=0| mark-title17 =none  \n|mark-coord18={{coord|25.7273|87.9392}}| label18=Bihar| label-color18 = black| label-angle18=40| label-pos18=bottom| label-size18=10| mark-size18=0| mark-title18 =none      \n|mark-coord19={{coord|25.7773|88.0162}}| label19=West | labela19= Bengal| label-color19 = black| label-angle19=40| label-pos19=bottom| label-size19=10| mark-size19=0| mark-title19 =none \n|mark-coord20={{coord|26.2554|88.0234}}| label20=Mahananda River| label-color20 = #77A1CB| label-angle20=-40| label-pos20=top| label-size20=10| mark-size20=0| mark-title20 =none       \n}}\n\n===Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary===\nRaiganj is known for [[Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary]] (also called the Kulik bird sanctuary), home to a large population of [[Asian openbill]]s and other waterbirds and it is the largest bird sanctuary in Asia.

But, in course of time, navigability of Kulik river decreased and business through the waterway was stopped in the first half of the 1970s, especially after the dam was erected to prevent floods.

Local birds like dove, bulbul, sparrow, king fisher, woodpeckers, owl, duck & cuckoo, can also be seen in large numbers. The migratory birds arrive from end of May to Ist week of July and depart from mid December to end of January. The nesting time is from July to August & egg laying from August to September. The flying training to the young ones is the best time to observe the birds, around October to November. Every winter nearly 150 different bird species arrive here from the north in numbers ranging from 65,000 to 75,000. Some of the common migratory birds seen here are Open-Billed Storks, Asian Open-billed storks, Egrets, Knight Herons, and Cormorants. Indian birds like kites, flycatchers, kingfishers, owls, woodpeckers, drongos, and bee eaters. The sanctuary has artificial network of man made canals which is connected to the River Kulik. During the months of monsoon the flood water from the river enters the plains of the sanctuary.

Mr.Sandip Biswas of the All India Trinamool Congress is the current chairman of the ongoing board.\nRaiganj is not really the district headquarters though we term the town as the headquarters of North Dinajpur. The administrative buildings are located at Karnajora - a gram panchayat area five kilometres from Raiganj town. All along, Raiganj was developed in a scattered manner. When West Dinajpur existed, this side was deprived since the district headquarters was in Balurghat.<ref>http://www.raiganjonline.in/city-guide/administration-in-raiganj</ref>\n<ref>http://www.raiganjmunicipality.com/administration/#.W2PtHtUzbIU</ref>\n===Raiganj Bhavan===\nIn year 2008 23 March, The Union I&B and Parliamentary affairs minister Mr Priyaranjan Dasmunshi inaugurated the newly constructed Raiganj Bhawan in Kolkata(Kasba area).{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Raiganj Ram Krishna Ashram.jpg|thumb|right|Raiganj Ram Krishna Ashram]]\n[[File:Kali Puja at Netaji Pathagar.jpg|thumb|Kali Puja at Netaji Pathagar]]\n[[File:Sudarshanpur Durga Puja.jpg|thumb|Sudarshanpur Durga Puja]]\n*Local Dances: Khan dance, Natua, Jang Gan, Mokha Dance and Halna Halnani dances Bhogta dances\n*Handicrafts: Terracota and jute decorative articles\n*\n\n==Media==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n*'''Newspaper''': Newspapers in Raiganj include English language dailies, ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'' and ''[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]'', which are printed in [[Siliguri]], and ''[[The Hindustan Times]]'' Hitvada and the ''[[Times of India]]'', which are printed in [[Kolkata]] and received after a day's delay.

There is a debate about the origin of the name. Some say the name is linked to the royal family of Dinajpur whose surname was Rai. The widely accepted view is that the name originated from the abundance of rai sorshe (a special type of mustard) corps at this place from time immemorial.\n<ref>http://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/once-upon-a-time/story-y2YcMKtTbufxxbbjMsw23J.html</ref>Moreover a considerable number of people think that the word \"Raiganj\" came from \"Rai\" meaning \"[[Radha]]\", the consort of [[Krishna]]. In this connection, \"Kaliaganj\", nearest city to Raiganj, comes from \"Kalia\" meaning \"Krishna\", the central character of [[Mahabharata]]. \n\n==Geography==\n{{OSM Location map\n| width=350| height=400| zoom=9\n| coord={{coord|25|55|33|N|88|11|50|E}}| float=left|caption='''Cities and towns in the Uttar Dinajpur district'''<br/>M: municipal city/ town, CT: census town, R: rural/ urban centre, T: tourist centre <br/>Owing to space constraints in the small map, the actual locations in a larger map may vary slightly\n|mark-coord1={{coord|26|14|12|N|88|11|0|E}} | label-pos1=right|label1=Islampur | numbered1=M| mark-title1= [[Islampur, Uttar Dinajpur]] (M)|label-color1=#800000 |label-size1=13| mark-size1=14|shape1=l-circle|shape-color1=#800000|shape-outline1=white|label-offset-x1=2\n|mark-coord2= {{coord|25|37|25|N|88|7|12|E}} | label-pos2=right|label2=Raiganj| numbered2=M| mark-title2= [[Raiganj]] (M)|shape-color2=black| label-size2=14|label-color2=black <!-- make the subject of the article stand out with black colors --> \n|mark-coord3={{coord|25|37|48|N|88|19|12|E}} | label-pos3=bottom|label3=Kaliaganj| numbered3=M| mark-title3= [[Kaliaganj]] (M)\n|mark-coord4={{coord|25|53|33|N|87|50|20|E}} | label-pos4=right|label4=Dalkhola| numbered4=M| mark-title4= [[Dalkhola]] (M)\n|mark-coord5={{coord|26|22|23|N|88|18|27|E}} | label-pos5=right|label5=Chopra | numbered5=CT| mark-title5= [[Chopra, Uttar Dinajpur]] (CT)|shape-color5=#A40000\n|mark-coord6={{coord|26|8|57|N|88|2|12|E}} | label-pos6=right|label6=Hanskunda | numbered6=CT| mark-title6= [[Hanskunda]] (CT)|shape-color6=#A40000\n|mark-coord7={{coord|26|6|30|N|88|8|33|E}} | label-pos7=right|label7=Goalpokhar| numbered7=R| mark-title7= [[Goalpokhar]] (R)| shape-color7=#C42222\n|mark-coord8={{coord|26|1|16|N|87|57|9|E}} | label-pos8=right|label8=Chakulia| numbered8=R| mark-title8= [[Chakulia, Uttar Dinajpur]] (R)| shape-color8=#C42222\n|mark-coord9={{coord|25|50|3|N|87|55|6|E}} | label-pos9=right|label9=Karandighi| numbered9=R| mark-title9= [[Karandighi, Uttar Dinajpur]] (R)| shape-color9=#C42222\n|mark-coord10={{coord|25|39|56|N|88|13|14|E}} | label-pos10=right|label10=Hemtabad| numbered10=R| mark-title10= [[Hemtabad, Uttar Dinajpur]] (R)| shape-color10=#C42222\n|mark-coord11={{coord|25|35|56|N|88|6|0|E}} | label-pos11=left|label11=Nachhratpur|labela11= Katabari | numbered11=CT| mark-title11= [[Nachhratpur Katabari]] (CT)|shape-color11=#A40000\n|mark-coord12={{coord|25|34|8|N|88|6|43|E}} | label-pos12=bottom|label12=Kasba | numbered12=CT| mark-title12= [[Kasba, Uttar Dinajpur]] (CT)|shape-color12=#A40000\n|mark-coord13={{coord|25|27|31|N|88|10|20|E}} | label-pos13=right|label13=Itahar | numbered13=CT| mark-title13= [[Itahar, Uttar Dinajpur]] (CT)|shape-color13=#A40000\n|mark-coord14={{coord|25|38|38|N|88|26|22|E}} | label-pos14=right|label14=Radhikapur|labela14=checkpoint| numbered14=R| mark-title14= [[Radhikapur]] (R)| shape-color14=#C42222\n|mark-coord15={{coord|25|39|13|N|88|6|15|E}} | label-pos15=top|label15=Raiganj|labela15=Wildlife Sanctuary| numbered15=T|shape-color15=green| mark-title15= [[Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary]] (T) \n|mark-coord16={{coord|25.9613|88.0524}}| label16=India| label-color16 = black| label-angle16=-70| label-pos16=bottom| label-size16=10| mark-size16=0| mark-title16 =none      \n|mark-coord17={{coord|25.9513|88.1224}}| label17=Bangladesh| label-color17 = black| label-angle17=-70| label-pos17=bottom| label-size17=10| mark-size17=0| mark-title17 =none  \n|mark-coord18={{coord|25.7273|87.9392}}| label18=Bihar| label-color18 = black| label-angle18=40| label-pos18=bottom| label-size18=10| mark-size18=0| mark-title18 =none      \n|mark-coord19={{coord|25.7773|88.0162}}| label19=West | labela19= Bengal| label-color19 = black| label-angle19=40| label-pos19=bottom| label-size19=10| mark-size19=0| mark-title19 =none \n|mark-coord20={{coord|26.2554|88.0234}}| label20=Mahananda River| label-color20 = #77A1CB| label-angle20=-40| label-pos20=top| label-size20=10| mark-size20=0| mark-title20 =none       \n}}\n\n===Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary===\nRaiganj is known for [[Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary]] (also called the Kulik bird sanctuary), home to a large population of [[Asian openbill]]s and other waterbirds and it is the largest bird sanctuary in Asia.

But, in course of time, navigability of Kulik river decreased and business through the waterway was stopped in the first half of the 1970s, especially after the dam was erected to prevent floods.

It is the largest bird sanctuary in Asia. The forest, water bodies and the river attract the migratory birds like Open Bill Strok, Night heron, cormorant, little cormorant & Egrets from South Asian countries and coastal regions. Local birds like dove, bulbul, sparrow, king fisher, woodpeckers, owl, duck & cuckoo, can also be seen in large numbers. The migratory birds arrive from end of May to Ist week of July and depart from mid December to end of January. The nesting time is from July to August & egg laying from August to September. The flying training to the young ones is the best time to observe the birds, around October to November. Every winter nearly 150 different bird species arrive here from the north in numbers ranging from 65,000 to 75,000. Some of the common migratory birds seen here are Open-Billed Storks, Asian Open-billed storks, Egrets, Knight Herons, and Cormorants. Indian birds like kites, flycatchers, kingfishers, owls, woodpeckers, drongos, and bee eaters. The sanctuary has artificial network of man made canals which is connected to the River Kulik. During the months of monsoon the flood water from the river enters the plains of the sanctuary. This acts as the important source of food for most of the bird species.\n\n'''Legal status of the Forest:-'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Reserved Forest\n| 573.71 Acre\n|-\n| Protected Forest\n| 249.50 Acre\n|-\n| Unclassed Forest\n| 660.54 Acre\n|-\n| Total\n| 1483.75 Acre = 610.71 Ha = 6.01 Sq.&nbsp;km\n|}\nThis bird sanctuary is all set to be rejuvenated as plans of developing a deer park and a tortoise park soon at the core of the sanctuary by State government.<ref>http://www.thestatesman.com/bengal/plan-to-develop-kulick-bird-sanctuary-148036.html</ref>\n\n===Raiganj Church===\n[[File:Raiganj Church.jpg|thumb|upright|Raiganj Church]]\nThe [[Raiganj Church]] is dedicated to St. Joseph the Worker, the patron saint of Raiganj Diocese.
