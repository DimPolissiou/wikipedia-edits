These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6MfPh-9DiEC&pg=PA25#PPA18,M1 | page = 18 | title = On life and times of George Joseph, 1887\u20131938, a Syrian Christian nationalist from Kerala | author = Joseph, George Gheverghese | publisher = Orient Longman | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | isbn=978-81-250-2495-8}}</ref> This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\n==Past occupations==\nThe social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \"...&nbsp;consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\"<ref name=\"Osella8\">{{cite book |title=Social Mobility in Kerala: Modernity and Identity in Conflict |first1=Filippo |last1=Osella |first2=Caroline |last2=Osella |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7453-1693-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&pg=PA8}}</ref>{{efn|Gough describes Thiyya subtenants in Central Travancore, who worked land held by the Nair caste.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas.

This was a ritualistic art form performed in almost all important temples of Kerala.  Today it is found in central Kerala.  This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the ''[[Mahabharatha]]''), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a [[nilavilakku]] at its centre.

Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Makachuttu===\nMakachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in [[Kilimanoor]], Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times.

Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]\u2014an order of armed [[Sikh]]s\u2014came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], some of the Akalis remained.

Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.

These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6MfPh-9DiEC&pg=PA25#PPA18,M1 | page = 18 | title = On life and times of George Joseph, 1887\u20131938, a Syrian Christian nationalist from Kerala | author = Joseph, George Gheverghese | publisher = Orient Longman | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | isbn=978-81-250-2495-8}}</ref> This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\n==Past occupations==\nThe social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \"...&nbsp;consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\"<ref name=\"Osella8\">{{cite book |title=Social Mobility in Kerala: Modernity and Identity in Conflict |first1=Filippo |last1=Osella |first2=Caroline |last2=Osella |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7453-1693-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&pg=PA8}}</ref>{{efn|Gough describes Thiyya subtenants in Central Travancore, who worked land held by the Nair caste.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Makachuttu===\nMakachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in [[Kilimanoor]], Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. [[Sandalwood]] paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume. This is a combination of [[snake worship]] and [[Kalarippayattu]].<ref name = \"ezh22\"/><ref name = \"ezh23\"/>\n\n===Poorakkali===\nPoorakkali is a folk dance prevalent among the Ezhavas of Malabar, usually performed in Bhagavathy temples as a ritual offering during the month of [[Meenam]] (March\u2013April).  Poorakkali requires specially trained and highly experienced dancers, trained in Kalaripayattu, a system of physical exercise formerly in vogue in Kerala.  Standing round a traditional lamp, the performers dance in eighteen different stages and rhythms, each phase called a niram.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Teyyam (Teyyattam) or Kaliyattam===\nIn northern Kerala, [[Theyyam|Teyyam]] is a popular [[ritual dance]]. This particular dance form is also known as Kaliyattam. The main deities of Ezhavas include Vayanattu Kulavan, Kativannur Viran, Pumarutan and [[Muthappan|Muttappan]].<ref name = \"ezh22\">{{cite book | author = Bernier, Ronald M. | title = Temple Arts of Kerala: A South Indian Tradition | publisher = Asia Book Corporation of America | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-940500-79-2 }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}<ref name = \"ezh23\">{{cite book | last=Chaitanya |first=Krishna | title=Arts of India | publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=New Delhi | year=1987 | isbn=978-81-7017-209-3 }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Customs==\nEzhavas adopted different patterns of behavior in family system across [[Kerala]]. Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

These people, and other Muslim converts in the region, are now known as [[Mappilla]]s.<ref name=\"Gough313\" /> A sizeable part of the Ezhava community, especially in central [[Travancore]] and in the [[Western Ghats|High Ranges]], embraced [[Christianity]] during the [[British Raj|British rule]], due to caste-based discrimination. In [[Kannur]], [[Protestant]] missions started working in the first half of the 19th century, notably the [[Basel Mission|Basel German Evangelical Mission]].

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful. In Malabar, which unlike Cochin and Travancore was under direct British control,<ref name=\"SchneiderGoughp304\">{{cite book |title=Matrilineal Kinship |editor1-first=David Murray |editor1-last=Schneider |editor2-first=E.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]\u2014an order of armed [[Sikh]]s\u2014came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], some of the Akalis remained. They attracted some Ezhava youth to the concepts of the Sikhism, resulting in Ezhava conversions to Sikhism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C8EBAAAAMAAJ&q=sikhism+ezhava&dq=sikhism+ezhava|title= The abstention movement|page=19|first=K.K |last=Kusuman|publisher=Kerala Historical Society |year=1976|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the SNDP in improving the lot of Ezhavas has been questioned. Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.

It originally carried automobile traffic on its upper deck, with trucks, cars, buses and [[interurban|commuter trains]] on the lower, but after the [[Key System]] abandoned rail service, the lower deck was converted to all-road traffic as well. In 1986, the bridge was unofficially dedicated to [[James Rolph]].<ref name=unofficial>{{cite book |title=2008 Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf |date=January 2009 |publisher=[[California Department of Transportation]] |page=41 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523161116/http://dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf |archivedate=May 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge has two sections of roughly equal length; the older western section, officially known as the Willie L. Brown Jr. Bridge (after former [[Mayor of San Francisco|San Francisco Mayor]] and [[List of Speakers of the California State Assembly|California State Assembly Speaker]] [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie L. Brown Jr.]]), connects downtown San Francisco to [[Yerba Buena Island]], and the newer unnamed eastern section connects the island to Oakland. The western section is a double [[suspension bridge]] with two decks, westbound traffic being carried on the upper deck while eastbound is carried on the lower one. The largest span of the original eastern section was a [[cantilever bridge]]. During the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], a portion of the eastern section's upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck and the bridge was closed for a month. [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge|Reconstruction of the eastern section of the bridge]] as a [[causeway]] connected to a [[self-anchored suspension bridge]] began in 2002; the new eastern section opened September 2, 2013, at a reported cost of over $6.5 billion, a 2,500% cost overrun from the original estimate of $250 million (for a seismic retrofit of the existing span).<ref>{{cite web |title=First Cars Cross SF-Oakland Bay Bridge's New Span |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/64b-sf-oakland-bay-bridge-opens-traffic-20139554 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{ cite web | url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/10/from-250-million-to-65-billion-the-bay-bridge-cost-overrun/410254/ | work=CityLab | title=From $250 Million to $6.5 Billion: The Bay Bridge Cost Overrun | last=Jaffe | first=Eric | date=October 13, 2015 | accessdate=September 28, 2017 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928174214/https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/10/from-250-million-to-65-billion-the-bay-bridge-cost-overrun/410254/ | archivedate=September 28, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Unlike the western section and the original eastern section of the bridge, the new eastern section is a single deck with the eastbound and westbound lanes on each side making it the world's widest bridge, according to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'',<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/paffairs/news/pressrel/14pr095.htm |title=San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge wins Excellence in Structural Engineering honor |last= |first= |date=September 15, 2014 |work=Press releases|access-date = |publisher=California Department of Transportation}}</ref> as of 2014.

Almost all goods not produced locally arrived by ship. But after the [[first transcontinental railroad]] was completed in May 1869, San Francisco was on the wrong side of the Bay, separated from the new rail link. The fear of many San Franciscans was that the city would lose its position as the regional center of trade. The concept of a bridge spanning the San Francisco Bay had been considered since the Gold Rush days. Several newspaper articles during the early 1870s discussed the idea. In early 1872, a \"Bay Bridge Committee\" was hard at work on plans to construct a [[railroad]] bridge. The April 1872 issue of the ''San Francisco Real Estate Circular'' contained an item about the committee:\n\n{{quotation|The Bay Bridge Committee lately submitted its report to the Board of Supervisors, in which compromise with the Central Pacific was recommended; also the bridging of the bay at Ravenswood and the granting of railroad facilities at Mission Bay and on the water front.

In the third of these decrees, in September 1872, Norton, frustrated that nothing had happened, proclaimed:\n\n{{quotation|WHEREAS, we issued our decree ordering the citizens of San Francisco and Oakland to appropriate funds for the survey of a suspension bridge from Oakland Point via Goat Island; also for a tunnel; and to ascertain which is the best project; and whereas the said citizens have hitherto neglected to notice our said decree; and whereas we are determined our authority shall be fully respected; now, therefore, we do hereby command the arrest by the army of both the Boards of City Fathers if they persist in neglecting our decrees.\n\nGiven under our royal hand and seal at San Francisco, this 17th day of September, 1872.<ref name=\"Norton Bay Bridge\"/>}}\n\n[[File:ProposedSanFranciscoBayBridge2.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of the proposed \"Rush San Francisco Trans-Bay Suspension Bridge\" (1913)<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crane |first=Lorin P. |date=April 1913 |title=Proposed Suspension Bridge Over San Francisco Bay |journal=Overland Monthly |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=375\u201377}}</ref>]]\n\nUnlike most of Emperor Norton's eccentric ideas, his decree to build a bridge had wide public and political appeal. Yet the task was too much of an engineering and economic challenge, since the bay was too wide and too deep there.

Purcell]], the State Highway Engineer of California, assumed the position of Chief Engineer for the Bay Bridge.\n\nTo make the bridge feasible, a route was chosen via [[Yerba Buena Island]], which would reduce both the material and the labor needed. Since Yerba Buena Island was a [[U.S. Navy]] base at the time, the approval of the U.S. Congress, which regulates the armed services and supervises all naval and military bases, was necessary for this island to be used. After a great deal of lobbying, California received Congressional approval to use the island on February 20, 1931, subject to the final approval of the Departments of War, Navy and Commerce.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/71st-congress/session-3/c71s3ch238.pdf ''U.S. Statutes at Large'', 71st Congress, Chap.238, pp.1192-3]</ref>  Permits were immediately applied for from the 3 federal departments as required.

There was an on-ramp to the upper deck on [[Rincon Hill]] from Fremont Street (which later became an off-ramp) and an off-ramp to First Street (later extended over First St to Fremont St).

The 3 feeder highways were U.S. 40 (Eastshore Highway) which led north through Berkeley, U.S. 50 (38th Street, later MacArthur Blvd.) which led through Oakland, and State Route 17 which ran parallel to U.S. 50, along the Oakland Estuary and through the industrial and port sections of the city.\n\n===Yerba Buena Tunnel===\n[[File:Yerba Buena Island tunnel.jpg|thumb|Traveling through the westbound Yerba Buena tunnel]]The Yerba Buena passage utilizes the [[Yerba Buena Tunnel]], {{convert|76|ft}} wide, {{convert|58|ft}} high, and {{convert|540|ft}} long.<ref name=\"YBIbluprints\"/> It is the largest diameter transportation bore tunnel in the world.<ref name=\"newbaybridge\"/>  The large amount of material that was excavated in boring the tunnel was used for a portion of the landfill over the [[shoal]]s lying adjacent to Yerba Buena Island to its north, a project which created the artificial [[Treasure Island, San Francisco|Treasure Island]].\n\nReminders of the long-gone bridge railway survive along the south side of the lower Yerba Buena Tunnel.

The bridge was re-designated as [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] in 1964, and the western ends of U.S. 40 and U.S. 50 are now in [[Silver Summit, Utah]], and [[West Sacramento, California]], respectively.\n\nThe off-ramp for [[Treasure Island, California|Treasure Island]] and [[Yerba Buena Island]] is unusual in that it is on the left-hand side in the eastbound direction. This off ramp presents an unusual hazard \u2013 drivers must slow within the normal traffic flow and move into a very short off-ramp that ends in a short radius turn left turn; accordingly, a 15 MPH advisory is posted there. The turn has been further narrowed from its original design by the installation of crash pads on the island side. Eastbound and westbound on-ramps are on the usual right-hand side, but these do not have dedicated merge lanes, forcing drivers to await gaps in traffic and then accelerate from a [[stop sign]] to traffic speeds in a short distance. In 2016, a new on-ramp and off-ramp to Treasure Island were opened in the western direction on the right-hand side of the roadway, replacing the left-hand side off-ramp in that direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Bay Bridge on-off ramps to Treasure Island now open|url=http://abc7news.com/traffic/new-bay-bridge-on-off-ramps-to-treasure-island-now-open-/1567438/|website=ABC 7 News San Francisco Oakland San Jose|publisher=ABC 7 News|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Rail service===\n\nOn January 14, 1939, the [[San Francisco Transbay Terminal]] was dedicated.  The following morning, January 15, 1939, the electric commuter trains started running across the south side of the lower deck of the bridge. The terminal originally was supposed to open the same time as the Bay Bridge, but was delayed. The trains were operated by the [[Sacramento Northern Railroad]] ([[Western Pacific Railroad|Western Pacific]]), the [[East Bay Electric Lines|Interurban Electric Railway]] ([[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]]) and the [[Key System]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Swenerton|first1=Jeff|title=When Trains Ruled the East Bay|url=http://www.oaklandmagazine.com/Oakland-Magazine/January-2008/When-Trains-Ruled-the-East-Bay/}}</ref> Freight trains never used the bridge. The tracks left the lower deck in San Francisco just southwest of the end of 1st St. They then went along an elevated viaduct above city streets, looping around and into the terminal on its east end. Departing trains exited on the loop back onto the bridge.<ref>[http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/Californiahighways/chpw_1938_may.pdf \"Building Bay Bridge Railroad\", ''California Highways and Public Works'', v.16 no.5, May, 1938, pp.8-11]</ref> The loop continued to be used by buses until the terminal's closure in 2010. The tracks left the lower deck in Oakland. The Interurban Electric Railway tracks ran along Engineer Road and over the [[Southern Pacific]] yard on trestles (some of it is still standing and visible from nearby roadways) onto the streets and dedicated right-of-ways in Berkeley, Albany, Oakland and Alameda. The Sacramento Northern and Key System tracks went under the SP tracks through a tunnel (which still exists and is in use as an access to the [[EBMUD]] treatment plant) and onto 40th St. Due to falling ridership, Sacramento Northern and IER service ended in 1941.<ref>''Red Trains in the East Bay'', Robert Ford, Interurbans Special 65, 1977</ref> After World War II Key System ridership began to fall as well.<ref>The Key Route, Harre Demoro, Interurbans Special 95,  1985</ref> Despite the vital role the railroad played, the last train went over the bridge in April 1958. The tracks were removed and replaced with pavement on the Transbay Terminal ramps and Bay Bridge. The Key System handled buses over the bridge until 1960 when its successor, [[AC Transit]], took over operations. It still handles service today. There have been several attempts to restore rail service on the bridge, but none have been successful.\n\n===Later events===\n\n====Modification to remove rail service====\n[[File:Oakland Bay Bridge from Yerba Buena Island.jpg|right|thumb|Daytime view of the Bay Bridge and [[San Francisco]] seen from [[Yerba Buena Island]]]]\n[[File:Bay bridge sf.JPG|thumb|right|A view of the Bay Bridge from the Bank of America building]]\nAutomobile traffic increased dramatically in the ensuing decades while the [[Key System]] declined, and in October 1963, the Bay Bridge was reconfigured with five lanes of westbound traffic on the upper deck and five lanes of eastbound traffic on the lower deck. The Key System originally planned to end train operations in 1948 when it replaced its streetcars with buses, but Caltrans did not approve of this. Trucks were allowed on both decks and the railroad was removed.<ref name=\"newbaybridge\"/> Owing to a lack of clearance for trucks through the upper-deck portion of the Yerba Buena tunnel, it was necessary to lower the elevation of the upper deck where it passes through the tunnel, and to correspondingly excavate to lower the elevation of the lower portion.<ref name=\"McGloin\">{{cite book |last=Bernard McGloin |first=John |title=San Francisco, the Story of a City |publisher=Presidio Press |year=1978 |location=San Francisco (California) |url=https://archive.org/details/sanfranciscostor00mcgl |isbn=978-0-89141-045-4 |url-status=live }}\n</ref> Additionally, the upper deck was retrofitted to handle the increased loads due to trucks, with understringers added and prestressing added to the bottom of the floor beams.

During the retrofit, much of the [[structural steel]] supporting the bridge deck was replaced while the bridge remained open to traffic.

Analysis showed that these could fail by shearing under extreme stress. Therefore, at most locations each given rivet was removed by breaking off the head with a jack-hammer [rivet buster] and punching out the old rivet, the hole precision [[reamer|reamed]] and the old rivets replaced with heat-treated high-strength tension-control [TC] bolts and nuts. Most bolts had domed heads placed facing traffic so they looked similar to the rivets that were removed.[Caltrans contract 04-0435U4, 1999\u20132004]. This work had to be performed with great care as the steel of the structure had for many years been painted with [[lead]] based paint, which had to be carefully removed and contained by workers with extensive protective gear.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n<!--{{fixbunching|mid}}-->\n[[File:San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge Retrofit 4 (2-cropped vs 3).jpg|thumb|left|Obsolete hot riveted [[lattice girder|laced ties]] (left, eastern span) and bolted box beam retrofit (right, western span)]]\nMost of the beams were originally constructed of two plate {{ibeam}}-beams joined with lattices of flat strip or angle stock, depending upon structural requirements. These have all been reconstructed by replacing the riveted lattice elements with bolted steel plate and so converting the lattice beams into box beams. This replacement included adding face plates to the large diagonal beams joining the faces of the main towers, which now have an improved appearance when viewed from certain angles.\n\nDiagonal box beams have been added to each bay of the upper and lower decks of the western spans. These add stiffness to reduce side-to-side motion during an earthquake and reduce the probability of damage to the decking surfaces.\n\nAnalysis showed that some massive concrete supports could burst and crumble under likely stresses. In particular the western supports were extensively modified. First, the location of existing reinforcing bar is determined using magnetic techniques. In areas between bars holes are drilled. Into these holes is inserted and glued an L-shaped bar that protrudes 15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10&nbsp;inches).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} This bar is retained in the hole with a high-strength [[epoxy]] adhesive. The entire surface of the structure is thus covered with closely spaced protrusions. A network of horizontal and vertical reinforcing bars is then attached to these protrusions. Mold surface plates are then positioned to retain high-strength concrete, which is then pumped into the void. After removal of the formwork the surface appears similar to the original concrete. This technique has been applied elsewhere throughout California to improve freeway overpass abutments and some overpass central supports that have unconventional shapes. (Other techniques such as ''jacket and grout'' are applied to simple vertical posts; see the [[seismic retrofit]] article.)\n\nThe western approaches have also been retrofitted in part, but mostly these have been replaced with new construction of reinforced concrete.\n<!--{{fixbunching|mid}}-->\n\n===Eastern section replacement===\n{{Main|Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge}}\nFor various reasons, the eastern section would have been too expensive to retrofit compared to replacing it, so the decision was made to replace it.\n\nThe replacement section underwent a series of design changes, both progressive and regressive, with increasing cost estimates and contractor bids. The final plan included a single-towered [[self-anchored suspension bridge|self-anchored suspension span]] starting at Yerba Buena island, leading to a long inclined \nviaduct to the Oakland touchdown.{{citation needed|date = November 2013}}\n\nSeparated and protected bicycle lanes are a visually prominent feature on the south side of the new eastern section.

Almost all goods not produced locally arrived by ship. But after the [[first transcontinental railroad]] was completed in May 1869, San Francisco was on the wrong side of the Bay, separated from the new rail link. The fear of many San Franciscans was that the city would lose its position as the regional center of trade. The concept of a bridge spanning the San Francisco Bay had been considered since the Gold Rush days. Several newspaper articles during the early 1870s discussed the idea. In early 1872, a \"Bay Bridge Committee\" was hard at work on plans to construct a [[railroad]] bridge. The April 1872 issue of the ''San Francisco Real Estate Circular'' contained an item about the committee:\n\n{{quotation|The Bay Bridge Committee lately submitted its report to the Board of Supervisors, in which compromise with the Central Pacific was recommended; also the bridging of the bay at Ravenswood and the granting of railroad facilities at Mission Bay and on the water front. Wm. C. Ralston, ex-Mayor Selby and James Otis were on this committee. A daily newspaper attempts to account for the advice of these gentlemen to the city by hinting that they were afraid of the railroad company, and therefore made their recommendations to suit its interests.<ref>{{cite news|title=Complimentary to Selby, Ralston and Otis. |work=San Francisco Real Estate Circular |date=April 1872 |url=http://www.sfmuseum.net/hist2/bbridge.html |accessdate=July 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616064519/http://www.sfmuseum.net/hist2/bbridge.html |archivedate=June 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}\n\nThe self-proclaimed [[Emperor Norton]] saw fit to decree three times in 1872 that a suspension bridge be constructed to connect Oakland with San Francisco. In the third of these decrees, in September 1872, Norton, frustrated that nothing had happened, proclaimed:\n\n{{quotation|WHEREAS, we issued our decree ordering the citizens of San Francisco and Oakland to appropriate funds for the survey of a suspension bridge from Oakland Point via Goat Island; also for a tunnel; and to ascertain which is the best project; and whereas the said citizens have hitherto neglected to notice our said decree; and whereas we are determined our authority shall be fully respected; now, therefore, we do hereby command the arrest by the army of both the Boards of City Fathers if they persist in neglecting our decrees.\n\nGiven under our royal hand and seal at San Francisco, this 17th day of September, 1872.<ref name=\"Norton Bay Bridge\"/>}}\n\n[[File:ProposedSanFranciscoBayBridge2.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of the proposed \"Rush San Francisco Trans-Bay Suspension Bridge\" (1913)<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crane |first=Lorin P. |date=April 1913 |title=Proposed Suspension Bridge Over San Francisco Bay |journal=Overland Monthly |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=375\u201377}}</ref>]]\n\nUnlike most of Emperor Norton's eccentric ideas, his decree to build a bridge had wide public and political appeal. Yet the task was too much of an engineering and economic challenge, since the bay was too wide and too deep there. In 1921, over forty years after Norton's death, a tube was considered, but it became clear that one would be inadequate for vehicular traffic.<ref name=\"newbaybridge\">{{cite web|title=The San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge Facts at a glance |work=Caltrans toll bridge program |publisher=[[California Department of Transportation]] |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/tollbridge/SFOBB/Sfobbfacts.html |accessdate=July 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103075716/http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/tollbridge/SFOBB/Sfobbfacts.html |archivedate=November 3, 2010 |url-status=live }}{{deadlink|date=February 2020}}</ref> Support for a trans-bay crossing finally grew in the 1920s with the increasing popularity and availability of the automobile.\n\n===Planning===\nIn 1929, the California Legislature passed and Gov.

Since Yerba Buena Island was a [[U.S. Navy]] base at the time, the approval of the U.S. Congress, which regulates the armed services and supervises all naval and military bases, was necessary for this island to be used. After a great deal of lobbying, California received Congressional approval to use the island on February 20, 1931, subject to the final approval of the Departments of War, Navy and Commerce.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/71st-congress/session-3/c71s3ch238.pdf ''U.S. Statutes at Large'', 71st Congress, Chap.238, pp.1192-3]</ref>  Permits were immediately applied for from the 3 federal departments as required.

''Red Trains in the East Bay'' (1977) Interurbans Publications {{ISBN|978-0-916374-27-3}} p.258</ref> In 1958 the tracks were replaced with pavement, but the reconfiguration to what the traffic eventually became did not take place until 1963.\n\nThe Federal highway on the bridge was originally a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] of [[U.S. Route 40 (California)|U.S. Highway 40]] and [[U.S. Route 50 (California)|U.S. Highway 50]]. The bridge was re-designated as [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] in 1964, and the western ends of U.S. 40 and U.S. 50 are now in [[Silver Summit, Utah]], and [[West Sacramento, California]], respectively.\n\nThe off-ramp for [[Treasure Island, California|Treasure Island]] and [[Yerba Buena Island]] is unusual in that it is on the left-hand side in the eastbound direction. This off ramp presents an unusual hazard \u2013 drivers must slow within the normal traffic flow and move into a very short off-ramp that ends in a short radius turn left turn; accordingly, a 15 MPH advisory is posted there. The turn has been further narrowed from its original design by the installation of crash pads on the island side. Eastbound and westbound on-ramps are on the usual right-hand side, but these do not have dedicated merge lanes, forcing drivers to await gaps in traffic and then accelerate from a [[stop sign]] to traffic speeds in a short distance. In 2016, a new on-ramp and off-ramp to Treasure Island were opened in the western direction on the right-hand side of the roadway, replacing the left-hand side off-ramp in that direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Bay Bridge on-off ramps to Treasure Island now open|url=http://abc7news.com/traffic/new-bay-bridge-on-off-ramps-to-treasure-island-now-open-/1567438/|website=ABC 7 News San Francisco Oakland San Jose|publisher=ABC 7 News|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Rail service===\n\nOn January 14, 1939, the [[San Francisco Transbay Terminal]] was dedicated.  The following morning, January 15, 1939, the electric commuter trains started running across the south side of the lower deck of the bridge. The terminal originally was supposed to open the same time as the Bay Bridge, but was delayed. The trains were operated by the [[Sacramento Northern Railroad]] ([[Western Pacific Railroad|Western Pacific]]), the [[East Bay Electric Lines|Interurban Electric Railway]] ([[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]]) and the [[Key System]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Swenerton|first1=Jeff|title=When Trains Ruled the East Bay|url=http://www.oaklandmagazine.com/Oakland-Magazine/January-2008/When-Trains-Ruled-the-East-Bay/}}</ref> Freight trains never used the bridge. The tracks left the lower deck in San Francisco just southwest of the end of 1st St. They then went along an elevated viaduct above city streets, looping around and into the terminal on its east end. Departing trains exited on the loop back onto the bridge.<ref>[http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/Californiahighways/chpw_1938_may.pdf \"Building Bay Bridge Railroad\", ''California Highways and Public Works'', v.16 no.5, May, 1938, pp.8-11]</ref> The loop continued to be used by buses until the terminal's closure in 2010. The tracks left the lower deck in Oakland. The Interurban Electric Railway tracks ran along Engineer Road and over the [[Southern Pacific]] yard on trestles (some of it is still standing and visible from nearby roadways) onto the streets and dedicated right-of-ways in Berkeley, Albany, Oakland and Alameda. The Sacramento Northern and Key System tracks went under the SP tracks through a tunnel (which still exists and is in use as an access to the [[EBMUD]] treatment plant) and onto 40th St. Due to falling ridership, Sacramento Northern and IER service ended in 1941.<ref>''Red Trains in the East Bay'', Robert Ford, Interurbans Special 65, 1977</ref> After World War II Key System ridership began to fall as well.<ref>The Key Route, Harre Demoro, Interurbans Special 95,  1985</ref> Despite the vital role the railroad played, the last train went over the bridge in April 1958. The tracks were removed and replaced with pavement on the Transbay Terminal ramps and Bay Bridge. The Key System handled buses over the bridge until 1960 when its successor, [[AC Transit]], took over operations. It still handles service today. There have been several attempts to restore rail service on the bridge, but none have been successful.\n\n===Later events===\n\n====Modification to remove rail service====\n[[File:Oakland Bay Bridge from Yerba Buena Island.jpg|right|thumb|Daytime view of the Bay Bridge and [[San Francisco]] seen from [[Yerba Buena Island]]]]\n[[File:Bay bridge sf.JPG|thumb|right|A view of the Bay Bridge from the Bank of America building]]\nAutomobile traffic increased dramatically in the ensuing decades while the [[Key System]] declined, and in October 1963, the Bay Bridge was reconfigured with five lanes of westbound traffic on the upper deck and five lanes of eastbound traffic on the lower deck. The Key System originally planned to end train operations in 1948 when it replaced its streetcars with buses, but Caltrans did not approve of this. Trucks were allowed on both decks and the railroad was removed.<ref name=\"newbaybridge\"/> Owing to a lack of clearance for trucks through the upper-deck portion of the Yerba Buena tunnel, it was necessary to lower the elevation of the upper deck where it passes through the tunnel, and to correspondingly excavate to lower the elevation of the lower portion.<ref name=\"McGloin\">{{cite book |last=Bernard McGloin |first=John |title=San Francisco, the Story of a City |publisher=Presidio Press |year=1978 |location=San Francisco (California) |url=https://archive.org/details/sanfranciscostor00mcgl |isbn=978-0-89141-045-4 |url-status=live }}\n</ref> Additionally, the upper deck was retrofitted to handle the increased loads due to trucks, with understringers added and prestressing added to the bottom of the floor beams.

Analysis showed that these could fail by shearing under extreme stress. Therefore, at most locations each given rivet was removed by breaking off the head with a jack-hammer [rivet buster] and punching out the old rivet, the hole precision [[reamer|reamed]] and the old rivets replaced with heat-treated high-strength tension-control [TC] bolts and nuts. Most bolts had domed heads placed facing traffic so they looked similar to the rivets that were removed.[Caltrans contract 04-0435U4, 1999\u20132004]. This work had to be performed with great care as the steel of the structure had for many years been painted with [[lead]] based paint, which had to be carefully removed and contained by workers with extensive protective gear.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n<!--{{fixbunching|mid}}-->\n[[File:San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge Retrofit 4 (2-cropped vs 3).jpg|thumb|left|Obsolete hot riveted [[lattice girder|laced ties]] (left, eastern span) and bolted box beam retrofit (right, western span)]]\nMost of the beams were originally constructed of two plate {{ibeam}}-beams joined with lattices of flat strip or angle stock, depending upon structural requirements. These have all been reconstructed by replacing the riveted lattice elements with bolted steel plate and so converting the lattice beams into box beams. This replacement included adding face plates to the large diagonal beams joining the faces of the main towers, which now have an improved appearance when viewed from certain angles.\n\nDiagonal box beams have been added to each bay of the upper and lower decks of the western spans. These add stiffness to reduce side-to-side motion during an earthquake and reduce the probability of damage to the decking surfaces.\n\nAnalysis showed that some massive concrete supports could burst and crumble under likely stresses. In particular the western supports were extensively modified. First, the location of existing reinforcing bar is determined using magnetic techniques. In areas between bars holes are drilled. Into these holes is inserted and glued an L-shaped bar that protrudes 15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10&nbsp;inches).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} This bar is retained in the hole with a high-strength [[epoxy]] adhesive. The entire surface of the structure is thus covered with closely spaced protrusions. A network of horizontal and vertical reinforcing bars is then attached to these protrusions. Mold surface plates are then positioned to retain high-strength concrete, which is then pumped into the void. After removal of the formwork the surface appears similar to the original concrete. This technique has been applied elsewhere throughout California to improve freeway overpass abutments and some overpass central supports that have unconventional shapes. (Other techniques such as ''jacket and grout'' are applied to simple vertical posts; see the [[seismic retrofit]] article.)\n\nThe western approaches have also been retrofitted in part, but mostly these have been replaced with new construction of reinforced concrete.\n<!--{{fixbunching|mid}}-->\n\n===Eastern section replacement===\n{{Main|Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge}}\nFor various reasons, the eastern section would have been too expensive to retrofit compared to replacing it, so the decision was made to replace it.\n\nThe replacement section underwent a series of design changes, both progressive and regressive, with increasing cost estimates and contractor bids.
