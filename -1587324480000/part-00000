The town is noted in Irish history for its resistance to the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Cromwellian army]] which sacked the towns of [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]]. With the exception of the [[townland]] of Suir Island, most of the borough is situated in the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of \"St Mary's\"<ref>[https://www.logainm.ie/2335.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - St Mary's, Clonmel civil parish</ref> which is part of the ancient [[Barony (Ireland)|barony]] of [[Iffa and Offa East]].\n\n==Population==\nThe 2016 Census used a new boundary created by the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] (CSO) to define the town of Clonmel and Environs resulting in a population figure of 17,140. This new boundary omitted part of the Clonmel Borough Boundary which the CSO had defined as Legal Town for the 2011 census 11.55&nbsp;km/sq. All of the 2011 census CSO environ in Co Waterford have been omitted as well as parts of CSO Environ of Clonmel in Co Tipperary. The CSO as part of the 11 May 2017 release of data compared their new 2016 CSO boundary with its population of 17,140 with the 2011 CSO Clonmel Environ boundary which is a larger area and had a resulting greater population of 17,908. The CSO are not comparing the same area and are incorrectly recorded a population decline of 768 (-4.3%).\n\nClonmel Borough (CSO Legal Town 2011, 11.55&nbsp;km/sq) had a population of 15,793 in 2011, another 2115 people were in the rural environs of Clonmel comprising Marlfield, Ardgeeha Upper (Cashel Rd), Boherduff (Fethard Rd) in County Tipperary and in [[County Waterford]] the area between the Dungarvan Rd and Mountain Rd.<ref>[http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=109359 C.S.O.

It is not clearly known when it got this name; many suppose that it came from the fertility of the soil and the richness of the country in which it is situated.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/historyclonmel00burkgoog History of Clonmel (1907)]</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Old Saint Marys, Clonmel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old St. Mary's Church]]\n\n===Town walls===\nClonmel grew significantly in [[medieval]] times, and many remainders of this period can be found in the town. A small section of the town walls remain in place near [[Old St. Mary's Church (Clonmel)|Old St. Mary's Church]] . This building is one of the main architectural features of the town. It was originally built in the 14th century or earlier but has been reconstructed or renovated on numerous occasions. The church was fortified early in its history, the town being strategically important, initially for the [[Earl of Ormonde (Irish)|Earls of Ormonde]], and later the [[Earl of Kildare]]. Some fortified parts of the church were destroyed or damaged during the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Cromwellian occupation]]. One of the former entry points into the town is now the site of the 'West Gate', a 19th-century reconstruction of an older structure. There were originally three gates in the walled town, North, East and West \u2013 with the South being protected by the river [[Suir]] and the [[Comeragh Mountains]]. The 'West Gate' is now an open arched entrance on to O'Connell street, the main street of the town.\n\n===Corporation regalia===\nUnder a charter granted by [[James I of England]], Clonmel became a [[Borough|Free Borough]] on 5 July 1608, and the Mayor and officers of the town were granted power to \"name, elect and constitute one Swordbearer and three Sergeants-at-Mace\". The present sword and two silver maces date only from Cromwellian times. The sword, of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] manufacture, was donated by Sir Thomas Stanley in 1656 and displays the Arms and motto of the town. The larger mace is stamped 1663.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burke  |first= William P. |title=History of Clonmel|publisher=N.

The walls were eventually breached, but [[Hugh Dubh O'Neill]], the commander of the town's garrison, inflicted heavy losses on the [[New Model Army]] when they tried to storm the breach. That night, O'Neill, deciding that further resistance was hopeless due to a lack of ammunition, led his soldiers and camp followers out of the town under cover of darkness. The story is told that Cromwell became suspicious of O'Neill's desperate situation when a silver bullet was discharged by the townspeople at his troops outside the walls.<ref>{{cite book|last=Curry|first=William|title=The Dublin University Magazine |publisher=William Curry, Jun., and Co.|year=1853|volume=v. 42|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5NoRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA329&dq=clonmel+%22silver+bullet%22|accessdate=27 June 2009}}</ref> The following morning, 18 May 1650, mayor John White was able to surrender the town on good terms as Cromwell was still unaware of the garrison's escape just hours before.

Their co-defendant, [[William Smith O'Brien]] was also sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], the last occasions such a sentence was handed down in Ireland. When delivering the guilty verdict, the foreman of the [[Grand jury#Ireland|Grand Jury]], R.M. Southcote Mansergh, great grandfather of the academic [[Nicholas Mansergh]] stated:\n<blockquote>\nWe earnestly recommend the prisoner to the merciful consideration of the Government, being unanimously of opinion that for many reasons his life should be spared.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mansergh|first=Nicholas|title=Nationalism and independence: selected Irish papers Irish History Series |editor=Diana Mansergh|publisher=Cork University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-1-85918-106-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f7OC7YQkFwYC&pg=PA124&dq=%22southcote+mansergh%22&q=%22southcote%20mansergh%22|accessdate=15 August 2009}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe sentences of O'Brien and other members of the [[Irish Confederation]] were eventually commuted to [[Penal transportation|transportation]] for life to [[Van Diemen's Land]].

It was one of five Borough Councils in Ireland. It had 12 elected representatives (councillors). John Hackett was the first Mayor and Pat English was the last Mayor of Clonmel Borough Council.\n\nFor local elections in 2014 the District of Cahir-Clonmel elected nine members to [[Tipperary County Council]].\n\n===National===\nClonmel belongs to the [[Tipperary (D\u00e1il constituency)|Tipperary constituency]] which elects five [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (the Irish Parliament).\n\nIn the 2016 General Election [[Mattie McGrath]] (Independent), [[Michael Lowry]] (Independent), [[Alan Kelly (politician)|Alan Kelly]] ([[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]]), [[Jackie Cahill]] ([[Fianna F\u00e1il]]) and [[S\u00e9amus Healy]] ([[Workers and Unemployed Action]]) won the five seats.\n\nThe [[2020 Irish General Election]] was supposed to  be postponed due to the sudden death of Independent candidate Marese Skehan [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51369150]. This was because it was a requirement under the 1992 Electoral Act Section 62. However, Attorney General S\u00e9amus Woulfe advised the Government that the entire general election could be open to a legal challenge if the Tipperary poll did not go ahead.

The [[Office of Public Works]] (OPW) completed and installed a Flood Forecasting System which has been used since 2007. The flood of 2015 had a flow of 390m<sup>3</sup>/s, 2004 had a flow of 354m<sup>3</sup>/s with the flood of 2000 having a flow of 353m<sup>3</sup>/s. The 2015 flood was the worst since that of 1946, which had seen a flow of 479m<sup>3</sup>/s. Phase 1 of the Clonmel Flood Defence (planned to cope with a [[100-year flood]]) started in 2007. It was scheduled to be completed by late 2009. Phases two and three were completion by 2012. Property omitted from Phase 1 along the convent road were protected in 2014 and the access to the river for the workmans boat club was also raised. \nFlooding of October 2014 was less than a 1\u20135 flood with a flow of 300m<sup>3</sup>/s.

''Premier People'' ceased publishing in 2011.<ref>[http://clonmelonline.com/2010/10/the-premier-people/ clonmelonline.com]</ref>\n\nThe ''Tipperary Free Press'' was established in 1826 by the future first catholic Lord Mayor of Clonmel, John Hackett, following a meeting of the Clonmel Corporation.  It was proposed that a Liberal and Independent newspaper should be in circulation in the district and Councillor Hackett, having been a printer and bookbinder in the town for some years, stepped forward to take on the task.   The successful newspaper with a circulation of 45,650 in 1829 was an influential and popular voice in supporting liberal causes, yet it was labelled as radical.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1830|title=Article IV - The Leeds Mercury; The Manchester Guardian.|url=|journal=The Westminster Review|volume= 12|pages=82|via=}}</ref>  Its primary intention was to be ''<nowiki/>'The voice of the common people''' and played a highly prominent role in the quest for [[Catholic emancipation|Catholic Emancipation]] as advocated by [[Daniel O'Connell]].  Hackett was sued for libel on multiple occasions for his [[caricature]]s of political rivals.  Printed on O'Connell Street bi-weekly, it circulated counties Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork and Limerick.  In its later years it assumed a Catholic-Whig political leaning.  Printing ceased when it was acquired by the ''Tipperary Independent'' (1882-1906) in 1883.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Museums and Galleries ===\n[[File:Cluain Meala (Clonmel), The Main Guard - geograph.org.uk - 260570.jpg|thumb|[[Main Guard (Clonmel)|The Main Guard]]]]\nTipperary County Museum tells the history of [[County Tipperary]] from the [[Stone Age]] to the present.

The rugby club was founded in 1892. In 1990 the club opened their new club House coinciding with the first ever [[Soviet Union national rugby union team|Soviet Union rugby team]] visit to Ireland. In their centenary year, 1992, they hosted [[London Irish|London Irish RFC]] against [[Shannon RFC]] in a memorable game played at the club grounds. Clonmel won the Munster Junior Cup for the first time in its 122-year history in 2014 and followed that up with a Munster Junior League (Division 1) title and the Munster Junior Challenge Cup in the 2015 season.\n\n=== Cricket ===\nClonmel's cricket club plays teams in the Munster Cricket Union Senior 2 and Senior 3 leagues. The cricket club currently fields 1 adult teams and 2 youth teams. All play their home games in the Presentation Convent Field. Clonmel's cricket Club was originally started by a group of friends who originally played the game socially, however the club has been playing competitive cricket for the last 20 years.\n\n=== Horse Racing and Coursing ===\nClonmel is noted in [[greyhound]] circles for being the home of the annual National [[Hare Coursing]] meeting in early February at [[Clonmel Racecourse]] located in the Powerstown area of the town. Also Included in this event is the Ladies' International Open Meeting and the coursing derby. At this time each year, Clonmel's population is swollen by a large influx of sports people from Ireland, the UK, and from as far afield as Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the Middle East.\n\n=== Rowing and boat building ===\nClonmel has two clubs associated with recreational activity on the river Suir, both of which are based in Irishtown.\n\n====Clonmel Rowing Club (CRC)====\nClonmel Rowing Club (CRC), was founded in 1869 and is one of the oldest sporting clubs in the town. It is located on Moor's Island, on the [[Suir]], about 500 meters west of the town centre. The club colours are Royal Blue and White. Sporting success in the early 1900s culminated in the winning of the Senior Men's 'eight' championships in 1920. The club is affectionately known locally as \"The Island\". In winter, training takes place on a 4-mile stretch of the river to the west of the town, from the clubhouse to [[Knocklofty, Clonmel|Knocklofty]] bridge. In the summer months this stretch is reduced to 2 miles as far as Sandybanks, near [[Marlfield, Clonmel|Marlfield]] village.\n\nFlooding has become a perennial problem, especially noticeable in recent years. The flow becomes so fast that rowing in January is not possible on this part of the Suir. Within a 25-mile radius there are two locations where the club can still train satisfactorily, [[Cappoquin]] and [[Fiddown]].\n\nCRC has a newly constructed, purpose built boat house since 1979, with boat storage on the ground floor. Upstairs are two [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts, a function hall and dressing rooms. Currently one squash court is being used as the gym.\n\nIn the new millennium, the club's veterans are still competing strongly. Women's rowing in Clonmel has developed culminating in Junior Women's 'double [[scull]]' and Junior women's 'eight' championship wins in 2003 and 2005.\n\n==== Workmen's Boat Club ====\nThe Workmen's Boat Club was established in 1883.

The town is noted in Irish history for its resistance to the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Cromwellian army]] which sacked the towns of [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]]. With the exception of the [[townland]] of Suir Island, most of the borough is situated in the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of \"St Mary's\"<ref>[https://www.logainm.ie/2335.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - St Mary's, Clonmel civil parish</ref> which is part of the ancient [[Barony (Ireland)|barony]] of [[Iffa and Offa East]].\n\n==Population==\nThe 2016 Census used a new boundary created by the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] (CSO) to define the town of Clonmel and Environs resulting in a population figure of 17,140. This new boundary omitted part of the Clonmel Borough Boundary which the CSO had defined as Legal Town for the 2011 census 11.55&nbsp;km/sq. All of the 2011 census CSO environ in Co Waterford have been omitted as well as parts of CSO Environ of Clonmel in Co Tipperary.

It is not clearly known when it got this name; many suppose that it came from the fertility of the soil and the richness of the country in which it is situated.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/historyclonmel00burkgoog History of Clonmel (1907)]</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Old Saint Marys, Clonmel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old St. Mary's Church]]\n\n===Town walls===\nClonmel grew significantly in [[medieval]] times, and many remainders of this period can be found in the town. A small section of the town walls remain in place near [[Old St. Mary's Church (Clonmel)|Old St. Mary's Church]] . This building is one of the main architectural features of the town. It was originally built in the 14th century or earlier but has been reconstructed or renovated on numerous occasions. The church was fortified early in its history, the town being strategically important, initially for the [[Earl of Ormonde (Irish)|Earls of Ormonde]], and later the [[Earl of Kildare]]. Some fortified parts of the church were destroyed or damaged during the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Cromwellian occupation]]. One of the former entry points into the town is now the site of the 'West Gate', a 19th-century reconstruction of an older structure. There were originally three gates in the walled town, North, East and West \u2013 with the South being protected by the river [[Suir]] and the [[Comeragh Mountains]]. The 'West Gate' is now an open arched entrance on to O'Connell street, the main street of the town.\n\n===Corporation regalia===\nUnder a charter granted by [[James I of England]], Clonmel became a [[Borough|Free Borough]] on 5 July 1608, and the Mayor and officers of the town were granted power to \"name, elect and constitute one Swordbearer and three Sergeants-at-Mace\". The present sword and two silver maces date only from Cromwellian times. The sword, of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] manufacture, was donated by Sir Thomas Stanley in 1656 and displays the Arms and motto of the town.

It was proposed that a Liberal and Independent newspaper should be in circulation in the district and Councillor Hackett, having been a printer and bookbinder in the town for some years, stepped forward to take on the task.   The successful newspaper with a circulation of 45,650 in 1829 was an influential and popular voice in supporting liberal causes, yet it was labelled as radical.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1830|title=Article IV - The Leeds Mercury; The Manchester Guardian.|url=|journal=The Westminster Review|volume=Volume 12|pages=82|via=}}</ref>  Its primary intention was to be ''<nowiki/>'The voice of the common people''' and played a highly prominent role in the quest for [[Catholic emancipation|Catholic Emancipation]] as advocated by [[Daniel O'Connell]].  Hackett was sued for libel on multiple occasions for his [[Caricature|caricatures]] of political rivals.  Printed on O'Connell Street bi-weekly, it circulated counties Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork and Limerick.  In its later years it assumed a Catholic-Whig political leaning.

The rugby club was founded in 1892. In 1990 the club opened their new club House coinciding with the first ever [[Soviet Union national rugby union team|Soviet Union rugby team]] visit to Ireland. In their centenary year, 1992, they hosted [[London Irish|London Irish RFC]] against [[Shannon RFC]] in a memorable game played at the club grounds. Clonmel won the Munster Junior Cup for the first time in its 122-year history in 2014 and followed that up with a Munster Junior League (Division 1) title and the Munster Junior Challenge Cup in the 2015 season.\n\n=== Cricket ===\nClonmel's cricket club plays teams in the Munster Cricket Union Senior 2 and Senior 3 leagues. The cricket club currently fields 1 adult teams and 2 youth teams. All play their home games in the Presentation Convent Field. Clonmel's cricket Club was originally started by a group of friends who originally played the game socially, however the club has been playing competitive cricket for the last 20 years.\n\n=== Horse Racing and Coursing ===\nClonmel is noted in [[greyhound]] circles for being the home of the annual National [[Hare Coursing]] meeting in early February at [[Clonmel Racecourse]] located in the Powerstown area of the town. Also Included in this event is the Ladies' International Open Meeting and the coursing derby. At this time each year, Clonmel's population is swollen by a large influx of sports people from Ireland, the UK, and from as far afield as Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the Middle East.\n\n=== Rowing and boat building ===\nClonmel has two clubs associated with recreational activity on the river Suir, both of which are based in Irishtown.\n\n====Clonmel Rowing Club (CRC)====\nClonmel Rowing Club (CRC), was founded in 1869 and is one of the oldest sporting clubs in the town. It is located on Moor's Island, on the [[Suir]], about 500 meters west of the town centre. The club colours are Royal Blue and White. Sporting success in the early 1900s culminated in the winning of the Senior Men's 'eight' championships in 1920. The club is affectionately known locally as \"The Island\". In winter, training takes place on a 4-mile stretch of the river to the west of the town, from the clubhouse to [[Knocklofty, Clonmel|Knocklofty]] bridge. In the summer months this stretch is reduced to 2 miles as far as Sandybanks, near [[Marlfield, Clonmel|Marlfield]] village.\n\nFlooding has become a perennial problem, especially noticeable in recent years. The flow becomes so fast that rowing in January is not possible on this part of the Suir. Within a 25-mile radius there are two locations where the club can still train satisfactorily, [[Cappoquin]] and [[Fiddown]].\n\nCRC has a newly constructed, purpose built boat house since 1979, with boat storage on the ground floor. Upstairs are two [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts, a function hall and dressing rooms. Currently one squash court is being used as the gym.\n\nIn the new millennium, the club's veterans are still competing strongly. Women's rowing in Clonmel has developed culminating in Junior Women's 'double [[scull]]' and Junior women's 'eight' championship wins in 2003 and 2005.\n\n==== Workmen's Boat Club ====\nThe Workmen's Boat Club was established in 1883. The property was leased from the Bagwell estate until 1999, when it was finally purchased by the club. One of the major undertakings of the club in recent years has been the restoration of the historic racing craft ''Cruiskeen'', which was built in the 1840s by GAA founder member [[Maurice Davin]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/seascapes/1173971.html |title=Seascapes News Summary \u2013 26th November 2007 |publisher=RT\u00c9 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |date=27 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503075025/http://www.rte.ie/radio1/seascapes/1173971.html |archivedate=3 May 2008 }}</ref> The project, outsourced to 'Conservation | Letterfrack', took several years of meticulous cleaning, treatment and repair and the 38&nbsp;ft./11.6m timber boat is now on permanent display in the County Museum, Clonmel.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marine Committee of the Heritage Council|author2=Sven Habermann|title=The Future of Maritime and Inland Waterways Collections|editor=Eleanor Flegg|publisher=The Heritage Council|year=2007|isbn=1-901137-99-6|url=http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/Marine/Maritime_Collect_Proceedings.pdf|display-authors=etal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927173626/http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/Marine/Maritime_Collect_Proceedings.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== GAA Clubs ===\nClonmel is home to several [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) clubs.

This field predated the current [[College Park (Charleston)|College Park]] at the same site, which is used as a practice facility for [[The Citadel Bulldogs baseball]]. Due to increasing attendance and the poor state of the stadium, the Bulldogs moved to the original [[Johnson Hagood Stadium (1927)|Johnson Hagood Stadium]] in 1927. In 1948, that stadium was replaced by the current [[Johnson Hagood Stadium]], which lies just to the south of The Citadel's gates in Charleston. \n\n[[File:CitadelStadium.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson Hagood Stadium]]\nJohnson Hagood is a 21,000 seat stadium, in which The Citadel routinely ranks in the top 25 in attendance at the FCS level.  In 2001, the Altman Athletic Center opened in the south end zone, complete with new home and visitor's locker rooms, official's locker rooms, and an upstairs hospitality area for donors.  In 2008, The Citadel completed a re-construction of the west stands and West Side Tower.  The stands contain reserved premium seats and bleacher seats, while the tower, shared with the South Carolina National Guard, contains twelve suites, a club level, and state of the art press box.  During preparation for construction, workers discovered the remains of sailors from failed test runs of the ''[[H.L. Hunley (submarine)|H.L. Hunley]]''.  These remains were reinterred in Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston.\n\nBeginning in 2012, The Citadel implemented a points system for parking and seat selection in Johnson Hagood Stadium, joining many large programs who use similar systems. The program is designed to reward long-time and large donors to The Citadel athletics by giving them preference in selecting seat and parking locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://foundation.citadel.edu/Document.Doc?id=401|title=Priority Points System|publisher=The Citadel|accessdate=2012-05-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, The Citadel determined that lead paint needed remediation on the east (visitor's) side of the stadium.  The work resulted in the entire east side being closed for the first game of the [[2016 The Citadel Bulldogs football team|2016 season]] and some sections being opened for subsequent games.  The capacity was thus 10,500 for the first game and about 15,000 for later games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/20160829/160829380/citadel-considers-tearing-down-visitors-side-at-johnson-hagood-stadium|newspaper=Post and Courier|author=Jeff Hartsell|location=Charleston, SC|date=August 29, 2016|title=Citadel considers tearing down visitors\u2019 side at Johnson Hagood Stadium|accessdate=October 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/20160909/160909467/citadel-football-returns-to-half-of-johnson-hagood-stadium|newspaper=Post and Courier|author=Jeff Hartsell|location=Charleston, SC|date=September 9, 2016|title=Citadel football returns to (half of) Johnson Hagood Stadium|accessdate=October 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/20161011/161019898/citadel-home-at-last-with-nations-best-4-road-wins|newspaper=Post and Courier|author=Jeff Hartsell|location=Charleston, SC|date=October 11, 2016|title=Citadel home at last, with nation\u2019s best 4 road wins|accessdate=October 12, 2016}}</ref>  The Board of Visitors decided to fully renovate the east side of the stadium, announcing that decision on December 2, 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/sports/citadel-notes-stadium-s-east-side-to-be-renovated-georgia/article_9ccf5690-b8ca-11e6-b48e-6b78a3d257d5.html|newspaper=Post and Courier|author=Jeff Hartsell|location=Charleston, SC|date=October 11, 2016|title=Citadel Notes: Stadium's east side to be renovated; Georgia Tech on 2019 schedule}}</ref>\n\n===Practice and on-campus facilities===\nPractices are held at the Maybank Triplets Practice Facility, an artificial turf field at the north edge of campus.

This field predated the current [[College Park (Charleston)|College Park]] at the same site, which is used as a practice facility for [[The Citadel Bulldogs baseball]]. Due to increasing attendance and the poor state of the stadium, the Bulldogs moved to the original [[Johnson Hagood Stadium (1927)|Johnson Hagood Stadium]] in 1927. In 1948, that stadium was replaced by the current [[Johnson Hagood Stadium]], which lies just to the south of The Citadel's gates in Charleston. \n\n[[File:CitadelStadium.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson Hagood Stadium]]\nJohnson Hagood is a 21,000 seat stadium, in which The Citadel routinely ranks in the top 25 in attendance at the FCS level.  In 2001, the Altman Athletic Center opened in the south end zone, complete with new home and visitor's locker rooms, official's locker rooms, and an upstairs hospitality area for donors.  In 2008, The Citadel completed a re-construction of the west stands and West Side Tower.  The stands contain reserved premium seats and bleacher seats, while the tower, shared with the South Carolina National Guard, contains twelve suites, a club level, and state of the art press box.  During preparation for construction, workers discovered the remains of sailors from failed test runs of the ''[[H.L. Hunley (submarine)|H.L. Hunley]]''.  These remains were reinterred in Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston.\n\nBeginning in 2012, The Citadel implemented a points system for parking and seat selection in Johnson Hagood Stadium, joining many large programs who use similar systems. The program is designed to reward long-time and large donors to The Citadel athletics by giving them preference in selecting seat and parking locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://foundation.citadel.edu/Document.Doc?id=401|title=Priority Points System|publisher=The Citadel|accessdate=2012-05-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, The Citadel determined that lead paint needed remediation on the east (visitor's) side of the stadium.  The work resulted in the entire east side being closed for the first game of the [[2016 The Citadel Bulldogs football team|2016 season]] and some sections being opened for subsequent games.  The capacity was thus 10,500 for the first game and about 15,000 for later games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/20160829/160829380/citadel-considers-tearing-down-visitors-side-at-johnson-hagood-stadium|newspaper=Post and Courier|author=Jeff Hartsell|location=Charleston, SC|date=August 29, 2016|title=Citadel considers tearing down visitors\u2019 side at Johnson Hagood Stadium|accessdate=October 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/20160909/160909467/citadel-football-returns-to-half-of-johnson-hagood-stadium|newspaper=Post and Courier|author=Jeff Hartsell|location=Charleston, SC|date=September 9, 2016|title=Citadel football returns to (half of) Johnson Hagood Stadium|accessdate=October 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/20161011/161019898/citadel-home-at-last-with-nations-best-4-road-wins|newspaper=Post and Courier|author=Jeff Hartsell|location=Charleston, SC|date=October 11, 2016|title=Citadel home at last, with nation\u2019s best 4 road wins|accessdate=October 12, 2016}}</ref>  The Board of Visitors decided to fully renovate the east side of the stadium, announcing that decision on December 2, 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/sports/citadel-notes-stadium-s-east-side-to-be-renovated-georgia/article_9ccf5690-b8ca-11e6-b48e-6b78a3d257d5.html|newspaper=Post and Courier|author=Jeff Hartsell|location=Charleston, SC|date=October 11, 2016|title=Citadel Notes: Stadium's east side to be renovated; Georgia Tech on 2019 schedule}}</ref>\n\n===Practice and on-campus facilities===\nPractices are held at the Maybank Triplets Practice Facility, an artificial turf field at the north edge of campus.

Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonised by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as [[Nyasaland]], a [[protectorate]] of the [[United Kingdom]], became a protectorate within the semi-independent [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]. The Federation was dissolved in 1963. In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under [[Queen Elizabeth II]] with the new name Malawi. Two years later it became a republic. Upon gaining independence it became a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[one-party state]] under the [[President of Malawi|presidency]] of [[Hastings Banda]], who remained president until 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hastings-Kamuzu-Banda|title=Hastings Kamuzu Banda &#124; president of Malawi|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/the-cult-of-hastings-banda-takes-hold/article4273860/|title=The cult of Hastings Banda takes hold|via=The Globe and Mail}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/afraf/article/97/387/231/16549|first=John|last=Mccracken|date=1 April 1998|journal=African Affairs|volume=97|issue=387|pages=231\u2013249|via=academic.oup.com|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a007927|title=Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective: The Case of Malawi}}</ref> Malawi now has a [[Democracy|democratic]], [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[Government of Malawi|government]] headed by an elected president, currently [[Peter Mutharika]]. The country has a [[Malawian Defence Force]] that includes an army, a navy and an air wing. Malawi's foreign policy is [[pro-Western]] and includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and participation in several [[international organisation]]s, including the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA), and the [[African Union]] (AU).\n\nMalawi is among the world's [[List of countries by Human Development Index|least-developed countries]]. The [[Economy of Malawi|economy]] is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population that is growing at a rapid rate. The Malawian government depends heavily on outside aid to meet [[economic development|development]] needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, [[environmental protection]], and becoming financially independent amidst widespread unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be improving, with a rise in the economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.\n\nMalawi has a low [[life expectancy]] and high [[infant mortality]]. There is a high prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]], which is a drain on the labour force and government expenditures. There is a diverse population of [[native people]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], with several languages spoken and an array of religious beliefs. Although there was periodic regional conflict fuelled in part by ethnic divisions in the past, by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a Malawian nationality had reemerged.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Malawi}}\n[[File:Chongoni Rock-Art Area-110124.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chongoni Rock Art Area]].]]\nThe area of Africa now known as Malawi had a very small population of [[hunter-gatherer]]s before waves of [[Bantu peoples]] began emigrating from the north around the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Although most of the Bantu peoples continued south, some remained  and founded [[ethnic group]]s based on common ancestry.<ref name=\"Cutter142\">Cutter, ''Africa 2006'', p. 142</ref> By 1500&nbsp;AD, the tribes had established the [[Maravi|Kingdom of Maravi]]  that reached from north of what is now [[Nkhotakota]] to the [[Zambezi River]] and from [[Lake Malawi]] to the [[Luangwa River]] in what is now [[Zambia]].<ref name=\"StateDept\" />\n\nSoon after 1600, with the area mostly united under one native ruler, native tribesmen began encountering, trading with and making alliances with [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders and members of the military. By 1700, however, the empire had broken up into areas controlled by many individual ethnic groups.<ref>Davidson, ''Africa in History'', pp. 164\u2013165</ref> The [[Arab slave trade]] reached its height in the mid-\n1800s, when approximately 20,000 people were enslaved and considered to be carried yearly from Nkhotakota to Kilwa where they were sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5603/ |title=Malawi Slave Routes and Dr. David Livingstone Trail \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Centre |website=Whc.unesco.org |date=9 July 2015 |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nMissionary and explorer [[David Livingstone]] reached Lake Malawi (then Lake Nyasa) in 1859 and identified the [[Shire Highlands]] south of the lake as an area suitable for European settlement. As the result of Livingstone's visit, several Anglican and Presbyterian missions were established in the area in the 1860s and 1870s, the [[African Lakes]] Company Limited was established in 1878 to set up a trade and transport concern working closely with the missions, and a small mission and trading settlement was established at [[Blantyre]] in 1876 and a British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] took up residence there in 1883. The Portuguese government was also interested in the area so, to prevent Portuguese occupation, the British government sent [[Harry Johnston]] as British consul with instructions to make treaties with local rulers beyond Portuguese jurisdiction.<ref>John G Pike, (1969).

The administrators were given a budget of \u00a310,000 (1891 nominal value) per year, which was enough to employ ten European civilians, two military officers, seventy [[Punjab region|Punjab]] [[Sikhs]] and eighty-five [[Zanzibar]] [[porter (carrier)|porters]]. These few employees were then expected to administer and police a territory of around 94,000&nbsp;square kilometres with between one and two million people.<ref>Reader, ''Africa'', p. 579</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the [[Nyasaland African Congress]] (NAC) was formed by the Africans of Nyasaland to promote local interests to the British government.<ref>Murphy, ''Central Africa'', p. 28</ref> In 1953, Britain linked Nyasaland with Northern and Southern [[Rhodesia]] in what was the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], often called the Central African Federation (CAF),<ref name=CA/> for mainly political reasons.<ref>Murphy, ''Central Africa'', p. li</ref> Even though the Federation was semi-independent, the linking provoked opposition from African nationalists, and the NAC gained popular support. An influential opponent of the CAF was Dr. [[Hastings Banda]], a European-trained doctor working in [[Ghana]] who was persuaded to return to Nyasaland in 1958 to assist the nationalist cause. Banda was elected president of the NAC and worked to mobilise nationalist sentiment before being jailed by colonial authorities in 1959. He was released in 1960 and asked to help draft a new constitution for Nyasaland, with a clause granting Africans the majority in the colony's Legislative Council.<ref name=\"Cutter142\" />\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-165-9.jpg|thumb|Malawi's first Prime Minister and later the first [[President of Malawi|President]], [[Hastings Banda]] (left), with Tanzania's President [[Julius Nyerere]]]]\n\nIn 1961, Banda's [[Malawi Congress Party]] (MCP) gained a majority in the [[Nyasaland general election, 1961|Legislative Council elections]] and Banda became [[Prime Minister of Malawi|Prime Minister]] in 1963.

Malawi maintained close [[Malawi\u2013South Africa relations|relations with South Africa]] throughout the [[Apartheid in South Africa|Apartheid]] era, which strained Malawi's relationships with other African countries. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes over the use of the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid.<ref name=\"StateDept\" /> In 2007, Malawi established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/may/07/china-puts-mark-malawi-presence|title= China puts its mark on Malawi|date=7 May 2011|author=Ngozo, Claire|accessdate=20 July 2011|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> In 2011, relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom were damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to Malawi criticised President Mutharika.

Other legal issues included limits on [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and [[freedom of the press]], lengthy pretrial detentions, and [[arbitrary arrest]]s and detentions. Societal issues found included [[violence against women]], [[human trafficking]], and [[child labour]]. Corruption within the government is seen as a major issue, despite the Malawi Anti-Corruption Bureau's (ACB) attempts to reduce it. The ACB appears to be successful at finding and prosecuting low level corruption, but higher level officials appear to be able to act with impunity.

This ongoing flux is the focus of expansive academic research primarily focused on how to improve the status of women in Malawi in the contemporary setting. The status of women throughout the world, including Malawi, is measured using a wide range of indices which cover areas of social, economic, and political contexts. Focusing primarily on the time period between 2010 and the current day, the status of women in Malawi has progressed through several of these indices but has room for growth in several other indices. \u00a0\n\nThe current social status of women in Malawi is effectively estimated through indices such as female access to schooling, [[maternal mortality rate]], and [[life expectancy]] of women from birth. These indices offer a wide lens of information on women\u2019s rights and life in Malawi and offer some understanding of how the status of women can be improved in the years and decades to come. Women\u2019s access to schooling in Malawi as an index highlights how within the state, the ratio of male to female students for many age groups and for total students by gender shows women\u2019s access to schooling maintains on par with men\u2019s access<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://research.acer.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&context=monitoring_learning|title=Girls\u2019 Primary and Secondary Education in\nMalawi: Sector Review|last=Robertson|first=Sally|last2=Cassity|first2=Elizabeth|date=July 28, 2017|website=The Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|last3=Kunkwenzu|first3=Esthery}}</ref>. Female students in Malawi, though, see consistent declines as the age increases, signifying the failure of [[compulsory education]] amongst female students in Malawi<ref name=\":02\" />. Along with the failure of compulsory education to ensure Malawian girls are educated, other indices highlight similar shortcomings with hope for improvement moving forward. This continues with both the life expectancy of females from birth and the maternal mortality rate. The life expectancy of women from birth in Malawi has seen significant growth over the past decade as the life expectancy of women in 2010 was approximately 58 years old whilst the most recent data from 2017 finds that women in Malawi\u2019s average life expectancy grew to 66 years<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?end=2017&locations=MW&start=2010|title=Life expectancy at birth, total (years) - Malawi {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>. Such a positive trajectory for both women\u2019s access to schooling and women\u2019s life expectancy curates an optimistic promise surrounding Malawi which is only hindered by the maternal mortality rate in Malawi which is particularly low even when compared with states at similar points in the development process<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/all/themes/hdr_theme/country-notes/MWI.pdf|title=Inequalities in Human Development in the 21st Century: Malawi|date=2019|website=Human Development Report 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \n\nThe social advances within the state are tied to the continued economic growth for the female population within Malawi. This growth is effectively gauged by indices such as the inheritance rights for women, [[Labor force participation|unemployment and labor force participation]] for females, along with the extent of the [[wage gap]] present between men and women in the Malawian economy. The inheritance rights index gauges the ability of women to effectively own and maintain property in comparison with their male counterparts. The current inheritance rights in Malawi are found to be equal in their dispersion between male/female children and for male/female surviving spouses<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/939291535658711278/pdf/WPS8573.pdf|title=Gender Gaps in Property Ownership\nin Sub-Saharan Africa|last=Gaddis|first=Isis|last2=Lahoti|first2=Rahul|date=August 2018|website=World Bank Group|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|last3=Li|first3=Wenjie}}</ref>. Contrary to the equality found in inheritance rights in Malawi, labour force participation and unemployment highlight the challenges for female employment in the state. The current state of female labour participation details how a higher percentage of the male population is currently employed despite the female population having a higher total employed population and a very similar unemployment rate<ref>{{Cite web|url=file:///Users/brogandice/Downloads/MWI_2012_LFS_Report%202013%20(4).pdf|title=Malawi Labour Force Survey|date=April 2014|website=National Statistical Office|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.

Along with their poor international ranking, the state scores poorly when compared to other [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan countries]] as the highest ranked sub-Saharan state, [[Rwanda]], scored a 0.791 on a 0-1 scale while Malawi scored 0.664<ref name=\":12\" />. These economic indices highlight how despite the rapid social improvements found in Malawi, the economic status of women requires immense growth in order to continue to strive for gender equality. \n\nThe area which holds the most promise for improving the other indices remains the political sector. Despite possessing the greatest potential for growth in the state, the political sector is presented with numerous challenges of its own as several indices highlight. Indices of particular focus include [[Political participation|political participation amongst women]], access to political institutions, and female seats in the [[National Assembly (Malawi)|National Assembly]]. The political participation of women in Malawi as an index is effectively captured through a myriad of sources; these sources come to similar conclusions in regards to the political participation of women. The participation of women in the national political structure has been shown to be weaker than their male counterparts due to the normalization of negative stereotypes which women are not expected to be as politically active as men<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://afrobarometer.org/sites/default/files/media-briefing/malawi/mlw_r6_presentation4_gender.pdf|title=In Malawi, women lag behind men in political participation and activism: Findings from Afrobarometer Round 6 Surveys in Malawi|date=2014|website=Afrobarometer|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.

Production facilities are to be established for a wide range of products within the three selected clusters: oil seed products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. The government estimates that these three clusters have the potential to represent more than 50% of Malawi's exports by 2027. In order to help companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the strategy makes provision for greater access to the outcome of international research and better information about available technologies; it also helps companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from sources such as the country's Export Development Fund and the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund is a competitive facility, through which businesses in Malawi's agricultural and manufacturing sectors can apply for grant funding for innovative projects with potential for making a strong social impact and helping the country to diversify its narrow range of exports. The first round of competitive bidding opened in April 2014.The fund is aligned on the three clusters selected within the country's ''National Export Strategy'': oil seed products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. It provides a matching grant of up to 50% to innovative business projects to help absorb some of the commercial risk in triggering innovation. This support should speed up the implementation of new business models and/or the adoption of technologies. The fund is endowed with US$8 million from the United Nations Development Programme and the UK Department for International Development.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Achievements ===\n[[File:Scientific publication trends in SADC countries, 2005-2014.svg|thumb|Scientific publication trends in the most productive SADC countries, 2005\u20132014.<ref name=t2030/>]]\n\nAmong the notable achievements stemming from the implementation of national policies for science, technology and innovation in recent years are the:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* Establishment, in 2012, of the Malawi University of Science and Technology and the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) to build STI capacity.

Ethnic conflict and continuing migration prevented the formation of a society that was uniquely and cohesively Malawian until the dawn of the 20th&nbsp;century. Over the past century, ethnic distinctions have diminished to the point where there is no significant inter-ethnic friction, although regional divisions still occur. The concept of a Malawian nationality has begun to form around a predominantly rural people who are generally conservative and traditionally nonviolent.

The Federation was dissolved in 1963. In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under [[Queen Elizabeth II]] with the new name Malawi.

The country has a [[Malawian Defence Force]] that includes an army, a navy and an air wing. Malawi's foreign policy is [[pro-Western]] and includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and participation in several [[international organisation]]s, including the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA), and the [[African Union]] (AU).\n\nMalawi is among the world's [[List of countries by Human Development Index|least-developed countries]]. The [[Economy of Malawi|economy]] is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population that is growing at a rapid rate. The Malawian government depends heavily on outside aid to meet [[economic development|development]] needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, [[environmental protection]], and becoming financially independent amidst widespread unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be improving, with a rise in the economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.\n\nMalawi has a low [[life expectancy]] and high [[infant mortality]]. There is a high prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]], which is a drain on the labour force and government expenditures. There is a diverse population of [[native people]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], with several languages spoken and an array of religious beliefs. Although there was periodic regional conflict fuelled in part by ethnic divisions in the past, by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a Malawian nationality had reemerged.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Malawi}}\n[[File:Chongoni Rock-Art Area-110124.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chongoni Rock Art Area]].]]\nThe area of Africa now known as Malawi had a very small population of [[hunter-gatherer]]s before waves of [[Bantu peoples]] began emigrating from the north around the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Although most of the Bantu peoples continued south, some remained  and founded [[ethnic group]]s based on common ancestry.<ref name=\"Cutter142\">Cutter, ''Africa 2006'', p. 142</ref> By 1500&nbsp;AD, the tribes had established the [[Maravi|Kingdom of Maravi]]  that reached from north of what is now [[Nkhotakota]] to the [[Zambezi River]] and from [[Lake Malawi]] to the [[Luangwa River]] in what is now [[Zambia]].<ref name=\"StateDept\" />\n\nSoon after 1600, with the area mostly united under one native ruler, native tribesmen began encountering, trading with and making alliances with [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders and members of the military.

Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries.

This ongoing flux is the focus of expansive academic research primarily focused on how to improve the status of women in Malawi in the contemporary setting. The status of women throughout the world, including Malawi, is measured using a wide range of indices which cover areas of social, economic, and political contexts. Focusing primarily on the time period between 2010 and the current day, the status of women in Malawi has progressed through several of these indices but has room for growth in several other indices. \u00a0\n\nThe current social status of women in Malawi is effectively estimated through indices such as female access to schooling, maternal mortality rate, and life expectancy of women from birth. These indices offer a wide lens of information on women\u2019s rights and life in Malawi and offer some understanding of how the status of women can be improved in the years and decades to come. Women\u2019s access to schooling in Malawi as an index highlights how within the state, the ratio of male to female students for many age groups and for total students by gender shows women\u2019s access to schooling maintains on par with men\u2019s access<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://research.acer.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&context=monitoring_learning|title=Girls\u2019 Primary and Secondary Education in\nMalawi: Sector Review|last=Robertson|first=Sally|last2=Cassity|first2=Elizabeth|date=July 28, 2017|website=The Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|last3=Kunkwenzu|first3=Esthery}}</ref>. Female students in Malawi, though, see consistent declines as the age increases, signifying the failure of compulsory education amongst female students in Malawi<ref name=\":02\" />. Along with the failure of compulsory education to ensure Malawian girls are educated, other indices highlight similar shortcomings with hope for improvement moving forward. This continues with both the life expectancy of females from birth and the maternal mortality rate. The life expectancy of women from birth in Malawi has seen significant growth over the past decade as the life expectancy of women in 2010 was approximately 58 years old whilst the most recent data from 2017 finds that women in Malawi\u2019s average life expectancy grew to 66 years<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?end=2017&locations=MW&start=2010|title=Life expectancy at birth, total (years) - Malawi {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>. Such a positive trajectory for both women\u2019s access to schooling and women\u2019s life expectancy curates an optimistic promise surrounding Malawi which is only hindered by the maternal mortality rate in Malawi which is particularly low even when compared with states at similar points in the development process<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/all/themes/hdr_theme/country-notes/MWI.pdf|title=Inequalities in Human Development in the 21st Century: Malawi|date=2019|website=Human Development Report 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \n\nThe social advances within the state are tied to the continued economic growth for the female population within Malawi. This growth is effectively gauged by indices such as the inheritance rights for women, unemployment and labor force participation for females, along with the extent of the wage gap present between men and women in the Malawian economy. The inheritance rights index gauges the ability of women to effectively own and maintain property in comparison with their male counterparts. The current inheritance rights in Malawi are found to be equal in their dispersion between male/female children and for male/female surviving spouses<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/939291535658711278/pdf/WPS8573.pdf|title=Gender Gaps in Property Ownership\nin Sub-Saharan Africa|last=Gaddis|first=Isis|last2=Lahoti|first2=Rahul|date=August 2018|website=World Bank Group|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|last3=Li|first3=Wenjie}}</ref>.

These economic indices highlight how despite the rapid social improvements found in Malawi, the economic status of women requires immense growth in order to continue to strive for gender equality. \n\nThe area which holds the most promise for improving the other indices remains the political sector. Despite possessing the greatest potential for growth in the state, the political sector is presented with numerous challenges of its own as several indices highlight. Indices of particular focus include political participation amongst women, access to political institutions, and female seats in the national parliament. The political participation of women in Malawi as an index is effectively captured through a myriad of sources; these sources come to similar conclusions in regards to the political participation of women. The participation of women in the national political structure has been shown to be weaker than their male counterparts due to the normalization of negative stereotypes which women are not expected to be as politically active as men<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://afrobarometer.org/sites/default/files/media-briefing/malawi/mlw_r6_presentation4_gender.pdf|title=In Malawi, women lag behind men in political participation and activism: Findings from Afrobarometer Round 6 Surveys in Malawi|date=2014|website=Afrobarometer|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.

This limited participation is directly correlated to the limited positions which are occupied by women in the national setup.

This corresponds to $7.8 per researcher (in current purchasing parity dollars).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 2014, Malawian scientists had the third-largest output in Southern Africa, in terms of articles catalogued in international journals. They published 322 articles in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index expanded) that year, almost triple the number in 2005 (116). Only South Africa (9,309) and the United Republic of Tanzania (770) published more in Southern Africa. Malawian scientists publish more in mainstream journals \u2013 relative to GDP \u2013 than any other country of a similar population size. This is impressive, even if the country's publication density remains modest, with just 19 publications per million inhabitants catalogued in international journals in 2014. The average for sub-Saharan Africa is 20 publications per million inhabitants.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Policy framework ===\nMalawi's first science and technology policy dates from 1991 and was revised in 2002. The ''National Science and Technology Policy'' of 2002 envisaged the establishment of a National Commission for Science and Technology to advise the government and other stakeholders on science and technology-led development. Although the Science and Technology Act of 2003 made provision for the creation of this commission, it only became operational in 2011, with a secretariat resulting from the merger of the Department of Science and Technology and the National Research Council. The Science and Technology Act of 2003 also established a Science and Technology Fund to finance research and studies through government grants and loans but, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, this was not yet operational. The Secretariat of the National Commission for Science and Technology has reviewed the ''Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation'' (2011\u20132015) but, as of early 2015, the revised policy had not yet met with Cabinet approval.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMalawi is conscious of the need to attract more foreign investment to foster technology transfer, develop human capital and empower the private sector to drive economic growth. In 2012, most foreign investment flowed to infrastructure (62%) and the energy sector (33%). The government has introduced a series of fiscal incentives, including tax breaks, to attract more foreign investors. In 2013, the Malawi Investment and Trade Centre put together an investment portfolio spanning 20 companies in the country's six major economic growth sectors, namely:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n* agriculture;\n* manufacturing;\n* energy (bio-energy, mobile electricity);\n*[https://www.malawitourism.com tourism] (ecolodges);\n* infrastructure (wastewater services, fibre optic cables, etc.); and\n* mining.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Life sciences and geosciences dominate, Cumulative totals by field, 2008\u20132014.svg|Scientific research output in terms of publications in Southern Africa, cumulative totals by field, 2008\u20132014.<ref>{{Cite book|title= UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 |date=2015|chapter= Figure 20.6}}</ref>\nFile:Researchers (HC) in Southern Africa per million inhabitants, 2013 or closest year.svg|Researchers (HC) in Southern Africa per million inhabitants, 2013 or closest year\nFile:Seychelles and South Africa have the most publications per million inhabitants.svg|Scientific publications per million inhabitants in SADC countries in 2014.<ref name=t2030/><ref name=\"Web\">{{Cite book |title= Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Science Citation Index Expanded}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\nIn 2013, the government adopted a ''National Export Strategy'' to diversify the country's exports. Production facilities are to be established for a wide range of products within the three selected clusters: oil seed products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. The government estimates that these three clusters have the potential to represent more than 50% of Malawi's exports by 2027. In order to help companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the strategy makes provision for greater access to the outcome of international research and better information about available technologies; it also helps companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from sources such as the country's Export Development Fund and the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund is a competitive facility, through which businesses in Malawi's agricultural and manufacturing sectors can apply for grant funding for innovative projects with potential for making a strong social impact and helping the country to diversify its narrow range of exports. The first round of competitive bidding opened in April 2014.The fund is aligned on the three clusters selected within the country's ''National Export Strategy'': oil seed products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. It provides a matching grant of up to 50% to innovative business projects to help absorb some of the commercial risk in triggering innovation. This support should speed up the implementation of new business models and/or the adoption of technologies. The fund is endowed with US$8 million from the United Nations Development Programme and the UK Department for International Development.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Achievements ===\n[[File:Scientific publication trends in SADC countries, 2005-2014.svg|thumb|Scientific publication trends in the most productive SADC countries, 2005\u20132014.<ref name=t2030/>]]\n\nAmong the notable achievements stemming from the implementation of national policies for science, technology and innovation in recent years are the:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* Establishment, in 2012, of the Malawi University of Science and Technology and the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) to build STI capacity.

There are four public universities in Malawi: [[Mzuzu University]] (MZUNI), Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR), the [[University of Malawi]] (UNIMA) and [[Malawi University of Science and Technology]] (MUST). There are also private universities, such as Livingstonia, Malawi Lakeview, Catholic University of Malawi, Central Christian University, African Bible College, UNICAF University, and MIM. The entry requirement is six credits on the Malawi School Certificate of Education, which is equivalent to O levels.\n\n==Military==\n{{Main|Malawian Defence Force}}\n\nMalawi maintains a small standing military of approximately 25,000 men, the [[Malawian Defence Force]]. It consists of army, navy and air force elements. The Malawi army originated from [[British Army|British colonial units]] formed before independence, and is now made up of two rifle regiments and one parachute regiment. The Malawi Air Force was established with German help in 1976, and operates a small number of transport aircraft and multi-purpose helicopters. The Malawian Navy has three vessels operating on Lake Malawi, based in [[Monkey Bay]].<ref name=\"Turner22\">Turner, ''The Statesman's Yearbook'', p. 822</ref> In 2017, Malawi signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Music of Malawi|Malawian cuisine}}\n[[File:Malawi n3.jpg|thumb|upright|A Malawian man playing a [[xylophone]]]]\n\nThe name \"Malawi\" comes from the [[Maravi]], a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people who emigrated from the southern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] around 1400&nbsp;AD. Upon reaching northern Lake Malawi, the group divided, with one group moving south down the west bank of the lake to become the group known as the [[Chewa people|Chewa]], while the other group, the ancestors of today's Nyanja, moved along the east side of the lake to the southern section of Malawi. Ethnic conflict and continuing migration prevented the formation of a society that was uniquely and cohesively Malawian until the dawn of the 20th&nbsp;century. Over the past century, ethnic distinctions have diminished to the point where there is no significant inter-ethnic friction, although regional divisions still occur. The concept of a Malawian nationality has begun to form around a predominantly rural people who are generally conservative and traditionally nonviolent. The \"Warm Heart of Africa\" nickname is not due to the hot weather of the country, but due to the kind, loving nature of the Malawian people.<ref name=\"StateDept\" />\n\nFrom 1964 to 2010, and again since 2012, the [[Flag of Malawi]] is made up of three equal horizontal stripes of black, red and green with a red rising sun superimposed in the center of the black stripe.

Starbuck Island was mined for [[phosphate]] between 1870 and 1893. Because of its low profile (at its highest point, the island rises to about 5 meters) and the dangerous surrounding reefs, a number of ships were wrecked at Starbuck Island in the late 19th century, including the French transport ''Euryale'' on March 10, 1870. The captain of this ship, the future contre-admiral Albert Des Portes, who stayed 35 days with his crew on the atoll before being rescued and coming back to France with all the members, finally found the right geographical location of the island. On August 7, 1896 the Norwegian ship \"Seladon\" was wrecked against the barrier. The crew went into the lifeboats and drifted for 30 days until they landed on the island of [[Niulakita]], Tuvalu. For 10 months they lived together with a few natives until they were picked up by a ship and rescued.<ref name=\"SN\">{{cite book|last1= Wincent Rege, Malvin Rege & Eli Rege|first1=|authorlink1= |title= The wreck of the Seladon: A true survival on an island story|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 2012 |publisher= CreateSpace|location= |language= |isbn=978-1470002459|oclc= |doi= |id= |page=|pages=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}</ref>\n\nThe island formed a part of the British [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony]] prior to the independence of Kiribati in 1979.
