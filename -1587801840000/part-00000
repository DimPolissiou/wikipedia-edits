It features a hydraulically retractable tricycle-type landing gear. The single-wheeled main units retract inward and the twin nose wheel unit retracts forward. About a quarter of the aircraft's line replaceable units are common between it and the [[HAL Tejas]] trainer variant.\n\nIn the cockpit, the HJT-36 has a conventional tandem two-seat configuration with the trainee pilot forward and the instructor in the raised seat to the rear. The single-piece canopy gives both pilots good, all-round vision. The prototype aircraft used [[NPP Zvezda|Zvezda]] K-26LT lightweight [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s. However, these may be replaced with [[Martin-Baker]] Mk.16 IN16S seats, due to a price escalation of the former.<ref name=\"supplier\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airframer.com/aircraft_detail.html?program=641|title=HAL HJT-36 Sitara - program supplier guide|website=www.airframer.com}}</ref> The pilots have both conventional and manual flight controls.<ref name=at-hjt/>\n\nThe trainer has a full glass cockpit with a layout similar to current generation combat aircraft. It uses an integrated digital avionics system from [[GE Aviation Systems]]. Head-up display and repeater is produced by [[Elbit Systems]].<ref name=supplier/>\n\nThe aircraft has five external hardpoints for weapons-training. There is one centre-line hardpoint under the fuselage and two weapon pylons under each wing for carrying rockets, gun pods and bombs. The maximum external payload is 1,000&nbsp;kg.\n\nThe prototype aircraft were initially powered by a [[SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac 04-H-20]] non-afterburning [[turbofan]] developing 14.12&nbsp;kN of thrust. All production models will use the more powerful [[NPO Saturn AL-55I]] engine with about 16.9&nbsp;kN of thrust, as stipulated by the 2005 air staff requirements from the Air Force.\n\n== Specifications (HJT-36, prototypes) ==\n[[File:Profil HAL HJT-36.png|right|300px]]\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=Jane's All the World's Aircraft<ref name=\"jawa-1617\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Jackson|editor1-first=Paul|editor2-last=Peacock|editor2-first=Lindsay|editor3-last=Bushell|editor3-first=Susan|editor4-last=Willis|editor4-first=David|editor5-last=Winchester|editor5-first=Jim|title=IHS Jane's All the World's Aircraft: Development & Production|date=2016\u20132017|location=Couldson|isbn=978-0710631770|page=304|chapter=India}}</ref>\n|prime units?=met<!-- imp or kts first for US aircraft, and UK aircraft pre-metrification, \nmet(ric) first for all others.

The 16th-century [[Babri Masjid|Babri Mosque]] in the city of [[Ayodhya]], in [[Uttar Pradesh]] was targeted after a political rally organised by [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalist]] organisations turned violent.\n\nIn Hindu tradition, the city of Ayodhya is the birthplace of [[Rama]]. In the 16th century a [[Mughal Army|Mughal]] general, [[Mir Baqi]], had built a mosque, known as the Babri Masjid at a site identified by some Hindus as ''[[Ram Janmabhoomi]]'', or the birthplace of Rama. The [[Archaeological Survey of India]] states that the mosque was built on land where a non-Islamic structure had previously existed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/babri-masjid-not-built-on-vacant-land-artefacts-reveal-non-islamic-structure-supreme-court/story/389449.html|title=Babri Masjid not built on vacant land, artefacts reveal non-Islamic structure: Supreme Court|website=www.businesstoday.in|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/supreme-court-judgment-ends-several-speculations-asi-team-chief-1617499-2019-11-10|title=Supreme Court judgment on Ayodhya ends several speculation: ASI team chief|last=DelhiNovember 10|first=Rahul Shrivastava New|last2=November 10|first2=2019UPDATED|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10|last3=Ist|first3=2019 09:52}}</ref> In the 1980s, the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a temple dedicated to Rama at the site, with the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) as its political voice. Several rallies and marches were held as a part of this movement, including the ''[[Ram Rath Yatra]]'' led by [[L. K. Advani]].\n\nOn 6 December 1992 the VHP and the BJP organised a rally at the site involving 150,000 volunteers, known as ''[[Kar Sevak|kar sevaks]]''. The rally turned violent, and the crowd overwhelmed security forces and tore down the mosque. A subsequent inquiry into the incident found 68 people responsible, including several leaders of the BJP and the VHP. The demolition resulted in several months of [[Communal violence|intercommunal rioting]] between India's [[Hinduism in India|Hindu]] and [[Islam in India|Muslim]] communities, causing the death of at least 2,000 people. Retaliatory violence against Hindus also occurred in Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\n==Background==\n{{Ayodhya debate}}\n{{Main|Ayodhya dispute}}\nIn Hinduism the birthplace of the deity [[Rama]], known as \"[[Ram Janmabhoomi]]\", is considered a holy site.

V. Narasimha Rao]] handled the issue.

The RSS, BJP, VHP and the [[Bajrang Dal]] leaders present in the meeting amply agreed to work in a well-orchestrated manner.\" Claiming that the tapes of the meeting were personally handed over by him to his boss, he asserts that he has no doubts that his boss had shared the contents with the Prime Minister (Rao) and the Home Minister ([[Shankarrao Chavan]]).

The 16th-century [[Babri Masjid|Babri Mosque]] in the city of [[Ayodhya]], in [[Uttar Pradesh]] was targeted after a political rally organised by [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalist]] organisations turned violent.\n\nIn Hindu tradition, the city of Ayodhya is the birthplace of [[Rama]]. In the 16th century a [[Mughal Army|Mughal]] general, [[Mir Baqi]], had built a mosque, known as the Babri Masjid at a site identified by some Hindus as ''[[Ram Janmabhoomi]]'', or the birthplace of Rama. The [[Archaeological Survey of India]] states that the mosque was built on land where a non-Islamic structure had previously existed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/babri-masjid-not-built-on-vacant-land-artefacts-reveal-non-islamic-structure-supreme-court/story/389449.html|title=Babri Masjid not built on vacant land, artefacts reveal non-Islamic structure: Supreme Court|website=www.businesstoday.in|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/supreme-court-judgment-ends-several-speculations-asi-team-chief-1617499-2019-11-10|title=Supreme Court judgment on Ayodhya ends several speculation: ASI team chief|last=DelhiNovember 10|first=Rahul Shrivastava New|last2=November 10|first2=2019UPDATED|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10|last3=Ist|first3=2019 09:52}}</ref> In the 1980s, the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a temple dedicated to Rama at the site, with the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) as its political voice. Several rallies and marches were held as a part of this movement, including the ''[[Ram Rath Yatra]]'' led by [[L. K. Advani]].\n\nOn 6 December 1992 the VHP and the BJP organised a rally at the site involving 150,000 volunteers, known as ''[[Kar Sevak|kar sevaks]]''. The rally turned violent, and the crowd overwhelmed security forces and tore down the mosque. A subsequent inquiry into the incident found 68 people responsible, including several leaders of the BJP and the VHP. The demolition resulted in several months of [[Communal violence|intercommunal rioting]] between India's [[Hinduism in India|Hindu]] and [[Islam in India|Muslim]] communities, causing the death of at least 2,000 people. Retaliatory violence against Hindus also occurred in Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\n==Background==\n{{Ayodhya debate}}\n{{Main|Ayodhya dispute}}\nIn Hinduism the birthplace of the deity [[Rama]], known as \"[[Ram Janmabhoomi]]\", is considered a holy site.

The RSS, BJP, VHP and the [[Bajrang Dal]] leaders present in the meeting amply agreed to work in a well-orchestrated manner.\" Claiming that the tapes of the meeting were personally handed over by him to his boss, he asserts that he has no doubts that his boss had shared the contents with the Prime Minister (Rao) and the Home Minister ([[Shankarrao Chavan]]).

Since [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] have lost the final of the [[2008\u201309 Greek Cup]] to Champions League-bound [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], all three Greek Europa League spots (two via league, one via domestic cup) were allotted according to the position of the respective teams in the play-off.<!--\nadjust_points parameter denotes starting points for the first three teams\n-->\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|section=Play-offs\n|res_col_header=Q\n|highest_pos=2\n|team2=PAT\n|team3=AEK\n|team4=PAOK\n|team5=LAR\n\n|win_PAT=5|draw_PAT=1|loss_PAT=0|gf_PAT=12|ga_PAT=3|adjust_points_PAT=2\n|win_AEK=3|draw_AEK=2|loss_AEK=1|gf_AEK=8|ga_AEK=6|adjust_points_AEK=1\n|win_PAOK=2|draw_PAOK=0|loss_PAOK=4|gf_PAOK=5|ga_PAOK=9|adjust_points_PAOK=3\n|win_LAR=0|draw_LAR=1|loss_LAR=5|gf_LAR=3|ga_LAR=10\n|col_CL3=green2|text_CL3=Qualification for [[2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|Champions League third qualifying round]]\n|result2=CL3\n|col_ELPR=blue1|text_ELPR=Qualification for [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League#Play-off round|Europa League play-off round]]\n|result3=ELPR\n|col_EL3=blue2|text_EL3=Qualification for [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League#Third qualifying round|Europa League third qualifying round]]\n|result4=EL3\n|col_EL2=blue3|text_EL2=Qualification for [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League#Second qualifying round|Europa League second qualifying round]]\n|result5=EL2\n\n|class_rules=1) points;

Its participants have entered the mini-league with a number of bonus points based on their regular season record. Every team had the number of points earned by the fifth-placed team subtracted from its own number of points.

His mother was Minnie Summerfield.  His father, Robert Wolfenden Kenny (1863-1914) was a successful [[banker]] and civic leader in Los Angeles and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]]. Kenny's grandfather, George L. Kenny, arrived in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] in the early 1850s with his friends, the brothers A.L. Bancroft and [[Hubert Howe Bancroft]]. The three men formed a partnership and established the first bookstore in San Francisco.<ref name=\"Kenny\"/>  In 1921, Kenny graduated at 18 from [[Stanford University]].<ref name=NYTobit/><ref name=OAC-Kenny/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Press===\n[[File:JamesRolphJr.jpg|thumb|right|Kenny rose to power on the coattails of [[James Rolph]] by supporting him for California governor in 1930]]\nIn 1921, Kenny joined the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', where he worked with [[Chapin Hall]], and eventually became a financial editor there.  In 1922, he joined [[United Press]] news service.  He then worked for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in Paris.  In 1923, he returned to Los Angeles and worked for ''United News''.  He then opened his own press service with Ted Taylor, called the Los Angeles Press Service, while also working the for the ''[[Los Angeles Express (newspaper)|Los Angeles Express]]''.

He restructured the [[California Department of Justice]] (DOJ) to be similar to the [[United States Department of Justice]]; for example, he transferred the California DOJ main office from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] closer to the state legislature in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and created [[civil service]] positions instead of political appointments within the California DOJ. He also was instrumental in abolishing the legal existence of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in California.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nKenny also served as a Municipal Court Judge and later a [[Los Angeles County Superior Court|Superior Court]] Judge in [[Los Angeles, California]].

Kenny's grandfather, George L. Kenny, arrived in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] in the early 1850s with his friends, the brothers A.L. Bancroft and [[Hubert Howe Bancroft]].

He then opened his own press service with Ted Taylor, called the Los Angeles Press Service, while also working the for the ''[[Los Angeles Express (newspaper)|Los Angeles Express]]''.
