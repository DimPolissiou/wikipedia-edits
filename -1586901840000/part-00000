He is best known for his leadership of [[Canada during World War I]].\n\nBorden was born in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia]]. He worked as a schoolteacher for a period and then served his [[Articled clerk|articles of clerkship]] at a [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] law firm. He was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1878, and soon became one of Nova Scotia's most prominent barristers. Borden was elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in 1896, representing the [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867\u20131942)|Conservative Party]]. He replaced [[Charles Tupper]] as party leader in 1901, and became prime minister after the party's victory at the [[1911 Canadian federal election|1911 federal election]].\n\nAs prime minister, Borden led Canada through World War I and its immediate aftermath. His government passed the ''[[War Measures Act]]'', created the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]], and eventually introduced [[Military Service Act (Canada)|compulsory military service]], which sparked the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|1917 conscription crisis]]. On the home front, it dealt with the consequences of the [[Halifax Explosion]], introduced [[Women's suffrage in Canada|women's suffrage]] for federal elections, and used the [[North-West Mounted Police]] to break up the 1919 [[Winnipeg general strike]]. For the [[1917 Canadian federal election|1917 federal election]] (the first in six years), Borden created the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist Party]], an amalgam of Conservatives and pro-conscription [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]]; his government was re-elected with an overwhelming majority.\n\nBorden retired from politics in 1920, having accepted a knighthood in 1915 \u2013 the last Canadian prime minister to be knighted. He was also the last prime minister born before [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], and is the most recent Nova Scotian to hold the office. His portrait has appeared on [[Canadian hundred-dollar note|Canadian one hundred-dollar note]]s produced since 1976, but in late 2016 the government announced Borden's image would be removed during the next redesign.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\">{{cite news |title=Viola Desmond to appear on new Canadian banknote |first=Joanna |last=Smith |via=The Canadian Press |date=December 8, 2016 |publisher=CTV News |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/viola-desmond-to-appear-on-new-canadian-banknote-1.3194561}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nRobert Laird Borden was born and educated in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia]], a farming community at the eastern end of the [[Annapolis Valley]], where his great-grandfather Perry Borden, Sr. of [[Tiverton, Rhode Island]], had taken up [[Acadian]] land in 1760 as one of the [[New England Planters]]. The Borden family had immigrated from [[Headcorn, Kent]], England, to New England in the 1600s.  Also arriving in this group was a great-great-grandfather, [[Robert Denison]], who had come from Connecticut at about the same time. Perry had accompanied his father, Samuel Borden, the chief surveyor chosen by the government of [[Massachusetts]] to survey the former Acadian land and draw up new lots for the [[New England Planters|Planters]] in Nova Scotia. Through the marriage of his patrilineal ancestor Richard Borden to Innocent Cornell, Borden is descendant from [[Thomas Cornell (settler)|Thomas Cornell]] of [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island]].<ref>[https://web2.americanancestors.org/Browse/articles?searchby=author&subquery=Richard%20E.%20Brenneman&id=988 Notable Kin - New England in Hollywood, Part Three: The Possible Rhode Island Ancestry of Marilyn Monroe] New England Historical Genealogical Society.</ref>\n\nBorden's father Andrew Borden was judged by his son to be \"a man of good ability and excellent judgement\", of a \"calm, contemplative and philosophical\" turn of mind, but \"he lacked energy and had no great aptitude for affairs\". His mother Eunice Jane Laird was more driven, possessing \"very strong character, remarkable energy, high ambition and unusual ability\". Her ambition was transmitted to her first-born child, who applied himself to his studies while assisting his parents with the farm work he found so disagreeable. His cousin [[Frederick William Borden|Sir Frederick Borden]] was a prominent [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] politician.<ref>{{cite DCB |title=Borden, Sir Frederick William |first=Carman |last=Miller |author-link=Carman Miller |volume=XIV |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/borden_frederick_william_14E.html7}}</ref>\n\nRobert Borden was the last Canadian Prime Minister born before [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]].<ref>Thornton, Martin.

Seeing no future in teaching, he returned to Nova Scotia in 1874. Despite having no formal university education, he went to [[Articled clerk|article]] for four years at a [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] law firm. In August 1878, he was called to the Nova Scotia Bar, placing first in the bar examinations. Borden went to [[Kentville, Nova Scotia]], as the junior partner of the Conservative lawyer [[John&nbsp;P. Chipman]]. In 1880, he was inducted into the [[Freemason]]s&nbsp;\u2013 St Andrew's lodge #1.<ref>[http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/prime_ministers/borden_r/borden_r.html Sir Robert Laird Borden<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.freemasonry.bcy.ca</ref>\n\nIn 1882, he was asked by Wallace Graham to move to Halifax and join the Conservative law firm headed by Graham and Charles Hibbert Tupper. In the Autumn of 1889, when he was only 35, Borden became the senior partner following the departure of Graham and Tupper for the bench and politics, respectively. His financial future guaranteed, on September 25, 1889, he married [[Laura Bond]] (1863\u20131940), the daughter of a Halifax hardware merchant. They would have no children.  In 1894, he bought a large property and home on the south side of Quinpool Road, which the couple called \"Pinehurst\". In 1893, Borden successfully argued the first of two cases which he took to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. He represented many of the important Halifax businesses, and sat on the boards of Nova Scotian companies including the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]] and the [[Crown Life Insurance Company]]. In 1896, he became President of the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society, and took the initiative in organizing the founding meetings of the [[Canadian Bar Association]] in [[Montreal]] within the same year.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} By the time he was prevailed upon to enter politics, Borden had what some{{who|date=January 2015}} judged to be the largest legal practice in the Maritime Provinces, and had become a wealthy man.\n\n==Conservative Party in opposition==\n[[File:Robert Borden & Winston Churchill 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|Borden and [[Winston Churchill]] in 1912]]\nBorden was a Liberal until he broke with the party in [[1891 Canadian federal election|1891]] over the issue of [[Reciprocity (Canadian politics)|Reciprocity]].\n\nHe was elected to Parliament in the [[1896 Canadian federal election|1896 federal election]] as a Conservative and in 1901 was selected by the Conservative caucus to succeed Sir [[Charles Tupper]] as leader of the Conservative Party. He was defeated in his Halifax seat in the [[1904 Canadian federal election|1904 federal election]] and re-entered the House of Commons the next year via a by-election in [[Carleton (Ontario electoral district)|Carleton]]. Over the next decade he worked to rebuild the party and establish a reform policy, the [[Halifax Platform]] of 1907 which he described as \"the most advanced and progressive policy ever put forward in Federal affairs\". It called for reform of the Senate and the civil service, a more selective immigration policy, free rural mail delivery, and government regulation of telegraphs, telephones, and railways and eventually national ownership of telegraphs and telephones. Despite his efforts, his party lost the [[1908 Canadian federal election|1908 federal election]] to [[Wilfrid Laurier]]'s Liberals.<ref name=\"biographi1\">{{cite DCB|last=Brown|first=Robert Craig|title=Borden, Sir Robert Laird|volume=16|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/borden_robert_laird_16E.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sir-robert-borden |title=Robert Borden |last=Brown|first=Robert Craig|first2=Tabitha |last2=Marshall |work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |date=April 21, 2015 |orig-year=February 21, 2008}}</ref> Borden was however elected again for [[Halifax (electoral district)|Halifax]]. His party's fortunes turned around in the [[1911 Canadian federal election|1911 federal election]], however, when the Conservatives successfully campaigned against Laurier's proposals for a [[Reciprocity (Canadian politics)|Reciprocity]] ([[free trade]]) agreement with the United States. Borden countered with a revised version of John A. Macdonald's [[National Policy]] and appeals of loyalty to the [[British Empire]] and ran on the slogan \"Canadianism or Continentalism\".<ref name=\"biographi1\"/> In British Columbia, the party ran on the slogan \"A White Canada\", playing to the fears of British Columbians that resented the increasing presence of cheap Asian labour and the resulting depression in wages.<ref>Last Steps to Freedom by John Boyko pg.46</ref> In Quebec, concurrently, [[Henri Bourassa]] led a campaign against what he saw as Laurier's capitulation to British imperialism, playing a part in the defeat of Laurier's government and the election of Borden's Tories.\n\n==Prime Minister (1911\u20131920)==\n\n{{See also|Electoral history of Robert Borden}}\n\nBorden served as Prime Minister for the duration of the [[12th Parliament of Canada]], and for most of the [[13th Parliament of Canada]], before his retirement from active political life in July 1920.\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:BordenVictoryBondCampaignToronto.jpg|thumb|left|Borden at a [[War bond|Victory Bonds]] campaign in [[Toronto]], 1915]]\nAs [[Prime Minister of Canada]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], he transformed his government to a wartime administration, passing the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' in 1914. Borden committed Canada to provide half a million soldiers for the war effort. However, volunteers had quickly dried up when Canadians realized there would be no quick end to the war. Borden's determination to meet that huge commitment led to the ''[[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]]'' and the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], which split the country on linguistic lines.<ref name=conscript>{{cite journal|last1=Dennis|first1=Patrick M.|title=1918: Year of the Conscript|journal=[[Canada's History]]|date=Apr-May 2018|volume=98|issue=2|pages=40\u201347|issn=1920-9894|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/canadas-history/20180401/281522226622753}}</ref>  In 1917 Borden recruited members of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] (with the notable exception of leader Wilfrid Laurier) to create a [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] government. The [[1917 Canadian federal election|1917 election]] saw the \"Government\" candidates (including a number of [[Liberal-Unionist]]s) crush the Opposition \"[[Laurier Liberals]]\" in [[English Canada]] resulting in a large parliamentary majority for Borden.\n[[File:Joinville-le-Pont - Cont. Sir Robt Borden, Col. Beauchamp, O.C. Joinville-le-Pont - suite - sir Robert Borden, le col Beauchamp, cmdt.jpg|upright|thumb|Sir Robert Borden (right) at the official opening of No. 6 Canadian General Hospital, Joinville-le-Pont, France, July 1918]]\n\nSir Robert Borden pledged himself during the campaign to equal suffrage for women. With his return to power, he introduced a bill in 1918 for extending the franchise to women. This passed without division.\n\nThe war effort also enabled Canada to assert itself as an independent power. Borden wanted to create a single Canadian army, rather than have Canadian soldiers split up and assigned to British divisions as had happened during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. [[Sam Hughes]], the Minister of Militia, generally ensured that Canadians were well-trained and prepared to fight in their own divisions, although with mixed results such as the [[Ross Rifle]]. [[Arthur Currie]] provided sensible leadership for the Canadian divisions in Europe, although they were still under overall British command. Nevertheless, Canadian troops proved themselves to be among the best in the world, fighting at the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme]], [[Ypres]], [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], and especially at the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]].\n\nDuring Borden's first term as Prime Minister, the [[National Research Council of Canada]] was established in 1916.\n\n===Borden and the Treaty of Versailles===\nIn world affairs, Borden played a crucial role (according to McMillan) in transforming the British Empire into a partnership of equal states, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a term that was first discussed at an [[Imperial Conference]] in [[London]] during the war. Borden also introduced the first Canadian [[income tax]] under Income War Tax Act of 1917, which was then meant to be temporary but later became permanent.\n\nConvinced that Canada had become a nation on the battlefields of Europe, Borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. This was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which perceived such a delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost a far larger proportion of its men compared to the US in the war (although not more in absolute numbers), Canada at least had the right to the representation of a \"minor\" power. British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] eventually relented, and convinced the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of separate [[Canadians|Canadian]], [[India]]n, [[Australia]]n, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]n delegations. Despite this, Borden boycotted the opening ceremony, protesting at the precedence given to the [[Prime Minister of Newfoundland|prime minister]] of the much smaller Newfoundland over him.<ref>MacMillan p.71</ref>\n\nNot only did Borden's persistence allow him to represent Canada in [[Paris]] as a nation, it also ensured that each of the [[dominion]]s could sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in its own right and receive a separate membership in the [[League of Nations]]. During the conference, Borden tried to act as an intermediary between the [[United States]] and other members of the [[British Empire delegation]], particularly [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] over the issue of the [[League of Nations Mandate]].<ref>MacMillan p.107\u2013114</ref> Borden also discussed with Lloyd George the possibility of Canada taking over the administration of [[Belize]] and the [[West Indies]], but no agreement was reached.\n\nAt Borden's insistence, the treaty was ratified by the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]]. Borden was the last Prime Minister to be [[Knighthood|knighted]] after the House of Commons indicated its desire for the discontinuation of the granting of any future titles to Canadians in 1919 with the adoption of the [[Nickle Resolution]].\n\n===Post-war government===\nIn 1919, Borden approved the use of troops to put down the [[Winnipeg general strike]], which was feared to be the result of [[Bolshevik]] agitation from the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>MacMillan</ref>\n\n==Post-political career==\n[[File:Mrs Louise Borden.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Laura, Lady Borden by [[William James Topley]]]]\n[[File:Laura Borden.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Robert and Lady Borden]]\n[[File:Robert Borden, statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue on [[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]]]]\n\nSir Robert Borden retired from office in 1920. He was the Chancellor of [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] from 1924 to 1930 and also was Chancellor of [[McGill University]] from 1918 to 1920 while still Prime Minister.

He is best known for his leadership of [[Canada during World War I]].\n\nBorden was born in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia]]. He worked as a schoolteacher for a period and then served his [[Articled clerk|articles of clerkship]] at a [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] law firm. He was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1878, and soon became one of Nova Scotia's most prominent barristers. Borden was elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in 1896, representing the [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867\u20131942)|Conservative Party]]. He replaced [[Charles Tupper]] as party leader in 1901, and became prime minister after the party's victory at the [[1911 Canadian federal election|1911 federal election]].\n\nAs prime minister, Borden led Canada through World War I and its immediate aftermath. His government passed the ''[[War Measures Act]]'', created the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]], and eventually introduced [[Military Service Act (Canada)|compulsory military service]], which sparked the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|1917 conscription crisis]]. On the home front, it dealt with the consequences of the [[Halifax Explosion]], introduced [[Women's suffrage in Canada|women's suffrage]] for federal elections, and used the [[North-West Mounted Police]] to break up the 1919 [[Winnipeg general strike]]. For the [[1917 Canadian federal election|1917 federal election]] (the first in six years), Borden created the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist Party]], an amalgam of Conservatives and pro-conscription [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]]; his government was re-elected with an overwhelming majority.\n\nBorden retired from politics in 1920, having accepted a knighthood in 1915 \u2013 the last Canadian prime minister to be knighted. He was also the last prime minister born before [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], and is the most recent Nova Scotian to hold the office. His portrait has appeared on [[Canadian hundred-dollar note|Canadian one hundred-dollar note]]s produced since 1976, but in late 2016 the government announced Borden's image would be removed during the next redesign.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\">{{cite news |title=Viola Desmond to appear on new Canadian banknote |first=Joanna |last=Smith |via=The Canadian Press |date=December 8, 2016 |publisher=CTV News |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/viola-desmond-to-appear-on-new-canadian-banknote-1.3194561}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nRobert Laird Borden was born and educated in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia]], a farming community at the eastern end of the [[Annapolis Valley]], where his great-grandfather Perry Borden, Sr. of [[Tiverton, Rhode Island]], had taken up [[Acadian]] land in 1760 as one of the [[New England Planters]]. The Borden family had immigrated from [[Headcorn, Kent]], England, to New England in the 1600s.  Also arriving in this group was a great-great-grandfather, [[Robert Denison]], who had come from Connecticut at about the same time. Perry had accompanied his father, Samuel Borden, the chief surveyor chosen by the government of [[Massachusetts]] to survey the former Acadian land and draw up new lots for the [[New England Planters|Planters]] in Nova Scotia. Through the marriage of his patrilineal ancestor Richard Borden to Innocent Cornell, Borden is descendant from [[Thomas Cornell (settler)|Thomas Cornell]] of [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island]].<ref>[https://web2.americanancestors.org/Browse/articles?searchby=author&subquery=Richard%20E.%20Brenneman&id=988 Notable Kin - New England in Hollywood, Part Three: The Possible Rhode Island Ancestry of Marilyn Monroe] New England Historical Genealogical Society.</ref>\n\nBorden's father Andrew Borden was judged by his son to be \"a man of good ability and excellent judgement\", of a \"calm, contemplative and philosophical\" turn of mind, but \"he lacked energy and had no great aptitude for affairs\". His mother Eunice Jane Laird was more driven, possessing \"very strong character, remarkable energy, high ambition and unusual ability\". Her ambition was transmitted to her first-born child, who applied himself to his studies while assisting his parents with the farm work he found so disagreeable. His cousin [[Frederick William Borden|Sir Frederick Borden]] was a prominent [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] politician.<ref>{{cite DCB |title=Borden, Sir Frederick William |first=Carman |last=Miller |author-link=Carman Miller |volume=XIV |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/borden_frederick_william_14E.html7}}</ref>\n\nRobert Borden was the last Canadian Prime Minister born before [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]].<ref>Thornton, Martin.

Seeing no future in teaching, he returned to Nova Scotia in 1874. Despite having no formal university education, he went to [[Articled clerk|article]] for four years at a [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] law firm. In August 1878, he was called to the Nova Scotia Bar, placing first in the bar examinations. Borden went to [[Kentville, Nova Scotia]], as the junior partner of the Conservative lawyer [[John&nbsp;P. Chipman]]. In 1880, he was inducted into the [[Freemason]]s&nbsp;\u2013 St Andrew's lodge #1.<ref>[http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/prime_ministers/borden_r/borden_r.html Sir Robert Laird Borden<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.freemasonry.bcy.ca</ref>\n\nIn 1882, he was asked by Wallace Graham to move to Halifax and join the Conservative law firm headed by Graham and Charles Hibbert Tupper. In the Autumn of 1889, when he was only 35, Borden became the senior partner following the departure of Graham and Tupper for the bench and politics, respectively. His financial future guaranteed, on September 25, 1889, he married [[Laura Bond]] (1863\u20131940), the daughter of a Halifax hardware merchant. They would have no children.  In 1894, he bought a large property and home on the south side of Quinpool Road, which the couple called \"Pinehurst\". In 1893, Borden successfully argued the first of two cases which he took to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. He represented many of the important Halifax businesses, and sat on the boards of Nova Scotian companies including the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]] and the [[Crown Life Insurance Company]]. In 1896, he became President of the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society, and took the initiative in organizing the founding meetings of the [[Canadian Bar Association]] in [[Montreal]] within the same year.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} By the time he was prevailed upon to enter politics, Borden had what some{{who|date=January 2015}} judged to be the largest legal practice in the Maritime Provinces, and had become a wealthy man.\n\n==Conservative Party in opposition==\n[[File:Robert Borden & Winston Churchill 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|Borden and [[Winston Churchill]] in 1912]]\nBorden was a Liberal until he broke with the party in [[1891 Canadian federal election|1891]] over the issue of [[Reciprocity (Canadian politics)|Reciprocity]].\n\nHe was elected to Parliament in the [[1896 Canadian federal election|1896 federal election]] as a Conservative and in 1901 was selected by the Conservative caucus to succeed Sir [[Charles Tupper]] as leader of the Conservative Party. He was defeated in his Halifax seat in the [[1904 Canadian federal election|1904 federal election]] and re-entered the House of Commons the next year via a by-election in [[Carleton (Ontario electoral district)|Carleton]]. Over the next decade he worked to rebuild the party and establish a reform policy, the [[Halifax Platform]] of 1907 which he described as \"the most advanced and progressive policy ever put forward in Federal affairs\". It called for reform of the Senate and the civil service, a more selective immigration policy, free rural mail delivery, and government regulation of telegraphs, telephones, and railways and eventually national ownership of telegraphs and telephones. Despite his efforts, his party lost the [[1908 Canadian federal election|1908 federal election]] to [[Wilfrid Laurier]]'s Liberals.<ref name=\"biographi1\">{{cite DCB|last=Brown|first=Robert Craig|title=Borden, Sir Robert Laird|volume=16|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/borden_robert_laird_16E.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sir-robert-borden |title=Robert Borden |last=Brown|first=Robert Craig|first2=Tabitha |last2=Marshall |work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |date=April 21, 2015 |orig-year=February 21, 2008}}</ref> Borden was however elected again for [[Halifax (electoral district)|Halifax]]. His party's fortunes turned around in the [[1911 Canadian federal election|1911 federal election]], however, when the Conservatives successfully campaigned against Laurier's proposals for a [[Reciprocity (Canadian politics)|Reciprocity]] ([[free trade]]) agreement with the United States. Borden countered with a revised version of John A. Macdonald's [[National Policy]] and appeals of loyalty to the [[British Empire]] and ran on the slogan \"Canadianism or Continentalism\".<ref name=\"biographi1\"/> In British Columbia, the party ran on the slogan \"A White Canada\", playing to the fears of British Columbians that resented the increasing presence of cheap Asian labour and the resulting depression in wages.<ref>Last Steps to Freedom by John Boyko pg.46</ref> In Quebec, concurrently, [[Henri Bourassa]] led a campaign against what he saw as Laurier's capitulation to British imperialism, playing a part in the defeat of Laurier's government and the election of Borden's Tories.\n\n==Prime Minister (1911\u20131920)==\n\n{{See also|Electoral history of Robert Borden}}\n\nBorden served as Prime Minister for the duration of the [[12th Parliament of Canada]], and for most of the [[13th Parliament of Canada]], before his retirement from active political life in July 1920.\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:BordenVictoryBondCampaignToronto.jpg|thumb|left|Borden at a [[War bond|Victory Bonds]] campaign in [[Toronto]], 1915]]\nAs [[Prime Minister of Canada]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], he transformed his government to a wartime administration, passing the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' in 1914. Borden committed Canada to provide half a million soldiers for the war effort. However, volunteers had quickly dried up when Canadians realized there would be no quick end to the war. Borden's determination to meet that huge commitment led to the ''[[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]]'' and the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], which split the country on linguistic lines.<ref name=conscript>{{cite journal|last1=Dennis|first1=Patrick M.|title=1918: Year of the Conscript|journal=[[Canada's History]]|date=Apr-May 2018|volume=98|issue=2|pages=40\u201347|issn=1920-9894|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/canadas-history/20180401/281522226622753}}</ref>  In 1917 Borden recruited members of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] (with the notable exception of leader Wilfrid Laurier) to create a [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] government. The [[1917 Canadian federal election|1917 election]] saw the \"Government\" candidates (including a number of [[Liberal-Unionist]]s) crush the Opposition \"[[Laurier Liberals]]\" in [[English Canada]] resulting in a large parliamentary majority for Borden.\n[[File:Joinville-le-Pont - Cont. Sir Robt Borden, Col. Beauchamp, O.C. Joinville-le-Pont - suite - sir Robert Borden, le col Beauchamp, cmdt.jpg|upright|thumb|Sir Robert Borden (right) at the official opening of No. 6 Canadian General Hospital, Joinville-le-Pont, France, July 1918]]\n\nSir Robert Borden pledged himself during the campaign to equal suffrage for women. With his return to power, he introduced a bill in 1918 for extending the franchise to women. This passed without division.\n\nThe war effort also enabled Canada to assert itself as an independent power. Borden wanted to create a single Canadian army, rather than have Canadian soldiers split up and assigned to British divisions as had happened during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. [[Sam Hughes]], the Minister of Militia, generally ensured that Canadians were well-trained and prepared to fight in their own divisions, although with mixed results such as the [[Ross Rifle]]. [[Arthur Currie]] provided sensible leadership for the Canadian divisions in Europe, although they were still under overall British command. Nevertheless, Canadian troops proved themselves to be among the best in the world, fighting at the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme]], [[Ypres]], [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], and especially at the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]].\n\nDuring Borden's first term as Prime Minister, the [[National Research Council of Canada]] was established in 1916.\n\n===Borden and the Treaty of Versailles===\nIn world affairs, Borden played a crucial role (according to McMillan) in transforming the British Empire into a partnership of equal states, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a term that was first discussed at an [[Imperial Conference]] in [[London]] during the war. Borden also introduced the first Canadian [[income tax]] under Income War Tax Act of 1917, which was then meant to be temporary but later became permanent.\n\nConvinced that Canada had become a nation on the battlefields of Europe, Borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. This was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which perceived such a delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost a far larger proportion of its men compared to the US in the war (although not more in absolute numbers), Canada at least had the right to the representation of a \"minor\" power. British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] eventually relented, and convinced the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of separate [[Canadians|Canadian]], [[India]]n, [[Australia]]n, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]n delegations. Despite this, Borden boycotted the opening ceremony, protesting at the precedence given to the [[Prime Minister of Newfoundland|prime minister]] of the much smaller Newfoundland over him.<ref>MacMillan p.71</ref>\n\nNot only did Borden's persistence allow him to represent Canada in [[Paris]] as a nation, it also ensured that each of the [[dominion]]s could sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in its own right and receive a separate membership in the [[League of Nations]]. During the conference, Borden tried to act as an intermediary between the [[United States]] and other members of the [[British Empire delegation]], particularly [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] over the issue of the [[League of Nations Mandate]].<ref>MacMillan p.107\u2013114</ref> Borden also discussed with Lloyd George the possibility of Canada taking over the administration of [[Belize]] and the [[West Indies]], but no agreement was reached.\n\nAt Borden's insistence, the treaty was ratified by the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]]. Borden was the last Prime Minister to be [[Knighthood|knighted]] after the House of Commons indicated its desire for the discontinuation of the granting of any future titles to Canadians in 1919 with the adoption of the [[Nickle Resolution]].\n\n===Post-war government===\nIn 1919 Borden approved the use of troops to put down the [[Winnipeg general strike]], which was feared to be the result of [[Bolshevik]] agitation from the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>MacMillan</ref>\n\n==Post-political career==\n[[File:Mrs Louise Borden.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Laura, Lady Borden by [[William James Topley]]]]\n[[File:Laura Borden.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Robert and Lady Borden]]\n[[File:Robert Borden, statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue on [[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]]]]\n\nSir Robert Borden retired from office in 1920. He was the Chancellor of [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] from 1924 to 1930 and also was Chancellor of [[McGill University]] from 1918 to 1920 while still Prime Minister.
