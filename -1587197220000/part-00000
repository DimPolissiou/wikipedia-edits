The screenplay by [[Tracy Letts]] is based on his 1993 [[Killer Joe (play)|play of the same name]]. The film stars [[Matthew McConaughey]] in the title role, [[Emile Hirsch]], [[Juno Temple]], [[Gina Gershon]] and [[Thomas Haden Church]]. Friedkin and Letts had also collaborated on the 2006 film ''[[Bug (2006 film)|Bug]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[West Dallas]], [[Texas]], 22-year-old drug dealer Chris Smith comes to the house of his father Ansel and step-mother Sharla, after his mother, Adele, threw him out of her house. To make matters worse, Adele stole his cocaine money and spent it on fixing her car, and now Chris is desperate to pay off his debt to his dealer, Digger Soames, so he decides to murder his mother to collect the $50,000 [[life insurance]] of which his sister Dottie is the sole [[beneficiary]]. Assuming Dottie would share the money with Chris and their father, Chris manages to rope the dim-witted Ansel into hiring Joe Cooper, a [[Police officer|police]] [[detective]] who has a side career as a [[Hitman|contract killer]], to kill Adele (Ansel's ex-wife) to get the money. Chris and Ansel decide that after paying Joe from the proceeds of the life insurance policy, they will split the remainder four ways between themselves, Dottie, and Ansel's wife Sharla. Dottie hears the plan as they are talking, and agrees that it's a good idea.\n\nThe plan almost fails when Joe demands all of the money in advance, but Chris and Ansel are broke. However, Joe is interested in young Dottie and offers to take her as a \"retainer\" until the insurance comes through. Through Dottie's interaction with Joe, it is revealed that Adele tried to kill Dottie once when she was an infant. Joe and Dottie start a relationship. Chris has a change of heart and asks him to call off the hit, only to discover that Joe has already killed Adele. With Chris's reluctant help, Joe hides the body in a car and torches it.\n\nAfter Adele's death is discovered, the family learns that the insurance beneficiary is actually Rex, Adele's boyfriend, rather than her daughter Dottie. Chris then admits he originally heard the details about the policy from Rex, who also told him about Joe. Ansel then realizes that Rex duped Chris into hiring Joe to kill Adele. Immediately afterwards, Chris tries to talk Dottie into running away with him to escape Digger, who has already had two of his goons severely beat Chris up for not having repaid him. Dottie says she will go with him, but she must see Joe again first.\n\nWhen Ansel and Sharla return home from Adele's funeral, they find Joe inside with Dottie. He comes out of her room and asks increasingly pointed questions of Sharla, which ultimately leads her to admit that she knew the policy was really $100,000 ([[Double indemnity|accidental death is double]]). Joe shows them a check of that amount payable to Rex, as well as incriminating photos which prove Sharla was having an affair with Rex. Angered, Ansel declines to protect Sharla when Joe punches her and forces her to simulate [[oral sex]] on a fried chicken drumstick.\n\nJoe knows Chris is coming to take Dottie away and he threatens to kill Ansel and Sharla if they don't stop him. After Chris is seated for dinner, Joe announces that he and Dottie will be married. Chris refuses to let them, ordering Dottie to leave with him; Joe tells her to stay where she is. For a moment Dottie sits there, then she gets up and turns. While the men yell out at her, Chris threatens Joe with a gun and the two struggle. Ansel and Sharla rush to assist Joe as he brutally beats Chris, not wanting to be killed by Joe if Chris flees with Dottie. In all the confusion, Dottie recovers the gun and, in a rage, she fires several shots, killing Chris and seriously wounding Ansel. Dottie turns the gun on Joe, telling him that she is pregnant. Joe appears overjoyed as he inches closer to Dottie. The film ends just as Dottie moves her finger back on the trigger.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as \"Killer\" Joe Cooper\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as Chris Smith\n* [[Juno Temple]] as Dottie Smith\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Sharla Smith\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Ansel Smith\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Digger Soames\n\n==Rating controversy==\n{{quote box\n|quote = Cutting ''would not'' have made it mass appeal.

The screenplay by [[Tracy Letts]] is based on his 1993 [[Killer Joe (play)|play of the same name]]. The film stars [[Matthew McConaughey]] in the title role, [[Emile Hirsch]], [[Juno Temple]], [[Gina Gershon]] and [[Thomas Haden Church]]. Friedkin and Letts had also collaborated on the 2006 film ''[[Bug (2006 film)|Bug]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[West Dallas]], [[Texas]], 22-year-old drug dealer Chris Smith comes to the house of his father Ansel and step-mother Sharla, after his mother, Adele, threw him out of her house. To make matters worse, Adele stole his cocaine money and spent it on fixing her car, and now Chris is desperate to pay off his debt to his dealer, Digger Soames, so he decides to murder his mother to collect the $50,000 [[life insurance]] of which his sister Dottie is the sole [[beneficiary]]. Assuming Dottie would share the money with Chris and their father, Chris manages to rope the dim-witted Ansel into hiring Joe Cooper, a [[Police officer|police]] [[detective]] who has a side career as a [[Hitman|contract killer]], to kill Adele (Ansel's ex-wife) to get the money. Chris and Ansel decide that after paying Joe from the proceeds of the life insurance policy, they will split the remainder four ways between themselves, Dottie, and Ansel's wife Sharla. Dottie hears the plan as they are talking, and agrees that it's a good idea.\n\nThe plan almost fails when Joe demands all of the money in advance, but Chris and Ansel are broke. However, Joe is interested in young Dottie and offers to take her as a \"retainer\" until the insurance comes through. Through Dottie's interaction with Joe, it is revealed that Adele tried to kill Dottie once when she was an infant. Joe and Dottie start a relationship. Chris has a change of heart and asks him to call off the hit, only to discover that Joe has already killed Adele. With Chris's reluctant help, Joe hides the body in a car and torches it.\n\nAfter Adele's death is discovered, the family learns that the insurance beneficiary is actually Rex, Adele's boyfriend, rather than her daughter Dottie. Chris then admits he originally heard the details about the policy from Rex, who also told him about Joe. Ansel then realizes that Rex duped Chris into hiring Joe to kill Adele. Immediately afterwards, Chris tries to talk Dottie into running away with him to escape Digger, who has already had two of his goons severely beat Chris up for not having repaid him. Dottie says she will go with him, but she must see Joe again first.\n\nWhen Ansel and Sharla return home from Adele's funeral, they find Joe inside with Dottie. He comes out of her room and asks increasingly pointed questions of Sharla, which ultimately leads her to admit that she knew the policy was really $100,000 ([[Double indemnity|accidental death is double]]). Joe shows them a check of that amount payable to Rex, as well as incriminating photos which prove Sharla was having an affair with Rex. Angered, Ansel declines to protect Sharla when Joe punches her and forces her to simulate [[oral sex]] on a fried chicken drumstick.\n\nJoe knows Chris is coming to take Dottie away and he threatens to kill Ansel and Sharla if they don't stop him. After Chris is seated for dinner, Joe announces that he and Dottie will be married. Chris refuses to let them, ordering Dottie to leave with him; Joe tells her to stay where she is. For a moment Dottie sits there, then she gets up and turns. While the men yell out at her, Chris threatens Joe with a gun and the two struggle. Ansel and Sharla rush to assist Joe as he brutally beats Chris, not wanting to be killed by Joe if Chris flees with Dottie. In all the confusion, Dottie recovers the gun and, in a rage, she fires several shots, killing Chris and seriously wounding Ansel. Dottie turns the gun on Joe, telling him that she is pregnant. Joe appears overjoyed as he inches closer to Dottie. The film ends just as Dottie moves her finger back on the trigger.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as \"Killer\" Joe Cooper\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as Chris Smith\n* [[Juno Temple]] as Dottie Smith\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Sharla Smith\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Ansel Smith\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Digger Soames\n\n==Rating controversy==\n{{quote box\n|quote = Cutting ''would not'' have made it mass appeal.

Another duty is to promote friendly relations among the member national associations and to operate in an organized manner for the good order of the [[sport]].<ref>International Ice Hockey Federation. [https://www.iihf.com/en/static/5009/mission \"IIHF Mission\"] 2019-05-08.</ref>\nThe federation may take the necessary measures in order to conduct itself and its affairs in accordance with its [[statute]]s, [[bylaw]]s and regulations as well as in holding a clear [[jurisdiction]] with regards to ice hockey and in-line hockey at the international level. The IIHF is the body responsible with arranging the [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorships]], license rights, [[advertising]] and [[merchandising]] in connection with all IIHF competitions.\n\nAnother purpose of the federation is to provide aid in the young players' development and in the development of [[Coach (ice hockey)|coaches]] and [[Official (ice hockey)|game officials]]. On the other hand, all the events of IIHF are organized by the federation along with establishing and maintaining contact with any other sport federations or sport groups. The IIHF is responsible for processing the international players' transfers. It is also the body that presides over [[ice hockey at the Olympic Games]] as well as over all levels of the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]].<ref>International Hockey online portal. [http://www.internationalhockey.net/articlelisting/7/ \"International hockey and the olympics\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410183800/http://www.internationalhockey.net/articlelisting/7/ |date=10 April 2010 }} 2010-02-18.</ref> The federation works in collaboration with local [[committee]]s when organizing its 25 World Championships, at five different categories.\n\nEven though the IIHF runs the world championships, it is also responsible for the organization of several European club competitions such as the [[Champions Hockey League]] or the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]].\n\nThe federation is governed by the legislative body of the IIHF which is the General Congress along with the executive body, which is the Council. The Congress is entitled to make decisions with regard to the game's rules, the statutes and bylaws in the name of the federation. It is also the body that elects the president and the council or otherwise known as board.<ref>International Ice Hockey Federation. [https://www.iihf.com/en/static/5024/statutes-bylaws \"IIHF Statutes and Bylaws\"] 2019-05-08.</ref> The president of the IIHF is basically the representative of the federation. He represents the federation's interests in all external matters and he is also responsible that the decisions are made according to the federation's statutes and regulations. The president is assisted by the General Secretary, who is also the highest ranked employee of the IIHF.\n\n==History==\n===1908\u20131913===\n[[File:Iihf statutes.jpg|thumb|Foundation document of the LIHG.]]\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation was founded on 15 May 1908 at 34 [[Rue de Provence]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], as Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG).<ref>[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4808/history-of-ice-hockey It all Started in Paris, 1908] International Ice Hockey Federation.

[[Louis Magnus]], the French representative, was the fifth member to sign the founding document and also the first president of the LIHG.\n\nThe second congress was held from 22\u201325 January 1909 in [[Chamonix]], [[France]]. Playing and competitions rules were established, and an agreement was reached for an annual European Championship to be contested, beginning in 1910. The [[1909 Coupe de Chamonix]] was contested during the congress. It was won by [[Princes Ice Hockey Club]], representing Great Britain. Germany became the sixth LIHG member on 19 September 1909.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4857/1908-1913 IIHF 1908-1913]</ref>\n\nThe third LIHG Congress was held on 9 January 1910 in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]]. Louis Magnus was re-elected president and [[Peter Patton]] took on the position of vice-president. The first European Championship began in [[Les Avants]] a day after the conclusion of the congress. It was won by Great Britain.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/>\n\nRussia was added as the seventh LIHG member and [[Herman Kleeberg]] replaced Peter Patton as vice president at the fourth LIHG Congress, which was held in [[Berlin]] from 16\u201317 February 1911, in conjunction with the 1911 European Championship.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/> On 14 March 1911, the LIHG adopted Canadian rules of ice hockey.{{sfn|Podnieks|Szemberg|2007|p=198}}\n\nThe fifth LIHG Congress took place from 22\u201323 March 1912, in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. Unlike the two previous conferences, it was not held in conjunction with the European Championships, which had been staged in [[Prague]] in early February. A verdict was reached regarding the fate of the past month's European Championship, which had been the subject of a protest by Germany. It was decided that the tournament would be annulled as Austria was not yet an LIHG member at the time of its playing. Austria, along with Sweden and Luxembourg, were accepted as LIHG members at the congress. [[Henri van den Bulcke]] succeeded Louis Magnus as LIHG president, and [[Max Sillig]] replaced Herman Kleeberg as vice-president. The first [[LIHG Championships|LIHG Championship]] was contested in Brussels from 20\u201324 March.

Louis Magnus replaced Van den Bulcke as president, but he resigned immediately as the other delegates did not follow his program. Peter Patton, vice-president at the time, then became president and had new elections staged. Van den Bulcke was again elected as president (a position he would hold until 1920), and Patton was returned to his prior role of vice-president.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4856/1914-1933 IIHF 1914-1933]</ref>\n\n[[World War I]] interrupted all activities of the federation between 1914 and 1920. The LIHG expelled Austria and Germany from its ranks following the war in 1920. Bohemia's membership was transferred to the new country of [[Czechoslovakia]] the same year.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] were the first to integrate hockey into their program. Canada and the United States made their debut on the international scene at the tournament. Their level of play was vastly superior to that of the [[Europe]]ans and Canada took home the gold while the US won the silver medal. On 26 April 1920, at the LIHG Congress which was held during the Olympic tournament, both countries became members of the federation. Also at the congress, Max Sillig became president, and [[Paul Loicq]] and [[Frank Fellowes]] were elected as vice presidents.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nPaul Loicq was elected as president in 1922. [[Karel Hartmann|Dr. Karel Hartmann]] and Haddock were chosen as the new vice-presidents.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAt the 1923 congress it was decided to consider the 1924 Olympic Games as the World Championship as well as to organize a parallel European Championship. Romania, Spain, and Italy were admitted to the LIHG the same year.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAustria was re-admitted to the LIHG in 1924, while the Swedish proposal to re-admit Germany was declined. The Swedes protested by leaving the LIHG. They returned in 1926 following the re-admission of Germany.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928 Winter Olympics]], which also served as the World and European Championship for the year, saw a record 11 countries participate as Canada claimed their third gold medal.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAt the 1929 congress, the LIHG decided to organize a stand-alone World Championship, beginning in 1930. The first World Championship began in [[Chamonix]], but had to be concluded in [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]] as the natural ice in Chamonix melted toward the end of the tournament. Canada was considered so dominant that it received a bye to the final, where it easily dispatched Germany to win the gold medal. Japan, which had joined the LIHG just days prior to the start of the tournament, entered a team consisting of medical students.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1932 Winter Olympics|1932 Winter Olympics]], held in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], consisted of only four teams due to the global financial crisis. Germany and Poland were the only European nations present as Canada won their fourth Olympic gold medal. The [[Ice Hockey European Championship 1932|1932 European Championship]] was contested as the last stand-alone European Championship. Nine countries participated and Sweden won their third European title.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n \nThe LIHG celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1933. Since its foundation in 1908, 18 European Championships, six World Championships, and four Olympic Games tournaments had been contested. The [[1933 World Ice Hockey Championships|1933 World Championship]] marked the first time that Canada failed to emerge victorious in a World Championship or Olympic tournament. They were defeated by the United States, 2-1 in overtime.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe Netherlands and Norway became LIHG members in 1935. The three Baltic states, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania joined the LIHG in 1931, 1935, and 1938 respectively. South Africa was accepted into the LIHG in 1937.<ref name=\"IIHF1934\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4836/1934-1945 IIHF 1934-1945]</ref>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936 Winter Olympics]]  set a new record with 15 participants.

He was replaced by [[Fritz Kraatz|Dr. Fritz Kraatz]].<ref name=\"IIHF1946\"/> During the 1947 championships, the LIHG agreed to a merger with the International Ice Hockey Association.

The IOC initially declared that neither team would be allowed to participate, which led the LIHG to threaten a boycott of the entire ice hockey tournament. The IOC then conceded and allowed the AHAUS team to participate in the tournament and the AAU team to march in the opening ceremony. The AHAUS team was excluded from the final rankings of the Olympic tournament, but not from the World Championship, where they officially finished in fourth place.<ref name=\"IIHF1946\"/>\n\n[[W. G.

The game was awarded to East Germany, 5-0, by virtue of a forfeit. Two years later, at the [[1963 World Ice Hockey Championships|1963 World Championship]] in [[Stockholm]], the East Germans took payback on West Germany.

While the B Pool had been played as early as 1951, it was not held every year due to a frequent shortage of teams, and no promotion-and-relegation took place between it and the top division.<ref name=\"IIHF1957\"/>\n\nFor the 1965\u201366 season, the IIHF created the [[IIHF European Champions Cup|European Cup]], a tournament consisting of the top club teams from around Europe. The competition was originated by [[G\u00fcnther Sabetzki]], based on the [[Association football]] European Cup (now [[UEFA Champions League]]). In 1968 the IIHF organized the [[IIHF European Junior Championships|European U19 Championship]], a junior competition for players aged 19 and under.

The Canadians had boycotted these tournaments between 1970 and 1976 after the IIHF had refused to allow them to roster professional players at the World Championships from NHL teams that had not qualified for the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]. President Sabetzki managed to find a compromise that resulted in the return of Canada to international events beginning in 1977. The pro players whose teams had been eliminated from the playoffs were allowed to compete and in exchange, Canada agreed to participate in the World Championships. They also waived their right to host any World Championships. The creation of the [[Canada Cup]] (a competition organized by the NHL in Canada every four years) was also part of the new agreement between the IIHF and North American professional hockey.<ref name=\"IIHF1975\"/>\n\n[[Walter Wasservogel]] became the first full-time general secretary of the IIHF in 1978, serving in the role until 1986.<ref name=\"Legends\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/IZone/izone.member.info.do?mem=57|title=2.57 Walter Wasservogel|website=Legends of Hockey|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>\n\nThe first official [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World Junior Championships]] for players under 20 years of age was held in 1977.

In addition, the memberships of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] - all of which had initially joined the IIHF in the 1930s but were expelled following their annexation by the Soviet Union - were renewed. The breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] also resulted in an increase in membership. [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] joined as new members, while the membership of the old Yugoslavia was transferred to [[Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslavia]] (which later became known as Serbia and Montenegro and still later dissolved into the independent republics of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]).

Another duty is to promote friendly relations among the member national associations and to operate in an organized manner for the good order of the [[sport]].<ref>International Ice Hockey Federation. [https://www.iihf.com/en/static/5009/mission \"IIHF Mission\"] 2019-05-08.</ref>\nThe federation may take the necessary measures in order to conduct itself and its affairs in accordance with its [[statute]]s, [[bylaw]]s and regulations as well as in holding a clear [[jurisdiction]] with regards to ice hockey and in-line hockey at the international level. The IIHF is the body responsible with arranging the [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorships]], license rights, [[advertising]] and [[merchandising]] in connection with all IIHF competitions.\n\nAnother purpose of the federation is to provide aid in the young players' development and in the development of [[Coach (ice hockey)|coaches]] and [[Official (ice hockey)|game officials]]. On the other hand, all the events of IIHF are organized by the federation along with establishing and maintaining contact with any other sport federations or sport groups. The IIHF is responsible for processing the international players' transfers. It is also the body that presides over [[ice hockey at the Olympic Games]] as well as over all levels of the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]].<ref>International Hockey online portal. [http://www.internationalhockey.net/articlelisting/7/ \"International hockey and the olympics\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410183800/http://www.internationalhockey.net/articlelisting/7/ |date=10 April 2010 }} 2010-02-18.</ref> The federation works in collaboration with local [[committee]]s when organizing its 25 World Championships, at five different categories.\n\nEven though the IIHF runs the world championships, it is also responsible for the organization of several European club competitions such as the [[Champions Hockey League]] or the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]].\n\nThe federation is governed by the legislative body of the IIHF which is the General Congress along with the executive body, which is the Council. The Congress is entitled to make decisions with regard to the game's rules, the statutes and bylaws in the name of the federation. It is also the body that elects the president and the council or otherwise known as board.<ref>International Ice Hockey Federation. [https://www.iihf.com/en/static/5024/statutes-bylaws \"IIHF Statutes and Bylaws\"] 2019-05-08.</ref> The president of the IIHF is basically the representative of the federation. He represents the federation's interests in all external matters and he is also responsible that the decisions are made according to the federation's statutes and regulations. The president is assisted by the General Secretary, who is also the highest ranked employee of the IIHF.\n\n==History==\n===1908\u20131913===\n[[File:Iihf statutes.jpg|thumb|Foundation document of the LIHG.]]\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation was founded on 15 May 1908 at 34 [[Rue de Provence]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], as Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG).<ref>[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4808/history-of-ice-hockey It all Started in Paris, 1908] International Ice Hockey Federation.

[[Louis Magnus]], the French representative, was the fifth member to sign the founding document and also the first president of the LIHG.\n\nThe second congress was held from 22\u201325 January 1909 in [[Chamonix]], [[France]]. Playing and competitions rules were established, and an agreement was reached for an annual European Championship to be contested, beginning in 1910. The [[1909 Coupe de Chamonix]] was contested during the congress. It was won by [[Princes Ice Hockey Club]], representing Great Britain. Germany became the sixth LIHG member on 19 September 1909.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4857/1908-1913 IIHF 1908-1913]</ref>\n\nThe third LIHG Congress was held on 9 January 1910 in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]]. Louis Magnus was re-elected president and [[Peter Patton]] took on the position of vice-president. The first European Championship began in [[Les Avants]] a day after the conclusion of the congress. It was won by Great Britain.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/>\n\nRussia was added as the seventh LIHG member and [[Herman Kleeberg]] replaced Peter Patton as vice president at the fourth LIHG Congress, which was held in [[Berlin]] from 16\u201317 February 1911, in conjunction with the 1911 European Championship.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/> On 14 March 1911, the LIHG adopted Canadian rules of ice hockey.{{sfn|Podnieks|Szemberg|2007|p=198}}\n\nThe fifth LIHG Congress took place from 22\u201323 March 1912, in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. Unlike the two previous conferences, it was not held in conjunction with the European Championships, which had been staged in [[Prague]] in early February. A verdict was reached regarding the fate of the past month's European Championship, which had been the subject of a protest by Germany. It was decided that the tournament would be annulled as Austria was not yet an LIHG member at the time of its playing. Austria, along with Sweden and Luxembourg, were accepted as LIHG members at the congress. [[Henri van den Bulcke]] succeeded Louis Magnus as LIHG president, and [[Max Sillig]] replaced Herman Kleeberg as vice-president. The first [[LIHG Championships|LIHG Championship]] was contested in Brussels from 20\u201324 March. It was held annually until 1914.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/>\n\nAt the 1913 congress in [[St. Moritz]], Max Sillig resigned his position as vice-president and was replaced by Peter Patton, who had previously served in the position from 1910\u20131911.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/> In February 1913, LIHG arranged the first [[European Bandy Championships|European Bandy Championship]] tournament in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bandynet.ru/node/22115 |script-title= ru:\u0427\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u044b 1913 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 |publisher= Bandynet.ru |date= 30 September 2011 |language= Russian |accessdate= 6 January 2014 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140106132926/http://bandynet.ru/node/22115 |archivedate= 6 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===1914\u20131945===\nThe 1914 congress was held in Berlin, the location of that year's European Championship. Louis Magnus replaced Van den Bulcke as president, but he resigned immediately as the other delegates did not follow his program. Peter Patton, vice-president at the time, then became president and had new elections staged. Van den Bulcke was again elected as president (a position he would hold until 1920), and Patton was returned to his prior role of vice-president.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4856/1914-1933 IIHF 1914-1933]</ref>\n\n[[World War I]] interrupted all activities of the federation between 1914 and 1920. The LIHG expelled Austria and Germany from its ranks following the war in 1920. Bohemia's membership was transferred to the new country of [[Czechoslovakia]] the same year.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] were the first to integrate hockey into their program. Canada and the United States made their debut on the international scene at the tournament. Their level of play was vastly superior to that of the [[Europe]]ans and Canada took home the gold while the US won the silver medal. On 26 April 1920, at the LIHG Congress which was held during the Olympic tournament, both countries became members of the federation. Also at the congress, Max Sillig became president, and [[Paul Loicq]] and [[Frank Fellowes]] were elected as vice presidents.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nPaul Loicq was elected as president in 1922. [[Karel Hartmann|Dr. Karel Hartmann]] and Haddock were chosen as the new vice-presidents.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAt the 1923 congress it was decided to consider the 1924 Olympic Games as the World Championship as well as to organize a parallel European Championship. Romania, Spain, and Italy were admitted to the LIHG the same year.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAustria was re-admitted to the LIHG in 1924, while the Swedish proposal to re-admit Germany was declined. The Swedes protested by leaving the LIHG. They returned in 1926 following the re-admission of Germany.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928 Winter Olympics]], which also served as the World and European Championship for the year, saw a record 11 countries participate as Canada claimed their third gold medal.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAt the 1929 congress, the LIHG decided to organize a stand-alone World Championship, beginning in 1930. The first World Championship began in [[Chamonix]], but had to be concluded in [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]] as the natural ice in Chamonix melted toward the end of the tournament. Canada was considered so dominant that it received a bye to the final, where it easily dispatched Germany to win the gold medal. Japan, which had joined the LIHG just days prior to the start of the tournament, entered a team consisting of medical students.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1932 Winter Olympics|1932 Winter Olympics]], held in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], consisted of only four teams due to the global financial crisis. Germany and Poland were the only European nations present as Canada won their fourth Olympic gold medal. The [[Ice Hockey European Championship 1932|1932 European Championship]] was contested as the last stand-alone European Championship. Nine countries participated and Sweden won their third European title.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n \nThe LIHG celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1933. Since its foundation in 1908, 18 European Championships, six World Championships, and four Olympic Games tournaments had been contested. The [[1933 World Ice Hockey Championships|1933 World Championship]] marked the first time that Canada failed to emerge victorious in a World Championship or Olympic tournament. They were defeated by the United States, 2-1 in overtime.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe Netherlands and Norway became LIHG members in 1935. The three Baltic states, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania joined the LIHG in 1931, 1935, and 1938 respectively. South Africa was accepted into the LIHG in 1937.<ref name=\"IIHF1934\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4836/1934-1945 IIHF 1934-1945]</ref>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936 Winter Olympics]]  set a new record with 15 participants.

Paul Loicq, who had been the LIHG president for 25 years, resigned his position at the LIHG Congress which was being held simultaneously with the World Championship. He was replaced by [[Fritz Kraatz|Dr. Fritz Kraatz]].<ref name=\"IIHF1946\"/> During the 1947 championships, the LIHG agreed to a merger with the International Ice Hockey Association.

The IOC initially declared that neither team would be allowed to participate, which led the LIHG to threaten a boycott of the entire ice hockey tournament. The IOC then conceded and allowed the AHAUS team to participate in the tournament and the AAU team to march in the opening ceremony. The AHAUS team was excluded from the final rankings of the Olympic tournament, but not from the World Championship, where they officially finished in fourth place.<ref name=\"IIHF1946\"/>\n\n[[W. G. Hardy]] replaced Fritz Kraatz as president in 1948. He would hold the position for three years, before being replaced by Kraatz, who began his second term in office as LIHG president. Germany and Japan were re-admitted and the Soviet Union - which would go on to win their first World Championship during their inaugural appearance in 1954 - joined as a new member during his tenure.<ref name=\"IIHF1946\"/>\n\n[[Walter A. Brown]] was elected LIHG president in 1954, replacing Dr. Fritz Kraatz. Meanwhile, the federation adopted an English name and became the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).

The game was awarded to East Germany, 5-0, by virtue of a forfeit. Two years later, at the [[1963 World Ice Hockey Championships|1963 World Championship]] in [[Stockholm]], the East Germans took payback on West Germany.

While the B Pool had been played as early as 1951, it was not held every year due to a frequent shortage of teams, and no promotion-and-relegation took place between it and the top division.<ref name=\"IIHF1957\"/>\n\nFor the 1965\u201366 season, the IIHF created the [[IIHF European Champions Cup|European Cup]], a tournament consisting of the top club teams from around Europe. The competition was originated by [[G\u00fcnther Sabetzki]], based on the [[Association football]] European Cup (now [[UEFA Champions League]]). In 1968 the IIHF organized the [[IIHF European Junior Championships|European U19 Championship]], a junior competition for players aged 19 and under. The age limit was later reduced to 18 in 1977.<ref name=\"IIHF1957\"/>\n\nThe IIHF saw three different presidents take office between 1957 and 1974.

The Canadians had boycotted these tournaments between 1970 and 1976 after the IIHF had refused to allow them to roster professional players at the World Championships from NHL teams that had not qualified for the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]. President Sabetzki managed to find a compromise that resulted in the return of Canada to international events beginning in 1977. The pro players whose teams had been eliminated from the playoffs were allowed to compete and in exchange, Canada agreed to participate in the World Championships. They also waived their right to host any World Championships. The creation of the [[Canada Cup]] (a competition organized by the NHL in Canada every four years) was also part of the new agreement between the IIHF and North American professional hockey.<ref name=\"IIHF1975\"/>\n\n[[Walter Wasservogel]] became the first full-time general secretary of the IIHF in 1978, serving in the role until 1986.<ref name=\"Legends\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/IZone/izone.member.info.do?mem=57|title=2.57 Walter Wasservogel|website=Legends of Hockey|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>\n\nThe first official [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World Junior Championships]] for players under 20 years of age was held in 1977. Unofficial tournaments, which were not IIHF-sanctioned and teams were eligible to participate by invitation only, had been contested between 1974 and 1976. It began as a relatively obscure tournament, but soon grew in popularity, particularly in Canada.

In addition, the memberships of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] - all of which had initially joined the IIHF in the 1930s but were expelled following their annexation by the Soviet Union - were renewed. The breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] also resulted in an increase in membership. [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] joined as new members, while the membership of the old Yugoslavia was transferred to [[Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslavia]] (which later became known as Serbia and Montenegro and still later dissolved into the independent republics of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]).
