'''Napoleonic Wars''' (1803\u20131815) were a series of major conflicts putting the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and its allies, led by [[Napoleon I]], against a fluctuating array of [[Coalition forces of the Napoleonic Wars|European powers formed into various coalitions]], financed and usually led by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the [[French Revolution]] and its [[French Revolutionary Wars|resultant conflict]]. The wars are often categorized into five conflicts, each termed after the coalition that fought Napoleon: the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] (1805), the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth]] (1806\u201307), the [[War of the Fifth Coalition|Fifth]] (1809), the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth]] (1813), and the [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh]] (1815).\n\nNapoleon, upon ascending to First Consul of France in 1799, had inherited a [[First French Republic|chaotic republic]]; he subsequently created a state with stable finances, a strong bureaucracy, and a well-trained army. In 1805, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] started the '''Third Coalition''' and waged war against France. In response, Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] in December 1805, which is considered his greatest victory. At sea, the British severely defeated the joint Franco-Spanish navy in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October 1805. This victory secured British control of the seas and prevented the [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|invasion of Britain itself]]. Concerned about increasing French power, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] led the creation of the '''Fourth Coalition''' with Russia, Saxony and Sweden, and the resumption of war in October 1806. Napoleon quickly defeated the Prussians in [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|Jena]] and the Russians in [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]], bringing an [[Treaties of Tilsit|uneasy peace]] to the continent. The peace failed, though, as war broke out in 1809, when the badly prepared '''Fifth Coalition''', led by Austria, was quickly defeated in [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]].\n\nHoping to [[Continental System|isolate Britain economically]], Napoleon launched an [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|invasion of Portugal]], the only remaining British ally in continental Europe. After occupying Lisbon in November 1807, and with the bulk of French troops present in Spain, Napoleon seized the opportunity to turn against his former ally, depose the reigning [[Spanish Bourbons|Spanish Bourbon family]] and declare his brother King of Spain in 1808 as [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph I]]. The Spanish and Portuguese revolted with British support and expelled the French from Iberia in 1814 after [[Peninsular War|six years of fighting]].\n\nConcurrently, Russia, unwilling to bear economic consequences of reduced trade, routinely violated the [[Continental System]], prompting Napoleon to launch a [[French invasion of Russia|massive invasion of Russia]] in 1812. The resulting campaign ended with the dissolution and disastrous withdrawal of the French ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]''.\n\nEncouraged by the defeat, Prussia, Austria, and Russia formed the '''Sixth Coalition''' and began a new campaign against France, decisively defeating Napoleon at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] in October 1813 after several inconclusive engagements. The Allies then invaded France from the east, while the Peninsular War spilled over into southwestern France. Coalition troops captured Paris at the end of March 1814 and [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|forced Napoleon to abdicate]] in April. He was exiled to the island of [[Elba]], and the [[Bourbon restoration|Bourbons were restored to power]]. But Napoleon escaped in February 1815, and reassumed control of France for about one [[hundred days]]. In the '''Seventh Coalition''', the Allies defeated him permanently at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in June 1815 and exiled him to [[St Helena]], where he died six years later.<ref name=\"zamoy\">{{cite book |last1=Zamoyski |first1=Adam |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=NqVKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT480 |title=Napolean: A Life |date=16 October 2018 |publisher=Basic Books |page=480 |location=London |isbn=9780465055937 |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congress of Vienna]] redrew the borders of Europe, and brought a period of relative peace. The wars had profound consequences on global history, including the spread of [[nationalism]] and [[liberalism]], the rise of the [[British Empire]] as the world's [[Pax Britannica|foremost power]], the appearance of [[Latin American wars of independence|independence movements]] in [[Latin America]] and subsequent collapse of the [[Spanish Empire]], the fundamental reorganisation of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods of conducting warfare.\n\n==Overview==\nNapoleon [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|seized power]] in 1799, creating a ''de facto'' [[military dictatorship]].<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\">{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43294-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeillustr00jone_0/page/193 193\u2013194]|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeillustr00jone_0/page/193|date=20 October 1994}}</ref> There are a number of opinions on the date to use as the formal beginning of the Napoleonic Wars; 18 May 1803 is often used, when Britain and France ended the only short period of peace between 1792 and 1814.<ref name=\"Frederick Kagan 2007 pp 42-43\">Frederick Kagan, ''The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801\u20131805'' (2007) pp 42\u201343</ref> The Napoleonic Wars began with the [[War of the Third Coalition]], which was the first of the [[Coalition Wars]] against the [[First French Republic]] after Napoleon's accession as leader of [[France]].\n\nBritain ended the [[Treaty of Amiens]] and declared war on France in May 1803. Among the reasons were Napoleon's changes to the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Kagan argues that Britain was irritated in particular by Napoleon's assertion of [[Switzerland in the Napoleonic era|control over Switzerland]]. Furthermore, Britons felt insulted when Napoleon stated that their country deserved no voice in European affairs, even though King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] was an [[Prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. For its part, Russia decided that the intervention in Switzerland indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution of his differences with the other European powers.<ref name=\"Frederick Kagan 2007 pp 42-43\"/>\n\nThe British hastily enforced a [[naval blockade]] of France to starve it of resources. Napoleon responded with [[Continental System|economic embargoes against Britain]], and sought to eliminate Britain's Continental allies to break the coalitions arrayed against him. The so-called ''[[Continental System]]'' formed a [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|league of armed neutrality]] to disrupt the blockade and enforce [[free trade]] with France. The British responded by [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|capturing the Danish fleet]], breaking up the league, and later [[Battle of Trafalgar|secured dominance over the seas]], allowing it to freely continue its strategy. Napoleon won the [[War of the Third Coalition]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], forcing the [[Austrian Empire]] [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|out of the war]] and formally dissolving the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Within months, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] declared war, triggering a [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]. This war ended disastrously for Prussia, [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|defeated and occupied]] within 19 days of the beginning of the campaign. Napoleon subsequently defeated the [[Russian Empire]] at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]], creating powerful client states in Eastern Europe and ending the fourth coalition.\n\nConcurrently, the refusal of [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] to commit to the Continental System, and [[Spanish Empire|Spain's]] failure to maintain it, led to the [[Peninsular War]] and the outbreak of the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]]. The French occupied Spain and formed a [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Spanish client kingdom]], ending the alliance between the two. Heavy British involvement in the Iberian Peninsula soon followed, while a [[Walcheren Expedition|British effort to capture Antwerp]] failed. Napoleon oversaw the situation in Iberia, [[Battle of Somosierra|defeating the Spanish]], and [[Battle of Corunna|expelling the British]] from the Peninsula. Austria, keen to recover territory lost during the [[War of the Third Coalition]], invaded France's client states in Eastern Europe. Napoleon defeated the fifth coalition at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]].\n\nAttempts to disrupt the British blockade led to the United States [[War of 1812|declaring war on Britain]], while grievances over control of Poland, and Russia's withdrawal from the [[Continental System]], led to [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon invading Russia]] in June 1812. The invasion was an unmitigated disaster for Napoleon; [[Scorched-earth|scorched earth]] tactics, [[desertion]], [[Battle of Borodino|French strategic failures]] and the onset of the Russian winter [[French invasion of Russia#Retreat and losses|compelled Napoleon to retreat with massive losses]]. Napoleon suffered further setbacks; French power in the Iberian Peninsula was broken at [[Battle of Vitoria]] the following summer, and a new coalition began the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].\n\nThe coalition defeated Napoleon at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]], precipitating his fall from power and eventual abdication on 6 April 1814. The victors exiled Napoleon to [[Elba]] and [[Bourbon Restoration|restored the Bourbon monarchy]]. Napoleon escaped from Elba in 1815, gathering enough support to overthrow the monarchy of [[Louis XVIII]], triggering a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|seventh, and final, coalition against him]]. Napoleon was [[Battle of Waterloo|decisively defeated at Waterloo]], and he abdicated again on 22 June. On 15 July, he surrendered to the British at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], and was exiled to [[Saint Helena]], where he died in 1821.

In 1793, the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the [[Enlightenment Spain|Spanish Empire]], and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] formed the [[First Coalition]] to curtail the growing unrest in France. Measures such as [[Lev\u00e9e en masse|mass conscription]], military reforms, and total war allowed France to defeat the coalition, despite the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|concurrent civil war in France]]. [[Napoleon]], then a general in the French army, forced the Austrians to sign the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], leaving only Great Britain opposed to the fledgling French Republic.\n\nA [[War of the Second Coalition|Second Coalition]] was formed in 1798 by Great Britain, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Papal States]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]]. The French Republic, under the [[French Directory|Directory]], suffered from heavy levels of corruption and [[Chouannerie|internal strife]]. The new republic also lacked funds, and no longer enjoyed the services of [[Lazare Carnot]], the minister of war who had guided France to its victories during the early stages of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolution]]. Bonaparte, commander of the [[Arm\u00e9e d'Italie]] in the latter stages of the First Coalition, had [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|launched a campaign in Egypt]], intending to disrupt the British economic powerhouse of [[British India|India]]. Pressed from all sides, the Republic suffered a string of successive defeats against revitalised enemies, supported by Britain's financial help.\n\n[[File:Napoleon at the Battle of Rivoli.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte defeating the Austrians at the [[Battle of Rivoli]] in 1797]]\nBonaparte returned to France from Egypt on 23 August 1799, his [[Battle of the Nile|campaign there having failed]]. He seized control of the French government on 9 November, in [[coup of 18 Brumaire|a bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat]], replacing the Directory with the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and transforming the republic into a ''de facto'' dictatorship.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/> He further reorganised the French military forces, establishing a large reserve army positioned to support campaigns on the [[Rhine]] or in [[Italy]]. [[Second Battle of Zurich|Russia had already been knocked out of the war]], and, under Napoleon's leadership, the French [[Battle of Marengo|decisively defeated the Austrians in June 1800]], crippling Austrian capabilities in Italy. Austria was [[Battle of Hohenlinden|definitively defeated that December]], by Moreau's forces in Bavaria. The Austrian defeat was sealed by the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] early the following year, further compelling the British to sign the [[Treaty of Amiens]] with France, establishing a tenuous peace.\n\n===Start date and nomenclature===\nNo consensus exists as to when the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] ended and the Napoleonic Wars began.

This caused widespread outrage in Britain, which protested that this was a violation of the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville.

Protected by naval supremacy (in the words of Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] to the House of Lords \"I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come. I say only they will not come by sea\"), Britain did not have to spend the entire war defending itself and could therefore focus on supporting its embattled allies, maintaining low-intensity land warfare on a global scale for over a decade. The British government paid out large sums of money to other European states, so that they could pay armies in the field against France. These payments are colloquially known as the [[Golden Cavalry of St George]]. The British Army provided long-term support to the Spanish rebellion in the Peninsular War of 1808\u20131814, assisted by Spanish [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] ('little war') tactics. Anglo-Portuguese forces under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] supported the Spanish, which campaigned successfully against the French armies, eventually driving them from Spain and allowing Britain to invade southern France. By 1815, the British Army played the central role in the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.\n[[File:BritishEmpire1815.png|thumb|260px|The British managed to occupy and take control of [[Cape Colony]], [[British Guiana]], [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], [[British Mauritius|Mauritius]] and [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] during the Napoleonic Wars.]]\nBeyond minor naval actions against British imperial interests, the Napoleonic Wars were much less global in scope than preceding conflicts such as the [[Seven Years' War]], which historians term a \"[[world war]]\".\n\n===Economic warfare===\nIn response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on 16 May 1806, Napoleon issued the [[Berlin Decree]] on 21 November 1806, which brought into effect the [[Continental System]].<ref>Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics 1763\u20131848'' (1994) pp&nbsp;307\u201310</ref> This policy aimed to eliminate the threat from Britain by closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Britain maintained a standing army of 220,000 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, of whom less than half were available for campaigning. The rest were necessary for garrisoning Ireland and the colonies, and providing security for Britain. France's strength peaked at around 2,500,000 full-time and part-time soldiers including several hundred thousand National Guardsmen whom Napoleon could draft into the military if necessary. Both nations enlisted large numbers of sedentary militia who were unsuited for campaigning, and were mostly employed to release regular forces for active duty.<ref name=\"Paul Kennedy 1989 pp. 128\">Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers \u2013 economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1989), pp. 128\u20139</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy disrupted France's extra-continental trade by seizing and threatening French shipping and [[French colonial empire|colonial possessions]], but could do nothing about France's trade with the major continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. France's population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of Britain. Britain had the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade. This ensured that France could never consolidate its control over Europe in peace. Many in the French government believed that cutting Britain off from the Continent would end its economic influence over Europe and isolate it.\n\n===Financing the war===\nA key element in British success was its ability to mobilise the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. Although the UK had a population of circa 16 million against France's 30 million, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for many of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 men in 1813.<ref name=\"Paul Kennedy 1989 pp. 128\"/><ref>John M.

Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of [[frigate]]s, adding 50% more large [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], and increasing the number of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France saw its navy shrink by more than half.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783\u20131867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) p 143</ref> The smuggling of finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to weaken the British economy by cutting off markets. Subsidies to Russia and Austria kept them in the war. The British budget in 1814 reached \u00a398 million, including \u00a310 million for the Royal Navy, \u00a340 million for the army, \u00a310 million for the allies, and \u00a338 million as interest on the national debt, which soared to \u00a3679 million, more than double the GDP.

On 2 December, Napoleon crushed the Austro-Russian force in [[Moravia]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (usually considered his greatest victory).

With the withdrawal of Austria from the war, stalemate ensued. Napoleon's army had a record of continuous unbroken victories on land, but the full force of the Russian army had not yet come into play. Napoleon had now consolidated his hold on France, had taken control of Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and most of Western Germany and northern Italy. His admirers say that Napoleon wanted to stop now, but was forced to continue in order to gain greater security from the countries that refused to accept his conquests. Esdaille rejects that explanation and instead says that it was a good time to stop expansion, for the major powers were ready to accept Napoleon as he was:\n: in 1806 both Russia and Britain had been positively eager to make peace, and they might well have agreed to terms that would have left the Napoleonic imperium almost completely intact. As for Austria and Prussia, they simply wanted to be left alone. To have secured a compromise peace, then, would have been comparatively easy. But Napoleon was prepared to make no concessions.<ref>Esdaille, ''Napoleon's Wars, pp 252\u201353</ref>\n\n==War of the Fourth Coalition 1806\u20131807==\n{{Main|War of the Fourth Coalition}}\n[[File:Charles Meynier - Entr\u00e9e de Napol\u00e9on \u00e0 Berlin. 27 octobre 1806.jpg|thumb|After defeating Prussian forces at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena]], the French Army entered Berlin on 27 October 1806.]]\n\nWithin months of the collapse of the Third Coalition, the [[Fourth Coalition]] (1806\u201307) against France was formed by Britain, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden. In July 1806, Napoleon formed the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] out of the many tiny German states which constituted the [[Rhineland]] and most other western parts of Germany. He amalgamated many of the smaller states into larger electorates, duchies, and kingdoms to make the governance of non-Prussian Germany smoother. Napoleon elevated the rulers of the two largest Confederation states, [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], to the status of kings.\n\nIn August 1806, the Prussian king, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]], decided to go to war independently of any other great power. The army of Russia, a Prussian ally, in particular was too far away to assist. On 8 October 1806, Napoleon unleashed all the French forces east of the Rhine into Prussia. Napoleon defeated a Prussian army at [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] (14 October 1806), and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] defeated another at [[Battle of Auerst\u00e4dt|Auerst\u00e4dt]] on the same day. 160,000 French soldiers (increasing in number as the campaign went on) attacked Prussia, moving with such speed that they destroyed the entire Prussian army as an effective military force. Out of 250,000 troops the Prussians sustained 25,000 casualties, lost a further 150,000 as prisoners, 4,000 artillery pieces, and over 100,000 muskets. At Jena, Napoleon had fought only a detachment of the Prussian force. The battle at Auerst\u00e4dt involved a single French corps defeating the bulk of the Prussian army. Napoleon entered Berlin on 27 October 1806. He visited the tomb of [[Frederick the Great]] and instructed his marshals to remove their hats there, saying, \"If he were alive we wouldn't be here today\". Napoleon had taken only 19 days from beginning his attack on Prussia to knock it out of the war with the capture of Berlin and the destruction of its principal armies at Jena and Auerst\u00e4dt. Saxony left Prussia, and together with small states from north Germany, allied with France.\n\n[[File:Friedland mazurovsky.jpg|thumb|left|Charge of the Russian [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]] cavalry against French cuirassiers at the [[Battle of Friedland]], 14 June 1807]]\n\nIn the next stage of the war, the French drove Russian forces out of Poland and employed many Polish and German soldiers in several sieges in [[Silesia]] and [[Pomerania]], with the assistance of Dutch and Italian soldiers in the latter case. Napoleon then turned north to confront the remainder of the Russian army and to try to capture the temporary Prussian capital at [[K\u00f6nigsberg]]. A tactical draw at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] (7\u20138 February 1807), followed by capitulation at [[Siege of Danzig (1807)|Danzig]] (24 May 1807) and the [[Battle of Heilsberg]] (10 June 1807), forced the Russians to withdraw further north. Napoleon decisively beat the Russian army at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (14 June 1807), following which Alexander had to make peace with Napoleon at [[Treaty of Tilsit|Tilsit]] (7 July 1807). In Germany and Poland, new Napoleonic client states, such as the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], [[Duchy of Warsaw]], and [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Republic of Danzig]], were established.\n\nBy September, [[Guillaume Brune|Marshal Guillaume Brune]] completed the occupation of [[Swedish Pomerania]], allowing the Swedish army to withdraw with all its munitions of war.\n\n===Scandinavia and Finland===\n{{Main|Gunboat War|Finnish War|Dano-Swedish War of 1808-09}}\n[[File:Battle of Trangen.JPG|thumb|The [[Battle of Trangen]] during the [[Dano-Swedish War of 1808\u201309|Dano-Swedish War, 1808\u20131809]].

Napoleon also sent an auxiliary corps, consisting of troops from France, [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]], led by Marshal [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], to Denmark to participate in the invasion of Sweden. But British naval superiority prevented the armies from crossing the [[\u00d8resund]] strait, and the war came mainly to be fought along the Swedish-Norwegian border. At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] (September\u2013October 1808), France and Russia further agreed on the division of Sweden into two parts separated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], where the eastern part became the Russian [[Grand Duchy of Finland]].

Napoleon's impact on Poland was huge, including the Napoleonic legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.<ref>J. P.

The sea became a major [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of war]] against Napoleon's allies. During the time of the Fifth Coalition, the Royal Navy won a succession of victories in the French colonies. On land the major battles included [[Battle of Raszyn]], [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]], and [[Battle of Wagram]].\n\nOn land, the Fifth Coalition attempted few extensive military endeavours. One, the [[Walcheren Expedition]] of 1809, involved a dual effort by the British Army and the Royal Navy to relieve Austrian forces under intense French pressure. It ended in disaster after the Army commander, [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham]], failed to capture the objective, the naval base of French-controlled [[Antwerp]]. For the most part of the years of the Fifth Coalition, British military operations on land (apart from the Iberian Peninsula) remained restricted to hit-and-run operations executed by the Royal Navy, which dominated the sea after having beaten down almost all substantial naval opposition from France and its allies and blockading what remained of France's naval forces in heavily fortified French-controlled ports. These rapid-attack operations were aimed mostly at destroying blockaded French naval and mercantile shipping and the disruption of French supplies, communications, and military units stationed near the coasts. Often, when British allies attempted military actions within several dozen miles or so of the sea, the Royal Navy would arrive, land troops and supplies, and aid the coalition's land forces in a concerted operation. Royal Navy ships even provided artillery support against French units when fighting strayed near enough to the coastline. The ability and quality of the land forces governed these operations. For example, when operating with inexperienced guerrilla forces in Spain, the Royal Navy sometimes failed to achieve its objectives because of the lack of manpower that the Navy's guerrilla allies had promised to supply.\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Europe 1809.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The strategic situation in Europe in February 1809]]\n\nEconomic warfare continued: the French [[Continental System]] against the British naval blockade of French-controlled territory. Due to military shortages and lack of organisation in French territory, many breaches of the Continental System occurred as French-dominated states tolerated or even encouraged trade with British smugglers. In terms of economic damage to Great Britain, the blockade was largely ineffective. As Napoleon realised that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, he invaded those two countries. He tied down his forces in Spain, and lost very badly in Russia in 1812.<ref>J. M. Thompson, ''Napoleon Bonaparte: His rise and fall '' (1951) pp 235\u201340</ref>\n\nBoth sides entered further conflicts in attempts to enforce their blockade; the British fought the United States in the [[War of 1812]] (1812\u201315), and the French engaged in the [[Peninsular War]] (1808\u201314) to prevent smuggling into Spain. The Iberian conflict began when Portugal continued trade with Britain despite French restrictions. When Spain failed to maintain the Continental System, the uneasy Spanish alliance with France ended in all but name. French troops gradually encroached on Spanish territory until they occupied [[Madrid]], and installed a client monarchy. This provoked an explosion of [[Dos de Mayo Uprising|popular rebellions]] across Spain. Heavy British involvement soon followed.\n[[File:El dos de mayo de 1808 en Madrid.jpg|thumb|300px|[[The Second of May 1808|The Second of May 1808: The Charge of the Mamelukes]]'', by [[Francisco de Goya]] (1814)]]\n\nAustria, previously an ally of France, took the opportunity to attempt to restore its imperial territories in Germany as held prior to Austerlitz. Austria achieved some initial victories against the thinly spread army of Marshal [[Louis Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]]. Napoleon had left Berthier with only 170,000 men to defend France's entire eastern frontier (in the 1790s, 800,000 men had carried out the same task, but holding a much shorter front).\n\nAfter defeats in Spain suffered by France, Napoleon took charge and enjoyed success, retaking Madrid, defeating the Spanish and forcing a withdrawal of the heavily out-numbered British army from the Iberian Peninsula ([[Battle of Corunna]], 16 January 1809). But when he left, the [[guerrilla war]] against his forces in the countryside continued to tie down great numbers of troops. Austria's attack prevented Napoleon from successfully wrapping up operations against British forces by necessitating his departure for Austria, and he never returned to the Peninsular theatre. The British then sent in a fresh army under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington)]] whom the French could not stop.<ref>Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars (3): The Peninsular War 1807\u20131814'' (2014)</ref>\n\nThe Peninsular war proved a major disaster for France. Napoleon did well when he was in direct charge, but severe losses followed his departure, as he severely underestimated how much manpower would be needed. The effort in Spain was a drain on money, manpower and prestige. Historian David Gates called it the \"Spanish ulcer.\"<ref>David Gates, ''The Spanish Ulcer: A History of the Peninsular War'' (1986)</ref> France lost the Peninsular War, and Napoleon realised it had been a disaster for his cause, writing later, \"That unfortunate war destroyed me ...

The Polish army captured [[West Galicia]] following its earlier success. Napoleon assumed personal command and bolstered the army for a counter-attack on Austria. After a few small battles, the well-run campaign forced the Austrians to withdraw from Bavaria, and Napoleon advanced into Austria. His hurried attempt to cross the [[Danube]] resulted in the major [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] (22 May 1809) \u2014 Napoleon's first significant tactical defeat. But the Austrian commander, [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], failed to follow up on his indecisive victory, allowing Napoleon to prepare and seize Vienna in early July. He defeated the Austrians at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], on 5\u20136 July. (It was during the middle of that battle that [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Marshal Bernadotte]] was stripped of his command after retreating contrary to Napoleon's orders. Shortly thereafter, Bernadotte took up the offer from Sweden to fill the vacant position of Crown Prince there. Later he actively participated in wars against his former Emperor.)\n\nThe War of the Fifth Coalition ended with the [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] (14 October 1809). In the east, only the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]ese rebels led by [[Andreas Hofer]] continued to fight the French-Bavarian army until finally defeated in November 1809. In the west the Peninsular War continued. The British and Portuguese remained restricted to the area around Lisbon (behind their impregnable [[lines of Torres Vedras]]) but [[Siege of C\u00e1diz|besieged Cadiz]].\n\nIn 1810, the French Empire reached its greatest extent. Napoleon married [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie-Louise]], an Austrian Archduchess, with the aim of ensuring a more stable alliance with Austria and of providing the Emperor with an heir (something his first wife, Josephine, had failed to do). As well as the French Empire, Napoleon controlled the Swiss Confederation, the Confederation of the Rhine, the Duchy of Warsaw and the Kingdom of Italy. Territories allied with the French included:\n* the [[Denmark-Norway|Kingdom of Denmark]] \n* the [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Spain]] (under [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's elder brother)\n* the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] ([[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], Napoleon's younger brother)\n* the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples|Kingdom of Naples]] (under [[Joachim Murat]], husband of Napoleon's sister [[Caroline Bonaparte|Caroline]])\n* the [[Principality of Lucca and Piombino]] (under [[Elisa Bonaparte]] (Napoleon's sister) and her husband [[Felice Pasquale Baciocchi|Felice Baciocchi]]);\nand Napoleon's former enemies, Sweden, Prussia and Austria.\n\n==Subsidiary wars==\nThe Napoleonic Wars were the direct cause of wars in the Americas and elsewhere.\n\n===War of 1812===\n{{Main|War of 1812}}\nThe [[War of 1812]] coincided with the War of the Sixth Coalition. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, while Europeans often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. The United States declared war on Britain because of British interference with American merchant ships and [[Impressment#Conflict with the United States|forced enlistment]] into the British Royal Navy. France had interfered as well, and the US considered declaring war on France. The war ended in a military stalemate, and there were no boundary changes at the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which took effect in early 1815 when Napoleon was on Elba.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''The War of 1812 in the Age of Napoleon'' (2009)</ref>\n\n===Latin American Revolutions===\n{{main|Spanish American wars of independence|War of Independence of Brazil|Haitian Revolution}}\n[[File:America 1794.png|thumb|200px|Political map of the Americas in 1794]]\nThe abdication of kings [[Charles IV of Spain|Carlos IV]] and [[Ferdinand VII|Fernando VII]] of Spain and the installation of Napoleon's brother as [[Joseph Bonaparte|King Jos\u00e9]] provoked civil wars and revolutions leading to the independence of most of Spain's mainland American colonies. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII, whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] in the wake of these wars.<ref>[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]],  ''Caudillos in Spanish America 1800\u20131850''.

With the defeat of Napoleon and the return of the Braganza monarchy to Portugal, the heir remained in Brazil and declared Brazilian independence, achieving it peacefully with the territory intact.\n\nThe [[Haitian Revolution]] began in 1791, just before the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and continued until 1804.

Emperor Alexander I declared war on Britain after the British attack on Denmark in September 1807. British men-of-war supported the Swedish fleet during the [[Finnish War]] and won victories over the Russians in the [[Gulf of Finland]] in July 1808 and August 1809. The success of the Russian army on land, however, forced Sweden to sign peace treaties with Russia in 1809 and with France in 1810, and to join the blockade against Britain. But Franco-Russian relations became progressively worse after 1810, and the Russian war with Britain effectively ended. In April 1812, Britain, Russia and Sweden signed secret agreements directed against Napoleon.<ref>Alan Palmer, ''Alexander I: Tsar of War and Peace'' (1974)</ref>\n\nThe central issue for both Napoleon and Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] was control over Poland. Each wanted a semi-independent Poland he could control. As Esdaile notes, \"Implicit in the idea of a Russian Poland was, of course, a war against Napoleon.\"<ref>Charles Esdaile, ''Napoleon's Wars: An International History, 1803\u20131815'' (2007) p 438</ref> Schroeder says Poland was \"the root cause\" of Napoleon's war with Russia but Russia's refusal to support the Continental System was also a factor.<ref>Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics: 1763 \u2013 1848'' (1994) p 419</ref>\n\nIn 1812, at the height of his power, Napoleon invaded Russia with a pan-European [[La Grande Arm\u00e9e|''Grande Arm\u00e9e'']], consisting of 450,000 men (200,000 Frenchmen, and many soldiers of allies or subject areas). The French forces crossed the [[Niemen River]] on 24 June 1812. Russia proclaimed a [[Patriotic War of 1812|Patriotic War]], and Napoleon proclaimed a Second Polish war. The Poles supplied almost 100,000 men for the invasion force, but against their expectations, Napoleon avoided any concessions to Poland, having in mind further negotiations with Russia.<ref>{{citation |first=Richard =K. |last=Riehn |title=1812: Napoleon's Russian campaign |year=1990}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' marched through Russia, winning some relatively minor engagements and the major [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Battle of Smolensk]] on 16\u201318 August. In the same days, part of the French Army led by [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Nicolas Oudinot]] was stopped in the [[First Battle of Polotsk|Battle of Polotsk]] by the right wing of the Russian Army, under command of General [[Peter Wittgenstein]]. This prevented the French march on the Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]]; the fate of the invasion was decided in Moscow, where Napoleon led his forces in person.\n\n[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Napoleon]]'s withdrawal from Russia'', a painting by [[Adolph Northen]]]]\n\nRussia used [[scorched-earth]] tactics, and harried the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' with light [[Cossack]] cavalry. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' did not adjust its operational methods in response.<ref>Riehn 1990, pp. 138\u2013140.</ref> This led to most of the losses of the main column of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', which in one case amounted to 95,000 men, including deserters, in a week.<ref>Reihn 1990, p. 185.</ref>\n\nThe main Russian army retreated for almost three months. This constant retreat led to the unpopularity of [[Field Marshal]] [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly]] and a veteran, Prince [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], was made the new Commander-in-Chief by [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. Finally, the two armies engaged in the [[Battle of Borodino]] on 7 September,<ref>Philip Haythornthwaite, ''Borodino 1812; Napoleon's great gamble'' (2012).</ref> in the vicinity of Moscow. The battle was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars, involving more than 250,000 men and resulting in at least 70,000 casualties. It was indecisive; the French captured the main positions on the battlefield, but failed to destroy the Russian army. Logistical difficulties meant that French casualties could not be replaced, unlike Russian ones.\n\nNapoleon entered Moscow on 14 September, after the Russian Army had retreated yet again.<ref>Reihn, ''1812,''  pp. 253\u2013254</ref> By then, the Russians had largely evacuated the city and released criminals from the prisons to inconvenience the French; the governor, Count [[Fyodor Rostopchin]], ordered the city [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|to be burnt]].<ref>''With Napoleon in Russia, The Memoirs of General Coulaincourt,'' Chapter VI 'The Fire' pp. 109\u2013107 Pub.

In October, with no sign of clear victory in sight, Napoleon began the disastrous Great Retreat from Moscow.\n\n[[File:Minard's Map (vectorized).svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s graph of the decreasing size of the Grande Arm\u00e9e represented by the width of the line as it marches to Moscow (tan) and back (black)]]\n\nAt the [[Battle of Maloyaroslavets]] the French tried to reach [[Kaluga]], where they could find food and forage supplies. The replenished Russian Army blocked the road, and Napoleon was forced to retreat the same way he had come to Moscow, through the heavily ravaged areas along the [[Smolensk]] road. In the following weeks, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was dealt a catastrophic blow by the onset of the [[Russian Winter]], the lack of supplies and constant [[guerrilla warfare]] by Russian peasants and irregular troops.\n\nWhen the remnants of the Napoleon's army [[Battle of Berezina|crossed the Berezina River]] in November, only 27,000 fit soldiers survived, with 380,000 men dead or missing and 100,000 captured.<ref>''The Wordsworth Pocket Encyclopedia,'' page 17, Hertfordshire 1993</ref> Napoleon then left his men and returned to Paris to prepare the defence against the advancing Russians. The campaign effectively ended on 14 December 1812, when the last enemy troops left Russia. The Russians had lost around 210,000 men, but with their shorter supply lines, they soon replenished their armies.\n\n==War of the Sixth Coalition 1812\u20131814==\n{{Main|Sixth Coalition}}\n\nSeeing an opportunity in Napoleon's historic defeat, Prussia, Sweden, Austria, and several German states re-entered the war.<ref>Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon in Power'' (2013), pp 431\u201374</ref> Napoleon vowed that he would create a new army as large as the one he had sent into Russia, and quickly built up his forces in the east from 30,000 to 130,000 and eventually to 400,000. Napoleon inflicted 40,000 casualties on the Allies at [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1813)|L\u00fctzen]] (2 May 1813) and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]] (20\u201321 May 1813). Both battles involved forces of over 250,000, making them some of the largest conflicts of the wars so far. Metternich in November 1813 offered Napoleon the [[Frankfurt proposals]]. They would allow Napoleon to remain Emperor but France would be reduced to its \"natural frontiers\" and lose control of most of Italy and Germany and the Netherlands. Napoleon still expected to win the wars, and rejected the terms. By 1814, as the Allies were closing in on Paris, Napoleon did agree to the Frankfurt proposals, but it was too late and he rejected the new harsher terms proposed by the Allies.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite book|last=J.

As the French regrouped, the Anglo\u2013Portuguese entered Madrid and advanced towards Burgos, before retreating all the way to Portugal when renewed French concentrations threatened to trap them. As a consequence of the Salamanca campaign, the French were forced to end their long siege of Cadiz and to permanently evacuate the provinces of [[Andalusia]] and [[Asturias]].<ref>Peter Young and James Philip Lawford, ''Wellington's masterpiece: the battle and campaign of Salamanca'' (outledge, 2015).</ref>\n\nIn a strategic move, Wellesley planned to move his supply base from Lisbon to [[Santander, Spain|Santander]]. The Anglo\u2013Portuguese forces swept northwards in late May and seized Burgos. On 21 June, at [[Battle of Vitoria|Vitoria]], the combined Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish armies won against [[Joseph Bonaparte]], finally breaking French power in Spain. The French had to retreat out of the Iberian peninsula, over the [[Pyrenees]].<ref>Michael Glover, ''Wellington's Peninsular Victories: Busaco, Salamanca, Vitoria, Nivelle'' (1963).</ref>\n\nThe belligerents declared an armistice from 4 June 1813 (continuing until 13 August) during which time both sides attempted to recover from the loss of approximately a quarter of a million men in the preceding two months. During this time coalition negotiations finally brought Austria out in open opposition to France. Two principal Austrian armies took the field, adding 300,000 men to the coalition armies in Germany. The Allies now had around 800,000 front-line soldiers in the German theatre, with a strategic reserve of 350,000 formed to support the front-line operations.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n[[File:General Nansouty at the battle of Hanau.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Hanau]] (30\u201331 October 1813), took part between Austro-Bavarian and French forces.]]\nNapoleon succeeded in bringing the imperial forces in the region to around 650,000\u2014although only 250,000 came under his direct command, with another 120,000 under [[Nicolas Charles Oudinot]] and 30,000 under Davout. The remainder of imperial forces came mostly from the Confederation of the Rhine, especially Saxony and Bavaria. In addition, to the south, Murat's Kingdom of Naples and [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]]'s Kingdom of Italy had 100,000 armed men. In Spain, another 150,000 to 200,000 French troops steadily retreated before Anglo\u2013Portuguese forces numbering around 100,000. Thus around 900,000 Frenchmen in all theatres faced around 1,800,000 coalition soldiers (including the strategic reserve under formation in Germany). The gross figures may mislead slightly, as most of the German troops fighting on the side of the French fought at best unreliably and stood on the verge of defecting to the Allies. One can reasonably say that Napoleon could count on no more than 450,000 men in Germany\u2014which left him outnumbered about four to one.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nFollowing the end of the armistice, Napoleon seemed to have regained the initiative at [[Battle of Dresden|Dresden]] (August 1813), where he once again defeated a numerically superior coalition army and inflicted enormous casualties, while sustaining relatively few. The failures of his marshals and a slow resumption of the offensive on his part cost him any advantage that this victory might have secured. At the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in Saxony (16\u201319 October 1813), also called the \"Battle of the Nations\", 191,000 French fought more than 300,000 Allies, and the defeated French had to retreat into France. After the French withdrawal from Germany, Napoleon's remaining ally, [[Denmark-Norway]], became isolated and [[Treaty of Kiel|fell to the coalition]].<ref>Peter Hofschroer, ''Leipzig 1813: The Battle of the Nations'' (1993)</ref>\n\n[[File:Russparis.jpg|thumb|The Russian Army entering Paris in 1814]]\nNapoleon then fought a series of battles in France, including the [[Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube]], but the overwhelming numbers of the Allies steadily forced him back. The Allies [[Battle of Paris (1814)|entered Paris]] on 30 March 1814. During this time Napoleon fought his [[Six Days' Campaign]], in which he won multiple battles against the enemy forces advancing towards Paris. During this entire campaign he never managed to field more than 70,000 men against more than half a million coalition soldiers. At the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] (9 March 1814), the Allies agreed to preserve the coalition until Napoleon's total defeat.<ref name=\"Philip Dwyer 2013 pp 464-98\">Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon In Power'' (2013) pp 464\u201398</ref>\n\nNapoleon determined to fight on, even now, incapable of fathoming his fall from power. During the campaign he had issued a decree for 900,000 fresh conscripts, but only a fraction of these materialised, and Napoleon's schemes for victory eventually gave way to the reality of his hopeless situation. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Occasional military actions continued in Italy, Spain, and Holland in early 1814.<ref name=\"Philip Dwyer 2013 pp 464-98\"/>\n\nThe victors exiled Napoleon to the island of [[Elba]], and restored the French [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the person of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]].

The period known as the [[Hundred Days]] began after Napoleon escaped from Elba and landed at [[Cannes]] (1 March 1815). Travelling to Paris, picking up support as he went, he eventually overthrew the restored [[Louis XVIII]]. The Allies rapidly gathered their armies to meet him again. Napoleon raised 280,000 men, whom he distributed among several armies. To add to the 90,000-strong standing army, he recalled well over a quarter of a million veterans from past campaigns and issued a decree for the eventual draft of around 2.5&nbsp;million new men into the French army, which was never achieved. This faced an initial coalition force of about 700,000\u2014although coalition campaign plans provided for one million front-line soldiers, supported by around 200,000 garrison, logistics and other auxiliary personnel.\n\nNapoleon took about 124,000 men of the Army of the North on a pre-emptive strike against the Allies in Belgium.<ref>Peter Hofschroer, ''The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras'' (2006)</ref> He intended to attack the coalition armies before they combined, in hope of driving the British into the sea and the Prussians out of the war. His march to the frontier achieved the surprise he had planned, catching the Anglo-Dutch Army in a dispersed arrangement. The Prussians had been more wary, concentrating {{fraction|3|4}} of their army in and around Ligny. The Prussians forced the [[Arm\u00e9e du Nord]] to fight all the day of the 15th to reach Ligny in a delaying action by the Prussian 1st Corps. He forced Prussia to fight at [[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]] on 16 June 1815, and the defeated Prussians retreated in disorder. On the same day, the left wing of the Arm\u00e9e du Nord, under the command of Marshal [[Michel Ney]], succeeded in stopping any of Wellington's forces going to aid Bl\u00fccher's Prussians by fighting a blocking action at [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]]. Ney failed to clear the cross-roads and Wellington reinforced the position. But with the Prussian retreat, Wellington too had to retreat. He fell back to a previously reconnoitred position on an [[escarpment]] at Mont St Jean, a few miles south of the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]].\n\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nNapoleon took the reserve of the Army of the North, and reunited his forces with those of Ney to pursue Wellington's army, after he ordered Marshal [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Grouchy]] to take the right wing of the Army of the North and stop the Prussians re-grouping. In the first of a series of miscalculations, both Grouchy and Napoleon failed to realise that the Prussian forces were already reorganised and were assembling at the village of Wavre. The French army did nothing to stop a rather leisurely retreat that took place throughout the night and into the early morning by the Prussians. As the 4th, 1st, and 2nd Prussian Corps marched through the town towards Waterloo the 3rd Prussian Corps took up blocking positions across the river, and although Grouchy engaged and defeated the Prussian rearguard under the command of Lt-Gen [[Johann von Thielmann|von Thielmann]] in the [[Battle of Wavre]] (18\u201319 June) it was 12 hours too late. In the end, 17,000 Prussians had kept 33,000 badly needed French reinforcements off the field.\n\nNapoleon delayed the start of fighting at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on the morning of 18 June for several hours while he waited for the ground to dry after the previous night's rain. By late afternoon, the French army had not succeeded in driving Wellington's forces from the escarpment on which they stood. When the Prussians arrived and attacked the French right flank in ever-increasing numbers, Napoleon's strategy of keeping the coalition armies divided had failed and a combined coalition general advance drove his army from the field in confusion.\n\nGrouchy organised a successful and well-ordered retreat towards Paris, where Marshal Davout had 117,000 men ready to turn back the 116,000 men of Bl\u00fccher and Wellington. [[Dominique Vandamme|General Vandamme]] was defeated at the [[Battle of Issy]] and negotiations for surrender had begun.\n\n[[File:Charge of the French Cuirassiers at Waterloo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The charge of the French [[Cuirassier]]s at the Battle of Waterloo against a square of [[Scottish regiment|Scottish Highlanders]]]]\n\nOn arriving at Paris three days after Waterloo, Napoleon still clung to the hope of a concerted national resistance; but the temper of the [[Parliament of France|legislative chamber]]s, and of the public generally, did not favour his view. Lacking support Napoleon abdicated again on 22 June 1815, and on 15 July he surrendered to the British squadron at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. The Allies exiled him to the remote South Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]], where he died on 5 May 1821.\n\nIn Italy, [[Joachim Murat]], whom the Allies had allowed to remain King of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] after Napoleon's initial defeat, once again allied with his brother-in-law, triggering the [[Neapolitan War]] (March to May 1815). Hoping to find support among Italian nationalists fearing the increasing influence of the Habsburgs in Italy, Murat issued the [[Rimini Proclamation]] inciting them to war. The proclamation failed and the Austrians soon crushed Murat at the [[Battle of Tolentino]] (2 May to 3 May 1815), forcing him to flee. The [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] returned to the throne of Naples on 20 May 1815. Murat tried to regain his throne, but after that failed, he was executed by firing squad on 13 October 1815.\n\n==Political effects==\nThe Napoleonic Wars brought radical changes to Europe, but the reactionary forces returned to power and tried to reverse some of them<ref>Jacques Godechot, et al. ''The Napoleonic era in Europe'' (1971)</ref> by [[Bourbon Restoration|restoring the Bourbon house]] on the French throne. Napoleon had succeeded in bringing most of Western Europe under one rule. In most European countries, subjugation in the French Empire brought with it many liberal features of the French Revolution including democracy, [[due process]] in courts, abolition of serfdom, reduction of the power of the Catholic Church, and a demand for constitutional limits on monarchs. The increasing voice of the middle classes with rising commerce and industry meant that restored European monarchs found it difficult to restore pre-revolutionary [[absolute monarch|absolutism]] and had to retain many of the reforms enacted during Napoleon's rule. Institutional legacies remain to this day in the form of [[Civil Law (legal system)|civil law]], with clearly defined [[code of law|codes of law]]\u2014an enduring legacy of the [[Napoleonic Code]].\n \n[[File:Europe 1815 map en.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The national boundaries within Europe set by the Congress of Vienna, 1815]]\n\nFrance's constant warfare with the combined forces of the other major powers of Europe for over two decades finally took its toll. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, France no longer held the role of the dominant [[historical powers|power]] in Continental Europe, as it had since the times of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], as the [[Congress of Vienna]] produced a \"[[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]\" by resizing the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace. In this regard, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was restored in its former borders, and also received large chunks of [[Grand Duchy of Warsaw|Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]]. Greatly enlarged, Prussia became a permanent [[Great Power]]. In order to drag Prussia's attention towards the west and France, the Congress also gave the [[Prussian Rhineland|Rhineland]] and [[Prussian Westphalia|Westphalia]] to Prussia. These industrial regions transformed agrarian Prussia into an industrial leader in the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Britain emerged as the most important economic power, and its [[Royal Navy]] held unquestioned naval superiority across the globe well into the 20th century.<ref name=\"The Royal Navy\"/>\n\nAfter the Napoleonic period, nationalism, a relatively new movement, became increasingly significant. This shaped much of the course of future European history. Its growth spelled the beginning of some states and the end of others, as the map of Europe changed dramatically in the hundred years following the [[Napoleonic Era]]. Rule by fiefdoms and aristocracy was widely replaced by national ideologies based on shared origins and culture. Bonaparte's reign over Europe sowed the seeds for the founding of the nation-states of [[Unification of Germany|Germany]] and [[Italian unification|Italy]] by starting the process of consolidating city-states, kingdoms and principalities. At the end of the war Denmark was forced to cede Norway to Sweden mainly as a compensation for the loss of [[Finland]] which the other coalition members agreed to, but because Norway had signed its own constitution on 17 May 1814 [[Sweden]] initiated the Swedish\u2013Norwegian War of 1814. The war was a short one taking place between 26 July \u2013 14 August 1814 and was a Swedish victory that put [[Norway]] into a personal union with [[Sweden]] under [[Charles XIV John of Sweden]]. The union was peacefully dissolved in 1905.

In [[Portuguese America]], Brazil experienced greater autonomy as it now [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|served as seat of the Portuguese Empire]] and ascended politically to the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|status of Kingdom]].

After his defeat, Napoleon deplored the fact that his dream of a free and peaceful \"European association\" remained unaccomplished. Such a European association would share the same principles of government, system of measurement, currency and [[Civil Code]]. One-and-a-half centuries later, and after two world wars several of these ideals re-emerged in the form of the [[European Union]].\n\n==Military legacy==\n\n===Enlarged scope===\n[[File:Lejeune - Bataille de Marengo.jpg|thumb|In 1800 Bonaparte took the French Army across the Alps, eventually defeating the Austrians at [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]].]]\n\nUntil the time of Napoleon, European states employed relatively small armies, made up of both national soldiers and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. These regulars were highly drilled professional soldiers. [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] armies could only deploy small field armies due to rudimentary staffs and comprehensive yet cumbersome logistics. Both issues combined to limit field forces to approximately 30,000 men under a single commander.\n\nMilitary innovators in the mid-18th century began to recognise the potential of an entire nation at war: a \"nation in arms\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/napoleonic_wars/6361907.html|title=Napoleon's Total War|publisher=HistoryNet.com|accessdate=18 November 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401054136/http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/napoleonic_wars/6361907.html|archivedate=1 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe scale of warfare dramatically enlarged during the Revolutionary and subsequent Napoleonic Wars. During Europe's major pre-revolutionary war, the [[Seven Years' War]] of 1756\u20131763, few armies ever numbered more than 200,000 with field forces often numbering less than 30,000. The French innovations of separate corps (allowing a single commander to efficiently command more than the traditional command span of 30,000 men) and living off the land (which allowed field armies to deploy more men without requiring an equal increase in supply arrangements such as depots and supply trains) allowed the French republic to field much larger armies than their opponents. Napoleon ensured during the time of the French republic that separate French field armies operated as a single army under his control, often allowing him to substantially outnumber his opponents. This forced his continental opponents to increase the size of their armies as well, moving away from the traditional small, well drilled Ancien R\u00e9gime armies of the 18th century to mass conscript armies.\n\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Napoleon on the field of [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]]]]\n\nThe Battle of Marengo, which largely ended the War of the Second Coalition, was fought with fewer than 60,000 men on both sides. The Battle of Austerlitz which ended the War of the Third Coalition involved fewer than 160,000 men. The Battle of Friedland which led to peace with Russia in 1807 involved about 150,000 men.\n\nAfter these defeats, the continental powers developed various forms of mass conscription to allow them to face France on even terms, and the size of field armies increased rapidly. The battle of Wagram of 1809 involved 300,000 men, and 500,000 fought at Leipzig in 1813, of whom 150,000 were killed or wounded.\n\nAbout a million French soldiers became casualties (wounded, invalided or killed), a higher proportion than in the First World War. The European total may have reached 5,000,000 military deaths, including disease.<ref>David A.Bell, ''The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the Birth of Warfare as We Know It'' (2007) p 7</ref><ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1987) pp&nbsp;99\u2013100</ref>\n\nFrance had the second-largest population in Europe by the end of the 18th century (27&nbsp;million, as compared to Britain's 12 million and Russia's 35 to 40&nbsp;million).<ref>Colin McEvedy and Richard M.

Before Napoleon's efforts, [[Lazare Carnot]] played a large part in the reorganisation of the French army from 1793 to 1794\u2014a time which saw previous French misfortunes reversed, with Republican armies advancing on all fronts.\n\n[[File:National Museum in Poznan - Przej\u015bcie przez Berezyn\u0119.JPG|thumb|Napoleon's retreat from Russia in 1812. His ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' had lost about half a million men.]]\nThe French army peaked in size in the 1790s with 1.5&nbsp;million Frenchmen enlisted although battlefield strength was much less. Haphazard bookkeeping, rudimentary medical support and lax recruitment standards ensured that many soldiers either never existed, fell ill or were unable to withstand the physical demands of soldiering.\n\nAbout 2.8&nbsp;million Frenchmen fought on land and about 150,000 at sea, bringing the total for France to almost 3 million combatants during almost 25 years of warfare.<ref name=\"John France 2011 351\"/>\n\n[[File:Trafalgar Crepin mg 0578.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Trafalgar]]]]\nBritain had 750,000 men under arms between 1792 and 1815 as its army expanded from 40,000 men in 1793<ref name=\"Chappell8\">Chappell, p. 8</ref> to a peak of 250,000 men in 1813.<ref name=\"Oxford132\"/> Over 250,000 sailors served in the [[Royal Navy]]. In September 1812, Russia had 900,000 enlisted men in its land forces, and between 1799 and 1815 2.1&nbsp;million men served in its army. Another 200,000 served in the Russian Navy. Out of the 900,000 men, the field armies deployed against France numbered less than 250,000.\n\nThere are no consistent statistics for other major combatants. Austria's forces peaked at about 576,000 (during the War of the Sixth Coalition) and had little or no naval component yet never fielded more than 250,000 men in field armies. After Britain, Austria proved the most persistent enemy of France; more than a million Austrians served during the long wars. Its large army was overall quite homogeneous and solid and in 1813 operated in Germany (140,000 men), Italy and the Balkans (90,000 men at its peak, about 50,000 men during most of the campaigning on these fronts). Austria's manpower was becoming quite limited towards the end of the wars, leading its generals to favour cautious and conservative strategies, to limit their losses.\n\n[[File:Baschkiren gegen Franzosen.jpg|thumb|French soldiers in skirmish with [[Bashkirs]] and [[Cossacks]] in 1813]]\nPrussia never had more than 320,000 men under arms at any time. In 1813\u20131815, the core of its army (about 100,000 men) was characterised by competence and determination, but the bulk of its forces consisted of second- and third-line troops, as well as militiamen of variable strength. Many of these troops performed reasonably well and often displayed considerable bravery but lacked the professionalism of their regular counterparts and were not as well equipped. Others were largely unfit for operations, except sieges. During the 1813 campaign, 130,000 men were used in the military operations, with 100,000 effectively participating in the main German campaign, and about 30,000 being used to besiege isolated French garrisons.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSpain's armies also peaked at around 200,000 men, not including more than 50,000 guerrillas scattered over Spain. In addition the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha Confederation]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] each had more than 100,000 men under arms. Even small nations now had armies rivalling the size of the [[Great Powers]]' forces of past wars but most of these were poor quality forces only suitable for garrison duties. The size of their combat forces remained modest yet they could still provide a welcome addition to the major powers. The percentage of French troops in the Grande Armee which Napoleon led into Russia was about 50% while the French allies also provided a significant contribution to the French forces in Spain. As these small nations joined the coalition forces in 1813\u20131814, they provided a useful addition to the coalition while depriving Napoleon of much needed manpower.\n\n===Innovations===\nThe initial stages of the [[Industrial Revolution]] had much to do with larger military forces\u2014it became easy to mass-produce weapons and thus to equip larger forces. Britain was the largest single manufacturer of armaments in this period. It supplied most of the weapons used by the coalition powers throughout the conflicts. France produced the second-largest total of armaments, equipping its own huge forces as well as those of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and other allies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Christopher David Hall|title=British Strategy in the Napoleonic War, 1803\u201315|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ue8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA28|year=1992|publisher=Manchester U.P.|page=28|isbn=9780719036064}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon showed innovative tendencies in his use of mobility to offset numerical disadvantages, as demonstrated in the rout of the Austro-Russian forces in 1805 in the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. The French Army redefined the role of artillery, forming independent, mobile units, as opposed to the previous tradition of attaching artillery pieces in support of troops.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe [[Semaphore line|semaphore system]] had allowed the French War-Minister, Carnot, to communicate with French forces on the frontiers throughout the 1790s.

Most historians argue that the escalation in size and scope came from two sources. First was the ideological clash between revolutionary/egalitarian and conservative/hierarchical belief systems. Second was the emergence of [[nationalism]] in France, Germany, Spain, and elsewhere that made these \"people's wars\" instead of contests between monarchs.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald Stoker|title=Conscription in the Napoleonic Era: A Revolution in Military Affairs?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iks6rVhTHrwC&pg=PA38|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|pages=24, 31\u201332, 38|display-authors=etal|isbn=9780203674048}}</ref> Bell has argued that even more important than ideology and nationalism were the intellectual transformations in the culture of war that came about through [[the Enlightenment]].<ref>Bell, ''The First Total War'' (2008) pp&nbsp;7\u201313</ref> One factor, he says, is that war was no longer a routine event but a transforming experience for societies\u2014a total experience. Secondly the military emerged in its own right as a separate sphere of society distinct from the ordinary civilian world. The French Revolution made every civilian a part of the war machine, either as a soldier through universal conscription, or as a vital cog in the home front machinery supporting and supplying the army. Out of that, says Bell, came \"militarism,\" the belief that the military role was morally superior to the civilian role in times of great national crisis. The fighting army represented the essence of the nation's soul.<ref>Many historians say it was not the \"first\" total war; for a critique of Bell see {{cite book|author=Frederick C.

The use and misuse of military intelligence dictated the course of many major battles during the Napoleonic Wars. Some of the major battles that were dictated by the use of intelligence include: The Battle of Waterloo, Battle of Leipzig, Battle of Salamanca, and the Battle of Vitoria. A major exception to the greater use of superior military intelligence to claim victory was the Battle of Jena in 1806. At the Battle of Jena even Prussian superior military intelligence was not enough to counter the sheer military force of Napoleons' armies. \n\nThe use of intelligence varied greatly across the major world powers of the war. Napoleon at this time had more supply of intelligence given to him than any French general before him. However, Napoleon was not advocate of military intelligence at this time as he often found it unreliable and inaccurate when compared to his own preconceived notions of the enemy. Napoleon rather studied his enemy via domestic newspapers, diplomatic publications, maps, and prior documents of military engagements in the theaters of war in which he would operate. It was this stout and constant study of the enemy which made Napoleon the military mastermind of his time. Whereas, his opponents--Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia\u2014who were much more reliant on traditional intelligence gathering methods and were much more quickly and willing to act on them. \n\nThe methods of Intelligence during these wars were to include the formation of vast and complex networks of corresponding agents, codebreaking, and cryptanalysis. The greatest cipher to be used to hide military operations during this time was known as the Great Paris Cipher used by the French. However, thanks to hard work of British codebreakers like George Scovell, the British were able to crack French ciphers and gain vast amounts of military intelligence on Napoleon and his armies.<ref name=\"The Secret World\" group=\"Intel\">{{cite book |last1=Andrew |first1=Christopher |title=The Secret World |date=2018 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=Yale |isbn=978-0-300-23844-0 }}</ref>\n\n==In fiction==\n{{main|Napoleonic Wars in fiction}}\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] were a defining event of the early 19th century, and inspired many works of fiction, from then until the present day.\n\n*[[Leo Tolstoy]]'s epic novel ''[[War and Peace]]'' recounts Napoleon's wars between 1805 and 1812 (especially the disastrous 1812 invasion of Russia and subsequent retreat) from a Russian perspective.\n*[[Stendhal]]'s novel ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'' opens with a ground-level recounting of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and the subsequent chaotic retreat of French forces.\n*''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]] takes place against the backdrop of the Napoleonic War and subsequent decades, and in its unabridged form contains an epic telling of the [[Battle of Waterloo]].\n*''[[Adieu (novella)|Adieu]]'' is a novella by [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] in which can be found a short description of the French retreat from Russia, particularly the [[battle of Berezina]], where the fictional couple of the story are tragically separated.

'''Napoleonic Wars''' (1803\u20131815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and its allies, led by [[Napoleon I]], against a fluctuating array of [[Coalition forces of the Napoleonic Wars|European powers formed into various coalitions]], financed and usually led by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the [[French Revolution]] and its [[French Revolutionary Wars|resultant conflict]]. The wars are often categorised into five conflicts, each termed after the coalition that fought Napoleon: the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] (1805), the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth]] (1806\u201307), the [[War of the Fifth Coalition|Fifth]] (1809), the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth]] (1813), and the [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh]] (1815).\n\nNapoleon, upon ascending to First Consul of France in 1799, had inherited a [[First French Republic|chaotic republic]]; he subsequently created a state with stable finances, a strong bureaucracy, and a well-trained army. In 1805, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] started the '''Third Coalition''' and waged war against France. In response, Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] in December 1805, which is considered his greatest victory. At sea, the British severely defeated the joint Franco-Spanish navy in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October 1805. This victory secured British control of the seas and prevented the [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|invasion of Britain itself]]. Concerned about increasing French power, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] led the creation of the '''Fourth Coalition''' with Russia, Saxony and Sweden, and the resumption of war in October 1806. Napoleon quickly defeated the Prussians in [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|Jena]] and the Russians in [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]], bringing an [[Treaties of Tilsit|uneasy peace]] to the continent. The peace failed, though, as war broke out in 1809, when the badly prepared '''Fifth Coalition''', led by Austria, was quickly defeated in [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]].\n\nHoping to [[Continental System|isolate Britain economically]], Napoleon launched an [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|invasion of Portugal]], the only remaining British ally in continental Europe. After occupying Lisbon in November 1807, and with the bulk of French troops present in Spain, Napoleon seized the opportunity to turn against his former ally, depose the reigning [[Spanish Bourbons|Spanish Bourbon family]] and declare his brother King of Spain in 1808 as [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph I]]. The Spanish and Portuguese revolted with British support and expelled the French from Iberia in 1814 after [[Peninsular War|six years of fighting]].\n\nConcurrently, Russia, unwilling to bear economic consequences of reduced trade, routinely violated the [[Continental System]], prompting Napoleon to launch a [[French invasion of Russia|massive invasion of Russia]] in 1812. The resulting campaign ended with the dissolution and disastrous withdrawal of the French ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]''.\n\nEncouraged by the defeat, Prussia, Austria, and Russia formed the '''Sixth Coalition''' and began a new campaign against France, decisively defeating Napoleon at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] in October 1813 after several inconclusive engagements. The Allies then invaded France from the east, while the Peninsular War spilled over into southwestern France. Coalition troops captured Paris at the end of March 1814 and [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|forced Napoleon to abdicate]] in April. He was exiled to the island of [[Elba]], and the [[Bourbon restoration|Bourbons were restored to power]]. But Napoleon escaped in February 1815, and reassumed control of France for about one [[hundred days]]. In the '''Seventh Coalition''', the Allies defeated him permanently at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in June 1815 and exiled him to [[St Helena]], where he died six years later.<ref name=\"zamoy\">{{cite book |last1=Zamoyski |first1=Adam |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=NqVKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT480 |title=Napolean: A Life |date=16 October 2018 |publisher=Basic Books |page=480 |location=London |isbn=9780465055937 |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congress of Vienna]] redrew the borders of Europe, and brought a period of relative peace. The wars had profound consequences on global history, including the spread of [[nationalism]] and [[liberalism]], the rise of the [[British Empire]] as the world's [[Pax Britannica|foremost power]], the appearance of [[Latin American wars of independence|independence movements]] in [[Latin America]] and subsequent collapse of the [[Spanish Empire]], the fundamental reorganisation of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods of conducting warfare.\n\n==Overview==\nNapoleon [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|seized power]] in 1799, creating a ''de facto'' [[military dictatorship]].<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\">{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43294-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeillustr00jone_0/page/193 193\u2013194]|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeillustr00jone_0/page/193|date=20 October 1994}}</ref> There are a number of opinions on the date to use as the formal beginning of the Napoleonic Wars; 18 May 1803 is often used, when Britain and France ended the only short period of peace between 1792 and 1814.<ref name=\"Frederick Kagan 2007 pp 42-43\">Frederick Kagan, ''The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801\u20131805'' (2007) pp 42\u201343</ref> The Napoleonic Wars began with the [[War of the Third Coalition]], which was the first of the [[Coalition Wars]] against the [[First French Republic]] after Napoleon's accession as leader of [[France]].\n\nBritain ended the [[Treaty of Amiens]] and declared war on France in May 1803. Among the reasons were Napoleon's changes to the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Kagan argues that Britain was irritated in particular by Napoleon's assertion of [[Switzerland in the Napoleonic era|control over Switzerland]]. Furthermore, Britons felt insulted when Napoleon stated that their country deserved no voice in European affairs, even though King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] was an [[Prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. For its part, Russia decided that the intervention in Switzerland indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution of his differences with the other European powers.<ref name=\"Frederick Kagan 2007 pp 42-43\"/>\n\nThe British hastily enforced a [[naval blockade]] of France to starve it of resources. Napoleon responded with [[Continental System|economic embargoes against Britain]], and sought to eliminate Britain's Continental allies to break the coalitions arrayed against him. The so-called ''[[Continental System]]'' formed a [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|league of armed neutrality]] to disrupt the blockade and enforce [[free trade]] with France. The British responded by [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|capturing the Danish fleet]], breaking up the league, and later [[Battle of Trafalgar|secured dominance over the seas]], allowing it to freely continue its strategy. Napoleon won the [[War of the Third Coalition]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], forcing the [[Austrian Empire]] [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|out of the war]] and formally dissolving the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Within months, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] declared war, triggering a [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]. This war ended disastrously for Prussia, [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|defeated and occupied]] within 19 days of the beginning of the campaign. Napoleon subsequently defeated the [[Russian Empire]] at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]], creating powerful client states in Eastern Europe and ending the fourth coalition.\n\nConcurrently, the refusal of [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] to commit to the Continental System, and [[Spanish Empire|Spain's]] failure to maintain it, led to the [[Peninsular War]] and the outbreak of the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]]. The French occupied Spain and formed a [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Spanish client kingdom]], ending the alliance between the two. Heavy British involvement in the Iberian Peninsula soon followed, while a [[Walcheren Expedition|British effort to capture Antwerp]] failed. Napoleon oversaw the situation in Iberia, [[Battle of Somosierra|defeating the Spanish]], and [[Battle of Corunna|expelling the British]] from the Peninsula. Austria, keen to recover territory lost during the [[War of the Third Coalition]], invaded France's client states in Eastern Europe. Napoleon defeated the fifth coalition at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]].\n\nAttempts to disrupt the British blockade led to the United States [[War of 1812|declaring war on Britain]], while grievances over control of Poland, and Russia's withdrawal from the [[Continental System]], led to [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon invading Russia]] in June 1812. The invasion was an unmitigated disaster for Napoleon; [[Scorched-earth|scorched earth]] tactics, [[desertion]], [[Battle of Borodino|French strategic failures]] and the onset of the Russian winter [[French invasion of Russia#Retreat and losses|compelled Napoleon to retreat with massive losses]]. Napoleon suffered further setbacks; French power in the Iberian Peninsula was broken at [[Battle of Vitoria]] the following summer, and a new coalition began the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].\n\nThe coalition defeated Napoleon at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]], precipitating his fall from power and eventual abdication on 6 April 1814. The victors exiled Napoleon to [[Elba]] and [[Bourbon Restoration|restored the Bourbon monarchy]]. Napoleon escaped from Elba in 1815, gathering enough support to overthrow the monarchy of [[Louis XVIII]], triggering a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|seventh, and final, coalition against him]]. Napoleon was [[Battle of Waterloo|decisively defeated at Waterloo]], and he abdicated again on 22 June. On 15 July, he surrendered to the British at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], and was exiled to [[Saint Helena]], where he died in 1821.

In 1793, the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the [[Enlightenment Spain|Spanish Empire]], and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] formed the [[First Coalition]] to curtail the growing unrest in France. Measures such as [[Lev\u00e9e en masse|mass conscription]], military reforms, and total war allowed France to defeat the coalition, despite the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|concurrent civil war in France]]. [[Napoleon]], then a general in the French army, forced the Austrians to sign the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], leaving only Great Britain opposed to the fledgling French Republic.\n\nA [[War of the Second Coalition|Second Coalition]] was formed in 1798 by Great Britain, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Papal States]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]]. The French Republic, under the [[French Directory|Directory]], suffered from heavy levels of corruption and [[Chouannerie|internal strife]]. The new republic also lacked funds, and no longer enjoyed the services of [[Lazare Carnot]], the minister of war who had guided France to its victories during the early stages of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolution]]. Bonaparte, commander of the [[Arm\u00e9e d'Italie]] in the latter stages of the First Coalition, had [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|launched a campaign in Egypt]], intending to disrupt the British economic powerhouse of [[British India|India]]. Pressed from all sides, the Republic suffered a string of successive defeats against revitalised enemies, supported by Britain's financial help.\n\n[[File:Napoleon at the Battle of Rivoli.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte defeating the Austrians at the [[Battle of Rivoli]] in 1797]]\nBonaparte returned to France from Egypt on 23 August 1799, his [[Battle of the Nile|campaign there having failed]]. He seized control of the French government on 9 November, in [[coup of 18 Brumaire|a bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat]], replacing the Directory with the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and transforming the republic into a ''de facto'' dictatorship.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/> He further reorganised the French military forces, establishing a large reserve army positioned to support campaigns on the [[Rhine]] or in [[Italy]]. [[Second Battle of Zurich|Russia had already been knocked out of the war]], and, under Napoleon's leadership, the French [[Battle of Marengo|decisively defeated the Austrians in June 1800]], crippling Austrian capabilities in Italy. Austria was [[Battle of Hohenlinden|definitively defeated that December]], by Moreau's forces in Bavaria. The Austrian defeat was sealed by the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] early the following year, further compelling the British to sign the [[Treaty of Amiens]] with France, establishing a tenuous peace.\n\n===Start date and nomenclature===\nNo consensus exists as to when the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] ended and the Napoleonic Wars began.

This caused widespread outrage in Britain, which protested that this was a violation of the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville.

Protected by naval supremacy (in the words of Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] to the House of Lords \"I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come. I say only they will not come by sea\"), Britain did not have to spend the entire war defending itself and could therefore focus on supporting its embattled allies, maintaining low-intensity land warfare on a global scale for over a decade. The British government paid out large sums of money to other European states, so that they could pay armies in the field against France. These payments are colloquially known as the [[Golden Cavalry of St George]]. The British Army provided long-term support to the Spanish rebellion in the Peninsular War of 1808\u20131814, assisted by Spanish [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] ('little war') tactics. Anglo-Portuguese forces under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] supported the Spanish, which campaigned successfully against the French armies, eventually driving them from Spain and allowing Britain to invade southern France. By 1815, the British Army played the central role in the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.\n[[File:BritishEmpire1815.png|thumb|260px|The British managed to occupy and take control of [[Cape Colony]], [[British Guiana]], [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], [[British Mauritius|Mauritius]] and [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] during the Napoleonic Wars.]]\nBeyond minor naval actions against British imperial interests, the Napoleonic Wars were much less global in scope than preceding conflicts such as the [[Seven Years' War]], which historians term a \"[[world war]]\".\n\n===Economic warfare===\nIn response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on 16 May 1806, Napoleon issued the [[Berlin Decree]] on 21 November 1806, which brought into effect the [[Continental System]].<ref>Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics 1763\u20131848'' (1994) pp&nbsp;307\u201310</ref> This policy aimed to eliminate the threat from Britain by closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Britain maintained a standing army of 220,000 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, of whom less than half were available for campaigning. The rest were necessary for garrisoning Ireland and the colonies, and providing security for Britain. France's strength peaked at around 2,500,000 full-time and part-time soldiers including several hundred thousand National Guardsmen whom Napoleon could draft into the military if necessary. Both nations enlisted large numbers of sedentary militia who were unsuited for campaigning, and were mostly employed to release regular forces for active duty.<ref name=\"Paul Kennedy 1989 pp. 128\">Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers \u2013 economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1989), pp. 128\u20139</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy disrupted France's extra-continental trade by seizing and threatening French shipping and [[French colonial empire|colonial possessions]], but could do nothing about France's trade with the major continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. France's population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of Britain. Britain had the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade. This ensured that France could never consolidate its control over Europe in peace. Many in the French government believed that cutting Britain off from the Continent would end its economic influence over Europe and isolate it.\n\n===Financing the war===\nA key element in British success was its ability to mobilise the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. Although the UK had a population of circa 16 million against France's 30 million, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for many of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 men in 1813.<ref name=\"Paul Kennedy 1989 pp. 128\"/><ref>John M.

Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of [[frigate]]s, adding 50% more large [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], and increasing the number of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France saw its navy shrink by more than half.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783\u20131867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) p 143</ref> The smuggling of finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to weaken the British economy by cutting off markets. Subsidies to Russia and Austria kept them in the war. The British budget in 1814 reached \u00a398 million, including \u00a310 million for the Royal Navy, \u00a340 million for the army, \u00a310 million for the allies, and \u00a338 million as interest on the national debt, which soared to \u00a3679 million, more than double the GDP.

On 2 December, Napoleon crushed the Austro-Russian force in [[Moravia]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (usually considered his greatest victory).

With the withdrawal of Austria from the war, stalemate ensued. Napoleon's army had a record of continuous unbroken victories on land, but the full force of the Russian army had not yet come into play. Napoleon had now consolidated his hold on France, had taken control of Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and most of Western Germany and northern Italy. His admirers say that Napoleon wanted to stop now, but was forced to continue in order to gain greater security from the countries that refused to accept his conquests. Esdaille rejects that explanation and instead says that it was a good time to stop expansion, for the major powers were ready to accept Napoleon as he was:\n: in 1806 both Russia and Britain had been positively eager to make peace, and they might well have agreed to terms that would have left the Napoleonic imperium almost completely intact. As for Austria and Prussia, they simply wanted to be left alone. To have secured a compromise peace, then, would have been comparatively easy. But Napoleon was prepared to make no concessions.<ref>Esdaille, ''Napoleon's Wars, pp 252\u201353</ref>\n\n==War of the Fourth Coalition 1806\u20131807==\n{{Main|War of the Fourth Coalition}}\n[[File:Charles Meynier - Entr\u00e9e de Napol\u00e9on \u00e0 Berlin. 27 octobre 1806.jpg|thumb|After defeating Prussian forces at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena]], the French Army entered Berlin on 27 October 1806.]]\n\nWithin months of the collapse of the Third Coalition, the [[Fourth Coalition]] (1806\u201307) against France was formed by Britain, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden. In July 1806, Napoleon formed the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] out of the many tiny German states which constituted the [[Rhineland]] and most other western parts of Germany. He amalgamated many of the smaller states into larger electorates, duchies, and kingdoms to make the governance of non-Prussian Germany smoother. Napoleon elevated the rulers of the two largest Confederation states, [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], to the status of kings.\n\nIn August 1806, the Prussian king, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]], decided to go to war independently of any other great power. The army of Russia, a Prussian ally, in particular was too far away to assist. On 8 October 1806, Napoleon unleashed all the French forces east of the Rhine into Prussia. Napoleon defeated a Prussian army at [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] (14 October 1806), and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] defeated another at [[Battle of Auerst\u00e4dt|Auerst\u00e4dt]] on the same day. 160,000 French soldiers (increasing in number as the campaign went on) attacked Prussia, moving with such speed that they destroyed the entire Prussian army as an effective military force. Out of 250,000 troops the Prussians sustained 25,000 casualties, lost a further 150,000 as prisoners, 4,000 artillery pieces, and over 100,000 muskets. At Jena, Napoleon had fought only a detachment of the Prussian force. The battle at Auerst\u00e4dt involved a single French corps defeating the bulk of the Prussian army. Napoleon entered Berlin on 27 October 1806. He visited the tomb of [[Frederick the Great]] and instructed his marshals to remove their hats there, saying, \"If he were alive we wouldn't be here today\". Napoleon had taken only 19 days from beginning his attack on Prussia to knock it out of the war with the capture of Berlin and the destruction of its principal armies at Jena and Auerst\u00e4dt. Saxony left Prussia, and together with small states from north Germany, allied with France.\n\n[[File:Friedland mazurovsky.jpg|thumb|left|Charge of the Russian [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]] cavalry against French cuirassiers at the [[Battle of Friedland]], 14 June 1807]]\n\nIn the next stage of the war, the French drove Russian forces out of Poland and employed many Polish and German soldiers in several sieges in [[Silesia]] and [[Pomerania]], with the assistance of Dutch and Italian soldiers in the latter case. Napoleon then turned north to confront the remainder of the Russian army and to try to capture the temporary Prussian capital at [[K\u00f6nigsberg]]. A tactical draw at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] (7\u20138 February 1807), followed by capitulation at [[Siege of Danzig (1807)|Danzig]] (24 May 1807) and the [[Battle of Heilsberg]] (10 June 1807), forced the Russians to withdraw further north. Napoleon decisively beat the Russian army at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (14 June 1807), following which Alexander had to make peace with Napoleon at [[Treaty of Tilsit|Tilsit]] (7 July 1807). In Germany and Poland, new Napoleonic client states, such as the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], [[Duchy of Warsaw]], and [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Republic of Danzig]], were established.\n\nBy September, [[Guillaume Brune|Marshal Guillaume Brune]] completed the occupation of [[Swedish Pomerania]], allowing the Swedish army to withdraw with all its munitions of war.\n\n===Scandinavia and Finland===\n{{Main|Gunboat War|Finnish War|Dano-Swedish War of 1808-09}}\n[[File:Battle of Trangen.JPG|thumb|The [[Battle of Trangen]] during the [[Dano-Swedish War of 1808\u201309|Dano-Swedish War, 1808\u20131809]].

Napoleon also sent an auxiliary corps, consisting of troops from France, [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]], led by Marshal [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], to Denmark to participate in the invasion of Sweden. But British naval superiority prevented the armies from crossing the [[\u00d8resund]] strait, and the war came mainly to be fought along the Swedish-Norwegian border. At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] (September\u2013October 1808), France and Russia further agreed on the division of Sweden into two parts separated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], where the eastern part became the Russian [[Grand Duchy of Finland]].

Napoleon's impact on Poland was huge, including the Napoleonic legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.<ref>J. P.

The sea became a major [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of war]] against Napoleon's allies. During the time of the Fifth Coalition, the Royal Navy won a succession of victories in the French colonies. On land the major battles included [[Battle of Raszyn]], [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]], and [[Battle of Wagram]].\n\nOn land, the Fifth Coalition attempted few extensive military endeavours. One, the [[Walcheren Expedition]] of 1809, involved a dual effort by the British Army and the Royal Navy to relieve Austrian forces under intense French pressure. It ended in disaster after the Army commander, [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham]], failed to capture the objective, the naval base of French-controlled [[Antwerp]]. For the most part of the years of the Fifth Coalition, British military operations on land (apart from the Iberian Peninsula) remained restricted to hit-and-run operations executed by the Royal Navy, which dominated the sea after having beaten down almost all substantial naval opposition from France and its allies and blockading what remained of France's naval forces in heavily fortified French-controlled ports. These rapid-attack operations were aimed mostly at destroying blockaded French naval and mercantile shipping and the disruption of French supplies, communications, and military units stationed near the coasts. Often, when British allies attempted military actions within several dozen miles or so of the sea, the Royal Navy would arrive, land troops and supplies, and aid the coalition's land forces in a concerted operation. Royal Navy ships even provided artillery support against French units when fighting strayed near enough to the coastline. The ability and quality of the land forces governed these operations. For example, when operating with inexperienced guerrilla forces in Spain, the Royal Navy sometimes failed to achieve its objectives because of the lack of manpower that the Navy's guerrilla allies had promised to supply.\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Europe 1809.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The strategic situation in Europe in February 1809]]\n\nEconomic warfare continued: the French [[Continental System]] against the British naval blockade of French-controlled territory. Due to military shortages and lack of organisation in French territory, many breaches of the Continental System occurred as French-dominated states tolerated or even encouraged trade with British smugglers. In terms of economic damage to Great Britain, the blockade was largely ineffective. As Napoleon realised that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, he invaded those two countries. He tied down his forces in Spain, and lost very badly in Russia in 1812.<ref>J. M. Thompson, ''Napoleon Bonaparte: His rise and fall '' (1951) pp 235\u201340</ref>\n\nBoth sides entered further conflicts in attempts to enforce their blockade; the British fought the United States in the [[War of 1812]] (1812\u201315), and the French engaged in the [[Peninsular War]] (1808\u201314) to prevent smuggling into Spain. The Iberian conflict began when Portugal continued trade with Britain despite French restrictions. When Spain failed to maintain the Continental System, the uneasy Spanish alliance with France ended in all but name. French troops gradually encroached on Spanish territory until they occupied [[Madrid]], and installed a client monarchy. This provoked an explosion of [[Dos de Mayo Uprising|popular rebellions]] across Spain. Heavy British involvement soon followed.\n[[File:El dos de mayo de 1808 en Madrid.jpg|thumb|300px|[[The Second of May 1808|The Second of May 1808: The Charge of the Mamelukes]]'', by [[Francisco de Goya]] (1814)]]\n\nAustria, previously an ally of France, took the opportunity to attempt to restore its imperial territories in Germany as held prior to Austerlitz. Austria achieved some initial victories against the thinly spread army of Marshal [[Louis Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]]. Napoleon had left Berthier with only 170,000 men to defend France's entire eastern frontier (in the 1790s, 800,000 men had carried out the same task, but holding a much shorter front).\n\nAfter defeats in Spain suffered by France, Napoleon took charge and enjoyed success, retaking Madrid, defeating the Spanish and forcing a withdrawal of the heavily out-numbered British army from the Iberian Peninsula ([[Battle of Corunna]], 16 January 1809). But when he left, the [[guerrilla war]] against his forces in the countryside continued to tie down great numbers of troops. Austria's attack prevented Napoleon from successfully wrapping up operations against British forces by necessitating his departure for Austria, and he never returned to the Peninsular theatre. The British then sent in a fresh army under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington)]] whom the French could not stop.<ref>Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars (3): The Peninsular War 1807\u20131814'' (2014)</ref>\n\nThe Peninsular war proved a major disaster for France. Napoleon did well when he was in direct charge, but severe losses followed his departure, as he severely underestimated how much manpower would be needed. The effort in Spain was a drain on money, manpower and prestige. Historian David Gates called it the \"Spanish ulcer.\"<ref>David Gates, ''The Spanish Ulcer: A History of the Peninsular War'' (1986)</ref> France lost the Peninsular War, and Napoleon realised it had been a disaster for his cause, writing later, \"That unfortunate war destroyed me ...

The Polish army captured [[West Galicia]] following its earlier success. Napoleon assumed personal command and bolstered the army for a counter-attack on Austria. After a few small battles, the well-run campaign forced the Austrians to withdraw from Bavaria, and Napoleon advanced into Austria. His hurried attempt to cross the [[Danube]] resulted in the major [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] (22 May 1809) \u2014 Napoleon's first significant tactical defeat. But the Austrian commander, [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], failed to follow up on his indecisive victory, allowing Napoleon to prepare and seize Vienna in early July. He defeated the Austrians at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], on 5\u20136 July. (It was during the middle of that battle that [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Marshal Bernadotte]] was stripped of his command after retreating contrary to Napoleon's orders. Shortly thereafter, Bernadotte took up the offer from Sweden to fill the vacant position of Crown Prince there. Later he actively participated in wars against his former Emperor.)\n\nThe War of the Fifth Coalition ended with the [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] (14 October 1809). In the east, only the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]ese rebels led by [[Andreas Hofer]] continued to fight the French-Bavarian army until finally defeated in November 1809. In the west the Peninsular War continued. The British and Portuguese remained restricted to the area around Lisbon (behind their impregnable [[lines of Torres Vedras]]) but [[Siege of C\u00e1diz|besieged Cadiz]].\n\nIn 1810, the French Empire reached its greatest extent. Napoleon married [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie-Louise]], an Austrian Archduchess, with the aim of ensuring a more stable alliance with Austria and of providing the Emperor with an heir (something his first wife, Josephine, had failed to do). As well as the French Empire, Napoleon controlled the Swiss Confederation, the Confederation of the Rhine, the Duchy of Warsaw and the Kingdom of Italy. Territories allied with the French included:\n* the [[Denmark-Norway|Kingdom of Denmark]] \n* the [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Spain]] (under [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's elder brother)\n* the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] ([[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], Napoleon's younger brother)\n* the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples|Kingdom of Naples]] (under [[Joachim Murat]], husband of Napoleon's sister [[Caroline Bonaparte|Caroline]])\n* the [[Principality of Lucca and Piombino]] (under [[Elisa Bonaparte]] (Napoleon's sister) and her husband [[Felice Pasquale Baciocchi|Felice Baciocchi]]);\nand Napoleon's former enemies, Sweden, Prussia and Austria.\n\n==Subsidiary wars==\nThe Napoleonic Wars were the direct cause of wars in the Americas and elsewhere.\n\n===War of 1812===\n{{Main|War of 1812}}\nThe [[War of 1812]] coincided with the War of the Sixth Coalition. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, while Europeans often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. The United States declared war on Britain because of British interference with American merchant ships and [[Impressment#Conflict with the United States|forced enlistment]] into the British Royal Navy. France had interfered as well, and the US considered declaring war on France. The war ended in a military stalemate, and there were no boundary changes at the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which took effect in early 1815 when Napoleon was on Elba.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''The War of 1812 in the Age of Napoleon'' (2009)</ref>\n\n===Latin American Revolutions===\n{{main|Spanish American wars of independence|War of Independence of Brazil|Haitian Revolution}}\n[[File:America 1794.png|thumb|200px|Political map of the Americas in 1794]]\nThe abdication of kings [[Charles IV of Spain|Carlos IV]] and [[Ferdinand VII|Fernando VII]] of Spain and the installation of Napoleon's brother as [[Joseph Bonaparte|King Jos\u00e9]] provoked civil wars and revolutions leading to the independence of most of Spain's mainland American colonies. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII, whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] in the wake of these wars.<ref>[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]],  ''Caudillos in Spanish America 1800\u20131850''.

With the defeat of Napoleon and the return of the Braganza monarchy to Portugal, the heir remained in Brazil and declared Brazilian independence, achieving it peacefully with the territory intact.\n\nThe [[Haitian Revolution]] began in 1791, just before the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and continued until 1804.

Emperor Alexander I declared war on Britain after the British attack on Denmark in September 1807. British men-of-war supported the Swedish fleet during the [[Finnish War]] and won victories over the Russians in the [[Gulf of Finland]] in July 1808 and August 1809. The success of the Russian army on land, however, forced Sweden to sign peace treaties with Russia in 1809 and with France in 1810, and to join the blockade against Britain. But Franco-Russian relations became progressively worse after 1810, and the Russian war with Britain effectively ended. In April 1812, Britain, Russia and Sweden signed secret agreements directed against Napoleon.<ref>Alan Palmer, ''Alexander I: Tsar of War and Peace'' (1974)</ref>\n\nThe central issue for both Napoleon and Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] was control over Poland. Each wanted a semi-independent Poland he could control. As Esdaile notes, \"Implicit in the idea of a Russian Poland was, of course, a war against Napoleon.\"<ref>Charles Esdaile, ''Napoleon's Wars: An International History, 1803\u20131815'' (2007) p 438</ref> Schroeder says Poland was \"the root cause\" of Napoleon's war with Russia but Russia's refusal to support the Continental System was also a factor.<ref>Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics: 1763 \u2013 1848'' (1994) p 419</ref>\n\nIn 1812, at the height of his power, Napoleon invaded Russia with a pan-European [[La Grande Arm\u00e9e|''Grande Arm\u00e9e'']], consisting of 450,000 men (200,000 Frenchmen, and many soldiers of allies or subject areas). The French forces crossed the [[Niemen River]] on 24 June 1812. Russia proclaimed a [[Patriotic War of 1812|Patriotic War]], and Napoleon proclaimed a Second Polish war. The Poles supplied almost 100,000 men for the invasion force, but against their expectations, Napoleon avoided any concessions to Poland, having in mind further negotiations with Russia.<ref>{{citation |first=Richard =K. |last=Riehn |title=1812: Napoleon's Russian campaign |year=1990}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' marched through Russia, winning some relatively minor engagements and the major [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Battle of Smolensk]] on 16\u201318 August. In the same days, part of the French Army led by [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Nicolas Oudinot]] was stopped in the [[First Battle of Polotsk|Battle of Polotsk]] by the right wing of the Russian Army, under command of General [[Peter Wittgenstein]]. This prevented the French march on the Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]]; the fate of the invasion was decided in Moscow, where Napoleon led his forces in person.\n\n[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Napoleon]]'s withdrawal from Russia'', a painting by [[Adolph Northen]]]]\n\nRussia used [[scorched-earth]] tactics, and harried the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' with light [[Cossack]] cavalry. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' did not adjust its operational methods in response.<ref>Riehn 1990, pp. 138\u2013140.</ref> This led to most of the losses of the main column of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', which in one case amounted to 95,000 men, including deserters, in a week.<ref>Reihn 1990, p. 185.</ref>\n\nThe main Russian army retreated for almost three months. This constant retreat led to the unpopularity of [[Field Marshal]] [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly]] and a veteran, Prince [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], was made the new Commander-in-Chief by [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. Finally, the two armies engaged in the [[Battle of Borodino]] on 7 September,<ref>Philip Haythornthwaite, ''Borodino 1812; Napoleon's great gamble'' (2012).</ref> in the vicinity of Moscow. The battle was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars, involving more than 250,000 men and resulting in at least 70,000 casualties. It was indecisive; the French captured the main positions on the battlefield, but failed to destroy the Russian army. Logistical difficulties meant that French casualties could not be replaced, unlike Russian ones.\n\nNapoleon entered Moscow on 14 September, after the Russian Army had retreated yet again.<ref>Reihn, ''1812,''  pp. 253\u2013254</ref> By then, the Russians had largely evacuated the city and released criminals from the prisons to inconvenience the French; the governor, Count [[Fyodor Rostopchin]], ordered the city [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|to be burnt]].<ref>''With Napoleon in Russia, The Memoirs of General Coulaincourt,'' Chapter VI 'The Fire' pp. 109\u2013107 Pub.

In October, with no sign of clear victory in sight, Napoleon began the disastrous Great Retreat from Moscow.\n\n[[File:Minard's Map (vectorized).svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s graph of the decreasing size of the Grande Arm\u00e9e represented by the width of the line as it marches to Moscow (tan) and back (black)]]\n\nAt the [[Battle of Maloyaroslavets]] the French tried to reach [[Kaluga]], where they could find food and forage supplies. The replenished Russian Army blocked the road, and Napoleon was forced to retreat the same way he had come to Moscow, through the heavily ravaged areas along the [[Smolensk]] road. In the following weeks, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was dealt a catastrophic blow by the onset of the [[Russian Winter]], the lack of supplies and constant [[guerrilla warfare]] by Russian peasants and irregular troops.\n\nWhen the remnants of the Napoleon's army [[Battle of Berezina|crossed the Berezina River]] in November, only 27,000 fit soldiers survived, with 380,000 men dead or missing and 100,000 captured.<ref>''The Wordsworth Pocket Encyclopedia,'' page 17, Hertfordshire 1993</ref> Napoleon then left his men and returned to Paris to prepare the defence against the advancing Russians. The campaign effectively ended on 14 December 1812, when the last enemy troops left Russia. The Russians had lost around 210,000 men, but with their shorter supply lines, they soon replenished their armies.\n\n==War of the Sixth Coalition 1812\u20131814==\n{{Main|Sixth Coalition}}\n\nSeeing an opportunity in Napoleon's historic defeat, Prussia, Sweden, Austria, and several German states re-entered the war.<ref>Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon in Power'' (2013), pp 431\u201374</ref> Napoleon vowed that he would create a new army as large as the one he had sent into Russia, and quickly built up his forces in the east from 30,000 to 130,000 and eventually to 400,000. Napoleon inflicted 40,000 casualties on the Allies at [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1813)|L\u00fctzen]] (2 May 1813) and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]] (20\u201321 May 1813). Both battles involved forces of over 250,000, making them some of the largest conflicts of the wars so far. Metternich in November 1813 offered Napoleon the [[Frankfurt proposals]]. They would allow Napoleon to remain Emperor but France would be reduced to its \"natural frontiers\" and lose control of most of Italy and Germany and the Netherlands. Napoleon still expected to win the wars, and rejected the terms. By 1814, as the Allies were closing in on Paris, Napoleon did agree to the Frankfurt proposals, but it was too late and he rejected the new harsher terms proposed by the Allies.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite book|last=J.

As the French regrouped, the Anglo\u2013Portuguese entered Madrid and advanced towards Burgos, before retreating all the way to Portugal when renewed French concentrations threatened to trap them. As a consequence of the Salamanca campaign, the French were forced to end their long siege of Cadiz and to permanently evacuate the provinces of [[Andalusia]] and [[Asturias]].<ref>Peter Young and James Philip Lawford, ''Wellington's masterpiece: the battle and campaign of Salamanca'' (outledge, 2015).</ref>\n\nIn a strategic move, Wellesley planned to move his supply base from Lisbon to [[Santander, Spain|Santander]]. The Anglo\u2013Portuguese forces swept northwards in late May and seized Burgos. On 21 June, at [[Battle of Vitoria|Vitoria]], the combined Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish armies won against [[Joseph Bonaparte]], finally breaking French power in Spain. The French had to retreat out of the Iberian peninsula, over the [[Pyrenees]].<ref>Michael Glover, ''Wellington's Peninsular Victories: Busaco, Salamanca, Vitoria, Nivelle'' (1963).</ref>\n\nThe belligerents declared an armistice from 4 June 1813 (continuing until 13 August) during which time both sides attempted to recover from the loss of approximately a quarter of a million men in the preceding two months. During this time coalition negotiations finally brought Austria out in open opposition to France. Two principal Austrian armies took the field, adding 300,000 men to the coalition armies in Germany. The Allies now had around 800,000 front-line soldiers in the German theatre, with a strategic reserve of 350,000 formed to support the front-line operations.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n[[File:General Nansouty at the battle of Hanau.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Hanau]] (30\u201331 October 1813), took part between Austro-Bavarian and French forces.]]\nNapoleon succeeded in bringing the imperial forces in the region to around 650,000\u2014although only 250,000 came under his direct command, with another 120,000 under [[Nicolas Charles Oudinot]] and 30,000 under Davout. The remainder of imperial forces came mostly from the Confederation of the Rhine, especially Saxony and Bavaria. In addition, to the south, Murat's Kingdom of Naples and [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]]'s Kingdom of Italy had 100,000 armed men. In Spain, another 150,000 to 200,000 French troops steadily retreated before Anglo\u2013Portuguese forces numbering around 100,000. Thus around 900,000 Frenchmen in all theatres faced around 1,800,000 coalition soldiers (including the strategic reserve under formation in Germany). The gross figures may mislead slightly, as most of the German troops fighting on the side of the French fought at best unreliably and stood on the verge of defecting to the Allies. One can reasonably say that Napoleon could count on no more than 450,000 men in Germany\u2014which left him outnumbered about four to one.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nFollowing the end of the armistice, Napoleon seemed to have regained the initiative at [[Battle of Dresden|Dresden]] (August 1813), where he once again defeated a numerically superior coalition army and inflicted enormous casualties, while sustaining relatively few. The failures of his marshals and a slow resumption of the offensive on his part cost him any advantage that this victory might have secured. At the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in Saxony (16\u201319 October 1813), also called the \"Battle of the Nations\", 191,000 French fought more than 300,000 Allies, and the defeated French had to retreat into France. After the French withdrawal from Germany, Napoleon's remaining ally, [[Denmark-Norway]], became isolated and [[Treaty of Kiel|fell to the coalition]].<ref>Peter Hofschroer, ''Leipzig 1813: The Battle of the Nations'' (1993)</ref>\n\n[[File:Russparis.jpg|thumb|The Russian Army entering Paris in 1814]]\nNapoleon then fought a series of battles in France, including the [[Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube]], but the overwhelming numbers of the Allies steadily forced him back. The Allies [[Battle of Paris (1814)|entered Paris]] on 30 March 1814. During this time Napoleon fought his [[Six Days' Campaign]], in which he won multiple battles against the enemy forces advancing towards Paris. During this entire campaign he never managed to field more than 70,000 men against more than half a million coalition soldiers. At the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] (9 March 1814), the Allies agreed to preserve the coalition until Napoleon's total defeat.<ref name=\"Philip Dwyer 2013 pp 464-98\">Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon In Power'' (2013) pp 464\u201398</ref>\n\nNapoleon determined to fight on, even now, incapable of fathoming his fall from power. During the campaign he had issued a decree for 900,000 fresh conscripts, but only a fraction of these materialised, and Napoleon's schemes for victory eventually gave way to the reality of his hopeless situation. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Occasional military actions continued in Italy, Spain, and Holland in early 1814.<ref name=\"Philip Dwyer 2013 pp 464-98\"/>\n\nThe victors exiled Napoleon to the island of [[Elba]], and restored the French [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the person of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]].

The period known as the [[Hundred Days]] began after Napoleon escaped from Elba and landed at [[Cannes]] (1 March 1815). Travelling to Paris, picking up support as he went, he eventually overthrew the restored [[Louis XVIII]]. The Allies rapidly gathered their armies to meet him again. Napoleon raised 280,000 men, whom he distributed among several armies. To add to the 90,000-strong standing army, he recalled well over a quarter of a million veterans from past campaigns and issued a decree for the eventual draft of around 2.5&nbsp;million new men into the French army, which was never achieved. This faced an initial coalition force of about 700,000\u2014although coalition campaign plans provided for one million front-line soldiers, supported by around 200,000 garrison, logistics and other auxiliary personnel.\n\nNapoleon took about 124,000 men of the Army of the North on a pre-emptive strike against the Allies in Belgium.<ref>Peter Hofschroer, ''The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras'' (2006)</ref> He intended to attack the coalition armies before they combined, in hope of driving the British into the sea and the Prussians out of the war. His march to the frontier achieved the surprise he had planned, catching the Anglo-Dutch Army in a dispersed arrangement. The Prussians had been more wary, concentrating {{fraction|3|4}} of their army in and around Ligny. The Prussians forced the [[Arm\u00e9e du Nord]] to fight all the day of the 15th to reach Ligny in a delaying action by the Prussian 1st Corps. He forced Prussia to fight at [[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]] on 16 June 1815, and the defeated Prussians retreated in disorder. On the same day, the left wing of the Arm\u00e9e du Nord, under the command of Marshal [[Michel Ney]], succeeded in stopping any of Wellington's forces going to aid Bl\u00fccher's Prussians by fighting a blocking action at [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]]. Ney failed to clear the cross-roads and Wellington reinforced the position. But with the Prussian retreat, Wellington too had to retreat. He fell back to a previously reconnoitred position on an [[escarpment]] at Mont St Jean, a few miles south of the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]].\n\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nNapoleon took the reserve of the Army of the North, and reunited his forces with those of Ney to pursue Wellington's army, after he ordered Marshal [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Grouchy]] to take the right wing of the Army of the North and stop the Prussians re-grouping. In the first of a series of miscalculations, both Grouchy and Napoleon failed to realise that the Prussian forces were already reorganised and were assembling at the village of Wavre. The French army did nothing to stop a rather leisurely retreat that took place throughout the night and into the early morning by the Prussians. As the 4th, 1st, and 2nd Prussian Corps marched through the town towards Waterloo the 3rd Prussian Corps took up blocking positions across the river, and although Grouchy engaged and defeated the Prussian rearguard under the command of Lt-Gen [[Johann von Thielmann|von Thielmann]] in the [[Battle of Wavre]] (18\u201319 June) it was 12 hours too late. In the end, 17,000 Prussians had kept 33,000 badly needed French reinforcements off the field.\n\nNapoleon delayed the start of fighting at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on the morning of 18 June for several hours while he waited for the ground to dry after the previous night's rain. By late afternoon, the French army had not succeeded in driving Wellington's forces from the escarpment on which they stood. When the Prussians arrived and attacked the French right flank in ever-increasing numbers, Napoleon's strategy of keeping the coalition armies divided had failed and a combined coalition general advance drove his army from the field in confusion.\n\nGrouchy organised a successful and well-ordered retreat towards Paris, where Marshal Davout had 117,000 men ready to turn back the 116,000 men of Bl\u00fccher and Wellington. [[Dominique Vandamme|General Vandamme]] was defeated at the [[Battle of Issy]] and negotiations for surrender had begun.\n\n[[File:Charge of the French Cuirassiers at Waterloo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The charge of the French [[Cuirassier]]s at the Battle of Waterloo against a square of [[Scottish regiment|Scottish Highlanders]]]]\n\nOn arriving at Paris three days after Waterloo, Napoleon still clung to the hope of a concerted national resistance; but the temper of the [[Parliament of France|legislative chamber]]s, and of the public generally, did not favour his view. Lacking support Napoleon abdicated again on 22 June 1815, and on 15 July he surrendered to the British squadron at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. The Allies exiled him to the remote South Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]], where he died on 5 May 1821.\n\nIn Italy, [[Joachim Murat]], whom the Allies had allowed to remain King of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] after Napoleon's initial defeat, once again allied with his brother-in-law, triggering the [[Neapolitan War]] (March to May 1815). Hoping to find support among Italian nationalists fearing the increasing influence of the Habsburgs in Italy, Murat issued the [[Rimini Proclamation]] inciting them to war. The proclamation failed and the Austrians soon crushed Murat at the [[Battle of Tolentino]] (2 May to 3 May 1815), forcing him to flee. The [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] returned to the throne of Naples on 20 May 1815. Murat tried to regain his throne, but after that failed, he was executed by firing squad on 13 October 1815.\n\n==Political effects==\nThe Napoleonic Wars brought radical changes to Europe, but the reactionary forces returned to power and tried to reverse some of them<ref>Jacques Godechot, et al. ''The Napoleonic era in Europe'' (1971)</ref> by [[Bourbon Restoration|restoring the Bourbon house]] on the French throne. Napoleon had succeeded in bringing most of Western Europe under one rule. In most European countries, subjugation in the French Empire brought with it many liberal features of the French Revolution including democracy, [[due process]] in courts, abolition of serfdom, reduction of the power of the Catholic Church, and a demand for constitutional limits on monarchs. The increasing voice of the middle classes with rising commerce and industry meant that restored European monarchs found it difficult to restore pre-revolutionary [[absolute monarch|absolutism]] and had to retain many of the reforms enacted during Napoleon's rule. Institutional legacies remain to this day in the form of [[Civil Law (legal system)|civil law]], with clearly defined [[code of law|codes of law]]\u2014an enduring legacy of the [[Napoleonic Code]].\n \n[[File:Europe 1815 map en.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The national boundaries within Europe set by the Congress of Vienna, 1815]]\n\nFrance's constant warfare with the combined forces of the other major powers of Europe for over two decades finally took its toll. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, France no longer held the role of the dominant [[historical powers|power]] in Continental Europe, as it had since the times of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], as the [[Congress of Vienna]] produced a \"[[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]\" by resizing the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace. In this regard, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was restored in its former borders, and also received large chunks of [[Grand Duchy of Warsaw|Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]]. Greatly enlarged, Prussia became a permanent [[Great Power]]. In order to drag Prussia's attention towards the west and France, the Congress also gave the [[Prussian Rhineland|Rhineland]] and [[Prussian Westphalia|Westphalia]] to Prussia. These industrial regions transformed agrarian Prussia into an industrial leader in the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Britain emerged as the most important economic power, and its [[Royal Navy]] held unquestioned naval superiority across the globe well into the 20th century.<ref name=\"The Royal Navy\"/>\n\nAfter the Napoleonic period, nationalism, a relatively new movement, became increasingly significant. This shaped much of the course of future European history. Its growth spelled the beginning of some states and the end of others, as the map of Europe changed dramatically in the hundred years following the [[Napoleonic Era]]. Rule by fiefdoms and aristocracy was widely replaced by national ideologies based on shared origins and culture. Bonaparte's reign over Europe sowed the seeds for the founding of the nation-states of [[Unification of Germany|Germany]] and [[Italian unification|Italy]] by starting the process of consolidating city-states, kingdoms and principalities. At the end of the war Denmark was forced to cede Norway to Sweden mainly as a compensation for the loss of [[Finland]] which the other coalition members agreed to, but because Norway had signed its own constitution on 17 May 1814 [[Sweden]] initiated the Swedish\u2013Norwegian War of 1814. The war was a short one taking place between 26 July \u2013 14 August 1814 and was a Swedish victory that put [[Norway]] into a personal union with [[Sweden]] under [[Charles XIV John of Sweden]]. The union was peacefully dissolved in 1905.

In [[Portuguese America]], Brazil experienced greater autonomy as it now [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|served as seat of the Portuguese Empire]] and ascended politically to the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|status of Kingdom]].

After his defeat, Napoleon deplored the fact that his dream of a free and peaceful \"European association\" remained unaccomplished. Such a European association would share the same principles of government, system of measurement, currency and [[Civil Code]]. One-and-a-half centuries later, and after two world wars several of these ideals re-emerged in the form of the [[European Union]].\n\n==Military legacy==\n\n===Enlarged scope===\n[[File:Lejeune - Bataille de Marengo.jpg|thumb|In 1800 Bonaparte took the French Army across the Alps, eventually defeating the Austrians at [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]].]]\n\nUntil the time of Napoleon, European states employed relatively small armies, made up of both national soldiers and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. These regulars were highly drilled professional soldiers. [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] armies could only deploy small field armies due to rudimentary staffs and comprehensive yet cumbersome logistics. Both issues combined to limit field forces to approximately 30,000 men under a single commander.\n\nMilitary innovators in the mid-18th century began to recognise the potential of an entire nation at war: a \"nation in arms\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/napoleonic_wars/6361907.html|title=Napoleon's Total War|publisher=HistoryNet.com|accessdate=18 November 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401054136/http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/napoleonic_wars/6361907.html|archivedate=1 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe scale of warfare dramatically enlarged during the Revolutionary and subsequent Napoleonic Wars. During Europe's major pre-revolutionary war, the [[Seven Years' War]] of 1756\u20131763, few armies ever numbered more than 200,000 with field forces often numbering less than 30,000. The French innovations of separate corps (allowing a single commander to efficiently command more than the traditional command span of 30,000 men) and living off the land (which allowed field armies to deploy more men without requiring an equal increase in supply arrangements such as depots and supply trains) allowed the French republic to field much larger armies than their opponents. Napoleon ensured during the time of the French republic that separate French field armies operated as a single army under his control, often allowing him to substantially outnumber his opponents. This forced his continental opponents to increase the size of their armies as well, moving away from the traditional small, well drilled Ancien R\u00e9gime armies of the 18th century to mass conscript armies.\n\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Napoleon on the field of [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]]]]\n\nThe Battle of Marengo, which largely ended the War of the Second Coalition, was fought with fewer than 60,000 men on both sides. The Battle of Austerlitz which ended the War of the Third Coalition involved fewer than 160,000 men. The Battle of Friedland which led to peace with Russia in 1807 involved about 150,000 men.\n\nAfter these defeats, the continental powers developed various forms of mass conscription to allow them to face France on even terms, and the size of field armies increased rapidly. The battle of Wagram of 1809 involved 300,000 men, and 500,000 fought at Leipzig in 1813, of whom 150,000 were killed or wounded.\n\nAbout a million French soldiers became casualties (wounded, invalided or killed), a higher proportion than in the First World War. The European total may have reached 5,000,000 military deaths, including disease.<ref>David A.Bell, ''The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the Birth of Warfare as We Know It'' (2007) p 7</ref><ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1987) pp&nbsp;99\u2013100</ref>\n\nFrance had the second-largest population in Europe by the end of the 18th century (27&nbsp;million, as compared to Britain's 12 million and Russia's 35 to 40&nbsp;million).<ref>Colin McEvedy and Richard M.

Before Napoleon's efforts, [[Lazare Carnot]] played a large part in the reorganisation of the French army from 1793 to 1794\u2014a time which saw previous French misfortunes reversed, with Republican armies advancing on all fronts.\n\n[[File:National Museum in Poznan - Przej\u015bcie przez Berezyn\u0119.JPG|thumb|Napoleon's retreat from Russia in 1812. His ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' had lost about half a million men.]]\nThe French army peaked in size in the 1790s with 1.5&nbsp;million Frenchmen enlisted although battlefield strength was much less. Haphazard bookkeeping, rudimentary medical support and lax recruitment standards ensured that many soldiers either never existed, fell ill or were unable to withstand the physical demands of soldiering.\n\nAbout 2.8&nbsp;million Frenchmen fought on land and about 150,000 at sea, bringing the total for France to almost 3 million combatants during almost 25 years of warfare.<ref name=\"John France 2011 351\"/>\n\n[[File:Trafalgar Crepin mg 0578.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Trafalgar]]]]\nBritain had 750,000 men under arms between 1792 and 1815 as its army expanded from 40,000 men in 1793<ref name=\"Chappell8\">Chappell, p. 8</ref> to a peak of 250,000 men in 1813.<ref name=\"Oxford132\"/> Over 250,000 sailors served in the [[Royal Navy]]. In September 1812, Russia had 900,000 enlisted men in its land forces, and between 1799 and 1815 2.1&nbsp;million men served in its army. Another 200,000 served in the Russian Navy. Out of the 900,000 men, the field armies deployed against France numbered less than 250,000.\n\nThere are no consistent statistics for other major combatants. Austria's forces peaked at about 576,000 (during the War of the Sixth Coalition) and had little or no naval component yet never fielded more than 250,000 men in field armies. After Britain, Austria proved the most persistent enemy of France; more than a million Austrians served during the long wars. Its large army was overall quite homogeneous and solid and in 1813 operated in Germany (140,000 men), Italy and the Balkans (90,000 men at its peak, about 50,000 men during most of the campaigning on these fronts). Austria's manpower was becoming quite limited towards the end of the wars, leading its generals to favour cautious and conservative strategies, to limit their losses.\n\n[[File:Baschkiren gegen Franzosen.jpg|thumb|French soldiers in skirmish with [[Bashkirs]] and [[Cossacks]] in 1813]]\nPrussia never had more than 320,000 men under arms at any time. In 1813\u20131815, the core of its army (about 100,000 men) was characterised by competence and determination, but the bulk of its forces consisted of second- and third-line troops, as well as militiamen of variable strength. Many of these troops performed reasonably well and often displayed considerable bravery but lacked the professionalism of their regular counterparts and were not as well equipped. Others were largely unfit for operations, except sieges. During the 1813 campaign, 130,000 men were used in the military operations, with 100,000 effectively participating in the main German campaign, and about 30,000 being used to besiege isolated French garrisons.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSpain's armies also peaked at around 200,000 men, not including more than 50,000 guerrillas scattered over Spain. In addition the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha Confederation]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] each had more than 100,000 men under arms. Even small nations now had armies rivalling the size of the [[Great Powers]]' forces of past wars but most of these were poor quality forces only suitable for garrison duties. The size of their combat forces remained modest yet they could still provide a welcome addition to the major powers. The percentage of French troops in the Grande Armee which Napoleon led into Russia was about 50% while the French allies also provided a significant contribution to the French forces in Spain. As these small nations joined the coalition forces in 1813\u20131814, they provided a useful addition to the coalition while depriving Napoleon of much needed manpower.\n\n===Innovations===\nThe initial stages of the [[Industrial Revolution]] had much to do with larger military forces\u2014it became easy to mass-produce weapons and thus to equip larger forces. Britain was the largest single manufacturer of armaments in this period. It supplied most of the weapons used by the coalition powers throughout the conflicts. France produced the second-largest total of armaments, equipping its own huge forces as well as those of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and other allies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Christopher David Hall|title=British Strategy in the Napoleonic War, 1803\u201315|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ue8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA28|year=1992|publisher=Manchester U.P.|page=28|isbn=9780719036064}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon showed innovative tendencies in his use of mobility to offset numerical disadvantages, as demonstrated in the rout of the Austro-Russian forces in 1805 in the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. The French Army redefined the role of artillery, forming independent, mobile units, as opposed to the previous tradition of attaching artillery pieces in support of troops.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe [[Semaphore line|semaphore system]] had allowed the French War-Minister, Carnot, to communicate with French forces on the frontiers throughout the 1790s.

Most historians argue that the escalation in size and scope came from two sources. First was the ideological clash between revolutionary/egalitarian and conservative/hierarchical belief systems. Second was the emergence of [[nationalism]] in France, Germany, Spain, and elsewhere that made these \"people's wars\" instead of contests between monarchs.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald Stoker|title=Conscription in the Napoleonic Era: A Revolution in Military Affairs?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iks6rVhTHrwC&pg=PA38|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|pages=24, 31\u201332, 38|display-authors=etal|isbn=9780203674048}}</ref> Bell has argued that even more important than ideology and nationalism were the intellectual transformations in the culture of war that came about through [[the Enlightenment]].<ref>Bell, ''The First Total War'' (2008) pp&nbsp;7\u201313</ref> One factor, he says, is that war was no longer a routine event but a transforming experience for societies\u2014a total experience. Secondly the military emerged in its own right as a separate sphere of society distinct from the ordinary civilian world. The French Revolution made every civilian a part of the war machine, either as a soldier through universal conscription, or as a vital cog in the home front machinery supporting and supplying the army. Out of that, says Bell, came \"militarism,\" the belief that the military role was morally superior to the civilian role in times of great national crisis. The fighting army represented the essence of the nation's soul.<ref>Many historians say it was not the \"first\" total war; for a critique of Bell see {{cite book|author=Frederick C.

The use and misuse of military intelligence dictated the course of many major battles during the Napoleonic Wars. Some of the major battles that were dictated by the use of intelligence include: The Battle of Waterloo, Battle of Leipzig, Battle of Salamanca, and the Battle of Vitoria. A major exception to the greater use of superior military intelligence to claim victory was the Battle of Jena in 1806. At the Battle of Jena even Prussian superior military intelligence was not enough to counter the sheer military force of Napoleons' armies. \n\nThe use of intelligence varied greatly across the major world powers of the war. Napoleon at this time had more supply of intelligence given to him than any French general before him. However, Napoleon was not advocate of military intelligence at this time as he often found it unreliable and inaccurate when compared to his own preconceived notions of the enemy. Napoleon rather studied his enemy via domestic newspapers, diplomatic publications, maps, and prior documents of military engagements in the theaters of war in which he would operate. It was this stout and constant study of the enemy which made Napoleon the military mastermind of his time. Whereas, his opponents--Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia\u2014who were much more reliant on traditional intelligence gathering methods and were much more quickly and willing to act on them. \n\nThe methods of Intelligence during these wars were to include the formation of vast and complex networks of corresponding agents, codebreaking, and cryptanalysis. The greatest cipher to be used to hide military operations during this time was known as the Great Paris Cipher used by the French. However, thanks to hard work of British codebreakers like George Scovell, the British were able to crack French ciphers and gain vast amounts of military intelligence on Napoleon and his armies.<ref name=\"The Secret World\" group=\"Intel\">{{cite book |last1=Andrew |first1=Christopher |title=The Secret World |date=2018 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=Yale |isbn=978-0-300-23844-0 }}</ref>\n\n==In fiction==\n{{main|Napoleonic Wars in fiction}}\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] were a defining event of the early 19th century, and inspired many works of fiction, from then until the present day.\n\n*[[Leo Tolstoy]]'s epic novel ''[[War and Peace]]'' recounts Napoleon's wars between 1805 and 1812 (especially the disastrous 1812 invasion of Russia and subsequent retreat) from a Russian perspective.\n*[[Stendhal]]'s novel ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'' opens with a ground-level recounting of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and the subsequent chaotic retreat of French forces.\n*''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]] takes place against the backdrop of the Napoleonic War and subsequent decades, and in its unabridged form contains an epic telling of the [[Battle of Waterloo]].\n*''[[Adieu (novella)|Adieu]]'' is a novella by [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] in which can be found a short description of the French retreat from Russia, particularly the [[battle of Berezina]], where the fictional couple of the story are tragically separated.

In medieval times there were important woad-growing regions in England, Germany and France. Towns such as [[Toulouse]] became prosperous from the woad trade. Woad was eventually replaced by the more colourfast ''[[Indigofera tinctoria]]'' and, in the early 20th century, both woad and ''Indigofera tinctoria'' were replaced by synthetic blue dyes. Woad has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. There has also been some revival of the use of woad for craft purposes.\n\n==History of woad cultivation==\n===Ancient use===\n\nThe first archaeological finds of woad seeds date to the [[Neolithic]]. The seeds have been found in the cave of l'Audoste, [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], France. Impressions of seeds of ''F\u00e4rberwaid'' (Isatis tinctoria L.) or German indigo, of the plant family ''Brassicaceae'', have been found on pottery in the [[Iron Age]] settlement of [[Heuneburg]], Germany.

In fact among the plain people, chiefly farmers, farm workers and small crafters, a lot had stayed in France, complying in a minimal way with the king's demands.

A lot of pastors had already either converted or emigrated and the king was under the false impression that there remained almost no Protestants in France. In fact among the plain people, chiefly farmers, farm workers and small crafters, a lot had stayed in France, complying in a minimal way with the king's demands.

Suburban Line)'' or '''Wiener Vorortelinie''' ''(lit. Vienna Suburban Line)'' is an electrified commuter rail service operating in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. \n\nIt is the only S-Bahn route to operate entirely within Viennese city limits and is also the most frequently operated single S-Bahn service with intervals of 10 minutes during weekdays, and 15 minutes during weekends and holidays. \n\nThe S45 opened on 31 May 1987 and uses the route of the original [[Vienna Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] and still bears the architecture of the Stadtbahn. Drivers based in Wien Franz-Jozefs Bahnhof and Wien Westbahnhof drive the route. Unlike the Pink line or the \u201cStammstrecke\u201d (lit. stem route) it is the only line servicing the route it drives on. \n\nIt terminates at Handelskai (on the Stammstrecke) and also crosses the U6 there, the U3 at Ottakring and joins both ends of the U4 at Heiligenstadt and H\u00fctteldorf.\nDue to the short platform lengths, only single 4024s (Talent EMUs) and 4020s can operate on the route. \n\nThe 474X train sets were also tested on the route, but it was found that their extendable door step took too long for them to be able to maintain good time on the route.  \n\nThe maximum speed of the route is 100 km/h, between H\u00fctteldorf and Penzing, however this speed is not always reached due to the way the route is signalled, i.e. due to the limitations of PZB90, which however don't apply to all 4020 EMUs as most of them use the outdated Indusi60.\n\n==History==\n{{details|Vienna Stadtbahn}}\n\nThe original route was opened on 11 May 1898 by the Vienna Stadtbahn. Steam powered trains operated between [[Wien H\u00fctteldorf railway station|Wien H\u00fctteldorf]] and [[Wien Heiligenstadt railway station|Wien Heiligenstadt]] on a single track line. On 11 July 1932, passenger service was ended and only freight trains used the line. \n\nIn 1975 freight service was discontinued and the line was abandoned. In 1979 the City of Vienna, along with [[Austrian Federal Railways|\u00d6BB]] brought up plans to reactivate the line. In the following years the line was renovated, expanded to two tracks and electrified with [[15 kV AC railway electrification|15 kV 16,7 Hz]]. \n\nIn 1984 a final plan of the new route was concluded. Service began on 31 May 1987, nearly 55 years after passenger service was discontinued, between H\u00fctteldorf and Heiligenstadt. \n\nPassenger traffic greatly increased when service was extended past Heiligenstadt to Handelskai in 1996, offering a connection to the Vienna Trunk Line and increased even more when the [[U3 (Vienna U-Bahn)|U3]] U-Bahn line was extended to [[Ottakring]]. In 2007 rush hour frequency was increased from 15 minutes to 10 minutes and in December 2012 frequency was increased to 10 minutes on weekdays.<ref>[http://www.arbeiter-zeitung.at/cgi-bin/archiv/flash.pl?year=1984&month=3&day=23&page=08&html=1 ''Vorortelinie wird ab 1987 bis H\u00fctteldorf fahren''], [[Arbeiterzeitung]], 23 March 1984 - 27 March 2010</ref>\n\n==Station Listing==\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=200| Station !!width=200| Connections !!width=200| Notes\n|-\n| '''[[Wien H\u00fctteldorf railway station|Wien H\u00fctteldorf]]''' || '''S-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|S50}} {{Public transport Vienna|S80}}<br>'''\u00d6BB:''' R, REX, CJX<br>'''Westbahn'''<br>'''U-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|U4}}<br>'''Bus:''' 43B, 47B, 49A, 50A, 50B, 52A, 52B, 53A, N49<br>'''Wieselbus'''<br>'''Regional buses'''|| Opened in 1858 as part of the [[Western Railway (Austria)|Western Railway]], Stadtbahn section opened in 1898.\n|-\n| '''[[Wien Penzing railway station|Wien Penzing]]''' || '''S-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|S50}}<br>'''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|52}} || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Breitensee railway station|Wien Breitensee]]''' || '''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|49}}<br>'''Bus:''' N49 || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Ottakring railway station|Wien Ottakring]]''' || '''U-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|U3}}<br>'''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|2}} {{Public transport Vienna|46}}<br>'''Bus:''' 45A, 46A, 46B, 48A, N46 || U-Bahn connection opened in 1998. \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Hernals railway station|Wien Hernals]]''' || '''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|43}}<br>'''Bus:''' 42A, 44A, N43 || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Gersthof railway station|Wien Gersthof]]''' || '''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|9}} {{Public transport Vienna|40}} {{Public transport Vienna|41}}<br>'''Bus:''' 10A, N41 || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Krottenbachstra\u00dfe railway station|Wien Krottenbachstra\u00dfe]]''' || '''Bus:''' 35A, N35 || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Oberd\u00f6bling railway station|Wien Oberd\u00f6bling]]''' || '''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|38}}<br>'''Bus:''' 39A || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Heiligenstadt railway station|Wien Heiligenstadt]] || '''S-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|S40}}<br>'''\u00d6BB:''' R<br>'''U-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|U4}}<br>'''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|D}}<br>'''Bus:''' 5B, 10A, 11A, 38A, 39A || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Handelskai railway station|Wien Handelskai]]''' || '''S-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|S1}} {{Public transport Vienna|S2}} {{Public transport Vienna|S3}} {{Public transport Vienna|S4}} {{Public transport Vienna|S7}}<br>'''\u00d6BB:''' R, REX<br>'''U-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|U6}}<br>'''Bus:''' 5A, 11A, 11B, N64 || Service extended in 1996.\n|}</center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Austrian Federal Railways]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Vienna]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1987]]\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox rail line\n| box_width     = \n| name          = {{Public transport Vienna|S45}} \n| other_name    = ''Vorortelinie''<br>''Wiener Vorortelinie''\n| color         = \n| logo          = \n| image         = T\u00fcrkenschanzpark S45.JPG\n| image_width   = 300px\n| caption       = A Handelskai-bound train at T\u00fcrkenschanzpark, in 2013\n| type          = [[Commuter rail]]\n| system        = [[Vienna S-Bahn]]\n| status        = Operating\n| locale        = [[Vienna]]\n| start         = [[Wien H\u00fctteldorf railway station|Wien H\u00fctteldorf]]\n| end           = [[Wien Handelskai railway station|Wien Handelskai]]\n| stations      = 10\n| routes        = \n| daily_ridership     = \n| open          = {{Start date|1987|05|31|df=y}}\n| close         = \n| owner         = [[Austrian Federal Railways|\u00d6BB]]\n| operator      = \n| character     = \n| depot         = {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}}\n| linelength    =   \n| tracks       = 2\n| gauge         = {{track gauge|sg|al=on}}\n| routenumber   = \n| linenumber    = \n| electrification            = \n| speed         = Vmax=100\n| elevation     = \n| website       = \n| map           = {{Infobox rdt|S45 Wien}}\n| map_state     = collapsed\n}}\nLine '''S45''' of the [[Vienna S-Bahn]], also known as the '''Vorortelinie''' ''(lit.

In 2007 rush hour frequency was increased from 15 minutes to 10 minutes and in December 2012 frequency was increased to 10 minutes on weekdays.<ref>[http://www.arbeiter-zeitung.at/cgi-bin/archiv/flash.pl?year=1984&month=3&day=23&page=08&html=1 ''Vorortelinie wird ab 1987 bis H\u00fctteldorf fahren''], [[Arbeiterzeitung]], 23 March 1984 - 27 March 2010</ref>\n\n==Station Listing==\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=200| Station !!width=200| Connections !!width=200| Notes\n|-\n| '''[[Wien H\u00fctteldorf railway station|Wien H\u00fctteldorf]]''' || '''S-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|S50}} {{Public transport Vienna|S80}}<br>'''\u00d6BB:''' R, REX, CJX<br>'''Westbahn'''<br>'''U-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|U4}}<br>'''Bus:''' 43B, 47B, 49A, 50A, 50B, 52A, 52B, 53A, N49<br>'''Wieselbus'''<br>'''Regional buses'''|| Opened in 1858 as part of the [[Western Railway (Austria)|Western Railway]], Stadtbahn section opened in 1898.\n|-\n| '''[[Wien Penzing railway station|Wien Penzing]]''' || '''S-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|S50}}<br>'''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|52}} || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Breitensee railway station|Wien Breitensee]]''' || '''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|49}}<br>'''Bus:''' N49 || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Ottakring railway station|Wien Ottakring]]''' || '''U-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|U3}}<br>'''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|2}} {{Public transport Vienna|46}}<br>'''Bus:''' 45A, 46A, 46B, 48A, N46 || U-Bahn connection opened in 1998. \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Hernals railway station|Wien Hernals]]''' || '''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|43}}<br>'''Bus:''' 42A, 44A, N43 || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Gersthof railway station|Wien Gersthof]]''' || '''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|9}} {{Public transport Vienna|40}} {{Public transport Vienna|41}}<br>'''Bus:''' 10A, N41 || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Krottenbachstra\u00dfe railway station|Wien Krottenbachstra\u00dfe]]''' || '''Bus:''' 35A, N35 || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Oberd\u00f6bling railway station|Wien Oberd\u00f6bling]]''' || '''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|38}}<br>'''Bus:''' 39A || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Heiligenstadt railway station|Wien Heiligenstadt]] || '''S-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|S40}}<br>'''\u00d6BB:''' R<br>'''U-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|U4}}<br>'''Tram:''' {{Public transport Vienna|D}}<br>'''Bus:''' 5B, 10A, 11A, 38A, 39A || \n|-\n| '''[[Wien Handelskai railway station|Wien Handelskai]]''' || '''S-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|S1}} {{Public transport Vienna|S2}} {{Public transport Vienna|S3}} {{Public transport Vienna|S4}} {{Public transport Vienna|S7}}<br>'''\u00d6BB:''' R, REX<br>'''U-Bahn:''' {{Public transport Vienna|U6}}<br>'''Bus:''' 5A, 11A, 11B, N64 || Service extended in 1996.\n|}</center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Austrian Federal Railways]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Vienna]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1987]]\n", "name_user": "Infogapp1", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spacing for easier readability", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S45_(Vienna)"}

The battle was fought around Ko\u0161are on the border between [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FR Yugoslavia]] and [[Albania]] from 9 April until 10 June during the [[NATO bombing of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe KLA sought to enter [[Kosovo]] from Albania and cut off of the communication routes of the [[Yugoslav Army]], and also take over of the region of [[Metohija]]. After days of heavy fighting, the Yugoslav Army kept the KLA from advancing into Kosovo. KLA insurgents managed to take the Ko\u0161are outpost following a massive artillery barrage by the Albanian Army and NATO airstrikes of Yugoslav strategic sites, but were unable to break the Yugoslav Army's second line of defense.\n\n==Background==\nThe KLA was supported by the Albanian Army and NATO. The Albanian Army supported with artillery and tanks, NATO with air support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/military060299.htm|title=Washingtonpost.com:  NATO Gives Air Support to KLA Forces|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n===9\u201313 April===\n\nOn 9 April 1999, at 03:00, an artillery barrage began from the Albanian side of the border, aimed in the direction of the Ko\u0161are military outpost, which was occupied by the Yugoslav Army.

Then, with massive artillery support, the KLA took Maja Glava and continued to bombard the Ko\u0161are Outpost, which resulted in the Yugoslav soldiers having to abandon their posts. At 19:00, members of the KLA entered the abandoned outpost and [[CNN]] and the British [[BBC News|BBC]] broadcast images of a great number of KLA militants taking the outpost.\n\nMembers of the Yugoslav Forces then retreated towards the second line of defense above the outpost. Those positions were much more easier to defend. The next day, Yugoslav reserve troops arrived to relieve the First Army. One batch of KLA soldiers managed to cut the Yugoslav line of communications, and managed to disable one [[BOV (APC)|BOV]] armoured personnel carrier. During the night, the KLA attacked the Yugoslav Army at Opijaz, trying to shatter the resistance of the Yugoslav soldiers, but all of the attacks were unsuccessful and resulted in the Yugoslav Army inflicting heavy losses on the KLA insurgents. The next day, the KLA tried to break the resistance of the second defensive line of the Yugoslav Army, with little success. Meanwhile, the Yugoslavs managed to bring in their Special Forces and also a few artillery pieces.\n\nOn 13 April, the Yugoslav and Albanian armies [[April 1999 Albania\u2013Yugoslav border incident|clashed at the border]] near [[Krum\u00eb]].\n\n===Reorganization of Yugoslav positions and counterattack===\n\nAlbanian Army and KLA artillery continued to shell the Yugoslav Army's positions from Maja Glava and Rrasa e Koshares. The Yugoslav Army Headquarters decided to launch a sudden attack and surprise the enemy. On April 14, Yugoslav troops attacked Maja Glava. The distance between the two enemy trenches wasn't longer than 50 meters. The Yugoslav Army was unable to take Maja Glava completely, but it prevented the Albanians' artillery from engaging them from their positions. The Maja Glava front was stabilized until the end of the war, without any changes on the lines.\n\nIn April, there weren't any changes on the front lines at Rrasa e Koshares and both sides suffered heavy losses. Many Yugoslav soldiers were killed by the non-stop artillery bombardment, while many KLA soldiers were killed in numerous unsuccessful attempts to break the Yugoslav lines of defense.{{Weasel inline|date=May 2018}}\n\n===May at Ko\u0161are===\nMay began with several unsuccessful attacks by the Yugoslav Army to take back the Ko\u0161are outpost. The attacks were made unsuccessful because of the constant artillery fire aimed at their positions. On the 6th of May, the Yugoslav Army counterattacked at Rrasa e Koshares, in an effort to halt the artillery bombardment. A bloody skirmish ensued, but the Yugoslav Army did not manage to take Rrasa e Koshares. On 10 May, the Yugoslav Army sent two [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] tanks to help stabilize the offensive on Rrasa e Koshares. When the tanks penetrated the KLA's lines, they advanced over 100 meters into insurgent-held territory, but the KLA still managed to retain control of Rrasa e Koshares. During the night of 10/11 May, [[NATO]] bombers dropped dozens of bombs on the Yugoslav troops who had attacked KLA positions around Rrasa e Koshares. At least in two of these instances NATO dropped cluster bombs on Yugoslav army troops. In these attacks, NATO killed eight Yugoslav soldiers and one officer and managed to wound over 40. The KLA seized the opportunity to attack and fought the Yugoslav soldiers out of their positions and forced them back.\n\nDuring the middle of May, many bloody skirmishes were fought at Mrcaj, which was eventually taken by the Yugoslav Army. After the Yugoslavs had inflicted some casualties on the insurgents, the KLA had to retreat from their positions giving the Yugoslavs the chance to take the now undefended position. This development allowed the Yugoslav Army to stabilize their position on the battlefield and to hold the attackers outside of their line of defense. On 22 May, NATO aircraft mistakenly bombed KLA positions, killing 67.<ref name=Chronology>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/etc/cron.html|title=A Kosovo Chronology - War In Europe - FRONTLINE - PBS|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThroughout May, NATO conducted air operations against Serbian targets in Kosovo and Serbia, some which included collateral damage\u2013death of civilians.{{sfn|Nardulli et al.|2002}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:A street graffiti honoring the fallen soldiers of the Battle of Ko\u0161are.jpg|thumb|right|A [[mural]] honoring the fallen soldiers of the Battle of Ko\u0161are in [[Ni\u0161]]]]\n[[File:Kla members.jpg|thumb|KLA members waiting to turn in their weapons to U.S. Marines, 30 June 1999.]]\nThe Kosovo War lasted until 10 June.

The battle was fought around Ko\u0161are on the border between [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FR Yugoslavia]] and [[Albania]] from 9 April until 10 June during the [[NATO bombing of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe KLA sought to enter [[Kosovo]] from Albania and cut off of the communication routes of the [[Yugoslav Army]], and also take over of the region of [[Metohija]]. After days of heavy fighting, the Yugoslav Army kept the KLA from advancing into Kosovo. KLA insurgents managed to take the Ko\u0161are outpost following a massive artillery barrage by the Albanian Army and NATO airstrikes of Yugoslav strategic sites, but were unable to break the Yugoslav Army's second line of defense.\n\n==Background==\nThe KLA was supported by the Albanian Army and NATO.

Then, with massive artillery support, the KLA took Maja Glava and continued to bombard the Ko\u0161are Outpost, which resulted in the Yugoslav soldiers having to abandon their posts. At 19:00, members of the KLA entered the abandoned outpost and [[CNN]] and the British [[BBC News|BBC]] broadcast images of a great number of KLA militants taking the outpost.\n\nMembers of the Yugoslav Forces then retreated towards the second line of defense above the outpost. Those positions were much more easier to defend. The next day, Yugoslav reserve troops arrived to relieve the First Army. One batch of KLA soldiers managed to cut the Yugoslav line of communications, and managed to disable one [[BOV (APC)|BOV]] armoured personnel carrier. During the night, the KLA attacked the Yugoslav Army at Opijaz, trying to shatter the resistance of the Yugoslav soldiers, but all of the attacks were unsuccessful and resulted in the Yugoslav Army inflicting heavy losses on the KLA insurgents. The next day, the KLA tried to break the resistance of the second defensive line of the Yugoslav Army, with little success. Meanwhile, the Yugoslavs managed to bring in their Special Forces and also a few artillery pieces.\n\nOn 13 April, the Yugoslav and Albanian armies [[April 1999 Albania\u2013Yugoslav border incident|clashed at the border]] near [[Krum\u00eb]].\n\n===Reorganization of Yugoslav positions and counterattack===\n\nAlbanian Army and KLA artillery continued to shell the Yugoslav Army's positions from Maja Glava and Rrasa e Koshares. The Yugoslav Army Headquarters decided to launch a sudden attack and surprise the enemy. On April 14, Yugoslav troops attacked Maja Glava. The distance between the two enemy trenches wasn't longer than 50 meters. The Yugoslav Army was unable to take Maja Glava completely, but it prevented the Albanians' artillery from engaging them from their positions. The Maja Glava front was stabilized until the end of the war, without any changes on the lines.\n\nIn April, there weren't any changes on the front lines at Rrasa e Koshares and both sides suffered heavy losses. Many Yugoslav soldiers were killed by the non-stop artillery bombardment, while many KLA soldiers were killed in numerous unsuccessful attempts to break the Yugoslav lines of defense.{{Weasel inline|date=May 2018}}\n\n===May at Ko\u0161are===\nMay began with several unsuccessful attacks by the Yugoslav Army to take back the Ko\u0161are outpost. The attacks were made unsuccessful because of the constant artillery fire aimed at their positions. On the 6th of May, the Yugoslav Army counterattacked at Rrasa e Koshares, in an effort to halt the artillery bombardment. A bloody skirmish ensued, but the Yugoslav Army did not manage to take Rrasa e Koshares. On 10 May, the Yugoslav Army sent two [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] tanks to help stabilize the offensive on Rrasa e Koshares. When the tanks penetrated the KLA's lines, they advanced over 100 meters into insurgent-held territory, but the KLA still managed to retain control of Rrasa e Koshares. During the night of 10/11 May, [[NATO]] bombers dropped dozens of bombs on the Yugoslav troops who had attacked KLA positions around Rrasa e Koshares. At least in two of these instances NATO dropped cluster bombs on Yugoslav army troops. In these attacks, NATO killed eight Yugoslav soldiers and one officer and managed to wound over 40. The KLA seized the opportunity to attack and fought the Yugoslav soldiers out of their positions and forced them back.\n\nDuring the middle of May, many bloody skirmishes were fought at Mrcaj, which was eventually taken by the Yugoslav Army. After the Yugoslavs had inflicted some casualties on the insurgents, the KLA had to retreat from their positions giving the Yugoslavs the chance to take the now undefended position. This development allowed the Yugoslav Army to stabilize their position on the battlefield and to hold the attackers outside of their line of defense. On 22 May, NATO aircraft mistakenly bombed KLA positions, killing 67.<ref name=Chronology>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/etc/cron.html|title=A Kosovo Chronology - War In Europe - FRONTLINE - PBS|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThroughout May, NATO conducted air operations against Serbian targets in Kosovo and Serbia, some which included collateral damage\u2013death of civilians.{{sfn|Nardulli et al.|2002}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:A street graffiti honoring the fallen soldiers of the Battle of Ko\u0161are.jpg|thumb|right|A [[mural]] honoring the fallen soldiers of the Battle of Ko\u0161are in [[Ni\u0161]]]]\n[[File:Kla members.jpg|thumb|KLA members waiting to turn in their weapons to U.S. Marines, 30 June 1999.]]\nThe Kosovo War lasted until 10 June.

Although there is no official record of the Tsar's inspiration for it, many believe that he was moved by an egg owned by the Empress's aunt, [[Princess Vilhelmine Marie of Denmark]], which had captivated Maria's imagination in her childhood and of which the Tsar was well aware. Known as the [[First Hen Egg|Hen Egg]], the very first Faberg\u00e9 egg is crafted from a foundation of gold. Its opaque white enameled \"shell\" opens to reveal a matte yellow-gold yolk. This, in turn, opens to reveal a multicolored gold hen that also opens. The hen contained a minute diamond replica of the imperial crown from which a small ruby pendant was suspended, but these last two elements have been lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wintraecken.nl/mieks/faberge/eggs/1885-Hen-Egg.htm |title=Article on the first Hen egg |publisher=wintraecken.nl |date=13 November 2008 |access-date=26 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624214253/http://www.wintraecken.nl/mieks/faberge/eggs/1885-Hen-Egg.htm |archive-date=24 June 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMaria was so delighted by the gift that Alexander appointed Faberg\u00e9 a \"goldsmith by special appointment to the Imperial Crown\" and commissioned another egg the next year. After that, [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]] was apparently given complete freedom for the design of future imperial Easter eggs, and their designs became more elaborate. According to Faberg\u00e9 family lore, not even the Tsar knew what form they would take\u2014the only requirements were that each contain a surprise, and that each be unique. Once Faberg\u00e9 had approved an initial design, the work was carried out by a team of craftsmen, among them [[Michael Perkhin]], [[Henrik Wigstr\u00f6m]] and [[Erik August Kollin]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nAfter Alexander III's death on 1 November 1894, his son, Nicholas II, presented a Faberg\u00e9 egg to both his wife, Alexandra Fedorovna, and his mother, the Dowager Empress Maria Fedorovna. Records have shown that of the 50 imperial Easter eggs, 20 were given to the former and 30 to the latter.

Although there is no official record of the Tsar's inspiration for it, many believe that he was moved by an egg owned by the Empress's aunt, [[Princess Vilhelmine Marie of Denmark]], which had captivated Maria's imagination in her childhood and of which the Tsar was well aware. Known as the [[First Hen Egg|Hen Egg]], the very first Faberg\u00e9 egg is crafted from a foundation of gold. Its opaque white enameled \"shell\" opens to reveal a matte yellow-gold yolk.

According to Faberg\u00e9 family lore, not even the Tsar knew what form they would take\u2014the only requirements were that each contain a surprise, and that each be unique. Once Faberg\u00e9 had approved an initial design, the work was carried out by a team of craftsmen, among them [[Michael Perkhin]], [[Henrik Wigstr\u00f6m]] and [[Erik August Kollin]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nAfter Alexander III's death on 1 November 1894, his son, Nicholas II, presented a Faberg\u00e9 egg to both his wife, Alexandra Fedorovna, and his mother, the Dowager Empress Maria Fedorovna.

First, it intended to destroy important American fleet units, thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and to enable Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference. Second, it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 [[Two-Ocean Navy Act|Vinson-Walsh Act]] erased any chance of victory.<ref name=Willmott14>{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983|p=14}}.</ref><ref>[[Shigeru Fukudome|Fukudome, Shigeru]].

The Canadian province of [[British Columbia]], bordering the Pacific Ocean, had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their [[Japanese Canadian|Japanese-Canadian]] descendants. Pre-war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack, leading to a reaction from the [[Government of Canada]]. On February 24, 1942, Order-in-Council P.C. no. 1486 was passed under the [[War Measures Act]], allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia, as well as the prohibiting them from returning to the province.

The aircraft was further damaged on landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot's pistol, maps, codes, and other documents. The island's residents had no telephones or radios and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to Nishikaichi's assistance was a source of concern for many, and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.<ref>Douglas Shinsato, Translator/Publisher of For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, 2011, pp.&nbsp;293\u2013294</ref>\n\n===Strategic implications===\nAdmiral [[Ch\u016bichi Hara|Hara Tadaichi]] summed up the Japanese result by saying, \"We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.\"<ref>Haufler, Herve.

Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of [[War Plan Orange|Plan Orange]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Harvnb|Peattie|1997}}</ref> The U.S. instead adopted \"[[Plan Dog]]\" in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Hakim|1995}}</ref>\n\nFortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched; otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines\u2014the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] in October 1944). A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a \"decisive battle\" that never happened.<ref>{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983}}, ''War Plan Orange''{{clarify|date=October 2011|reason=need full cite.

As early as 1924, Chief of U.S. Air Service [[Mason Patrick]] displayed a concern for military vulnerabilities in the Pacific, having sent Gen. [[Billy Mitchell]] on a survey of the Pacific and the East.

The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus U.S. equipment was dumped after the war, including vehicles and landing craft. Both of its torpedoes were missing. This correlates with reports of two torpedoes fired at the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|St. Louis|CL-49|2}} at 10:04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor, and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer {{USS|Helm|DD-388|2}} at 08:21.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zimm|2011|pp=330\u2013341}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese declaration of war===\n{{See also|Japanese war crimes}}\nThe attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan, but this was not Admiral Yamamoto's intention.

Tokyo transmitted the 5000-word notification (commonly called the \"14-Part Message\") in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it on schedule; in the event, it was not presented until more than an hour after the attack began. (In fact, U.S. code breakers had [[Purple cipher|already deciphered]] and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it.)<ref>Toland, ''Infamy''</ref> The final part is sometimes described as a declaration of war. While it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator negotiations were likely to be terminated<ref>Prange, Goldstein, and Dillon, ''At Dawn We Slept'', pp. 424 and 475</ref> and that war might break out at any moment,<ref>Prange, Goldstein, and Dillon, ''At Dawn We Slept'', pp. 493\u2013494</ref> it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations.

In 1999, however, Takeo Iguchi, a professor of law and international relations at [[International Christian University]] in Tokyo, discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, and indeed whether, to notify Washington of Japan's intention to break off negotiations and start a war, including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying, \"[O]ur deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success.\" Of this, Iguchi said, \"The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations&nbsp;... and they clearly prevailed.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/world/pearl-harbor-truly-a-sneak-attack-papers-show.html |title=Pearl Harbor Truly a Sneak Attack, Papers Show |author=Howard W.

The Canadian province of [[British Columbia]], bordering the Pacific Ocean, had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their [[Japanese Canadian|Japanese-Canadian]] descendants.

The island of [[Niihau]], only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor, was designated as the rescue point.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of ''Hiryu'' was damaged in the attack on Wheeler, so he flew to the rescue point. The aircraft was further damaged on landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot's pistol, maps, codes, and other documents. The island's residents had no telephones or radios and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to Nishikaichi's assistance was a source of concern for many, and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.<ref>Douglas Shinsato, Translator/Publisher of For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, 2011, pp.&nbsp;293\u2013294</ref>\n\n===Strategic implications===\nAdmiral [[Ch\u016bichi Hara|Hara Tadaichi]] summed up the Japanese result by saying, \"We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.\"<ref>Haufler, Herve.

Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of [[War Plan Orange|Plan Orange]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Harvnb|Peattie|1997}}</ref> The U.S. instead adopted \"[[Plan Dog]]\" in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Hakim|1995}}</ref>\n\nFortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched; otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines\u2014the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] in October 1944). A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a \"decisive battle\" that never happened.<ref>{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983}}, ''War Plan Orange''{{clarify|date=October 2011|reason=need full cite.
