The next morning, Milroy divided his troops into a two pronged attack to flank the Confederate camp. The first column advanced up the Staunton-Parkersburg Pike, engaging the Confederate right side for several hours before withdrawing. Beause of the difficult mountain terrain, the second Union column arrived shortly after the withdrawal of the first column, unable to suuport the main body of Union troops on the right<ref>https://www.mycivilwar.com/battles/611213.html</ref>, but then attacked the Confederate left<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. \n\n[[File:Camp_Allegheny_Battlefield_West_Virginia.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Camp Allegheny Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nIn a piercing winter wind, fighting raged for much of the sunny morning as each side maneuvered on the hillside slopes, fields and woods to gain the advantage. On the right flank, Milroy's strong force was in a mountain clearing, among the fallen timber, stumps and brush, which proved to be too difficult for the Confederate infantry to dislodge. A Confederate [[artillery|artillery battery]] unlimbered and unleashed a \"storm of round shot and canister among them, knocking their timber defences about their heads, and making their nest too hot to hold them...\" The fighting moved back and forth from advance to retreat, with the Union temporarily occupying the post, only to be driven off. The Confederates attempted their own flanking maneuvers which quickly failed because their force was too thin. The fighting was in such close quarters that eight of the Confederate cannons in the fortification could not be used<ref>https://www.mycivilwar.com/battles/611213.html</ref>.  After fighting for over seven hours<ref>https://emergingcivilwar.com/2012/11/24/a-historians-stroll-across-camp-allegheny/</ref> Milroy's troops finally withdrew, retreating to his camps at Green Spring Run near Cheat Mountain. Johnson's losses were high: 25 men were killed and 97 were wounded in the engagement, plus 23 went missing.\n\nAccording to one Confederate soldier in the [[52nd Virginia Infantry]]:<ref name=\"JSR\" />\n<blockquote>I had a splendid position in this battle and could see the whole fight without having to take any part in it, and I remember how I thought Colonel Johnson must be the most wonderful hero in the world, as I saw him at one point, where his men were hard pressed, snatch a musket in one hand and, swinging a big club in the other, he led his line right up among the enemy, driving them headlong down the mountain, killing and wounding many with the bayonet and capturing a large number of prisoners...</blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle, though considered insignificant compared to later battles in the Civil War, was actually one of the bloodiest in the initial year of the war<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. The Union casualties are estimated at 137 and Confederate casualities at 147<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>. Johnson would receive the nickname \"Allegheny\" Johnson for his role at the battle and for commanding the forbidding mountainous Camp Allegheny post. \n\nIronically, the Confederates had received orders to withdraw a few days prior to the battle<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. But the failed Union advance convinced the Confederate higher command to leave Johnson\u2019s force in place at Camp Allegheny with five regiments through the remainder of the harsh winter of 1861\u201362<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref><ref>http://www.civilwar.com/history/battles/battle-summaries-19937/148062-camp-alleghany.html</ref>. The snow was often knee deep. The toll on the Confederate troops was brutal. In March 18, 1862, prior to the subsequent [[Battle of McDowell]] in Highland County (May 8, 1862,) Johnson (by then promoted to General) had roughly 4,000 men stationed at Camp Allegheny in Pocahontas County, but his effective strength was only 2,784, as nearly 1,200 men were sick or unavailable<ref>http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/McDowell-Battlefield-Driving-Tour.pdf</ref>. After the Battle of Camp Allegheny, Johnson also knew that the post was vulnerable to being flanked, and believed that Shenandoah Mountain to the southeast was a more defensible position. Combined with the loss of men in the bitter mountain weather and the logistical challenges of keeping the remote mountain post effectively supplied, [[General Robert E. Lee]] agreed to let Johnson abandon the post in favor of Shenandoah Mountain on April 2, 1862<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/camp-allegheny</ref>.\n\nThe battles in the rugged and mountainous region of western Virginia, including the Battle of Camp Allegheny, were small by later standards but left and enduring footprint because those states that were in Union control formed the nucleus of the new state of West Virginia.

Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of [[Carabinieri]] in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not comply. Two groups of ten volunteers joined Italian forces in the fighting on the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]], the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Grand and General Council]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nSan Marino was originally led by the [[Arengo]], initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the Council. {{As of|2016}}, this method of nomination is still in use.\n\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (''Consiglio grande e generale''). The Council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old [[parish]]es of the republic.\n\n[[Citizen]]s 18 years or older are eligible to vote. Beside general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the [[judicial branch]] during the period of legislature of the Council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councillors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\n\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regent to be the heads of state. The regents are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the [[Roman Republic]]. The Council is equivalent to the [[Roman Senate]]; the captains regent, to the [[consul]]s of ancient [[Rome]]. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing [[Pact for San Marino]], led by the [[San Marinese Christian Democratic Party]]; and the left-wing [[Reforms and Freedom]], led by the [[Party of Socialists and Democrats]], a merger of the [[Socialist Party of San Marino]] and the former communist [[Party of Democrats]]. The [[Sammarinese general election, 2008|2008 general election]] was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\n\nOn 1 October 2007, [[Mirko Tomassoni]] was elected as among the heads of state, making him the first disabled person ever to have been elected as captain regent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/esteri/disabile-san-marino/disabile-san-marino/disabile-san-marino.html |title=San Marino, primo capo di Stato disabile \"Via tutte le barriere architettoniche\" \u2013 esteri |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nSan Marino has had more [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female heads of state]] than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice.

National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of [[Military of Italy|Italy's armed forces]]. Different branches have varied functions, including: performing ceremonial duties; patrolling borders; mounting guard at government buildings; and assisting police in major criminal cases. The [[Civil Police (San Marino)|police]] are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n====Crossbow Corps====\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of [[crossbow]] shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n====Guard of the Rock====\n[[File:Guardia di Rocca al Palazzo Pubblico San Marino.jpg|thumb|[[Guardia di Rocca|Guards of the Rock]]]]\nThe [[Guardia di Rocca|Guard of the Rock]] is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them. In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in [[San Marino, San Marino|San Marino City]], the seat of national government.\n\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists, and are known for their colourful ceremony of [[Changing the Guard]]. Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.\n\n====Guard of the Grand and General Council====\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the Council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1740, is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the Council are to protect the [[captains regent]], and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n====Company of Uniformed Militia====\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\n\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a [[kepi]] bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n====Military Ensemble====\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia, and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 50 musicians. The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n====Gendarmerie====\nEstablished in 1842, the [[Corps of Gendarmerie of San Marino|Gendarmerie]] of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency. Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\n\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the ''Corpi Militari Volontari'', or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of San Marino|Sammarinese euro coins|List of banks in San Marino}}\n[[File:Via Basilicus din San Marino2.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|Tourism and banking are the country's main source of revenue.]]\n\nAlthough San Marino is not a [[European Union]] member, it is allowed to use the [[euro]] as its currency by arrangement with the [[Council of the European Union]]; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the [[euro coins]]. Before the euro, the [[Sammarinese lira]] was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the [[Italian lira]]. The small number of [[Sammarinese euro coins]], as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to [[coin collecting|coin collectors]].\n\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of [[Italy]]. Key industries include [[bank]]ing, [[electronics]], and [[ceramic]]s. The main [[agriculture|agricultural]] products are [[wine]] and [[cheese]]. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\n\nSan Marino's [[postage stamp]]s, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to [[philately|philatelists]] and are an important source of income. San Marino is no longer a member of the [[Small European Postal Administration Cooperation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sepacstamps.eu/|title=SEPAC Stamps {{!}} Small European Postal Administration Cooperations|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Taxation===\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 19%, capital gains are subject to a five per cent tax, and interest is subject to a 13% [[withholding tax]].\n\nIn 1972, a [[value-added tax]] (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and was applied in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. In addition, a tax on imported goods, to be levied by San Marino, was established. Such taxes, however, were not, and are not, applied to national products. Until 1996, goods manufactured and sold in San Marino were not subject to indirect taxation.\n\nUnder the [[European Union Customs Union|European Union customs agreement]], San Marino continues to levy taxes, the equivalent of an import duty, on imported goods.

Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive [[Vehicle registration plates of San Marino|Sammarinese license plates]], which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is \"RSM\".\n\nThere are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private [[Torraccia airfield|airstrip located in Torraccia]] and an international heliport located in [[Borgo Maggiore]]. Most tourists who arrive by air land at [[Federico Fellini International Airport]] close to the city of [[Rimini]], then make the transfer by bus.\n\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.\n\n===Public transport===\nSan Marino has limited public transport facilities. There is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at [[Rimini railway station]] and San Marino coach station.\n\nA limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic,<ref>Licensed taxi companies are listed on the {{cite web |url=http://www.visitsanmarino.com/default.asp?id=114 |title=Government tourism website |accessdate=2007-09-03 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501005409/http://www.visitsanmarino.com/default.asp?id=114 |archivedate=1 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.\n\n[[File:San-Marino-Gondola-1283.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial tramway to [[Monte Titano]]]]\nThere is a {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} aerial tramway connecting the [[City of San Marino]] on top of [[Monte Titano]] with [[Borgo Maggiore]], a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, [[Dogana, San Marino|Dogana]], via the local bus service.\n\nTwo aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.\n\n===Railway===\n{{Main|Ferrovia Rimini\u2013San Marino}}\nToday, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before [[World War II]], it had a single narrow-gauge line called the [[Ferrovia Rimini\u2013San Marino]] which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of [[Valdragone]], but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.<ref>[http://ifef.free.fr/provo/if2005-6.pdf ''Internacia Fervojisto''] (''International Railways''), 2005.6, p. 85. In Esperanto</ref>\nAn advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers, but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Culture of San Marino}}\n[[File:Pompeo batoni san marino risolleva la repubblica by stefano bolognini.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|A painting in the Museo di Stato di San Marino by [[Pompeo Batoni]]]]\nThe [[Three Towers of San Marino]] are located on the three peaks of [[Monte Titano]] in the capital. They are depicted on both the [[flag of San Marino]] and its [[Coat of Arms of San Marino|coat of arms]]. The three towers are: ''[[Guaita]]'', the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century ''[[Cesta]]'', located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century ''[[Montale (San Marino)|Montale]]'', on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.\n\n===University===\nThe ''Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino'' ([[University of the Republic of San Marino]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unirsm.sm/ |title=Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di San Marino |publisher=Unirsm.sm |date=|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> is the main university, which includes the ''[[Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino]]'' (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora.

Its best known is probably the ''[[Torta Tre Monti]]'' (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the [[Three Towers of San Marino]].

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Grand and General Council]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nSan Marino was originally led by the [[Arengo]], initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the Council. {{As of|2016}}, this method of nomination is still in use.\n\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (''Consiglio grande e generale''). The Council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old [[parish]]es of the republic.\n\n[[Citizen]]s 18 years or older are eligible to vote. Beside general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the [[judicial branch]] during the period of legislature of the Council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councillors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\n\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regent to be the heads of state. The regents are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the [[Roman Republic]]. The Council is equivalent to the [[Roman Senate]]; the captains regent, to the [[consul]]s of ancient [[Rome]]. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing [[Pact for San Marino]], led by the [[San Marinese Christian Democratic Party]]; and the left-wing [[Reforms and Freedom]], led by the [[Party of Socialists and Democrats]], a merger of the [[Socialist Party of San Marino]] and the former communist [[Party of Democrats]]. The [[Sammarinese general election, 2008|2008 general election]] was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\n\nOn 1 October 2007, [[Mirko Tomassoni]] was elected as among the heads of state, making him the first disabled person ever to have been elected as captain regent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/esteri/disabile-san-marino/disabile-san-marino/disabile-san-marino.html |title=San Marino, primo capo di Stato disabile \"Via tutte le barriere architettoniche\" \u2013 esteri |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nSan Marino has had more [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female heads of state]] than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino [Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino] exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n\n====Municipalities====\n[[File:San Marino.png|thumb|[[Administrative division]]s of San Marino]]\nSan Marino is divided into the following nine [[municipalities]], known locally as ''{{lang|it|castelli}}'' (meaning \"castles\"):\n* [[City of San Marino|San Marino]] (City of San Marino, officially ''{{lang|it|Citt\u00e0 di San Marino}}'') is the capital.\n\nThere are also eight minor municipalities:\n* [[Acquaviva (San Marino)|Acquaviva]]\n* [[Borgo Maggiore]]\n* [[Chiesanuova]]\n* [[Domagnano]]\n* [[Faetano]]\n* [[Fiorentino]]\n* [[Montegiardino]]\n* [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]]\n\nThe largest settlement of the Republic is [[Dogana]], which is not an autonomous ''{{lang|it|castello}}'', but rather belongs to the Castello of [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]].\n\nIn a similar way to an Italian ''{{lang|it|[[comune]]}}'', each ''{{lang|it|castello}}'' includes a main settlement, called ''{{lang|it|capoluogo}}'', which is the seat of the ''{{lang|it|castello}}'', and some even smaller localities known as ''{{lang|it|[[frazione|frazioni]]}}''.\n\n====Curacies====\nThe republic is made up of 43 [[parish (administrative division)|parishes]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elezioni.sm/index.php?id=299 |title=Regolamento Disciplina Campagna Elettorale |accessdate=2010-11-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805215911/http://www.elezioni.sm/index.php?id=299 |archivedate=5 August 2009 |df=dmy-all |language=it}}. elezioni.sm</ref> named ''[[curacy|curacies]]'' (It: ''curazie''):<br />\n[[C\u00e0 Berlone]], [[C\u00e0 Chiavello]], [[C\u00e0 Giannino]], [[C\u00e0 Melone]], [[C\u00e0 Ragni]], [[C\u00e0 Rigo]], [[Cailungo]], [[Caladino]], [[Calligaria]], [[Canepa, San Marino|Canepa]], [[Capanne, San Marino|Capanne]], [[Casole]], [[Castellaro, San Marino|Castellaro]], [[Cerbaiola]], [[Cinque Vie]], [[Confine]], [[Corianino]], [[Crociale]], [[Dogana]], [[Falciano]], [[Fiorina (San Marino)|Fiorina]], [[Galavotto]], [[Gualdicciolo]], [[La Serra]], [[Lesignano]], [[Molarini]], [[Montalbo, San Marino|Montalbo]], [[Monte Pulito]], [[Murata (San Marino)|Murata]], [[Pianacci]], [[Piandivello]], [[Poggio Casalino]], [[Poggio Chiesanuova]], [[Ponte Mellini]], [[Rovereta]], [[San Giovanni sotto le Penne]], [[Santa Mustiola]], [[Spaccio Giannoni]], [[Teglio, San Marino|Teglio]], [[Torraccia]], [[Valdragone]], [[Valgiurata]] and [[Ventoso]].\n\n===Military===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2011}}\n{{Main|Military of San Marino}}\n\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of [[Military of Italy|Italy's armed forces]]. Different branches have varied functions, including: performing ceremonial duties; patrolling borders; mounting guard at government buildings; and assisting police in major criminal cases. The [[Civil Police (San Marino)|police]] are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n====Crossbow Corps====\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of [[crossbow]] shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n====Guard of the Rock====\n[[File:Guardia di Rocca al Palazzo Pubblico San Marino.jpg|thumb|[[Guardia di Rocca|Guards of the Rock]]]]\nThe [[Guardia di Rocca|Guard of the Rock]] is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them. In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in [[San Marino, San Marino|San Marino City]], the seat of national government.\n\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists, and are known for their colourful ceremony of [[Changing the Guard]]. Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.\n\n====Guard of the Grand and General Council====\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the Council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1740, is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the Council are to protect the [[captains regent]], and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n====Company of Uniformed Militia====\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\n\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a [[kepi]] bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n====Military Ensemble====\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia, and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 50 musicians. The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n====Gendarmerie====\nEstablished in 1842, the [[Corps of Gendarmerie of San Marino|Gendarmerie]] of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency. Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\n\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the ''Corpi Militari Volontari'', or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of San Marino|Sammarinese euro coins|List of banks in San Marino}}\n[[File:Via Basilicus din San Marino2.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|Tourism and banking are the country's main source of revenue.]]\n\nAlthough San Marino is not a [[European Union]] member, it is allowed to use the [[euro]] as its currency by arrangement with the [[Council of the European Union]]; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the [[euro coins]]. Before the euro, the [[Sammarinese lira]] was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the [[Italian lira]]. The small number of [[Sammarinese euro coins]], as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to [[coin collecting|coin collectors]].\n\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of [[Italy]]. Key industries include [[bank]]ing, [[electronics]], and [[ceramic]]s. The main [[agriculture|agricultural]] products are [[wine]] and [[cheese]]. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\n\nSan Marino's [[postage stamp]]s, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to [[philately|philatelists]] and are an important source of income. San Marino is no longer a member of the [[Small European Postal Administration Cooperation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sepacstamps.eu/|title=SEPAC Stamps {{!}} Small European Postal Administration Cooperations|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Taxation===\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 19%, capital gains are subject to a five per cent tax, and interest is subject to a 13% [[withholding tax]].\n\nIn 1972, a [[value-added tax]] (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and was applied in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. In addition, a tax on imported goods, to be levied by San Marino, was established. Such taxes, however, were not, and are not, applied to national products. Until 1996, goods manufactured and sold in San Marino were not subject to indirect taxation.\n\nUnder the [[European Union Customs Union|European Union customs agreement]], San Marino continues to levy taxes, the equivalent of an import duty, on imported goods. Also, a general VAT was introduced, in replacement of the Italian VAT.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in San Marino}}\nThe [[tourism]] sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]],<ref name=\"rtv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sanmarinortv.sm/economia/default.asp?id=33&id_n=39203|title=Turismo: San Marino fa i conti con la recessione economica, l'Italia guarda con fiducia al 2010|date=11 January 2010|publisher=San Marino RTV |language=Italian|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tourists flows|url=http://www.statistica.sm/contents/instance15/files/document/14079659Tav_Afflusso_tur.pdf|website=statistica.sm|publisher=Statistical Office of San Marino|accessdate=16 December 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082104/http://www.statistica.sm/contents/instance15/files/document/14079659Tav_Afflusso_tur.pdf|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Conventions with Italy===\nSan Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esteri.sm/on-line/home/trattati-internazionali/convenzioni-bilaterali/convenzioni-bilaterali---accordi-bilaterali-con-litalia.html|title=Convenzioni Bilaterali \u2013 Accordi bilaterali con l'Italia|publisher=Segreteria di stato per gli affari esteri e politici|language=Italian|accessdate=28 December 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104183908/http://www.esteri.sm/on-line/home/trattati-internazionali/convenzioni-bilaterali/convenzioni-bilaterali---accordi-bilaterali-con-litalia.html|archivedate=4 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.\nCultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's [[government monopoly]] are forbidden in San Marino.

Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian [[diocese]]s, mostly in the [[Diocese of Montefeltro]], and partly in the [[Diocese of Rimini]]. In 1977, the border between [[Montefeltro]] and [[Rimini]] was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The [[bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino]] resides in [[Pennabilli]], in Italy's province of [[Pesaro e Urbino]].\n\nThere is a provision under the income tax rules that the taxpayers have the right to request for allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities. The churches include the two religious groups of the [[Waldensian Church]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro]] was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro.

The earliest mention of [[Montefeltro]], as ''Mona Feretri'', is in the diplomas by which [[Charlemagne]] confirmed the [[donation of Pepin]]. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at [[San Leo]].

Its best known is probably the ''[[Torta Tre Monti]]'' (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the [[Three Towers of San Marino]].

The district is located entirely in [[Los Angeles County]] and includes much of [[Central Los Angeles]], as well as such wealthy neighborhoods as [[Los Feliz]].\n\nA native of Los Angeles, Watson is a graduate of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and also holds degrees from [[California State University, Los Angeles]] and [[Claremont Graduate University]]. She worked as a psychologist, professor, and health occupation specialist before serving as a member of the [[Los Angeles Unified School District|Los Angeles Unified School Board]] (1975\u201378). She was a member of the [[California Senate]] from 1978 to 1998, and the [[United States Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia|US Ambassador to Micronesia]] from 1999 to 2000.\n\nWatson was elected to Congress in a 2001 special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Representative [[Julian C.

Watson became a member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]].\n\nShe earned an [[Master of Science|MS]] from [[California State University, Los Angeles]] in [[School Psychology]] (1967) and a [[PhD]] in [[School leadership|Educational Administration]] from [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1987. She also attended the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].  Watson taught [[elementary school]] and was a [[school psychologist]] in the [[Los Angeles Unified School District|Los Angeles public schools]].  She has lectured at [[California State University, Long Beach]] and [[California State University, Los Angeles]]. She was a health occupation specialist with the [[California Department of Education]]'s Bureau of Industrial Education.\n\nWatson was elected to the [[California State Senate]] from 1978 to 1998.  The longtime chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, she gained a reputation as an advocate for [[health care]] for the [[poverty|poor]] and [[child]]ren.  Term limited, she was replaced by [[Kevin Murray (politician)|Kevin Murray]].\n\nWhen, in 1988, the US government proposed the addition of the category of \"bi-racial\" or \"[[multiracial]]\" to official documents and statistics, some African American organizations and African American leaders such as Watson and Representative [[Augustus Hawkins]] were particularly vocal in their rejection and opposition of the category.  They feared massive defection from the [[African American]] self-designation.\n\nIn 1992, Watson ran for the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]].  After a hard-fought campaign that often turned negative, Watson narrowly lost to former Supervisor [[Yvonne Burke]], who was supported by US Representative [[Maxine Waters]].\n\nPresident [[Bill Clinton]] appointed her [[United States Ambassador]] to [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]] in 1999.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]]'''\n**[[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health|Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health]]\n**[[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and the Global Environment|Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and the Global Environment]]\n**[[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade|Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade]]\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]'''\n**[[United States House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Domestic Policy|Subcommittee on Domestic Policy]]\n**[[United States House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Government Management, Organization, and Procurement|Subcommittee on Government Management, Organization, and Procurement]] (Chairwoman)\n**[[United States House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives|Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives]]\n\n===Caucuses===\n*Chair of the Congressional Entertainment Industries Caucus\n*Co-chair of the Congressional Korea Caucus\n*Co-chair of the U.S.-UK Caucus\n*[[Congressional Black Caucus]]\n\nCongresswoman Watson supported [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq]],<ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_iraq.shtml War in Iraq: 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309131459/http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_iraq.shtml |date=2010-03-09 }}</ref> opposed [[media consolidation]],<ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_media.shtml Corporate Media and the FCC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309131503/http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_media.shtml |date=2010-03-09 }}</ref>  supported expanding [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] coverage,<ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_welfare.shtml High-Priced Republican Welfare Plan Puts the Burden on States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309131448/http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_welfare.shtml |date=2010-03-09 }}</ref> and opposed President Bush's proposal to [[privatize]] [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].<ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_socialsecurity.shtml How will President Bush's plan to privatize Social Security impact America and the 33rd District of California?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309131441/http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_socialsecurity.shtml |date=2010-03-09 }}</ref>  Watson opposed the [[Bush tax cuts]], saying they were unaffordable.\n\nShe was one of the 31 members of the House who voted not to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s from [[Ohio]] in the [[2004 United States presidential election]].<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 7]</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the ''[[National Journal]]'' ranked Watson as the most [[Social liberalism|liberal]] member of Congress.<ref>[http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=3655 National Journal - Composite Liberal Score] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007031125/http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=3655 |date=2008-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nOn the issue of [[Cherokee Freedmen]] membership in the Cherokee tribe, Watson noted that 20,000 Cherokee lived in California.  She opposed the [[Cherokee Nation]]'s March 2007 vote to amend its [[constitution]] to limit membership to only those descendants with at least one [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] ancestor on the [[Dawes Roll]].  She noted that when [[freedmen]] were granted [[citizenship]] in the tribe in 1866 by a treaty which the Cherokees made with the US government, it was without restriction to those freedmen with Indian ancestry. Appeals to the Cherokee Nation's position were pending, in part because the tribe excluded descendants of Cherokee freedmen and intermarried whites from voting on the amendment.  In June 2007 Watson introduced a bill to sever US relations with the tribe and revoke its [[Native American gambling enterprises|gaming privileges]] unless the Cherokee restored membership in the tribe to descendants of Cherokee freedmen.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gillian |last=Flaccus |authorlink= |author= |title=Cherokee identity fight reaches Calif. |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/09/27/cherokee_identity_fight_reaches_calif/ |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Boston Globe |location=[[Boston, Massachusetts]] |id= |pages= |page= |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-28 |language= |quote= |df= }}{{dead link|date=February 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==Political campaigns==\nIn the [[2008 Democratic primary]], Watson's district went overwhelmingly for [[Illinois]] Senator [[Barack Obama]] by a margin of 61-29.

Watson became a member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]].\n\nShe earned an [[Master of Science|MS]] from [[California State University, Los Angeles]] in [[School Psychology]] (1967) and a [[PhD]] in [[School leadership|Educational Administration]] from [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1987. She also attended the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].  Watson taught [[elementary school]] and was a [[school psychologist]] in the [[Los Angeles Unified School District|Los Angeles public schools]].

She was a health occupation specialist with the [[California Department of Education]]'s Bureau of Industrial Education.\n\nWatson was elected to the [[California State Senate]] from 1978 to 1998.  The longtime chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, she gained a reputation as an advocate for [[health care]] for the [[poverty|poor]] and [[child]]ren.  Term limited, she was replaced by [[Kevin Murray (politician)|Kevin Murray]].\n\nWhen, in 1988, the US government proposed the addition of the category of \"bi-racial\" or \"[[multiracial]]\" to official documents and statistics, some African American organizations and African American leaders such as Watson and Representative [[Augustus Hawkins]] were particularly vocal in their rejection and opposition of the category.  They feared massive defection from the [[African American]] self-designation.\n\nIn 1992, Watson ran for the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]].  After a hard-fought campaign that often turned negative, Watson narrowly lost to former Supervisor [[Yvonne Burke]], who was supported by US Representative [[Maxine Waters]].\n\nPresident [[Bill Clinton]] appointed her [[United States Ambassador]] to [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]] in 1999.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]]'''\n**[[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health|Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health]]\n**[[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and the Global Environment|Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and the Global Environment]]\n**[[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade|Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade]]\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]'''\n**[[United States House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Domestic Policy|Subcommittee on Domestic Policy]]\n**[[United States House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Government Management, Organization, and Procurement|Subcommittee on Government Management, Organization, and Procurement]] (Chairwoman)\n**[[United States House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives|Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives]]\n\n===Caucuses===\n*Chair of the Congressional Entertainment Industries Caucus\n*Co-chair of the Congressional Korea Caucus\n*Co-chair of the U.S.-UK Caucus\n*[[Congressional Black Caucus]]\n\nCongresswoman Watson supported [[withdrawal of US troops from Iraq]],<ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_iraq.shtml War in Iraq: 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309131459/http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_iraq.shtml |date=2010-03-09 }}</ref> opposed [[media consolidation]],<ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_media.shtml Corporate Media and the FCC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309131503/http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_media.shtml |date=2010-03-09 }}</ref>  supported expanding [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] coverage,<ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_welfare.shtml High-Priced Republican Welfare Plan Puts the Burden on States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309131448/http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_welfare.shtml |date=2010-03-09 }}</ref> and opposed President Bush's proposal to [[privatize]] [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].<ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_socialsecurity.shtml How will President Bush's plan to privatize Social Security impact America and the 33rd District of California?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309131441/http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_socialsecurity.shtml |date=2010-03-09 }}</ref>  Watson opposed the [[Bush tax cuts]], saying they were unaffordable.\n\nShe was one of the 31 members of the House who voted not to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s from [[Ohio]] in the [[2004 United States presidential election]].<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 7]</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the ''[[National Journal]]'' ranked Watson as the most [[Social liberalism|liberal]] member of Congress.<ref>[http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=3655 National Journal - Composite Liberal Score] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007031125/http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=3655 |date=2008-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nOn the issue of [[Cherokee Freedmen]] membership in the Cherokee tribe, Watson noted that 20,000 Cherokee lived in California.

She noted that when [[freedmen]] were granted [[citizenship]] in the tribe in 1866 by a treaty which the Cherokees made with the US government, it was without restriction to those freedmen with Indian ancestry. Appeals to the Cherokee Nation's position were pending, in part because the tribe excluded descendants of Cherokee freedmen and intermarried whites from voting on the amendment.  In June 2007 Watson introduced a bill to sever US relations with the tribe and revoke its [[Native American gambling enterprises|gaming privileges]] unless the Cherokee restored membership in the tribe to descendants of Cherokee freedmen.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gillian |last=Flaccus |authorlink= |author= |title=Cherokee identity fight reaches Calif. |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/09/27/cherokee_identity_fight_reaches_calif/ |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Boston Globe |location=[[Boston, Massachusetts]] |id= |pages= |page= |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-28 |language= |quote= |df= }}{{dead link|date=February 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==Political campaigns==\nIn the [[2008 Democratic primary]], Watson's district went overwhelmingly for [[Illinois]] Senator [[Barack Obama]] by a margin of 61-29.

He is considered a father of the modern [[foster care]] movement and was most renowned for starting the [[Orphan Train]] movement of the mid-19th century, and for founding [[Children's Aid Society]].\n\n==Early life==\nBrace was born on June 19, 1826 in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]].

He was drawn to New York because it was viewed as the center of American Protestantism and social activity. His best friend and classmate at Yale, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the landscape architect, also lived in New York.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1852, at the age of 26, Brace, who had been raised as a [[Calvinist]], was serving as a minister to the poor of [[Blackwell's Island]] (now known as Roosevelt Island) and to the poor of the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] [[Mission (station)|Mission]], when he decided he wanted to pursue his humanitarian efforts in the streets rather than in church. Brace was aware of the impoverished lives of the children in New York City and for this reason he concentrated on improving children\u2019s situations and their future. In 1853, Brace established the [[Children's Aid Society]].<ref name=\"cas\">[http://www.childrensaidsociety.org/about/history \"History\", Children's Aid Society]</ref>\n\n[[File:Charles Loring Brace - Aged 29.jpg|thumb|Charles Loring Brace, aged 29 years]]\n\nIn 1854, the Society opened the first of its \"[[newspaper hawker|newsboys]]' lodging-houses\", which would become one of Brace's most successful projects. These houses provided basic room and board at low prices to homeless children who hawked newspapers on the streets of American cities. Though Brace viewed the newsboys as children in need of the services provided by the houses,<ref name=\"Life\">{{cite book|last1=Brace|first1=Charles Loring|title=The life of Charles Loring Brace : chiefly told in his own letters|date=1894|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeofcharleslor00bracuoft/page/186 186]|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofcharleslor00bracuoft|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> they also inspired several of [[Horatio Alger]]'s stories in which the newsboys' independence and pluck is rewarded with great wealth.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite journal|last1=Askeland|first1=Lori|title=Brace, Charles Loring (1826\u20131890).|journal=Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society|date=2004|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Charles_Loring_Brace.aspx}}</ref>\n\nBrace witnessed many children in New York City who lived in poverty with parents who abused [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], engaged in criminal activity, and were otherwise unfit parents. Many of these unwanted kids had been in trouble with the law.<ref name=\"lindahl\">[http://www.pietisten.org/fall04/orphantrains.html Lindahl, M., \"The Orphan Train\", ''Pietisten'', Vol. XIX, No. 1, Fall 2004]</ref> Such was the severity of [[child poverty]] in 1854 that the number of homeless children in New York City was estimated as high as 34,000. The police referred to these children as \u201cstreet rats\u201d.\n\nAccording to an essay written by Brace in 1872, one crime and poverty ridden area around Tenth Avenue was referred to as \u201cMisery Row\u201d. Misery Row was considered to be a main breeding ground of crime and poverty, and an inevitable \"fever nest\u201d where disease spread easily. Other children who were orphans or runaways found themselves drifting into this destitute area, as well as the old sheds of Eighteenth and Nineteenth Streets.\n\nOrphan asylums and almshouses were the only \"social services\" available for poor and homeless children.<ref name=\"cas\" /> Brace did not believe that these were worthwhile institutions because they merely served the purpose of feeding the poor and providing handouts. He felt that such institutions only deepened the dependence of the poor on [[Charitable organization|charity]]. Brace was also influenced by the writings of Edward Livingstone, a pioneer in [[prison reform]] who believed that the best way to deal with crime and poverty was to prevent it. Brace focused on finding jobs and training for poor and destitute children so they could help themselves. His initial efforts in [[social reform]] included free [[kindergarten]]s, free dental clinics, job placement, training programs, reading rooms, and lodging houses for boys.\n\n===Fostering and the \"Orphan Trains\"===\n{{main|Orphan Train}}\nBrace endeavored to place children into farm families of northern New York State, the [[Midwest]] and, after the [[American Civil War]], some southern and a few western states. From 1853 to 1864, 384 children were sent each year to families in New England states, the North Atlantic states and East North Central states. Nearly 1,000 children per year were sent from 1865 to 1874 to Michigan, Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri through Brace's \"Emigration Plan\u201d, now known as \"The Orphan Trains\". \"In every American community, especially in a western one, there are many spare places at the table of life,\" Brace wrote. \"They have enough for themselves and the stranger too.\"\n\nThe arrangements for placing orphan children varied. Sometimes they were pre-ordered by couples; at other times a local screening committee tried to make sure the children would be given to good parents; at other times the scene was more random.<ref name=\"lindahl\" />\n\nBrace received special discounts on fares for the orphan children from the railroads. Whole coaches were sometimes filled with these kids. Prior to departure, they were bathed, given new clothes, a coat, often a Bible, and reminded of good manners.<ref name=\"lindahl\" /> The trains transported children from lodging houses, orphanages, private homes or the street, bringing them to towns where local organizers had created interest in the program. Notices were posted around town and in newspapers, informing locals when the children would arrive and of the viewing location. The Children's Aid Society (CAS) made arrangements with train companies for the children (in groups ranging in size from three to 35, along with at least two adult agents) to travel in regular [[passenger coach]]es, not in wooden [[box car]]s as is sometimes depicted in novels. At towns along the route, the children assembled at the train station  or were brought to opera houses, schools, or town halls for the community to meet and interview.\n\n===Emigration Plan===\nBrace's Emigration Plan was also an anti-[[eugenic]] movement because Brace believed that one's \"[[gemmules]]\" (an early, pre-genetic concept that blood carried a family's heritability and character) did not predetermine one's future. Brace was deeply moved by [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'', having read it thirteen times.<ref>Stephen O'Connor, ''Orphan Trains'', pg. 80</ref> Brace was also an outspoken [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. In a bold move (and perhaps inspired by his abolitionist and Darwinian mindset), Brace did away with the centuries-old custom of [[indenture]] so that the \"placed\" children were allowed to leave a home if they were uncomfortable with the placement. Brace\u2019s vision of migrating children to live with the western Christian farming families was widely supported by wealthy New York families \u2013 the first $50 was given by Mrs. [[John Jacob Astor III|John Astor]] in 1853.\n\nThe Children's Aid Society (CAS), the best-known organization finding homes for children, made efforts to screen the host families and follow up on the welfare of placed children. By 1909, at the first White House [[Conference on Dependent Children]], the country's top social reformers praised the CAS' emigration movement, but argued that children should either be kept with their natal families or, if they were removed as a result of parental [[neglect]] or [[abuse]], every effort should be made to place the child in a foster home nearby. In a report in 1910, the Children\u2019s Aid Society estimated that 87 percent of children placed by the Orphan Train program had done well.<ref name=\"bu\" /> While there was occasional abuse, most people agreed that overall, the children were generally better off than on the streets of big cities without proper food, clothing, and shelter.\n\nBy 1920, the CAS and approximately 1500 other agencies and institutions had placed approximately 150,000 children in the largest migration or resettlement of children in American history.  The CAS' Orphan Train movement ended in 1929, 75 years after it had begun as a social experiment.\n\nTo this day, Brace is honored and revered for his compassionate work with the street children of New York City. He helped 400,000 children with the orphan train.\n\nBrace served as an executive secretary of Children's Aid Society for 37 years, overseeing the program. He died in 1890 from [[Bright's disease]].<ref name=\"bu\" /> After his death, the Brace Memorial Farm was created for street children to learn farm skills, manners, and personal [[social skills]] to help prepare them for life on their own.  His memoirs were published in 1872 under the title \"The Dangerous Classes of New York and Twenty Years\u2019 Work Among Them\" ({{ISBN|1402181493}}).\n\n==Personal life==\nOn August 21, 1854 he married Letitia Neill in [[Belfast]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Ireland]], who proved to be a great support to her husband\u2019s social reform efforts. Letitia's father, Robert Neill, was an avid abolitionist and he opened his home to some of the world's most famous anti-slavery orators, including [[Frederick Douglass]]. He died at Campfer, Tirol, on August 11, 1890.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Brace, Charles Loring}}</ref>\n\nFamily includes son, Charles Loring Brace Jr. (Yale, 1876) and CAS board secretary,<ref name=\"2Yalies\" /> grandson, [[Gerald Warner Brace]] (1901\u20131978) American writer, educator, sailor and boat builder, and great-grandson, [[C.

He is considered a father of the modern [[foster care]] movement and was most renowned for starting the [[Orphan Train]] movement of the mid-19th century, and for founding [[Children's Aid Society]].\n\n==Early life==\nBrace was born on June 19, 1826 in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]].

He was drawn to New York because it was viewed as the center of American Protestantism and social activity. His best friend and classmate at Yale, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the landscape architect, also lived in New York.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1852, at the age of 26, Brace, who had been raised as a [[Calvinist]], was serving as a minister to the poor of [[Blackwell's Island]] (now known as Roosevelt Island) and to the poor of the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] [[Mission (station)|Mission]], when he decided he wanted to pursue his humanitarian efforts in the streets rather than in church. Brace was aware of the impoverished lives of the children in New York City and for this reason he concentrated on improving children\u2019s situations and their future. In 1853, Brace established the [[Children's Aid Society]].<ref name=\"cas\">[http://www.childrensaidsociety.org/about/history \"History\", Children's Aid Society]</ref>\n\n[[File:Charles Loring Brace - Aged 29.jpg|thumb|Charles Loring Brace, aged 29 years]]\n\nIn 1854, the Society opened the first of its \"[[newspaper hawker|newsboys]]' lodging-houses\", which would become one of Brace's most successful projects. These houses provided basic room and board at low prices to homeless children who hawked newspapers on the streets of American cities. Though Brace viewed the newsboys as children in need of the services provided by the houses,<ref name=\"Life\">{{cite book|last1=Brace|first1=Charles Loring|title=The life of Charles Loring Brace : chiefly told in his own letters|date=1894|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeofcharleslor00bracuoft/page/186 186]|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofcharleslor00bracuoft|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> they also inspired several of [[Horatio Alger]]'s stories in which the newsboys' independence and pluck is rewarded with great wealth.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite journal|last1=Askeland|first1=Lori|title=Brace, Charles Loring (1826\u20131890).|journal=Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society|date=2004|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Charles_Loring_Brace.aspx}}</ref>\n\nBrace witnessed many children in New York City who lived in poverty with parents who abused [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], engaged in criminal activity, and were otherwise unfit parents. Many of these unwanted kids had been in trouble with the law.<ref name=\"lindahl\">[http://www.pietisten.org/fall04/orphantrains.html Lindahl, M., \"The Orphan Train\", ''Pietisten'', Vol. XIX, No. 1, Fall 2004]</ref> Such was the severity of [[child poverty]] in 1854 that the number of homeless children in New York City was estimated as high as 34,000. The police referred to these children as \u201cstreet rats\u201d.\n\nAccording to an essay written by Brace in 1872, one crime and poverty ridden area around Tenth Avenue was referred to as \u201cMisery Row\u201d. Misery Row was considered to be a main breeding ground of crime and poverty, and an inevitable \"fever nest\u201d where disease spread easily. Other children who were orphans or runaways found themselves drifting into this destitute area, as well as the old sheds of Eighteenth and Nineteenth Streets.\n\nOrphan asylums and almshouses were the only \"social services\" available for poor and homeless children.<ref name=\"cas\" /> Brace did not believe that these were worthwhile institutions because they merely served the purpose of feeding the poor and providing handouts. He felt that such institutions only deepened the dependence of the poor on [[Charitable organization|charity]]. Brace was also influenced by the writings of Edward Livingstone, a pioneer in [[prison reform]] who believed that the best way to deal with crime and poverty was to prevent it. Brace focused on finding jobs and training for poor and destitute children so they could help themselves. His initial efforts in [[social reform]] included free [[kindergarten]]s, free dental clinics, job placement, training programs, reading rooms, and lodging houses for boys.\n\n===Fostering and the \"Orphan Trains\"===\n{{main|Orphan Train}}\nBrace endeavored to place children into farm families of northern New York State, the [[Midwest]] and, after the [[American Civil War]], some southern and a few western states. From 1853 to 1864, 384 children were sent each year to families in New England states, the North Atlantic states and East North Central states. Nearly 1,000 children per year were sent from 1865 to 1874 to Michigan, Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri through Brace's \"Emigration Plan\u201d, now known as \"The Orphan Trains\". \"In every American community, especially in a western one, there are many spare places at the table of life,\" Brace wrote. \"They have enough for themselves and the stranger too.\"\n\nThe arrangements for placing orphan children varied. Sometimes they were pre-ordered by couples; at other times a local screening committee tried to make sure the children would be given to good parents; at other times the scene was more random.<ref name=\"lindahl\" />\n\nBrace received special discounts on fares for the orphan children from the railroads. Whole coaches were sometimes filled with these kids. Prior to departure, they were bathed, given new clothes, a coat, often a Bible, and reminded of good manners.<ref name=\"lindahl\" /> The trains transported children from lodging houses, orphanages, private homes or the street, bringing them to towns where local organizers had created interest in the program. Notices were posted around town and in newspapers, informing locals when the children would arrive and of the viewing location. The Children's Aid Society (CAS) made arrangements with train companies for the children (in groups ranging in size from three to 35, along with at least two adult agents) to travel in regular [[passenger coach]]es, not in wooden [[box car]]s as is sometimes depicted in novels. At towns along the route, the children assembled at the train station  or were brought to opera houses, schools, or town halls for the community to meet and interview.\n\n===Emigration Plan===\nBrace's Emigration Plan was also an anti-[[eugenic]] movement because Brace believed that one's \"[[gemmules]]\" (an early, pre-genetic concept that blood carried a family's heritability and character) did not predetermine one's future. Brace was deeply moved by [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'', having read it thirteen times.<ref>Stephen O'Connor, ''Orphan Trains'', pg. 80</ref> Brace was also an outspoken [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. In a bold move (and perhaps inspired by his abolitionist and Darwinian mindset), Brace did away with the centuries-old custom of [[indenture]] so that the \"placed\" children were allowed to leave a home if they were uncomfortable with the placement. Brace\u2019s vision of migrating children to live with the western Christian farming families was widely supported by wealthy New York families \u2013 the first $50 was given by Mrs. [[John Jacob Astor III|John Astor]] in 1853.\n\nThe Children's Aid Society (CAS), the best-known organization finding homes for children, made efforts to screen the host families and follow up on the welfare of placed children. By 1909, at the first White House [[Conference on Dependent Children]], the country's top social reformers praised the CAS' emigration movement, but argued that children should either be kept with their natal families or, if they were removed as a result of parental [[neglect]] or [[abuse]], every effort should be made to place the child in a foster home nearby. In a report in 1910, the Children\u2019s Aid Society estimated that 87 percent of children placed by the Orphan Train program had done well.<ref name=\"bu\" /> While there was occasional abuse, most people agreed that overall, the children were generally better off than on the streets of big cities without proper food, clothing, and shelter.\n\nBy 1920, the CAS and approximately 1500 other agencies and institutions had placed approximately 150,000 children in the largest migration or resettlement of children in American history.  The CAS' Orphan Train movement ended in 1929, 75 years after it had begun as a social experiment.\n\nTo this day, Brace is honored and revered for his compassionate work with the street children of New York City. He helped 400,000 children with the orphan train.\n\nBrace served as an executive secretary of Children's Aid Society for 37 years, overseeing the program. He died in 1890 from [[Bright's disease]].<ref name=\"bu\" /> After his death, the Brace Memorial Farm was created for street children to learn farm skills, manners, and personal [[social skills]] to help prepare them for life on their own.  His memoirs were published in 1872 under the title \"The Dangerous Classes of New York and Twenty Years\u2019 Work Among Them\" ({{ISBN|1402181493}}).\n\n==Personal life==\nOn August 21, 1854 he married Letitia Neill in [[Belfast]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Ireland]], who proved to be a great support to her husband\u2019s social reform efforts. Letitia's father, Robert Neill, was an avid abolitionist and he opened his home to some of the world's most famous anti-slavery orators, including [[Frederick Douglass]]. He died at Campfer, Tirol, on August 11, 1890.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Brace, Charles Loring}}</ref>\n\nFamily includes son, Charles Loring Brace Jr. (Yale, 1876) and CAS board secretary,<ref name=\"2Yalies\" /> grandson, [[Gerald Warner Brace]] (1901\u20131978) American writer, educator, sailor and boat builder, and great-grandson, [[C.

Harrington's caucus supported [[George McGovern]]'s call for a cease-fire and immediate withdrawal from Vietnam. In contrast to the traditional emphasis on strengthening the working class by organizing labor unions, Harrington reduced the emphasis on labor of previous socialist organizations. While continuing to work with unionists, Harrington instead placed more emphasis on middle-class political activists, especially those drawn to activism through the McGovern campaign. Developing a \"realignment\" strategy common to socialists since the 1960s, the DSOC tried to help to build a \"democratic left\" movement from the political movements participating in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\nIn 1982, the DSOC merged with the [[New American Movement]] to form the [[Democratic Socialists of America]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\n{{main article|Socialist Party of America}}\nAfter nearly a decade of internal acrimony, the [[Social Democratic Federation (United States)|Socialist Party of America-Social Democratic Federation]] was clearly headed for a split as the decade of the 1970s opened. While sharing a common antipathy to the worldwide [[Communism|Communist]] movement, the organization was divided over two primary issues:\n# Should democratic socialists call for either an immediate withdrawal of United States forces from Vietnam or a negotiated peace settlement along with an immediate end to the bombing of North Vietnam?\n# Should the democratic left continue its traditional focus of organizing the [[working class]] in [[labor unions]] or should it shift its focus to (predominantly middle class) peace activists?\n\n==== 1972 Convention of the Socialist Party of America ====\n{{See also|Social Democrats, USA}}\nIn its 1972 convention, the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA) had two Co-Chairmen, [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Charles S. Zimmerman]] of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU);<ref name=\"Sorin149\">Gerald Sorin, ''The Prophetic Minority: American Jewish Immigrant Radicals, 1880-1920.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985; pg. 155.</ref> and a First National Vice Chairman, James S. Glaser, who were re-elected by [[acclamation]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> In his opening speech to the Convention, Co-Chairman Bayard Rustin called for [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA) to organize against the \"reactionary policies of the Nixon Administration\" while at the same time criticized the \"irresponsibility and \u00e9litism of the 'New Politics' liberals\".<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/>\n\nThe party changed its name to SDUSA by a vote of 73 to 34.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">\n* {{cite news|title=Socialist Party now the Social Democrats, U.S.A.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 31, 1972|page=36|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html|accessdate=February 8, 2010|ref=harv}}\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on the 1972 Convention on other days, e.g.\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists defeat motion favoring recognition of Cuba|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 28, 1972|page=15|last=Johnston|first=Laurie|ref=harv|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/28/archives/young-socialists-defeat-motion-favoring-recognition-of-cuba.html?sq=Young+socialists&scp=4&st=p}}\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists support Meany; Group urges the Democrats to join labor movement|date=December 31, 1972|page=36|last=Johnston|first=Laurie|ref=harv|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/young-socialist-support-meany-group-urges-the-democrats-to-join.html?sq=Young+socialists&scp=11&st=p|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Renaming the party as SDUSA was meant to be \"realistic\". ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that the SPA had last sponsored a [[Darlington Hoopes|candidate for President]] in [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only 6 states. Because the party no longer sponsored candidates in presidential elections, the name \"Party\" had been \"misleading\" as \"Party\" had hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party, according to the majority report. The name \"Socialist\" was replaced by \"[[Social democracy|Social Democrats]]\" because many American associated the word \"[[Democratic socialism|socialism]]\" with [[Soviet Communism]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> The party also wished to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties, the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]].<ref name=\"NYT27\">{{cite news|title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New&nbsp;Politics' split|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 27, 1972|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/27/archives/young-socialists-open-parley-to-weigh-new-politics-split.html?sq=Young+socialists&scp=7&st=p}}</ref>\n\nDuring the convention, the majority (Unity Caucus) won every vote by a ratio of two to one. The convention elected a national committee of 33 members, with 22 seats for the majority caucus, eight seats for the Coalition Caucus of [[Michael Harrington]], two for a Debs Caucus and one for the independent [[Samuel H. Friedman]].<ref name=\"NYT73\">{{cite news|title='Firmness' urged on <!-- CAPITALIZED! -->Communists: Social Democrats reach end of U.S. Convention here|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1973|page=11|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C15F73F551A7493C3A9178AD85F478785F9|ref=harv}}</ref> Friedman and the minority caucuses had opposed the name change.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/>\n\nThe convention voted on and adopted proposals for its program by a two-one vote. On foreign policy, the program called for \"firmness toward Communist aggression\". However, on the Vietnam War the program opposed \"any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission\" and instead it endorsed negotiating a peace agreement, which should protect Communist political cadres in South Vietnam from further military or police reprisals. Harrington's proposal for a [[ceasefire]] and [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|immediate withdrawal]] of United States forces was defeated.<!--  A Vice Chairman of the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL), [[Carl Gershman]] introduced the international program that was approved. --><ref name=\"NYT73\"/> Harrington complained that after its convention the Socialist Party had endorsed [[George McGovern]] only with a  statement loaded with \"constructive criticism\" and that it had not mobilized enough support for McGovern. The majority caucus's Arch Puddington replied that the California branch was especially active in supporting McGovern while the New York branch were focusing on a congressional race.<ref name=\"NYT27 \"/>\n\n=== Foundation ===\n{{see also|Socialist Party USA}}\nEven before the convention, [[Michael Harrington]] had resigned as an Honorary Chairperson of the SPA.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Some months after the convention, he resigned his membership in SDUSA. Harrington and his supporters from the Coalition Caucus soon formed the DSOC. Many members of the Debs Caucus resigned from SDUSA and formed the [[Socialist Party USA]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Despite opposing the majority of the SPA, Harrington acknowledged the validity of its members' concerns: <blockquote>The anti-war activists of the sixties were overwhelmingly white and middle class. Many of them were unconcerned about the domestic political consequences of their actions and were even contemptuous of that majority of Americans who supported the war. There was a profoundly elitist tendency in the movement that [the majority of the Socialist Party leadership] denounced as dilettantish and collegiate. Moreover, there was a vocal, and regularly televised, fringe of confrontationists, exhibitionists, and [[Vietcong]] flag wavers who could plausibly be dismissed as freakish, or sinister, or both.<ref name=\"Harrington, Fragments\">Harrington, ''Fragments of the Century,'' pp. 212\u2013213.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHarrington's caucus in the SPA endorsed the [[New Politics (1950s)|New Politics movement]] and sought to expand that tendency into a viable left-wing pressure-group within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], advancing an explicitly socialist agenda and attempting to win influence over elected officials for that program. Harrington led many members of this caucus and from his networks to establish the DSOC in 1973.\n\nHarrington, a former editor of the SPA's weekly newspaper, ''New America'',<ref>Michael Harrington, ''Fragments of the Century.'' New York: Saturday Review Press/E.P. Dutton & Co., 1973; pg. 199.</ref> was the most important figure in the establishment of DSOC. Harrington had resigned as National Co-Chairman of the SPA, many of whose leaders criticized McGovern, when Harrington focused his efforts on electing McGovern in October 1972.<ref>Harrington, ''Fragments of the Century,'' pg. 195.</ref>\n\nIn his first memoir, published in 1973, Harrington defended his choice of peace activists over trade unionists: <blockquote>But in their derogatory comparison of this movement with the trade unionists, my comrades failed to notice two of its historic aspects. First, the anti-war young were right: Vietnam was not only an immoral conflict, it was counterproductive from all points of view, including that of progressive anti-Communism. Secondly, the new strata of the issue-oriented and college-educated who provided the mass bass for this phenomenon were, and are, extremely important to the creation of a new majority for change in this country.<ref name=\"Harrington, Fragments\"/></blockquote>\n\nAt its start, the DSOC had 840 members, of which 2 percent served on its national board; approximately 200 had previously had membership in the SDUSA or its predecessors<!-- (the [[Socialist Party of America#Max_Shachtman.2C_Civil_Rights.2C_and_the_War_on_Poverty|Socialist Party Social Democratic Federation]], \"formerly the Socialist Party, USA\"), --> in 1973 when SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800, according to a 1973 profile of Harrington.<ref>{{harvtxt|O'Rourke|1993|pp=195\u2013196}}: {{cite book|last=O'Rourke|first=William|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5iUJfPxlTCcC&pg=PA195|chapter=L: Michael Harrington|title=Signs of the literary times: Essays, reviews, profiles, 1970-1992'|pages=192\u2013196|publisher=SUNY Press|series=The Margins of Literature (SUNY Series)|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1681-X|id={{ISBN|9780791416815}}|ref=harv}}\nOriginally: {{cite journal|last=O'Rourke|first=William|title=Michael Harrington: Beyond Watergate, Sixties, and reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5iUJfPxlTCcC&pg=PA197&dq=%22Socialist+Party%22+OR+%22Social+Democrats%22,+%22Michael+Harrington%22,+%22New+York+Times%22&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q=Michael%20Harrington&f=false|pages=6\u20137|journal=SoHo Weekly News|volume=3|number=2|date=November 13, 1973|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nThe publication that would eventually become the official organ of the DSOC, initially an eight-page letter-sized monthly called ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left,'' predated the formal establishment of the DSOC as a national organization in October 1973. The first issue of ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left'' (the name was later shortened to ''Democratic Left'') appeared in March 1973 under the editorship of Mike Harrington, assisted by Jack Clark as Managing Editor.<ref name=\"DL001\">[http://www.marxisthistory.org/history/usa/parties/dsa/1973/0300-dsoc-dl001.pdf ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left], vol. 1, no. 1 (March 1973).</ref> A front page essay by Harrington, entitled \"The Shape of Our Politics\", made nary a mention of the bitter faction fight within the SPA: <blockquote>Liberalism is in transition. Important ideologists announce their 'deradicalization.'\n\nOn the other wing, many trade unionists and middle-class liberals have become aware of the need for structural change in our society. In the McGovern campaign, for instance, the frankly [[Redistribution of wealth|redistributionist]] principle that revenue should be raised by levies on [[unearned income]]s was a major step forward.\n\nOn the campus there is a decline of activism, a revival of private concerns. The [[New Left]] is dead. But a large and serious constituency of the Left remains, even if unorganized and uncertain. If presented with a clear and reasoned perspective for basic change, it might be won to a lifetime commitment, even in the Nixon years; if not, it could vanish.\n\nThe Left, more than ever before, needs thought, self-criticism, candor, and communication. We hope this ''Newsletter'' will make a modest contribution to that end.<ref name=\"DL001\" /></blockquote>\n\n''Democratic Left'' continues today as the publication of the [[Democratic Socialists of America]], the organizational successor to the DSOC. The organization also published a number of issues of an internal discussion bulletin, containing typewritten content submitted by its members about various issues of concern.\n\n=== Formal establishment ===\nThe June 1973 issue of ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left,'' the fourth monthly magazine off the press, announced to its subscribers that the never-before-mentioned National Board of the DSOC had issued a call for the launch of \"a new, nationwide socialist organization\".<ref name=\"Journey\">[http://www.marxisthistory.org/history/usa/parties/dsa/1973/0600-dsoc-dl004.pdf \"The Journey of Ten Thousand Miles,\"] ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left,'' vol. 1, no. 4 (June 1973), pg. 6.</ref> The founding convention of the DSOC was initially slated to begin on October 12, 1973 in New York City.<ref name=\"Journey\"/> For the first time, membership dues were solicited, with rates of $3.50 for students and $7.00 for regular membership accepted until January 1, 1974.<ref name=\"Journey\"/>\n\nThe Founding Convention was to be a three-day-long affair, beginning at 8 pm at the Eisner and Lubin Auditorium of [[New York University]].<ref name=\"New\">[http://www.marxisthistory.org/history/usa/parties/dsa/1973/1000-dsoc-dl006.pdf \"A New Beginning for American Socialism,\"] ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left,'' vol. 1, no. 6 (October 1973), pg. 6.</ref> The convention was not composed of elected delegates, but was rather open to a general admission and about 500 people were in attendance.<ref>Michael Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner: An Autobiography.'' New York: Henry Holt & Co., 1988; pg. 17.</ref> The keynote speaker chosen by the organizers of the DSOC to address this gathering was [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], one of the key architects of the [[New Democratic Party]], the [[social-democratic]] parliamentary opposition party of Canada.<ref name=\"New\"/>\n\nThe following day on October 13, the convention moved to the [[McAlpin Hotel]], located at the corner of Broadway and 34th Street in New York City and began in earnest. Harrington delivered an address to those attending the gathering which was undelegated and open to all desiring to attend from the general public and then the attendees broke up into various small workshops.<ref name=\"New\"/> Small group subjects included \"the unions\", \"[[feminism]]\", \"racial equality\", \"Democratic Party\", \"equality\" and \"[[detente]]\".<ref name=\"New\" /> Workshop chairs were appointed in advance and included [[Michael Walzer]], Bogdan Denitch, [[Christopher Lasch]] and others.<ref name=\"New\"/> A panel discussion on \"Socialism and the Welfare State\" was also held, featuring prominently Harrington's close political associate, the historian and magazine editor [[Irving Howe]], an individual who would become one of the organization's leading faces.<ref name=\"New\"/>\n\nThe final day saw the election of a governing National Board and ratification of a constitution for the new organization.<ref name=\"New\"/>\n\n=== Membership size and structure ===\nAccording to the group's founder [[Michael Harrington]], the DSOC began with a core of about 250 members.<ref name=\"LD19\">Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner,'' pg. 19.</ref> The group's first paid staffer was Jack Clark, a 23-year-old from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] who received $50 a month and use of a spare bed in the home of Debbie Meier, herself a second generation socialist and important figure in the DSOC inner circle.<ref name=\"LD19\"/> Meier's home served as the group's base of operations up to the October 1973 convention, at which time the DSOC rented a tiny basement office.<ref>Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner,'' pg. 23.</ref>\n\n== Ideology and strategy ==\nThe DSOC presented itself as an explicitly socialist organization. In electoral politics, it worked within the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in which it dedicated itself to building a base of support for democratic-socialist (\"democratic-left\") ideas. In [[Michael Harrington]]'s view, the task facing the American movement was \"to build a new American majority for social change\".<ref name=\"Realism\">Michael Harrington, \"The Left Wing of Realism,\" ''Democratic Left,'' vol. 1, no. 1 (March 1973), pg. 5.</ref> While important, Harrington wrote that the union movement could not win political power in its own right, instead arguing that it needed to unite with the \"college-educated and issue-oriented\" adherents of the so-called \"[[New Politics (1950s)|New Politics]]\" in the Democratic Party: <blockquote>In 1968, the Center-Right of [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] and [[George Wallace|Wallace]] received almost 58% of the votes; in 1972, in a two-way race, Nixon got over 61%. In 1968, the American unions were a major, and sometimes sole, force behind [[Hubert Humphrey]], proving that the organized workers are the most cohesive element that can be mobilized for social change. But the '68 election also proved that labor by itself cannot come close to winning. [...] In 1968 many [[Eugene McCarthy|McCarthyites]] did not understand that Humphrey was infinitely preferable to Nixon; in 1972, the [[George Meany|Meanyites]] did not understand that McGovern was infinitely preferable to Nixon.\n\nIf this split continues, the [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republicans]] will hold the Presidency for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the only way to build a new majority for social change is for labor and the new politics to come together.<ref name=\"Realism\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe DSOC proposed  winning power through the tactic of \"realignment\", i.e. uniting of forces within the Democratic Party on a democratic socialist platform.\n\nIts members ran for political office almost always within the Democratic Party. In addition, the DSOC publicized and promoted the individual efforts of its dues payers and supporters, many of whom were active in labor unions or other political organizations. There were members of the DSOC who were elected to the [[United States Congress|Congress]] ([[Berkeley, California]] Rep. [[Ron Dellums]]) and the [[New York City Council]] ([[Ruth Messinger]]). The DSOC had public support from [[Labor unions|union]] leaders as [[Victor Reuther]] of the [[United Auto Workers]], [[William W. Winpisinger]] of the [[International Association of Machinists]] and various officials of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]].\n\n== Democratic Socialists of America ==\nThe DSOC ceased to exist in 1982 when it merged with the [[New American Movement]] (NAM) to form the [[Democratic Socialists of America]] (DSA).\n\nDiscussions with representatives of the NAM, a successor organization to [[Students for a Democratic Society]], began as early as 1977.<ref name=\"LD64\">Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner,'' pg. 64.</ref> The move was favored by the DSOC's left-wing led by historian Jim Chapin which sought to bring into the DSOC many former participants in the [[New Left]] of the 1960s who were in search of a new home.<ref name=\"LD64\"/> The DSOC formally endorsed the idea of merger with the NAM at its 1979 Houston convention.<ref name=\"LD65\">Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner,'' pg. 65.</ref>\n\nHowever, the proposal for merger generated vocal opposition. Forces on the organization's right-wing, led by Howe and calling themselves the Committee Against the NAM Merger (CATNAM), urged that instead of courting New Left survivors. the DSOC should instead continue to place its emphasis on outreach to larger forces in the labor movement and the Democratic Party. In addition to noting the NAM's deep distrust of the Democratic Party, many adherents of the CATNAM had grave misgivings about the NAM's position towards [[Israel]], with the DSOC maintaining belief in a [[two-state solution]] guaranteeing the existence of Israel while many in the NAM saw the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] as engaged in an [[Anti-colonial liberation movements|anti-colonial liberation]] struggle.<ref name=\"LD65\"/> Ultimately, a careful statement was worked out on the Middle East based upon a two-state solution and merger talks moved forward.\n\nThe 1981 DSOC National Convention was marked by a very heated debate on the question of merger with the NAM, which was ultimately resolved by a vote of approximately 80% of the delegates in favor and none against, with the 20% or so supporting the CATNAM position abstaining.<ref  name=\"LD66\">Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner,'' pg. 66.</ref> Harrington later noted: \"Our opponents wanted to indicate they were unhappy \u2014 and that they were staying\".<ref  name=\"LD66\"/>\n\nThe unity convention joining the NAM and the DSOC was held in Detroit in 1982 and the DSA was thereby established. The gathering was addressed by [[George W. Crockett, Jr.|George Crockett]], a member of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], with Harrington delivering the keynote address.<ref  name=\"LD66\"/> The new organization claimed a membership of 6,000 at the time of its formation.<ref  name=\"LD66\"/>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=demleft ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left''].

Harrington's caucus supported [[George McGovern]]'s call for a cease-fire and immediate withdrawal from Vietnam. In contrast to the traditional emphasis on strengthening the working class by organizing labor unions, Harrington reduced the emphasis on labor of previous socialist organizations. While continuing to work with unionists, Harrington instead placed more emphasis on middle-class political activists, especially those drawn to activism through the McGovern campaign. Developing a \"realignment\" strategy common to socialists since the 1960s, the DSOC tried to help to build a \"democratic left\" movement from the political movements participating in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\nIn 1982, the DSOC merged with the [[New American Movement]] to form the [[Democratic Socialists of America]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\n{{main article|Socialist Party of America}}\nAfter nearly a decade of internal acrimony, the [[Social Democratic Federation (United States)|Socialist Party of America-Social Democratic Federation]] was clearly headed for a split as the decade of the 1970s opened. While sharing a common antipathy to the worldwide [[Communism|Communist]] movement, the organization was divided over two primary issues:\n# Should democratic socialists call for either an immediate withdrawal of United States forces from Vietnam or a negotiated peace settlement along with an immediate end to the bombing of North Vietnam?\n# Should the democratic left continue its traditional focus of organizing the [[working class]] in [[labor unions]] or should it shift its focus to (predominantly middle class) peace activists?\n\n==== 1972 Convention of the Socialist Party of America ====\n{{See also|Social Democrats, USA}}\nIn its 1972 convention, the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA) had two Co-Chairmen, [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Charles S. Zimmerman]] of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU);<ref name=\"Sorin149\">Gerald Sorin, ''The Prophetic Minority: American Jewish Immigrant Radicals, 1880-1920.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985; pg. 155.</ref> and a First National Vice Chairman, James S. Glaser, who were re-elected by [[acclamation]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> In his opening speech to the Convention, Co-Chairman Bayard Rustin called for [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA) to organize against the \"reactionary policies of the Nixon Administration\" while at the same time criticized the \"irresponsibility and \u00e9litism of the 'New Politics' liberals\".<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/>\n\nThe party changed its name to SDUSA by a vote of 73 to 34.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">\n* {{cite news|title=Socialist Party now the Social Democrats, U.S.A.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 31, 1972|page=36|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html|accessdate=February 8, 2010|ref=harv}}\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on the 1972 Convention on other days, e.g.\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists defeat motion favoring recognition of Cuba|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 28, 1972|page=15|last=Johnston|first=Laurie|ref=harv|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/28/archives/young-socialists-defeat-motion-favoring-recognition-of-cuba.html?sq=Young+socialists&scp=4&st=p}}\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists support Meany; Group urges the Democrats to join labor movement|date=December 31, 1972|page=36|last=Johnston|first=Laurie|ref=harv|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/young-socialist-support-meany-group-urges-the-democrats-to-join.html?sq=Young+socialists&scp=11&st=p|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Renaming the party as SDUSA was meant to be \"realistic\". ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that the SPA had last sponsored a [[Darlington Hoopes|candidate for President]] in [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only 6 states. Because the party no longer sponsored candidates in presidential elections, the name \"Party\" had been \"misleading\" as \"Party\" had hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party, according to the majority report. The name \"Socialist\" was replaced by \"[[Social democracy|Social Democrats]]\" because many American associated the word \"[[Democratic socialism|socialism]]\" with [[Soviet Communism]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> The party also wished to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties, the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]].<ref name=\"NYT27\">{{cite news|title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New&nbsp;Politics' split|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 27, 1972|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/27/archives/young-socialists-open-parley-to-weigh-new-politics-split.html?sq=Young+socialists&scp=7&st=p}}</ref>\n\nDuring the convention, the majority (Unity Caucus) won every vote by a ratio of two to one. The convention elected a national committee of 33 members, with 22 seats for the majority caucus, eight seats for the Coalition Caucus of [[Michael Harrington]], two for a Debs Caucus and one for the independent [[Samuel H. Friedman]].<ref name=\"NYT73\">{{cite news|title='Firmness' urged on <!-- CAPITALIZED! -->Communists: Social Democrats reach end of U.S. Convention here|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1973|page=11|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C15F73F551A7493C3A9178AD85F478785F9|ref=harv}}</ref> Friedman and the minority caucuses had opposed the name change.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/>\n\nThe convention voted on and adopted proposals for its program by a two-one vote. On foreign policy, the program called for \"firmness toward Communist aggression\". However, on the Vietnam War the program opposed \"any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission\" and instead it endorsed negotiating a peace agreement, which should protect Communist political cadres in South Vietnam from further military or police reprisals. Harrington's proposal for a [[ceasefire]] and [[immediate withdrawal]] of United States forces was defeated.<!--  A Vice Chairman of the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL), [[Carl Gershman]] introduced the international program that was approved. --><ref name=\"NYT73\"/> Harrington complained that after its convention the Socialist Party had endorsed [[George McGovern]] only with a  statement loaded with \"constructive criticism\" and that it had not mobilized enough support for McGovern. The majority caucus's Arch Puddington replied that the California branch was especially active in supporting McGovern while the New York branch were focusing on a congressional race.<ref name=\"NYT27 \"/>\n\n=== Foundation ===\n{{see also|Socialist Party USA}}\nEven before the convention, [[Michael Harrington]] had resigned as an Honorary Chairperson of the SPA.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Some months after the convention, he resigned his membership in SDUSA. Harrington and his supporters from the Coalition Caucus soon formed the DSOC. Many members of the Debs Caucus resigned from SDUSA and formed the [[Socialist Party USA]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Despite opposing the majority of the SPA, Harrington acknowledged the validity of its members' concerns: <blockquote>The anti-war activists of the sixties were overwhelmingly white and middle class. Many of them were unconcerned about the domestic political consequences of their actions and were even contemptuous of that majority of Americans who supported the war. There was a profoundly elitist tendency in the movement that [the majority of the Socialist Party leadership] denounced as dilettantish and collegiate. Moreover, there was a vocal, and regularly televised, fringe of confrontationists, exhibitionists, and [[Vietcong]] flag wavers who could plausibly be dismissed as freakish, or sinister, or both.<ref name=\"Harrington, Fragments\">Harrington, ''Fragments of the Century,'' pp. 212\u2013213.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHarrington's caucus in the SPA endorsed the [[New Politics (1950s)|New Politics movement]] and sought to expand that tendency into a viable left-wing pressure-group within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], advancing an explicitly socialist agenda and attempting to win influence over elected officials for that program. Harrington led many members of this caucus and from his networks to establish the DSOC in 1973.\n\nHarrington, a former editor of the SPA's weekly newspaper, ''New America'',<ref>Michael Harrington, ''Fragments of the Century.'' New York: Saturday Review Press/E.P. Dutton & Co., 1973; pg. 199.</ref> was the most important figure in the establishment of DSOC. Harrington had resigned as National Co-Chairman of the SPA, many of whose leaders criticized McGovern, when Harrington focused his efforts on electing McGovern in October 1972.<ref>Harrington, ''Fragments of the Century,'' pg. 195.</ref>\n\nIn his first memoir, published in 1973, Harrington defended his choice of peace activists over trade unionists: <blockquote>But in their derogatory comparison of this movement with the trade unionists, my comrades failed to notice two of its historic aspects. First, the anti-war young were right: Vietnam was not only an immoral conflict, it was counterproductive from all points of view, including that of progressive anti-Communism. Secondly, the new strata of the issue-oriented and college-educated who provided the mass bass for this phenomenon were, and are, extremely important to the creation of a new majority for change in this country.<ref name=\"Harrington, Fragments\"/></blockquote>\n\nAt its start, the DSOC had 840 members, of which 2 percent served on its national board; approximately 200 had previously had membership in the SDUSA or its predecessors<!-- (the [[Socialist Party of America#Max_Shachtman.2C_Civil_Rights.2C_and_the_War_on_Poverty|Socialist Party Social Democratic Federation]], \"formerly the Socialist Party, USA\"), --> in 1973 when SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800, according to a 1973 profile of Harrington.<ref>{{harvtxt|O'Rourke|1993|pp=195\u2013196}}: {{cite book|last=O'Rourke|first=William|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5iUJfPxlTCcC&pg=PA195|chapter=L: Michael Harrington|title=Signs of the literary times: Essays, reviews, profiles, 1970-1992'|pages=192\u2013196|publisher=SUNY Press|series=The Margins of Literature (SUNY Series)|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1681-X|id={{ISBN|9780791416815}}|ref=harv}}\nOriginally: {{cite journal|last=O'Rourke|first=William|title=Michael Harrington: Beyond Watergate, Sixties, and reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5iUJfPxlTCcC&pg=PA197&dq=%22Socialist+Party%22+OR+%22Social+Democrats%22,+%22Michael+Harrington%22,+%22New+York+Times%22&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q=Michael%20Harrington&f=false|pages=6\u20137|journal=SoHo Weekly News|volume=3|number=2|date=November 13, 1973|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nThe publication that would eventually become the official organ of the DSOC, initially an eight-page letter-sized monthly called ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left,'' predated the formal establishment of the DSOC as a national organization in October 1973. The first issue of ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left'' (the name was later shortened to ''Democratic Left'') appeared in March 1973 under the editorship of Mike Harrington, assisted by Jack Clark as Managing Editor.<ref name=\"DL001\">[http://www.marxisthistory.org/history/usa/parties/dsa/1973/0300-dsoc-dl001.pdf ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left], vol. 1, no. 1 (March 1973).</ref> A front page essay by Harrington, entitled \"The Shape of Our Politics\", made nary a mention of the bitter faction fight within the SPA: <blockquote>Liberalism is in transition. Important ideologists announce their 'deradicalization.'\n\nOn the other wing, many trade unionists and middle-class liberals have become aware of the need for structural change in our society. In the McGovern campaign, for instance, the frankly [[Redistribution of wealth|redistributionist]] principle that revenue should be raised by levies on [[unearned income]]s was a major step forward.\n\nOn the campus there is a decline of activism, a revival of private concerns. The [[New Left]] is dead. But a large and serious constituency of the Left remains, even if unorganized and uncertain. If presented with a clear and reasoned perspective for basic change, it might be won to a lifetime commitment, even in the Nixon years; if not, it could vanish.\n\nThe Left, more than ever before, needs thought, self-criticism, candor, and communication. We hope this ''Newsletter'' will make a modest contribution to that end.<ref name=\"DL001\" /></blockquote>\n\n''Democratic Left'' continues today as the publication of the [[Democratic Socialists of America]], the organizational successor to the DSOC. The organization also published a number of issues of an internal discussion bulletin, containing typewritten content submitted by its members about various issues of concern.\n\n=== Formal establishment ===\nThe June 1973 issue of ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left,'' the fourth monthly magazine off the press, announced to its subscribers that the never-before-mentioned National Board of the DSOC had issued a call for the launch of \"a new, nationwide socialist organization\".<ref name=\"Journey\">[http://www.marxisthistory.org/history/usa/parties/dsa/1973/0600-dsoc-dl004.pdf \"The Journey of Ten Thousand Miles,\"] ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left,'' vol. 1, no. 4 (June 1973), pg. 6.</ref> The founding convention of the DSOC was initially slated to begin on October 12, 1973 in New York City.<ref name=\"Journey\"/> For the first time, membership dues were solicited, with rates of $3.50 for students and $7.00 for regular membership accepted until January 1, 1974.<ref name=\"Journey\"/>\n\nThe Founding Convention was to be a three-day-long affair, beginning at 8 pm at the Eisner and Lubin Auditorium of [[New York University]].<ref name=\"New\">[http://www.marxisthistory.org/history/usa/parties/dsa/1973/1000-dsoc-dl006.pdf \"A New Beginning for American Socialism,\"] ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left,'' vol. 1, no. 6 (October 1973), pg. 6.</ref> The convention was not composed of elected delegates, but was rather open to a general admission and about 500 people were in attendance.<ref>Michael Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner: An Autobiography.'' New York: Henry Holt & Co., 1988; pg. 17.</ref> The keynote speaker chosen by the organizers of the DSOC to address this gathering was [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], one of the key architects of the [[New Democratic Party]], the [[social-democratic]] parliamentary opposition party of Canada.<ref name=\"New\"/>\n\nThe following day on October 13, the convention moved to the [[McAlpin Hotel]], located at the corner of Broadway and 34th Street in New York City and began in earnest. Harrington delivered an address to those attending the gathering which was undelegated and open to all desiring to attend from the general public and then the attendees broke up into various small workshops.<ref name=\"New\"/> Small group subjects included \"the unions\", \"[[feminism]]\", \"racial equality\", \"Democratic Party\", \"equality\" and \"[[detente]]\".<ref name=\"New\" /> Workshop chairs were appointed in advance and included [[Michael Walzer]], Bogdan Denitch, [[Christopher Lasch]] and others.<ref name=\"New\"/> A panel discussion on \"Socialism and the Welfare State\" was also held, featuring prominently Harrington's close political associate, the historian and magazine editor [[Irving Howe]], an individual who would become one of the organization's leading faces.<ref name=\"New\"/>\n\nThe final day saw the election of a governing National Board and ratification of a constitution for the new organization.<ref name=\"New\"/>\n\n=== Membership size and structure ===\nAccording to the group's founder [[Michael Harrington]], the DSOC began with a core of about 250 members.<ref name=\"LD19\">Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner,'' pg. 19.</ref> The group's first paid staffer was Jack Clark, a 23-year-old from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] who received $50 a month and use of a spare bed in the home of Debbie Meier, herself a second generation socialist and important figure in the DSOC inner circle.<ref name=\"LD19\"/> Meier's home served as the group's base of operations up to the October 1973 convention, at which time the DSOC rented a tiny basement office.<ref>Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner,'' pg. 23.</ref>\n\n== Ideology and strategy ==\nThe DSOC presented itself as an explicitly socialist organization. In electoral politics, it worked within the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in which it dedicated itself to building a base of support for democratic-socialist (\"democratic-left\") ideas. In [[Michael Harrington]]'s view, the task facing the American movement was \"to build a new American majority for social change\".<ref name=\"Realism\">Michael Harrington, \"The Left Wing of Realism,\" ''Democratic Left,'' vol. 1, no. 1 (March 1973), pg. 5.</ref> While important, Harrington wrote that the union movement could not win political power in its own right, instead arguing that it needed to unite with the \"college-educated and issue-oriented\" adherents of the so-called \"[[New Politics (1950s)|New Politics]]\" in the Democratic Party: <blockquote>In 1968, the Center-Right of [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] and [[George Wallace|Wallace]] received almost 58% of the votes; in 1972, in a two-way race, Nixon got over 61%. In 1968, the American unions were a major, and sometimes sole, force behind [[Hubert Humphrey]], proving that the organized workers are the most cohesive element that can be mobilized for social change. But the '68 election also proved that labor by itself cannot come close to winning. [...] In 1968 many [[Eugene McCarthy|McCarthyites]] did not understand that Humphrey was infinitely preferable to Nixon; in 1972, the [[George Meany|Meanyites]] did not understand that McGovern was infinitely preferable to Nixon.\n\nIf this split continues, the [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republicans]] will hold the Presidency for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the only way to build a new majority for social change is for labor and the new politics to come together.<ref name=\"Realism\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe DSOC proposed  winning power through the tactic of \"realignment\", i.e. uniting of forces within the Democratic Party on a democratic socialist platform.\n\nIts members ran for political office almost always within the Democratic Party. In addition, the DSOC publicized and promoted the individual efforts of its dues payers and supporters, many of whom were active in labor unions or other political organizations. There were members of the DSOC who were elected to the [[United States Congress|Congress]] ([[Berkeley, California]] Rep. [[Ron Dellums]]) and the [[New York City Council]] ([[Ruth Messinger]]). The DSOC had public support from [[Labor unions|union]] leaders as [[Victor Reuther]] of the [[United Auto Workers]], [[William W. Winpisinger]] of the [[International Association of Machinists]] and various officials of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]].\n\n== Democratic Socialists of America ==\nThe DSOC ceased to exist in 1982 when it merged with the [[New American Movement]] (NAM) to form the [[Democratic Socialists of America]] (DSA).\n\nDiscussions with representatives of the NAM, a successor organization to [[Students for a Democratic Society]], began as early as 1977.<ref name=\"LD64\">Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner,'' pg. 64.</ref> The move was favored by the DSOC's left-wing led by historian Jim Chapin which sought to bring into the DSOC many former participants in the [[New Left]] of the 1960s who were in search of a new home.<ref name=\"LD64\"/> The DSOC formally endorsed the idea of merger with the NAM at its 1979 Houston convention.<ref name=\"LD65\">Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner,'' pg. 65.</ref>\n\nHowever, the proposal for merger generated vocal opposition. Forces on the organization's right-wing, led by Howe and calling themselves the Committee Against the NAM Merger (CATNAM), urged that instead of courting New Left survivors. the DSOC should instead continue to place its emphasis on outreach to larger forces in the labor movement and the Democratic Party. In addition to noting the NAM's deep distrust of the Democratic Party, many adherents of the CATNAM had grave misgivings about the NAM's position towards [[Israel]], with the DSOC maintaining belief in a [[two-state solution]] guaranteeing the existence of Israel while many in the NAM saw the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] as engaged in an [[Anti-colonial liberation movements|anti-colonial liberation]] struggle.<ref name=\"LD65\"/> Ultimately, a careful statement was worked out on the Middle East based upon a two-state solution and merger talks moved forward.\n\nThe 1981 DSOC National Convention was marked by a very heated debate on the question of merger with the NAM, which was ultimately resolved by a vote of approximately 80% of the delegates in favor and none against, with the 20% or so supporting the CATNAM position abstaining.<ref  name=\"LD66\">Harrington, ''The Long-Distance Runner,'' pg. 66.</ref> Harrington later noted: \"Our opponents wanted to indicate they were unhappy \u2014 and that they were staying\".<ref  name=\"LD66\"/>\n\nThe unity convention joining the NAM and the DSOC was held in Detroit in 1982 and the DSA was thereby established. The gathering was addressed by [[George W. Crockett, Jr.|George Crockett]], a member of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], with Harrington delivering the keynote address.<ref  name=\"LD66\"/> The new organization claimed a membership of 6,000 at the time of its formation.<ref  name=\"LD66\"/>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=demleft ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left''].
