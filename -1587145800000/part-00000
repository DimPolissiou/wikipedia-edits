On traditional legacy carriers, such operations on the smaller aircraft are mostly [[outsourcing|outsource]]d to smaller, usually independently owned regional airlines.]]\nA '''mainline flight''' is a flight operated by an airline's main operating unit, rather than by regional alliances, regional code-shares, regional subsidiaries, or wholly owned subsidiaries offering low-cost operations. '''Mainline carriers''' typically operate between [[Airline hub|hub airports]] within their network and on international or long-haul services, using [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body]] and [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] aircraft. This is in contrast to [[regional airline]]s, providing feeder services to hub airports operating smaller [[turboprop]] or [[regional jet]] aircraft, or [[low-cost carrier]] subsidiaries serving leisure markets.\n\nIn the United States, examples of mainline [[passenger airline]] flights include those operated by [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[United Airlines]]; but not flights operated by [[regional airline]]s [[Envoy Air]], [[Mesa Airlines]], [[Executive Airlines]], [[Piedmont Airlines]], or [[PSA Airlines]] with [[regional jet]]s or the services of [[Regional airline#United States mainline regional brands|regional airline marketing brands]] such as [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]], [[Delta Connection]], or [[United Express]]  aboard lower-capacity narrowbody jets and turboprop aircraft, such as those produced by [[Embraer]] or [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], that do not have transcontinental range.\n\nU.S. [[legacy carriers]] may operate branded mainline services using the same flight crews and [[air operator's certificate|AOC]] as that of their mainline operations. For example, [[United p.s.]] and [[American Flagship Service]] cater to the medium-haul [[Transcontinental flight|transcontinental]] business segment. Short-haul [[air shuttle]]s, such as [[Delta Shuttle]], operate at high frequency intervals between busy [[Busiest city pairs|city pairs]]. Previously, U.S. legacy carriers operated low-cost air services within their mainline operations to compete with [[low-cost carriers]]; these operations were short-lived and included brands such as [[Continental Lite]], [[Song (airline)|Song]] (Delta), and [[Ted (airline)|Ted]] (United). Outside the U.S., low-cost carrier subsidiary airlines are more common, with examples including [[Air Canada Rouge]], [[Jetstar Airways]] (subsidiary of [[Qantas]]), and [[Eurowings]] (subsidiary of [[Lufthansa]]).\n\nAn airline carrier's [[collective bargaining agreement]] with flight crews stipulates the maximum seating capacity of regional aircraft; as such, any aircraft that exceeds this capacity must operate as a mainline flight. The converse is not the case; mainline flight crews, with proper [[type rating]]s, may operate aircraft that are smaller than typical mainline aircraft.\n\n==Mainline Subsidiary Carriers and Airline

On traditional legacy carriers, such operations on the smaller aircraft are mostly [[outsourcing|outsource]]d to smaller, usually independently owned regional airlines.]]\nA '''mainline flight''' is a flight operated by an airline's main operating unit, rather than by regional alliances, regional code-shares, regional subsidiaries, or wholly owned subsidiaries offering low-cost operations. '''Mainline carriers''' typically operate between [[Airline hub|hub airports]] within their network and on international or long-haul services, using [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body]] and [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] aircraft. This is in contrast to [[regional airline]]s, providing feeder services to hub airports operating smaller [[turboprop]] or [[regional jet]] aircraft, or [[low-cost carrier]] subsidiaries serving leisure markets.\n\nIn the United States, examples of mainline [[passenger airline]] flights include those operated by [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[United Airlines]]; but not flights operated by [[regional airline]]s [[Envoy Air]], [[Mesa Airlines]], [[Executive Airlines]], [[Piedmont Airlines]], or [[PSA Airlines]] with [[regional jet]]s or the services of [[Regional airline#United States mainline regional brands|regional airline marketing brands]] such as [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]], [[Delta Connection]], or [[United Express]]  aboard lower-capacity narrowbody jets and turboprop aircraft, such as those produced by [[Embraer]] or [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], that do not have transcontinental range.\n\nU.S. [[legacy carriers]] may operate branded mainline services using the same flight crews and [[air operator's certificate|AOC]] as that of their mainline operations. For example, [[United p.s.]] and [[American Flagship Service]] cater to the medium-haul [[Transcontinental flight|transcontinental]] business segment. Short-haul [[air shuttle]]s, such as [[Delta Shuttle]], operate at high frequency intervals between busy [[Busiest city pairs|city pairs]]. Previously, U.S. legacy carriers operated low-cost air services within their mainline operations to compete with [[low-cost carriers]]; these operations were short-lived and included brands such as [[Continental Lite]], [[Song (airline)|Song]] (Delta), and [[Ted (airline)|Ted]] (United). Outside the U.S., low-cost carrier subsidiary airlines are more common, with examples including [[Air Canada Rouge]], [[Jetstar Airways]] (subsidiary of [[Qantas]]), and [[Eurowings]] (subsidiary of [[Lufthansa]]).\n\nAn airline carrier's [[collective bargaining agreement]] with flight crews stipulates the maximum seating capacity of regional aircraft; as such, any aircraft that exceeds this capacity must operate as a mainline flight. The converse is not the case; mainline flight crews, with proper [[type rating]]s, may operate aircraft that are smaller than typical mainline aircraft.\n\n==Mainline Subsidiary Carriers and Airline
