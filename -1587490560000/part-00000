This allows for various extra movements of trains including storage or removal of a train with mechanical problems to be sent back in the other direction.

The Senate is composed of 24 [[senator]]s who are [[Philippine senatorial elections|elected]]  [[at-large]] with the country as one district under [[plurality-at-large voting]].\n\nSenators serve six-year terms with a maximum of two consecutive terms, with half of the senators elected every three years to ensure that the Senate is maintained as a continuous body, though [[staggered elections|staggered]]. When the Senate was restored by the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]], the 24 senators who were elected in 1987 served until 1992. In 1992 the 12 candidates for the Senate obtaining the highest number of votes served until 1998, while the next 12 served until 1995. Thereafter, each senator elected serves the full six years.\n\nAside from having its concurrence on every bill in order to be passed for the [[President of the Philippines|president]]'s signature to become a law, the Senate is the only body that can concur with [[treaty|treaties]], and can try [[Impeachment in the Philippines|impeachment]] cases. The Senate Presidency is currently held by [[Tito Sotto]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Joint session of Philippine Legislature.jpg|thumbnail|left|Joint session of Philippine Legislature including the newly elected Senate, November 15, 1916]]\n[[Image:Sen. Primcias debates Sen. Paredes.jpg|thumb|left|The post\u2013World War II Philippine Senate in 1951: [[Cipriano P. Primicias, Sr.]], far left, debates [[Quint\u00edn Paredes]], far right. In the middle are Justiniano Montano, [[Mariano Jes\u00fas Cuenco]], Enrique B. Magalona, and Francisco Delgado; in the foreground is Edmundo Cea. Deliberations were once held at the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Legislative Building]].]]\n\nThe Senate has its roots in the [[Philippine Commission]] of the [[Insular Government]].  Under the [[Philippine Organic Act]], from 1907 to 1916, the [[Philippine Commission]] headed by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] served as the upper chamber of the [[Philippine Legislature]], with the [[Philippine Assembly]] as the elected [[lower house]].  At the same time the governor-general also exercised executive powers.\n\nIn August 1916 the [[United States Congress]] enacted the [[Philippine Autonomy Act]] or popularly known as the \"Jones Law\", which created an elected bicameral [[Philippine Legislature]] with the Senate as the [[upper chamber]] and with the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]], previously called the Philippine Assembly, as the [[lower chamber]]. The Governor-General continued to be the head of the [[executive branch]] of the Insular Government.  Senators then were elected via [[Senatorial districts of the Philippines|senatorial districts]] via [[plurality-at-large voting]]; each district grouped several provinces and each elected two senators except for \"non-Christian\" provinces where the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] appointed the senators for the district.\n\nFuture president [[Manuel L. Quezon]], who was then [[Philippine Resident Commissioner]], encouraged future president [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], then [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the House, to run for the leadership of the Senate, but Osme\u00f1a preferred to continue leading the lower house. Quezon then ran for the Senate and became [[Senate President]] serving for 19 years (1916\u20131935).\n\nThis setup continued until 1935, when the [[Philippine Independence Act]] or the \"Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act\" was passed by the [[U.S. Congress]] which granted the Filipinos the right to frame their own constitution in preparation for their independence, wherein they established a unicameral [[National Assembly of the Philippines]], effectively abolishing the Senate. Not long after the adoption of the 1935 Constitution several amendments began to be proposed. By 1938, the National Assembly began consideration of these proposals, which included restoring the Senate as the upper chamber of Congress. The amendment of the 1935 Constitution to have a bicameral legislature was approved in 1940 and the [[1941 Philippine Senate election|first biennial elections]] for the restored upper house was held in November 1941. Instead of the old senatorial districts, senators were elected via the entire country serving as an [[at-large]] district, although still under plurality-at-large voting, with voters voting up to eight candidates, and the eight candidates with the highest number of votes being elected. While the Senate from 1916 to 1935 had exclusive confirmation rights over executive appointments, as part of the compromises that restored the Senate in 1941, the power of confirming executive appointments has been exercised by a joint [[Commission on Appointments (Philippines)|Commission on Appointments]] composed of members of both houses. However, the Senate since its restoration and the independence of the Philippines in 1946 has the power to ratify treaties.\n\nThe Senate finally convened in 1945 and served as the upper chamber of Congress from thereon until the declaration of [[martial law]] by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in 1972, which shut down Congress. The Senate was resurrected in 1987 upon the ratification of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]]. However, instead of eight senators being replaced after every election, it was changed to twelve.\n\nIn the Senate, the officers are the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]], [[President pro tempore of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President ''pro tempore'']], [[Majority leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Majority Floor Leader]], [[Minority leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Minority Floor Leader]] and the Senate Secretary and the Senate Sergeant at Arms who shall be elected by the Senators from among the employees and staff of the Senate. Meanwhile, the Senate President, Senate President pro-tempore, the Majority Floor Leader and the Minority Floor Leader shall be elected by the Senators from among themselves.\n\n==Composition==\n{{see also|Philippine senatorial elections}}\n[[File:Philippine Senate composition.png|thumb|left|200px|Election results from 1916 to the present. Note that some senators may switch to another party mid-term.]]\nArticle VI, Section 2 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] provides that the Senate shall be composed of 24 senators who shall be elected at-large by the qualified voters of the [[Philippines]], as may be provided by law.\n\nThe composition of the Senate is smaller in number as compared to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]]. The members of this chamber are elected at large by the entire electorate. The rationale for this rule intends to make the Senate a training ground for national leaders and possibly a springboard for the [[President of the Philippines|presidency]].\n\nIt follows also that the Senator, having a national rather than only a district constituency, will have a broader outlook of the problems of the country, instead of being restricted by narrow viewpoints and interests. With such perspective, the Senate is likely to be more circumspect, or at least less impulsive, than the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nSenatorial candidates are chosen by the leaders of major political parties or coalitions of parties.  The selection process is not transparent and is done in \"backrooms\" where much political horse-trading occurs.  Thus, the absence of regional or proportional representation in the Senate exacerbates a top heavy system of governance, with power centralized in Metro Manila.  It has often been suggested that each region of the country should elect its own senator(s) to more properly represent the people.  This will have the effect of flattening the power structure.  Regional problems and concerns within a national view can be addressed more effectively.  A senator's performance, accountability, and electability become meaningful to a more defined and identifiable regional constituency.\n\nThe [[Senate Electoral Tribunal]] (SET) composed of three [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] justices and six senators determines election protests on already-seated senators. There had been three instances where the SET has replaced senators due to election protests, the last of which was In 2011 when the tribunal [[Pimentel III vs. Zubiri Senate Electoral Protest|awarded the protest]] of [[Koko Pimentel]] against [[Juan Miguel Zubiri]].<ref name=\"proclamation\">{{cite news|last=Calonzo |first=Andero |title=Pimentel proclaimed 12th winning senator in '07 polls |work=GMA News Online |date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/229132/nation/pimentel-proclaimed-12th-winning-senator-in-07-polls}}</ref>\n\n==Qualifications==\nThe qualifications for membership in the Senate are expressly stated in Section 3, Art. VI of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] as follows:\n\n*No person shall be a Senator unless he is a natural-born citizen of the [[Philippines]], and on the day of the election, is at least 35 years of age, able to read and write, a registered voter, and a resident of the [[Philippines]] for not less than two years immediately preceding the day of the election.\n*The age is fixed at 35 and must be possessed on the day of the elections, that is, when the polls are opened and the votes cast, and not on the day of the proclamation of the winners by the board of canvassers.\n*With regard to the residence requirements, it was ruled in the case of ''Lim v. Pelaez'' that it must be the place where one habitually resides and to which he, after absence, has the intention of returning.\n*The enumeration laid down by the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] is exclusive under the Latin principle of ''[[expressio unius est exclusio alterius]]''. This means that [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] cannot anymore add additional qualifications other than those provided by the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]].\n\n==Organization==\nUnder the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]], \"[[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] shall convene once every year on the fourth Monday of July for its regular session...\". During this time, the Senate is organized to elect its officers. Specifically, the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] provides a definite statement, to it:\n\nThe Senate shall elect its [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|President]] and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] its [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives|Speaker]] by a vote of all its respective members.\n\nEach House shall choose such other officers as it may deem necessary.\n\nBy virtue of these provisions of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]], the Senate adopts its own rules, otherwise known as the \"Rules of the Senate.\" The Rules of the Senate provide the following officers: a [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|President]], a [[President pro tempore of the Senate of the Philippines|President ''pro tempore'']], a Secretary and a Sergeant-at-Arms.\n\nFollowing this set of officers, the Senate as an institution can then be grouped into the Senate Proper and the Secretariat. The former belongs exclusively to the members of the Senate as well as its committees, while the latter renders support services to the members of the Senate.\n\n==Powers==\nThe Senate was modeled upon the [[United States Senate]]; the two chambers of Congress have roughly equal powers, and every bill or resolution that has to go through both houses needs the consent of both chambers before being passed for the president's signature. Once a bill is defeated in the Senate, it is lost. Once a bill is approved by the Senate on [[third reading]], the bill is passed to the House of Representatives, unless an identical bill has also been passed by the lower house. When a counterpart bill in the lower house is different from the one passed by the Senate, either a bicameral conference committee is created consisting of members from both chambers of Congress to reconcile the differences, or either chamber may instead approve the other chamber's version.\n\nWhile [[money bill]]s originate in the House of Representatives, the Senate may still propose or concur with amendments. Only the Senate has the power to approve, via a two-thirds supermajority, or denounce treaties, and the power to try and convict, via a two-thirds supermajority, an impeached official.\n\n==Current members==\n{|width=60% class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" |\n!rowspan=1|[[List of Senators of the Philippines|Senator]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Viray|first1=Patricia Lourdes|title=Comelec proclaims Senate 'Magic 12'|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/05/19/1584838/comelec-proclaims-senate-magic-12|accessdate=19 May 2016|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n!rowspan=1|[[List of political parties in the Philippines|Party]]\n!colspan=1|Number\n!Starts\n!Ends\n|-\n{{party colour|Liberal Party (Philippines)}}\n|align=left|[[Leila de Lima]]\n|[[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]]\n|1\n| rowspan=\"12\" |June 30, 2016\n| rowspan=\"12\" |June 30, 2022\n|-\n{{party colour|Liberal Party (Philippines)}}\n|align=left|[[Franklin Drilon]]\n||[[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]]\n|2\n|-\n{{party colour|Nationalist People's Coalition}}\n|align=left|[[Win Gatchalian]]\n|[[Nationalist People's Coalition|NPC]]\n|1\n|-\n{{party colour|Independent}}\n|align=left|[[Richard J.

When the Legislative Building was ruined in World War II, the House of Representatives temporarily met at the Old Japanese Schoolhouse at Lepanto<ref>{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Quezon Memorial Book|date=1952|publisher=Quezon Memorial Committee}}</ref> (modern-day S.

When President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dissolved Congress in 1972, he built a new legislative complex in [[Quezon City]]. The unicameral parliament known as the [[Batasang Pambansa]] eventually met there in 1978. With the restoration of the bicameral legislature in 1987, the House of Representatives inherited the complex at Quezon City, now called the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], while the Senate returned to the Congress Building, until the GSIS Building was finished In 1997. Thus, the country's two houses of Congress meet at different places in [[Metro Manila]].\n\nThe Senate would eventually move to Navy Village in [[Taguig]] by 2020.

Philippines}}\nThe '''Senate of the Philippines''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Senado ng Pilipinas'', also ''Mataas na Kapulungan ng Pilipinas'' or \"upper chamber\") is the [[upper house]] of the bicameral [[legislature]] of the [[Philippines]], the [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]]; the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] is the [[lower house]]. The Senate is composed of 24 [[senator]]s who are [[Philippine senatorial elections|elected]]  [[at-large]] with the country as one district under [[plurality-at-large voting]].\n\nSenators serve six-year terms with a maximum of two consecutive terms, with half of the senators elected every three years to ensure that the Senate is maintained as a continuous body, though [[staggered elections|staggered]]. When the Senate was restored by the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]], the 24 senators who were elected in 1987 served until 1992. In 1992 the 12 candidates for the Senate obtaining the highest number of votes served until 1998, while the next 12 served until 1995. Thereafter, each senator elected serves the full six years.\n\nAside from having its concurrence on every bill in order to be passed for the [[President of the Philippines|president]]'s signature to become a law, the Senate is the only body that can concur with [[treaty|treaties]], and can try [[Impeachment in the Philippines|impeachment]] cases. The Senate Presidency is currently held by [[Tito Sotto]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Joint session of Philippine Legislature.jpg|thumbnail|left|Joint session of Philippine Legislature including the newly elected Senate, November 15, 1916]]\n[[Image:Sen. Primcias debates Sen. Paredes.jpg|thumb|left|The post\u2013World War II Philippine Senate in 1951: [[Cipriano P. Primicias, Sr.]], far left, debates [[Quint\u00edn Paredes]], far right. In the middle are Justiniano Montano, [[Mariano Jes\u00fas Cuenco]], Enrique B. Magalona, and Francisco Delgado; in the foreground is Edmundo Cea. Deliberations were once held at the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Legislative Building]].]]\n\nThe Senate has its roots in the [[Philippine Commission]] of the [[Insular Government]].  Under the [[Philippine Organic Act]], from 1907 to 1916, the [[Philippine Commission]] headed by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] served as the upper chamber of the [[Philippine Legislature]], with the [[Philippine Assembly]] as the elected [[lower house]].  At the same time the governor-general also exercised executive powers.\n\nIn August 1916 the [[United States Congress]] enacted the [[Philippine Autonomy Act]] or popularly known as the \"Jones Law\", which created an elected bicameral [[Philippine Legislature]] with the Senate as the [[upper chamber]] and with the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]], previously called the Philippine Assembly, as the [[lower chamber]]. The Governor-General continued to be the head of the [[executive branch]] of the Insular Government.  Senators then were elected via [[Senatorial districts of the Philippines|senatorial districts]] via [[plurality-at-large voting]]; each district grouped several provinces and each elected two senators except for \"non-Christian\" provinces where the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] appointed the senators for the district.\n\nFuture president [[Manuel L. Quezon]], who was then [[Philippine Resident Commissioner]], encouraged future president [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], then [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the House, to run for the leadership of the Senate, but Osme\u00f1a preferred to continue leading the lower house. Quezon then ran for the Senate and became [[Senate President]] serving for 19 years (1916\u20131935).\n\nThis setup continued until 1935, when the [[Philippine Independence Act]] or the \"Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act\" was passed by the [[U.S. Congress]] which granted the Filipinos the right to frame their own constitution in preparation for their independence, wherein they established a unicameral [[National Assembly of the Philippines]], effectively abolishing the Senate. Not long after the adoption of the 1935 Constitution several amendments began to be proposed. By 1938, the National Assembly began consideration of these proposals, which included restoring the Senate as the upper chamber of Congress. The amendment of the 1935 Constitution to have a bicameral legislature was approved in 1940 and the [[1941 Philippine Senate election|first biennial elections]] for the restored upper house was held in November 1941. Instead of the old senatorial districts, senators were elected via the entire country serving as an [[at-large]] district, although still under plurality-at-large voting, with voters voting up to eight candidates, and the eight candidates with the highest number of votes being elected. While the Senate from 1916 to 1935 had exclusive confirmation rights over executive appointments, as part of the compromises that restored the Senate in 1941, the power of confirming executive appointments has been exercised by a joint [[Commission on Appointments (Philippines)|Commission on Appointments]] composed of members of both houses. However, the Senate since its restoration and the independence of the Philippines in 1946 has the power to ratify treaties.\n\nThe Senate finally convened in 1945 and served as the upper chamber of Congress from thereon until the declaration of [[martial law]] by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in 1972, which shut down Congress. The Senate was resurrected in 1987 upon the ratification of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]]. However, instead of eight senators being replaced after every election, it was changed to twelve.\n\nIn the Senate, the officers are the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]], [[President pro tempore of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President ''pro tempore'']], [[Majority leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Majority Floor Leader]], [[Minority leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Minority Floor Leader]] and the Senate Secretary and the Senate Sergeant at Arms who shall be elected by the Senators from among the employees and staff of the Senate. Meanwhile, the Senate President, Senate President pro-tempore, the Majority Floor Leader and the Minority Floor Leader shall be elected by the Senators from among themselves.\n\n==Composition==\n{{see also|Philippine senatorial elections}}\n[[File:Philippine Senate composition.png|thumb|left|200px|Election results from 1916 to the present. Note that some senators may switch to another party mid-term.]]\nArticle VI, Section 2 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] provides that the Senate shall be composed of 24 senators who shall be elected at-large by the qualified voters of the [[Philippines]], as may be provided by law.\n\nThe composition of the Senate is smaller in number as compared to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]]. The members of this chamber are elected at large by the entire electorate. The rationale for this rule intends to make the Senate a training ground for national leaders and possibly a springboard for the [[President of the Philippines|presidency]].\n\nIt follows also that the Senator, having a national rather than only a district constituency, will have a broader outlook of the problems of the country, instead of being restricted by narrow viewpoints and interests. With such perspective, the Senate is likely to be more circumspect, or at least less impulsive, than the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nSenatorial candidates are chosen by the leaders of major political parties or coalitions of parties.  The selection process is not transparent and is done in \"backrooms\" where much political horse-trading occurs.  Thus, the absence of regional or proportional representation in the Senate exacerbates a top heavy system of governance, with power centralized in Metro Manila.  It has often been suggested that each region of the country should elect its own senator(s) to more properly represent the people.  This will have the effect of flattening the power structure.  Regional problems and concerns within a national view can be addressed more effectively.  A senator's performance, accountability, and electability become meaningful to a more defined and identifiable regional constituency.\n\nThe [[Senate Electoral Tribunal]] (SET) composed of three [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] justices and six senators determines election protests on already-seated senators. There had been three instances where the SET has replaced senators due to election protests, the last of which was In 2011 when the tribunal [[Pimentel III vs. Zubiri Senate Electoral Protest|awarded the protest]] of [[Koko Pimentel]] against [[Juan Miguel Zubiri]].<ref name=\"proclamation\">{{cite news|last=Calonzo |first=Andero |title=Pimentel proclaimed 12th winning senator in '07 polls |work=GMA News Online |date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/229132/nation/pimentel-proclaimed-12th-winning-senator-in-07-polls}}</ref>\n\n==Qualifications==\nThe qualifications for membership in the Senate are expressly stated in Section 3, Art. VI of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] as follows:\n\n*No person shall be a Senator unless he is a natural-born citizen of the [[Philippines]], and on the day of the election, is at least 35 years of age, able to read and write, a registered voter, and a resident of the [[Philippines]] for not less than two years immediately preceding the day of the election.\n*The age is fixed at 35 and must be possessed on the day of the elections, that is, when the polls are opened and the votes cast, and not on the day of the proclamation of the winners by the board of canvassers.\n*With regard to the residence requirements, it was ruled in the case of ''Lim v. Pelaez'' that it must be the place where one habitually resides and to which he, after absence, has the intention of returning.\n*The enumeration laid down by the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] is exclusive under the Latin principle of ''[[expressio unius est exclusio alterius]]''. This means that [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] cannot anymore add additional qualifications other than those provided by the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]].\n\n==Organization==\nUnder the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]], \"[[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] shall convene once every year on the fourth Monday of July for its regular session...\". During this time, the Senate is organized to elect its officers. Specifically, the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] provides a definite statement, to it:\n\nThe Senate shall elect its [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|President]] and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] its [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives|Speaker]] by a vote of all its respective members.\n\nEach House shall choose such other officers as it may deem necessary.\n\nBy virtue of these provisions of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]], the Senate adopts its own rules, otherwise known as the \"Rules of the Senate.\" The Rules of the Senate provide the following officers: a [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|President]], a [[President pro tempore of the Senate of the Philippines|President ''pro tempore'']], a Secretary and a Sergeant-at-Arms.\n\nFollowing this set of officers, the Senate as an institution can then be grouped into the Senate Proper and the Secretariat. The former belongs exclusively to the members of the Senate as well as its committees, while the latter renders support services to the members of the Senate.\n\n==Powers==\nThe Senate was modeled upon the [[United States Senate]]; the two chambers of Congress have roughly equal powers, and every bill or resolution that has to go through both houses needs the consent of both chambers before being passed for the president's signature. Once a bill is defeated in the Senate, it is lost. Once a bill is approved by the Senate on [[third reading]], the bill is passed to the House of Representatives, unless an identical bill has also been passed by the lower house. When a counterpart bill in the lower house is different from the one passed by the Senate, either a bicameral conference committee is created consisting of members from both chambers of Congress to reconcile the differences, or either chamber may instead approve the other chamber's version.\n\nWhile [[money bill]]s originate in the House of Representatives, the Senate may still propose or concur with amendments. Only the Senate has the power to approve, via a two-thirds supermajority, or denounce treaties, and the power to try and convict, via a two-thirds supermajority, an impeached official.\n\n==Current members==\n{|width=60% class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" |\n!rowspan=1|[[List of Senators of the Philippines|Senator]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Viray|first1=Patricia Lourdes|title=Comelec proclaims Senate 'Magic 12'|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/05/19/1584838/comelec-proclaims-senate-magic-12|accessdate=19 May 2016|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n!rowspan=1|[[List of political parties in the Philippines|Party]]\n!colspan=1|Number\n!Starts\n!Ends\n|-\n{{party colour|Liberal Party (Philippines)}}\n|align=left|[[Leila de Lima]]\n|[[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]]\n|1\n| rowspan=\"12\" |June 30, 2016\n| rowspan=\"12\" |June 30, 2022\n|-\n{{party colour|Liberal Party (Philippines)}}\n|align=left|[[Franklin Drilon]]\n||[[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]]\n|2\n|-\n{{party colour|Nationalist People's Coalition}}\n|align=left|[[Win Gatchalian]]\n|[[Nationalist People's Coalition|NPC]]\n|1\n|-\n{{party colour|Bagumbayan-VNP}}\n|align=left|[[Richard J.

The unicameral parliament known as the [[Batasang Pambansa]] eventually met there in 1978. With the restoration of the bicameral legislature in 1987, the House of Representatives inherited the complex at Quezon City, now called the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], while the Senate returned to the Congress Building, until the GSIS Building was finished In 1997. Thus, the country's two houses of Congress meet at different places in [[Metro Manila]].\n\nThe Senate would eventually move to Navy Village in [[Taguig]] by 2020. As the Senate is renting GSIS for the office space, it asked the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] (BCDA) to present suitable sites for it to move to, with the Senate eyeing the Navy Village property along [[Lawton Avenue]] as its favored site.<ref>{{cite news|title=Senate to move to Bonifacio Global City in Taguig by 2020 - The Manila Times Online|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/senate-move-bonifacio-global-city-taguig-2020/308688/|accessdate=29 January 2017|work=www.manilatimes.net|date=2017-01-25}}</ref> In 2018, a building designed by [[AECOM]] was chosen as winner for the new home for the Senate and is expected to be built by 2022.

{"title_page": "Pope Pius XI and Spain", "text_new": "\n\nForeign relations between [[Pope Pius XI]] and [[Spain]] were very tense, especially because they occurred within the context of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the period of troubles preceding it.\n\n==Anti-clerical government==\nThe Republican government which came to power in Spain in 1931, as the country embraced constitutional democracy, following the fall of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and the exit of the King, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], seemed to signal that Spain was breaking with elements of its past. The Republican alliance took 45 of Spain's 52 provincial capitals.<ref>Mary Vincent, p.117</ref> The Republican alliance perceived the religious question at this time as a matter of trying to define a new, subordinate place of the Catholic Church. Many of the constitutional articles were modeled on the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Portuguese Constitution of 1911]] \u2013 separation of church and state; freedom of worship became a fundamental civic right; civil marriage and divorce were introduced; schools and cemeteries were secularized. Catholic schools continued, but outside the state system, and in 1933 further legislation banned all [[Religious sister (Catholic)|religious sisters]] and male congregations from teaching. ''State education would be secular, obligatory, free of charge, and available to all.''<ref>Mary Vincent, Spain 1833\u20132002, p.122</ref> Also, the [[Jesuit]]s were expelled from Spain. \n\nReligion was to be placed in the private sphere, religious worship confined to religious buildings \u2013 the public world of the Republic was to be determinedly secular. Establishing a secular state was a fundamental tenet of Republicanism, but the alliance was 'a hybrid of traditions', encompassing liberals, radicals, federalists, anarchists \u2013 and there was less unanimity as to other anti-religious policies. The Socialist minister of justice [[w:es:Fernando de los Rios|Fernando de los Rios]], argued that the deputies should not deprive communities of their traditional festivities and that processions like [[Holy Week in Seville]] or [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] transcended a purely religious significance \u2013 but was ignored.<ref>Vincent, p.122</ref> At [[Pentecost]] in 1932, Pope Pius XI protested against these measures and demanded [[restitution]]. He asked the Catholics of Spain to fight with all legal means against the perceived injustices.\n\n==Nationalization of Church properties==\nOn 3 June 1933, Pius issued the encyclical [[Dilectissima Nobis|''Dilectissima Nobis'']], in which he described the expropriation of all Church buildings, episcopal residences, parish houses, seminaries and monasteries. By law, they were now property of the Spanish State, to which the Church had to pay rent and taxes in order to continuously use these properties. \"Thus the Catholic Church is compelled to pay taxes on what was violently taken from her.\"<ref>Dilectissima Nobis,  9\u201310</ref> Religious vestments, liturgical instruments, statues, pictures, vases, gems and similar objects necessary for worship were expropriated as well.<ref>Dilectissima Nobis, 12</ref>\n\n==Expropriation of private Catholic schools==\nThe churches were not spared in the expropriation. Numerous churches and temples were destroyed by burning, after they were nationalized. Jesuits were prohibited from teaching. Private Catholic schools of Religious Orders and Congregations were expropriated, without regard to the free will of founders and benefactors. The purpose was to create solely secular schools.<ref>Dilectissima Nobis, 21</ref>\n\n==Beginning of the Civil War==\nThe Civil War in Spain started in 1936, during which thousands of churches were destroyed and thirteen bishops and some 7000 clergy and religious Spaniards were assassinated.<ref>Franzen  397</ref> Another estimate is that in the course of the Red Terror, 6,832&nbsp;members of the Catholic clergy were killed.<ref name=\"Cueva 355\">{{Harvnb|de la Cueva|1998|p=355}}</ref> Though many right-wing Catholics, including the majority of bishops, had always been opposed to the Republic and \" bore a considerable responsibility for the growing friction that culminated in open warfare\", the wave of persecution of religion that swept across the Republican zone, where the rebellion had failed, during the first months of the war, helped to assure \"Franco of the highly useful support of the ecclesiastical establishment throughout the whole of the Civil War.\"<ref>Raguer, Gunpowder and Incense, p.51</ref> ([[Isidro Goma y Tomas]] for example, handed money, collected from Ireland for the reconstruction of churches and replacement of liturgical articles, to Franco's rebel army.)<ref>Raguer, p.74</ref>\n\n==The speech at Castelgandolfo, 14 September 1936==\nIn the first bloody months of the Civil War some ecclesiastics managed to escape to [[Marseilles]], [[Genoa]], or Rome and these brought news reports with them, with which they sought to apply pressure to the organs of the Vatican Curia with whom they maintained regular relations. (Hilari Raguer, a Benedictine writer on religious history points out that they necessarily delivered a biased report - bishops and aristocrats carry more weight than peasants and workers\u2014and poor workers had no means of escape to take them from the Francoist zone to Rome). [[Wlodimir Ledochowski|Father Ledochowski]], the Head general of the Jesuits, ordered the Jesuit press all over the world to support the rebels. It became known that Pius XI would grant an audience, at his summer residence at [[Castelgandolfo]], to a large group of Spanish refugees and deliver an address to them. Expectation rose amongst the Spanish clergy in Rome. Though it should have fallen to Cardinal [[Francisco Vidal y Barraquer]] to lead the group of Spanish clergy, there was great animosity to him from the majority of Spanish ecclesiastics and the Pope instructed him to say he judged it wiser not to attend. Some 500 Spaniards, mostly priests and religious, as well as some secular supporters of the Uprising, did attend. The content of the speech disappointed the more fanatical among the supporters of the military rising. He read it in Italian and a Spanish translation was distributed as a leaflet. Entitled ''La vostra presenza'' (Your Presence Here), it began with lamentation for the fate of the victims and condemned communism. This part of the speech was used from this point on in Francoist propaganda. He quoted from the [[Book of Revelation]], telling the refugees they ''came out of great tribulation'' (Rev. 7, 14). Yet whilst some hoped and expected that the Insurgent cause would be declared a Holy War or Crusade\u2014it had already been so designated by various bishops and generals\u2014Pius XI expressed horror at fratricidal war and exhorted the insurgents to love their enemies. He thanked those who had tried to alleviate the miseries of war, though their effect had been minimal. This too may have displeased the fervent supporters of Franco who were present, for the insurgents had always obstructed intervention of this kind by governments or neutral organisations such as the [[International Red Cross]]<ref>Raguer, p.83</ref>\n\n==Reactions to Pius XI's Castelgandolfo speech==\nFour days after the speech [[Eugenio Pacelli]] wrote to Vidal y Barraquer to say the Pope had wanted to comfort the refugees but not to identify himself with the warlike attitude of the side that called itself Catholic. In the so-called 'National' zone however, the Francoists widely publicized the speech - but only those paragraphs which seemed to endorse the idea of a Crusade, the second part being suppressed. The Spanish bishops acted upon the impulse suggested by the propagandist version of the speech and \"let loose a cascade of Pastoral Letters in favour of Franco.\"<ref>Raguer, p.85</ref> So, for example, [[Enrique Pla y Deniel]], the [[Bishop of Salamanca]], on receiving a version of Pius XI's speech from the military, published his Pastoral Letter, ''Las Dos ciudades'',(''The Two cities''), dated 30 September, an attempt at a theological justification for Franco's cause. The moral weight of the Vatican was considered of great significance to the generals of the Uprising\u2014for one thing it was wanted at this time to aid the suppression of the separatist nationalisms in Spain. In 1936 it was [[Basque people|Basque]] nationalism which particularly troubled the Francoists as it presented to the world the sight of Catholics who were loyal to the Republic and resisting with arms the invasion of the ''Crusaders''.<ref>Raguer, p.86</ref>\n\n==Magaz, Goma, and Pius XI==\nThe [[Holy See]] maintained relations with the Republic in 1936\u2014thereafter they grew weaker. Relations began with [[Burgos]], the base of Franco's Nationalists, with the appointment of an unofficial Charg\u00e9. The Junta de Defensa at Burgos appointed a monarchist, Antonio de Magaz y Pers, the [[w:es:Marquesado de Magaz|Marqu\u00e9s de Magaz]] to establish contact with the Vatican. Magaz had been ambassador to the Holy See in the late 1920s and had sought to enrol the assistance of Pius XI in the suppression of ''catalanismo'' and ''bizcaitarrismo'' (Catalan and Basque nationalism)\u2014and the removal of Cardinal Vidal y Barraquer from the Primatial Archiepiscopal seat of [[Tarragona]]. Magaz did not succeed in removing the Catalan cardinal but did get decrees prohibiting the use of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in pastoral matters and ordering the expulsion from the seminaries of all teachers and pupils suspected of separatism.<ref>Raguer, p.88</ref>\n\nMagaz's second mission to the Vatican in 1936 lasted barely a year. He endlessly demanded the canonical condemnation of the Basque nationalists, who refused to surrender to the rebels. He made complaints and threats against what he called the ''neutralism'' of the Vatican in the face of a war of religion. Pius XI met Magaz in a papal audience on 23 November 1936. Pius XI had just received a report from the Bishop of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], [[w:es:Mateo Mugica|Mateo Mugica Urresterazu]], telling him how the Franco insurgents had expelled him from his seat and telling him that 14 priests of his diocese had been shot, and many more jailed or banished from their parishes. According to a report of J.A. Gimenez Arnau, who asked Magaz about the audience, Magaz told him Pius XI replied to his complaints about the Vatican's attitude to the Nationalist authorities by declaring; \" In the National Spain, priests are shot just as they are in the Spain of the other side.\" In another account, when Magaz said that the slight sympathy for the National government of the Pope's words caused him great distress, Pius XI was thrown into a fury and declared; \"''How can anyone dare to speak of our slight sympathy when on many different and public occasions we have condemned Communism and conferred our benevolence on those who fight it?''\" From that moment Magaz had condemned himself in the eyes of both the Vatican and Franco.<ref>Raguer, p.95</ref> Pius XI appointed [[Isidro Goma y Tomas]] as his unofficial and confidential representative at Franco's headquarters, a role he performed from 19 December 1936 to 18 September 1937, while Monsignore [[Ildebrando Antoniutti|Antoniutti]], who had arrived in Spain in October 1936 on another mission, was named as the Papal Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires. Goma's influence on the attitude of Pius XI was powerful. Having met with [[Eugenio Pacelli]] and Pius XI on December 19, 1936, Goma wrote in his diary ; \" the unfriendly attitude towards Spain was abandoned after my report to Pacelli had been read and a formula was found to create close ties with the government of Franco.\"\n\nGoma was a man of the Church, unlike Magaz, and suspicious of some of those surrounding Franco\u2014an anti-clerical sector which could stain the perceived Christian spirit of the Franco movement. This anti-clerical sector, he confronted in his Pastoral Letter of 28 January 1938, to mark the fourteenth anniversary of the coronation of Pius XI. In the third part, entitled 'Pius XI and Spain' he spoke of the Pope's love for Spain and in the fourth part, ''Prevengamonos'' ('Let us prevent'), he challenged those who attacked Pius XI for not intervening more determinedly in favour of the Francoist Uprising. In the fifth he confronted anti-Vatican sentiment in the Movement ;\"We have heard and read, 'Catholics, yes; Vaticanists, no'; and it is with pain that we have seen it expressed in more sophisticated terms by a section of the press.\" Franco, since 1 October 1936 had taken over all the powers of the junta and sought to gain the full support of Pius XI. The policy of Pius XI, which Goma first and afterwards Antoniutti and [[Gaetano Cicognani|Cicognani]] maintained, towards Franco's government, was characterised by a strong anticommunism on the one hand, an on the other, a suspicion of [[falangism]], and of the influence of Franco's German Nazi and Italian Fascist allies; the Vatican policy sought to guide the regime into the repeal of the anti-clerical laws of the Republic and away from 'pagan' and imported totalitarian temptations. Goma was received by Franco on 29 December 1936 and six basic points were established at the meeting - points that were the seeds of the Concordat of 1953.\n\n==''The Divini Redemptoris'' encyclical, March 1937==\nPius XI's 'third way' policy of neither communism nor fascism was illustrated by the publication in early 1937 of one encyclical against Communism and another against Nazism. The ''Divini Redemptoris'' devoted a paragraph to ''the horrors of communism in Spain'', and dwelt on the assassination of priests and religious. In Franco's Spain this encyclical against Communism received wide circulation, but the publication of ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' was prohibited. Franco told von Faupel, German Ambassador, that while Pius XI was recognised as the highest religious authority in Spain, any interference in internal Spanish affairs had to be rejected. He told the German ambassador that he too, Franco, had to fight against the Vatican. He had instructed the [[Archbishop of Toledo]], Goma, that no mention should be made in Spain of the encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' and that in this way any criticism of Germany would be cut off.<ref>Raguer, p.103</ref>\n\nIn 1937 there was dual representation with the Salamanca government, raised to the level of Charg\u00e9s d'Affaires, with Antoniutti at Salamanca and Churruca at Rome, and mention of the Valencia (Republican) government reduced to a line of dots in the ''Annuario Pontificio''. By 1938 relations with Franco reached the level of full Ambassador and [[Nuncio]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pope Pius Xi And Spain}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Spanish Civil War]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Spain]]\n", "text_old": "\n\nForeign relations between [[Pope Pius XI]] and [[Spain]] were very tense, especially because they occurred within the context of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the period of troubles preceding it.\n\n==Anti-clerical government==\nThe Republican government which came to power in Spain in 1931, as the country embraced constitutional democracy, following the fall of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and the exit of the King, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], seemed to signal that Spain was breaking with elements of its past.

Gimenez Arnau, who asked Magaz about the audience, Magaz told him Pius XI replied to his complaints about the Vatican's attitude to the Nationalist authorities by declaring; \" In the National Spain, priests are shot just as they are in the Spain of the other side.\" In another account, when Magaz said that the slight sympathy for the National government of the Pope's words caused him great distress, Pius XI was thrown into a fury and declared; \"''How can anyone dare to speak of our slight sympathy when on many different and public occasions we have condemned Communism and conferred our benevolence on those who fight it?''\" From that moment Magaz had condemned himself in the eyes of both the Vatican and Franco.<ref>Raguer, p.95</ref> Pius XI appointed [[Isidro Goma y Tomas]] as his unofficial and confidential representative at Franco's headquarters, a role he performed from 19 December 1936 to 18 September 1937, while Monsignore [[Ildebrando Antoniutti|Antoniutti]], who had arrived in Spain in October 1936 on another mission, was named as the Papal Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires. Goma's influence on the attitude of Pius XI was powerful. Having met with [[Eugenio Pacelli]] and Pius XI on December 19, 1936, Goma wrote in his diary ; \" the unfriendly attitude towards Spain was abandoned after my report to Pacelli had been read and a formula was found to create close ties with the government of Franco.\"\n\nGoma was a man of the Church, unlike Magaz, and suspicious of some of those surrounding Franco\u2014an anti-clerical sector which could stain the perceived Christian spirit of the Franco movement. This anti-clerical sector, he confronted in his Pastoral Letter of 28 January 1938, to mark the fourteenth anniversary of the coronation of Pius XI. In the third part, entitled 'Pius XI and Spain' he spoke of the Pope's love for Spain and in the fourth part, ''Prevengamonos'' ('Let us prevent'), he challenged those who attacked Pius XI for not intervening more determinedly in favour of the Francoist Uprising. In the fifth he confronted anti-Vatican sentiment in the Movement ;\"We have heard and read, 'Catholics, yes; Vaticanists, no'; and it is with pain that we have seen it expressed in more sophisticated terms by a section of the press.\" Franco, since 1 October 1936 had taken over all the powers of the junta and sought to gain the full support of Pius XI. The policy of Pius XI, which Goma first and afterwards Antoniutti and [[Gaetano Cicognani|Cicognani]] maintained, towards Franco's government, was characterised by a strong anticommunism on the one hand, an on the other, a suspicion of [[falangism]], and of the influence of Franco's German Nazi and Italian Fascist allies; the Vatican policy sought to guide the regime into the repeal of the anti-clerical laws of the Republic and away from 'pagan' and imported totalitarian temptations. Goma was received by Franco on 29 December 1936 and six basic points were established at the meeting - points that were the seeds of the Concordat of 1953.\n\n==''The Divini Redemptoris'' encyclical, March 1937==\nPius XI's 'third way' policy of neither communism nor fascism was illustrated by the publication in early 1937 of one encyclical against Communism and another against Nazism. The ''Divini Redemptoris'' devoted a paragraph to ''the horrors of communism in Spain'', and dwelt on the assassination of priests and religious. In Franco's Spain this encyclical against Communism received wide circulation, but the publication of ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' was prohibited. Franco told von Faupel, German Ambassador, that while Pius XI was recognised as the highest religious authority in Spain, any interference in internal Spanish affairs had to be rejected. He told the German ambassador that he too, Franco, had to fight against the Vatican. He had instructed the [[Archbishop of Toledo]], Goma, that no mention should be made in Spain of the encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' and that in this way any criticism of Germany would be cut off.<ref>Raguer, p.103</ref>\n\nIn 1937 there was dual representation with the Salamanca government, raised to the level of Charg\u00e9s d'Affaires, with Antoniutti at Salamanca and Churruca at Rome, and mention of the Valencia (Republican) government reduced to a line of dots in the ''Annuario Pontificio''. By 1938 relations with Franco reached the level of full Ambassador and [[Nuncio]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pope Pius Xi And Spain}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Spanish Civil War]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Spain]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNationalization of Church properties:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI_and_Spain"}

Billy Graham conducted 417 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham evangelistic campaign, held September 13\u201321, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward to ask Jesus to be their saviour and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Durban]], South Africa, in 1973, the crowd of some 100,000 was the first large mixed-race event in [[apartheid]] South Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/2018/03/billy-graham-1918-2018-prophet-of-world-christianity/|title=Billy Graham (1918\u20132018): Prophet of World Christianity?|last=Stanley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Stanley (historian)|date=March 2, 2018|website=Centre for the Study of World Christianity|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.<ref name=\"time1993\">Nancy Gibbs & Richard N.

Billy Graham conducted 417 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham evangelistic campaign, held September 13\u201321, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward to ask Jesus to be their saviour and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Durban]], South Africa, in 1973, the crowd of some 100,000 was the first large mixed-race event in [[apartheid]] South Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/2018/03/billy-graham-1918-2018-prophet-of-world-christianity/|title=Billy Graham (1918\u20132018): Prophet of World Christianity?|last=Stanley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Stanley (historian)|date=March 2, 2018|website=Centre for the Study of World Christianity|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.<ref name=\"time1993\">Nancy Gibbs & Richard N.

It is located at Eighth Avenue and 14th Street in [[Manhattan]], and served by the:\n\n* [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]], [[E (New York City Subway service)|E]], and [[L (New York City Subway service)|L]] trains at all times\n* [[C (New York City Subway service)|C]] train at all times except late nights\n\nThe whole complex is [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-compliant]], with the accessible station entrance at 14th Street. This complex was renovated at the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nThis station had two artworks installed here. The first one was in 1989 by Ross Lewis named ''Parallel Motion.'' It shows images of moving bodies in the mezzanine drawn by brushstrokes using Chinese calligraphy. It was removed in 1995 and is now in the lobby of Public School 89 in [[Battery Park City]]. The second art installation by [[Tom Otterness]], called ''[[Life Underground]],'' was installed in 2001. It features whimsical bronze sculptures, including a [[sewer alligator]], scattered about the station.\n\nThere are several [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] [[New York City Transit Authority]] training facilities located in the Mezzanine.\n\n__TOC__\n\n{{-}}\n\n== History ==\nIn 1999, this station underwent a major station renovation. On August 24, 1993, the contract for the project's design was awarded for $994,079. In May 1994, a supplemental agreement worth $203,435 was reached to allow the consultant to design the New York City Transit training facility to be compliant with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. As part of the project's design, multiple options were considered to improve the station, including the construction of a free transfer zone between the Eighth Avenue and Canarsie Lines. As part of the supplemental agreement, the consultant was directed to design it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda May 1994|date=May 16, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit}}</ref>{{Rp|C-55, C-56}}\n\n==Station layout==\n{{NYCS Platform Layout 14th Street/Eighth Avenue Station}}\n\n===Exits===\nThe station complex's three sets of entrances are located at the intersections of Eighth Avenue and 14th, 15th, and 16th Streets.<ref name=maps>{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: 14th Stret (A)(C)(E)|url=https://new.mta.info/sites/default/files/2018-04/14_St_%28A%29%28C%29%28E%29_web.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=2019-07-07}}</ref> The northernmost one has an unstaffed bank of turnstiles, two staircases going up to the northwest corner of 16th Street and Eighth Avenue, and one going up to each eastern side of the intersection.

It is the western ([[Railroad directions|railroad north]]) [[terminal station|terminal]] of the [[BMT Canarsie Line]]. The station is served by the L train at all times.\n\nEighth Avenue station opened on May 30, 1931, and was the last station to open on the Canarsie Line, built as an extension from the mainline that opened seven years earlier westward from [[Sixth Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Sixth Avenue]], the previous terminal.<ref name=\"BMT open\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1931/05/30/archives/mayor-drives-train-in-new-subway-link-the-mayor-becomes-a-motorman.html&scp=1&sq=mayor%20drives%20train%20in%20new%20subway%20link&st=cse Mayor drives train in new subway link] ''New York Times'' Retrieved September 2, 2008</ref>\n\nEighth Avenue uses a single island platform with two tracks<ref name=\"nycs8ave\">[http://nycsubway.org/perl/stations?203:3211 Eighth Avenue] ''NYCSubway'' Retrieved September 2, 2008, </ref> which are designated officially as Q1 and Q2; however, these [[New York City Subway chaining|chaining numbers]] are only used by train crew and MTA personnel as their main purpose is distance-marking. Originally, they were named QW1 and QW2 since Eighth Avenue was a western extension of the Canarsie Line, but the line has been re-chained simply as Q. Eighth Avenue is the zero-point of the Canarsie Line's chaining, that is, it is the starting point of all distances on the line. The tracks end at [[bumper block]]s just past the west end of the platform.\n\nThe station was originally decorated in a more IND style than the rest of the Canarsie Line, which was built by the BMT. The original tile band was two-tone ultramarine blue with \"8th Av\" captions.<ref name=\"nycs8ave\"/> However, a 1999 renovation subsequently removed the IND style and replaced it with the BMT quilt-like tile pattern that exists on all other subway stations on the BMT Canarsie Line. The current tile color scheme is white with red stripes and historically-correct mosaics predominantly beige and tan, with an oddly \"regular\" pattern of red, yellow, green and off-white in the center. To signify the station's location, there are small \"8\" decorations set in teal-green hexagons, as found in other stations on the line.<ref name=\"nycs8ave\"/>\n\n{{-}}\n\n== Nearby points of interest ==\n\n* [[Abingdon Square]]<ref name=maps/>\n* [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] art galleries west of [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|10th Avenue]]<ref name=maps/>\n* [[Chelsea Piers]] Sports Complex<ref name=maps/>\n* The [[High Line]]<ref name=maps/>\n* [[Hudson River Park]]<ref name=maps/>\n* [[IAC Building]]<ref name=maps/>\n* [[Jackson Square Park]]<ref name=maps/>\n* [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]]<ref name=maps/>\n* [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|Saint Vincent's Hospital]];

It is located at Eighth Avenue and 14th Street in [[Manhattan]], and served by the:\n\n* [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]], [[E (New York City Subway service)|E]], and [[L (New York City Subway service)|L]] trains at all times\n* [[C (New York City Subway service)|C]] train at all times except late nights\n\nThe whole complex is [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-compliant]], with the accessible station entrance at 14th Street. This complex was renovated at the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nThis station had two artworks installed here. The first one was in 1989 by Ross Lewis named ''Parallel Motion.'' It shows images of moving bodies in the mezzanine drawn by brushstrokes using Chinese calligraphy. It was removed in 1995 and is now in the lobby of Public School 89 in [[Battery Park City]]. The second art installation by [[Tom Otterness]], called ''[[Life Underground]],'' was installed in 2001. It features whimsical bronze sculptures, including a [[sewer alligator]], scattered about the station.\n\nThere are several [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] [[New York City Transit Authority]] training facilities located in the Mezzanine.\n\n__TOC__\n\n{{-}}\n\n== History ==\nIn 1999, this station underwent a major station renovation. On August 24, 1993, the contract for the project's design was awarded for $994,079. In May 1994, a supplemental agreement worth $203,435 was reached to allow the consultant to design the New York City Transit training facility to be compliant with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. As part of the project's design, multiple options were considered to improve the station, including the construction of a free transfer zone between the Eighth Avenue and Canarsie Lines. As part of the supplemental agreement, the consultant was directed to design it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda May 1994|date=May 16, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit}}</ref>{{Rp|C-55, C-56}}\n\n==Station layout==\n{{NYCS Platform Layout 14th Street/Eighth Avenue Station}}\n\n===Exits===\nThe station complex's three sets of entrances are located at the intersections of Eighth Avenue and 14th, 15th, and 16th Streets.<ref name=maps>{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: 14th Stret (A)(C)(E)|url=https://new.mta.info/sites/default/files/2018-04/14_St_%28A%29%28C%29%28E%29_web.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=2019-07-07}}</ref> The northernmost one has an unstaffed bank of turnstiles, two staircases going up to the northwest corner of 16th Street and Eighth Avenue, and one going up to each eastern side of the intersection.

It is the western ([[Railroad directions|railroad north]]) [[terminal station|terminal]] of the [[BMT Canarsie Line]]. The station is served by the L train at all times.\n\nEighth Avenue station opened on May 30, 1931, and was the last station to open on the Canarsie Line, built as an extension from the mainline that opened seven years earlier westward from [[Sixth Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Sixth Avenue]], the previous terminal.<ref name=\"BMT open\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1931/05/30/archives/mayor-drives-train-in-new-subway-link-the-mayor-becomes-a-motorman.html&scp=1&sq=mayor%20drives%20train%20in%20new%20subway%20link&st=cse Mayor drives train in new subway link] ''New York Times'' Retrieved September 2, 2008</ref>\n\nEighth Avenue uses a single island platform with two tracks<ref name=\"nycs8ave\">[http://nycsubway.org/perl/stations?203:3211 Eighth Avenue] ''NYCSubway'' Retrieved September 2, 2008, </ref> which are designated officially as Q1 and Q2; however, these [[New York City Subway chaining|chaining numbers]] are only used by train crew and MTA personnel as their main purpose is distance-marking. Originally, they were named QW1 and QW2 since Eighth Avenue was a western extension of the Canarsie Line, but the line has been re-chained simply as Q. Eighth Avenue is the zero-point of the Canarsie Line's chaining, that is, it is the starting point of all distances on the line. The tracks end at [[bumper block]]s just past the west end of the platform.\n\nThe station was originally decorated in a more IND style than the rest of the Canarsie Line, which was built by the BMT. The original tile band was two-tone ultramarine blue with \"8th Av\" captions.<ref name=\"nycs8ave\"/> However, a 1999 renovation subsequently removed the IND style and replaced it with the BMT quilt-like tile pattern that exists on all other subway stations on the BMT Canarsie Line.
