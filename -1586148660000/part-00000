Unsurprisingly, Goldie turns on Louie until she sees that he was invited to Doofus' birthday party and asks him to take her. They arrive pretending to be an aunt and nephew intending to take all of the million-dollar gift bags. However, Doofus sniffs out frauds among his guests and sends them to his \"Honey Bin\", leaving Louie and Goldie; Glomgold and his puppet-son; and Beaks and his robot-son, B.O.Y.D. (Nicolas Cantu). Once he removes the villains, Doofus demands to know who ruined his party. Goldie blames Louie, so Doofus programs B.O.Y.D. to attack him, but Goldie saves him. The party turns out to be a test, as Doofus claims Goldie as his new \"Gemeemama\". Louie is allowed to leave with the gift bags, but he decides to rescue Goldie and give B.O.Y.D. to Doofus as a brother, who transfers half of his fortune to his account for his new parents ([[Yuri Lowenthal]] & [[Tara Platt]]), allowing them to finally stand up to Doofus and ground him. During the confusion, Goldie steals the gift bags, but keeps a picture of Louie.

The others arrive to help Lena, but Magica turns her into a copy of her so they will attack her instead and prove her point.

The Carmarthen Hills were in the north of the region and the Lansdowne Hills were in the south. The name ''Blue Mountains'', however, was preferred<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ausdisc/ausdisc2-intro.html |title=Project Gutenberg Australia |publisher=Gutenberg.net.au |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref> and is derived from the blue tinge the range takes on when viewed from a distance. The tinge is believed to be caused by [[Mie scattering]] which occurs when incoming light with shorter wavelengths is preferentially scattered by particles within the atmosphere imparting a blue-greyish colour to any distant objects, including mountains and clouds. Volatile [[terpenoid]]s emitted in large quantities by the abundant eucalyptus trees in the Blue Mountains may cause Mie scattering and thus the blue haze for which the mountains were named.<ref name=\"Bohlmann2008\">{{cite journal|last1= Bohlmann|first1= J.|last2= Keeling|first2=C.

The site is known as Kings Tableland Aboriginal Site and dates back 22,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n=== European history ===\n[[Arthur Phillip]], the first governor of New South Wales, first glimpsed the extent of the Blue Mountains from a ridge at the site of today's Oakhill College, Castle Hill. He named them the Carmarthen Hills, \"some forty to sixty miles distant...\" and he reckoned that the ground was \"most suitable for government stock\". This is the location where Gidley King in 1799 established a prison town for political prisoners from Ireland and Scotland.\n\nThe first documented use of the name ''Blue Mountains'' appears in [[John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)|Captain John Hunter]]'s account of Phillip's 1789 expedition up the Hawkesbury River. Describing the events of about 5 July, Hunter wrote: \"We frequently, in some of the reaches which we passed through this day, saw very near us the hills, which we suppose as seen from Port Jackson, and called by the governor the Blue Mountains.\"<ref>Hunter, J. (1793) An Historical Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island. John Stockdale, London.</ref> During the nineteenth century the name was commonly applied to the portion of the Great Dividing Range from about Goulburn in the south to the Hunter Valley in the north, but in time it came to be associated with a more limited area.<ref name=\"Macqueen\" />\n\nThe native Aborigines knew two routes{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} across the mountains: Bilpin Ridge, which is now the location of [[Bells Line of Road]] between [[Richmond, New South Wales|Richmond]] and [[Bell, New South Wales|Bell]], and the [[Coxs River]], a tributary of the [[Nepean River]]. It could be followed upstream to the open plains of the Kanimbla Valley, the type of country that farmers prize.\n\nEuropean settlers initially considered that fertile lands lay beyond the mountains; while in the belief of many convicts China lay beyond. However, there was little fear that the mountains might provide a means of escape since they were considered impassable.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/writingplace/writing%20place%20essay.pdf |title= Beyond belonging?

An \"insurmountable\" barrier would deter convicts from trying to escape in that direction.\n\nA former convict, John Wilson, may have been the first European to cross the Blue Mountains. It is also believed that Mathew Everingham, 1795,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHistory.aspx?id=N0004 |title=DECCW &#124; Blue Mountains National Park&nbsp;\u2014 History since colonisation |publisher=Environment.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref> may have also been partly successful based on letters he wrote at the time which came to light in the late 1980s<!--NOTE: it is not certain that Wilson was the first to cross the mountains; if you disagree, please provide references-->. Wilson arrived with the First Fleet in 1788 and was freed in 1792. He settled in the bush, living with the Aborigines and even functioning as an intermediary between them and the settlers. In 1797 he returned to Sydney, claiming to have explored up to a hundred miles in all directions around Sydney, including across the mountains. His descriptions and observations were generally accurate, and it is possible that he had crossed the mountains via the southern aspect at the Coxs River corridor, guided by the Aborigines.<ref name=BMr/>{{rp|76\u201377}}\n\nGovernor Hunter was impressed by Wilson's skills and sent him on an expedition with John Price and others in January 1798. The party crossed the Nepean River and moved southwest towards the present site of [[Mittagong, New South Wales|Mittagong]]. There they turned west and found a route along the ridge where today the Wombeyan Caves Road is located. In the process they found a way to go west of the mountains, by going around them instead of across them. In March of the same year, Wilson and Price ventured to the Camden area, and then continued further south until they encountered Thirlmere Lakes, finally almost reaching the present site of [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]].\n\nIt is possible that the accomplishments of this expedition were suppressed by Hunter, who may not have wanted convicts to know that there was a relatively easy way out of Sydney.<ref name=BMr/>{{rp|83}} Wilson was killed by Aborigines after abducting an Aboriginal woman \"for his personal use\",<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=David|title=An account of the English colony in New South Wales|year=1804|publisher=T.

He was never recognised as the first person to cross the mountains, possibly because his Coxs River journey could not be verified, while his route west of Mittagong may have been the \"long way around\" for a colony that had its eyes fixed on the sandstone fortress west of the Nepean.\n\n[[File:Blaxland-map.jpg|thumb|left|Route of the [[Gregory Blaxland|Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|Lawson]], and [[William Wentworth|Wentworth]] Crossing of 1813]]\n[[File:The typical blue haze in the Jamison Valley behand the Three Sister.jpeg|thumb|left|The typical blue haze in the [[Jamison Valley]] behind the [[Three Sisters (Australia)|Three Sisters]], New South Wales, Australia.]]\n\nBetween 1798 and 1813, many people explored various parts of the mountains, from the Bilpin Ridge to the southern regions, today the site of the [[Kanangra-Boyd National Park]]. Still, they did not find a definite route across the mountains.\nThe [[1813 crossing of the Blue Mountains]] by [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and [[William Wentworth|William Charles Wentworth]] is officially credited as the first successful European crossing.<ref name=DictSydneyLawson>{{cite web|title=Lawson, William|url=http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/lawson_william|publisher=Dictionary of Sydney|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> Blaxland set out with Lawson and Wentworth on 11 May 1813 and succeeded in crossing the mountains by 31 May. They ventured as far as to what is now [[Mount Blaxland, New South Wales|Mount Blaxland]], just west of [[Coxs River]].\n\nIn November 1813, Macquarie sent the surveyor [[George Evans (explorer)|George Evans]] on an expedition to confirm the apparent discoveries made by Blaxland and his party. He was also told to see if there existed enough arable land to justify settlement. The issue had become more urgent because the colony was in the grips of a drought.\n\nEvans and his party reached the [[Fish River (Oberon)|Fish]] and [[Macquarie River|Macquarie]] rivers, and the site of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]].<ref>Shaping Australia \u2013 Explorers, Mitchell Scott (Watts Publishing) 2004, pp.5\u20136</ref> On 7 July 1814, construction of a road across the mountains was begun by [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]]. The work was at the behest of Governor Macquarie. 30 convict labourers and 8 guards completed the road on 14 January 1815 after 27 weeks of hard work.<ref name=BMr/>{{rp|145}}\n\nSince the Blue Mountains are rich in coal and shale, mining for these resources began in Hartley Vale in 1865. J.B. North ran a shale mine in the Jamison Valley in the 19th century,<ref name=SBMB/>{{rp|243}} and other operations were set up in several places. Locations for mining activities included the [[Jamison Valley]], the upper [[Grose Valley]], [[Newnes, New South Wales|Newnes]], [[Glen Davis, New South Wales|Glen Davis]] and the Asgard Swamp area outside [[Mount Victoria, New South Wales|Mount Victoria]]. Shale mining failed in the long run because it was not financially viable. \n[[File:(1)Ruins at Yerranderie.jpg|upright|thumb|Ruins at abandoned silver-mining town of Yerranderie (later reopened to tourism)]]\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate varies with elevation. At Katoomba, ({{convert|1010|m|ft|sigfig=4|abbr=on|disp=or}}) the summer average maximum temperature is around 22&nbsp;\u00b0C with a few days extending into the 30s (80s\u201390s \u00b0F) although it is quite common to see maximum temperatures stay in the teens when east coast troughs persist. Night-time temperatures are usually in the teens but can drop to single figures at times. During winter, the temperature is typically around 10 to 11&nbsp;\u00b0C in the daytime with \u22121&nbsp;\u00b0C or so on clear nights and 3 to 4&nbsp;\u00b0C on cloudy nights. Very occasionally it will get down to \u22123&nbsp;\u00b0C or slightly lower but usually the coldest air drains into the valleys during calm, clear nights. The Blue Mountains is not known for particularly cold mornings compared to other areas on the Central Tablelands, such as Oberon, Bathurst and Orange. There are two to three snowfalls per year, although settled snow has become less common in recent decades, due solely to a strengthening Subtropical Ridge northwards of 34.5\u00b0 S. In the lower mountains, however, the climate is significantly warmer.\n\nAnnual rainfall is about {{convert|1050|mm|in}} in the Upper Blue Mountains<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluemts.com.au/tourist/about/climate.asp |title=Blue Mountains Weather and Climate |publisher=Bluemts.com.au |date=1 January 2003 |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref> with many misty days.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:BlueMountainspano6.jpg|thumb|left|Neates Glen, outside [[Blackheath, New South Wales|Blackheath]]]]\n[[File:Upper Wentworth Falls, NSW, Australia 2 - Nov 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Upper [[Wentworth Falls (waterfall)|Wentworth Falls]] as viewed along the National Pass walking track near the town of Wentworth Falls]]\n[[File:Greater_Western_Sydney_Map.gif|thumb|right|The [[Greater Blue Mountains Area]] is sometimes considered to be part of [[Greater Western Sydney]] region.]]\nThe predominant natural vegetation of the higher ridges is eucalyptus forest.

This is in turn a part of the larger [[East Australian Cordillera]] physiographic division.\n\n=== Bushfires ===\nThe main natural disasters to afflict the area are bush fires and severe storms. In recent years the lower mountains have been subjected to a series of bush fires which have caused great loss of property but relatively little loss of life. The upper mountains had not had a major fire for some decades until December 2002 (the Blackheath Glen Fire) and November 2006 when an extensive blaze in the Grose Valley threatened several communities including [[Bell, New South Wales|Bell]] and [[Blackheath, New South Wales|Blackheath]] (the Lawsons Long Alley Fire). This latest fire burned for almost a month but was extinguished, mainly due to a change in the weather, without loss of human life or property. A program of winter burning seemed to have been successful in reducing fires in the upper mountains.\n\nIn recent years, the brushfires have become far more destructive and expansive than before. The region was severely damaged in the [[2013 New South Wales bushfires]]. However, even this was dwarfed by the [[2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season]], during which the entire mountain range was devastated at a scale never seen before. According to preliminary reports, up to 80% of the World Heritage Area has burned as of January 2020, many of these being areas that had never burned in any previously observed bushfires. These destructive blazes have been linked to accelerating climate change.

The Carmarthen Hills were in the north of the region and the Lansdowne Hills were in the south. The name ''Blue Mountains'', however, was preferred<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ausdisc/ausdisc2-intro.html |title=Project Gutenberg Australia |publisher=Gutenberg.net.au |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref> and is derived from the blue tinge the range takes on when viewed from a distance. The tinge is believed to be caused by [[Mie scattering]] which occurs when incoming light with shorter wavelengths is preferentially scattered by particles within the atmosphere imparting a blue-greyish colour to any distant objects, including mountains and clouds. Volatile [[terpenoid]]s emitted in large quantities by the abundant eucalyptus trees in the Blue Mountains may cause Mie scattering and thus the blue haze for which the mountains were named.<ref name=\"Bohlmann2008\">{{cite journal|last1= Bohlmann|first1= J.|last2= Keeling|first2=C.

The site is known as Kings Tableland Aboriginal Site and dates back 22,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n=== European history ===\n[[Arthur Phillip]], the first governor of New South Wales, first glimpsed the extent of the Blue Mountains from a ridge at the site of today's Oakhill College, Castle Hill. He named them the Carmarthen Hills, \"some forty to sixty miles distant...\" and he reckoned that the ground was \"most suitable for government stock\". This is the location where Gidley King in 1799 established a prison town for political prisoners from Ireland and Scotland.\n\nThe first documented use of the name ''Blue Mountains'' appears in [[John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)|Captain John Hunter]]'s account of Phillip's 1789 expedition up the Hawkesbury River. Describing the events of about 5 July, Hunter wrote: \"We frequently, in some of the reaches which we passed through this day, saw very near us the hills, which we suppose as seen from Port Jackson, and called by the governor the Blue Mountains.\"<ref>Hunter, J. (1793) An Historical Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island. John Stockdale, London.</ref> During the nineteenth century the name was commonly applied to the portion of the Great Dividing Range from about Goulburn in the south to the Hunter Valley in the north, but in time it came to be associated with a more limited area.<ref name=\"Macqueen\" />\n\nThe native Aborigines knew two routes{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} across the mountains: Bilpin Ridge, which is now the location of [[Bells Line of Road]] between [[Richmond, New South Wales|Richmond]] and [[Bell, New South Wales|Bell]], and the [[Coxs River]], a tributary of the [[Nepean River]]. It could be followed upstream to the open plains of the Kanimbla Valley, the type of country that farmers prize.\n\nEuropean settlers initially considered that fertile lands lay beyond the mountains; while in the belief of many convicts China lay beyond. However, there was little fear that the mountains might provide a means of escape since they were considered impassable.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/writingplace/writing%20place%20essay.pdf |title= Beyond belonging?

An \"insurmountable\" barrier would deter convicts from trying to escape in that direction.\n\nA former convict, John Wilson, may have been the first European to cross the Blue Mountains. It is also believed that Mathew Everingham, 1795,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHistory.aspx?id=N0004 |title=DECCW &#124; Blue Mountains National Park&nbsp;\u2014 History since colonisation |publisher=Environment.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref> may have also been partly successful based on letters he wrote at the time which came to light in the late 1980s<!--NOTE: it is not certain that Wilson was the first to cross the mountains; if you disagree, please provide references-->. Wilson arrived with the First Fleet in 1788 and was freed in 1792. He settled in the bush, living with the Aborigines and even functioning as an intermediary between them and the settlers. In 1797 he returned to Sydney, claiming to have explored up to a hundred miles in all directions around Sydney, including across the mountains. His descriptions and observations were generally accurate, and it is possible that he had crossed the mountains via the southern aspect at the Coxs River corridor, guided by the Aborigines.<ref name=BMr/>{{rp|76\u201377}}\n\nGovernor Hunter was impressed by Wilson's skills and sent him on an expedition with John Price and others in January 1798. The party crossed the Nepean River and moved southwest towards the present site of [[Mittagong, New South Wales|Mittagong]]. There they turned west and found a route along the ridge where today the Wombeyan Caves Road is located. In the process they found a way to go west of the mountains, by going around them instead of across them. In March of the same year, Wilson and Price ventured to the Camden area, and then continued further south until they encountered Thirlmere Lakes, finally almost reaching the present site of [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]].\n\nIt is possible that the accomplishments of this expedition were suppressed by Hunter, who may not have wanted convicts to know that there was a relatively easy way out of Sydney.<ref name=BMr/>{{rp|83}} Wilson was killed by Aborigines after abducting an Aboriginal woman \"for his personal use\",<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=David|title=An account of the English colony in New South Wales|year=1804|publisher=T.

He was never recognised as the first person to cross the mountains, possibly because his Coxs River journey could not be verified, while his route west of Mittagong may have been the \"long way around\" for a colony that had its eyes fixed on the sandstone fortress west of the Nepean.\n\n[[File:Blaxland-map.jpg|thumb|left|Route of the [[Gregory Blaxland|Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|Lawson]], and [[William Wentworth|Wentworth]] Crossing of 1813]]\n[[File:The typical blue haze in the Jamison Valley behand the Three Sister.jpeg|thumb|left|The typical blue haze in the [[Jamison Valley]] behind the [[Three Sisters (Australia)|Three Sisters]], New South Wales, Australia.]]\n\nBetween 1798 and 1813, many people explored various parts of the mountains, from the Bilpin Ridge to the southern regions, today the site of the [[Kanangra-Boyd National Park]]. Still, they did not find a definite route across the mountains.\nThe [[1813 crossing of the Blue Mountains]] by [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and [[William Wentworth|William Charles Wentworth]] is officially credited as the first successful European crossing.<ref name=DictSydneyLawson>{{cite web|title=Lawson, William|url=http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/lawson_william|publisher=Dictionary of Sydney|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> Blaxland set out with Lawson and Wentworth on 11 May 1813 and succeeded in crossing the mountains by 31 May. They ventured as far as to what is now [[Mount Blaxland, New South Wales|Mount Blaxland]], just west of [[Coxs River]].\n\nIn November 1813, Macquarie sent the surveyor [[George Evans (explorer)|George Evans]] on an expedition to confirm the apparent discoveries made by Blaxland and his party. He was also told to see if there existed enough arable land to justify settlement. The issue had become more urgent because the colony was in the grips of a drought.\n\nEvans and his party reached the [[Fish River (Oberon)|Fish]] and [[Macquarie River|Macquarie]] rivers, and the site of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]].<ref>Shaping Australia \u2013 Explorers, Mitchell Scott (Watts Publishing) 2004, pp.5\u20136</ref> On 7 July 1814, construction of a road across the mountains was begun by [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]]. The work was at the behest of Governor Macquarie. 30 convict labourers and 8 guards completed the road on 14 January 1815 after 27 weeks of hard work.<ref name=BMr/>{{rp|145}}\n\nSince the Blue Mountains are rich in coal and shale, mining for these resources began in Hartley Vale in 1865. J.B. North ran a shale mine in the Jamison Valley in the 19th century,<ref name=SBMB/>{{rp|243}} and other operations were set up in several places. Locations for mining activities included the [[Jamison Valley]], the upper [[Grose Valley]], [[Newnes, New South Wales|Newnes]], [[Glen Davis, New South Wales|Glen Davis]] and the Asgard Swamp area outside [[Mount Victoria, New South Wales|Mount Victoria]]. Shale mining failed in the long run because it was not financially viable. \n[[File:(1)Ruins at Yerranderie.jpg|upright|thumb|Ruins at abandoned silver-mining town of Yerranderie (later reopened to tourism)]]\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate varies with elevation. At Katoomba, ({{convert|1010|m|ft|sigfig=4|abbr=on|disp=or}}) the summer average maximum temperature is around 22&nbsp;\u00b0C with a few days extending into the 30s (80s\u201390s \u00b0F) although it is quite common to see maximum temperatures stay in the teens when east coast troughs persist. Night-time temperatures are usually in the teens but can drop to single figures at times. During winter, the temperature is typically around 10 to 11&nbsp;\u00b0C in the daytime with \u22121&nbsp;\u00b0C or so on clear nights and 3 to 4&nbsp;\u00b0C on cloudy nights. Very occasionally it will get down to \u22123&nbsp;\u00b0C or slightly lower but usually the coldest air drains into the valleys during calm, clear nights. The Blue Mountains is not known for particularly cold mornings compared to other areas on the Central Tablelands, such as Oberon, Bathurst and Orange. There are two to three snowfalls per year, although settled snow has become less common in recent decades, due solely to a strengthening Subtropical Ridge northwards of 34.5\u00b0 S. In the lower mountains, however, the climate is significantly warmer.\n\nAnnual rainfall is about {{convert|1050|mm|in}} in the Upper Blue Mountains<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluemts.com.au/tourist/about/climate.asp |title=Blue Mountains Weather and Climate |publisher=Bluemts.com.au |date=1 January 2003 |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref> with many misty days.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:BlueMountainspano6.jpg|thumb|left|Neates Glen, outside [[Blackheath, New South Wales|Blackheath]]]]\n[[File:Upper Wentworth Falls, NSW, Australia 2 - Nov 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Upper [[Wentworth Falls (waterfall)|Wentworth Falls]] as viewed along the National Pass walking track near the town of Wentworth Falls]]\n[[File:Greater_Western_Sydney_Map.gif|thumb|right|The [[Greater Blue Mountains Area]] is sometimes considered to be part of [[Greater Western Sydney]] region.]]\nThe predominant natural vegetation of the higher ridges is eucalyptus forest.

This is in turn a part of the larger [[East Australian Cordillera]] physiographic division.\n\n=== Bushfires ===\nThe main natural disasters to afflict the area are bush fires and severe storms. In recent years the lower mountains have been subjected to a series of bush fires which have caused great loss of property but relatively little loss of life. The upper mountains had not had a major fire for some decades until December 2002 (the Blackheath Glen Fire) and November 2006 when an extensive blaze in the Grose Valley threatened several communities including [[Bell, New South Wales|Bell]] and [[Blackheath, New South Wales|Blackheath]] (the Lawsons Long Alley Fire). This latest fire burned for almost a month but was extinguished, mainly due to a change in the weather, without loss of human life or property. A program of winter burning seemed to have been successful in reducing fires in the upper mountains.\n\nIn recent years, the brushfires have become far more destructive and expansive than before. The region was severely damaged in the [[2013 New South Wales bushfires]]. However, even this was dwarfed by the [[2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season]], during which the entire mountain range was devastated at a scale never seen before. According to preliminary reports, up to 80% of the World Heritage Area has burned as of January 2020, many of these being areas that had never burned in any previously observed bushfires. These destructive blazes have been linked to accelerating climate change. There have been fears that the blazes may severely reduce the biodiversity of the area and even wipe out some of the threatened species in the area, such as the [[regent honeyeater]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== World Heritage listing ==\n{{main|Greater Blue Mountains Area}}\n\nThe Greater Blue Mountains Area was unanimously listed as a World Heritage Area by UNESCO on 29 November 2000, becoming the fourth area in New South Wales to be listed.<ref>Gardens of Stone National Park Information Sheet, National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales, October 2001</ref> The area totals roughly {{convert|10000|sqkm|sqmi}}, including the Blue Mountains, Kanangra-Boyd, Wollemi, Gardens of Stone, Yengo, Nattai and Thirlmere Lakes National Parks, plus the Jenolan Caves Karst Conservation Reserve.\n\nThis site was chosen to be included on the World Heritage list because:\n\n{{cquote|\"Criteria (ii) and (iv): Australia\u2019s eucalypt vegetation is worthy of recognition as of outstanding universal value, because of its adaptability and evolution in post-Gondwana isolation.

It was announced in May 2015 and separated from [[Google+]], the company's [[social network]].\n\nGoogle Photos gives users free, unlimited storage for photos up to 16&nbsp;[[megapixel]]s and videos up to 1080p&nbsp;[[Display resolution|resolution]]. The service automatically analyzes photos, identifying various visual features and subjects. Users can search for anything in photos, with the service returning results from three major categories: People, Places, and Things. The [[computer vision]] of Google Photos recognizes faces (not only those of humans, but pets as well), grouping similar ones together (this feature is only available in certain countries due to privacy laws); geographic landmarks (such as the [[Eiffel Tower]]); and subject matter, including birthdays, buildings, animals, food, and more. \n\nDifferent forms of [[machine learning]] in the Photos service allow recognition of photo contents,  automatically generate albums, animate similar photos into quick videos, surface past memories at significant times, and improve the quality of photos and videos. In May 2017, Google announced several updates to Google Photos, including reminders for and suggested sharing of photos, shared photo libraries between two users, and physical albums, with Photos automatically suggesting collections based on face, location, trip, or other distinction.\n\nGoogle Photos acts as a backup when photos are sent or in Google terms 'Shared'. This is just a common [[Remote backup service|backup tool]] when photos are shared between social media or other platforms or apps.\n\nGoogle Photos received critical acclaim after its decoupling from Google+ in 2015. Reviewers liked the updated Photos service for its recognition technology, search, apps, and loading times. Nevertheless, privacy concerns were raised, including Google's motivation for building the service, as well as its relationship to governments and possible laws requiring Google to hand over a user's entire photo history. Google Photos has seen strong user adoption. It reached 100&nbsp;million users after five months, 200&nbsp;million after one year, and 500&nbsp;million as of May 2017, with Google announcing that over 1.2&nbsp;billion photos are uploaded to the service every day, with the grand total of all uploaded content measuring over 13.7&nbsp;[[petabyte]]s of storage. For comparison, at the end of 2017, the entire [[Internet Archive]] held almost 40 petabytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=<!--https://archive.org/~tracey/mrtg/du.html-->|title=Used Paired Space|publisher=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Google Photos reached its 1 billion users mark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708328/google-photos-users-gallery-go-1-billion|title=Google Photos passes the 1 billion users mark|first=Jon|last=Porter|date=July 24, 2019|website=The Verge}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\nThe service has apps for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems, and a website.<ref name=\"Announcement\" /> Users back up their photos to the cloud service, which become accessible for all of their devices.<ref name=\"Recode review\" />\n\nThe Photos service analyzes and organizes images into groups and can identify features such as beaches, skylines, or \"snowstorm in Toronto\".<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> From the application's search window, users are shown potential searches for groups of photos in three major categories: People, Places, and Things.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> The service analyzes photos for similar faces and groups them together in the People category.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> It can also track faces as they age.<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> The Places category uses [[geotagging]] data but can also determine locations in older pictures by analyzing for major landmarks (e.g., photos containing the [[Eiffel Tower]]).<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> The Things category processes photos for their subject matter: birthdays, buildings, cats, concerts, food, graduations, posters, screenshots, etc. Users can manually remove categorization errors.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/>\n\nRecipients of shared images can view web galleries without needing to download the app.<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> Users can swipe their fingers across the screen to adjust the service's photo editing settings, as opposed to using sliders.<ref name=\"The Verge: hands\"/> Images can be easily shared with social networks (Google+, Facebook, [[Twitter]]) and other services.

He criticized the service's sync functions, and preferred folders of images over an unsorted \"flat database\".

It was announced in May 2015 and separated from [[Google+]], the company's [[social network]].\n\nGoogle Photos gives users free, unlimited storage for photos up to 16&nbsp;[[megapixel]]s and videos up to 1080p&nbsp;[[Display resolution|resolution]]. The service automatically analyzes photos, identifying various visual features and subjects. Users can search for anything in photos, with the service returning results from three major categories: People, Places, and Things. The [[computer vision]] of Google Photos recognizes faces (not only those of humans, but pets as well), grouping similar ones together (this feature is only available in certain countries due to privacy laws); geographic landmarks (such as the [[Eiffel Tower]]); and subject matter, including birthdays, buildings, animals, food, and more. \n\nDifferent forms of [[machine learning]] in the Photos service allow recognition of photo contents,  automatically generate albums, animate similar photos into quick videos, surface past memories at significant times, and improve the quality of photos and videos. In May 2017, Google announced several updates to Google Photos, including reminders for and suggested sharing of photos, shared photo libraries between two users, and physical albums, with Photos automatically suggesting collections based on face, location, trip, or other distinction.\n\nGoogle Photos acts as a backup when photos are sent or in Google terms 'Shared'. This is just a common [[Remote backup service|backup tool]] when photos are shared between social media or other platforms or apps.\n\nGoogle Photos received critical acclaim after its decoupling from Google+ in 2015. Reviewers liked the updated Photos service for its recognition technology, search, apps, and loading times. Nevertheless, privacy concerns were raised, including Google's motivation for building the service, as well as its relationship to governments and possible laws requiring Google to hand over a user's entire photo history. Google Photos has seen strong user adoption. It reached 100&nbsp;million users after five months, 200&nbsp;million after one year, and 500&nbsp;million as of May 2017, with Google announcing that over 1.2&nbsp;billion photos are uploaded to the service every day, with the grand total of all uploaded content measuring over 13.7&nbsp;[[petabyte]]s of storage. For comparison, at the end of 2017, the entire [[Internet Archive]] held almost 40 petabytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=<!--https://archive.org/~tracey/mrtg/du.html-->|title=Used Paired Space|publisher=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Google Photos reached its 1 billion users mark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708328/google-photos-users-gallery-go-1-billion|title=Google Photos passes the 1 billion users mark|first=Jon|last=Porter|date=July 24, 2019|website=The Verge}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\nThe service has apps for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems, and a website.<ref name=\"Announcement\" /> Users back up their photos to the cloud service, which become accessible for all of their devices.<ref name=\"Recode review\" />\n\nThe Photos service analyzes and organizes images into groups and can identify features such as beaches, skylines, or \"snowstorm in Toronto\".<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> From the application's search window, users are shown potential searches for groups of photos in three major categories: People, Places, and Things.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> The service analyzes photos for similar faces and groups them together in the People category.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> It can also track faces as they age.<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> The Places category uses [[geotagging]] data but can also determine locations in older pictures by analyzing for major landmarks (e.g., photos containing the [[Eiffel Tower]]).<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> The Things category processes photos for their subject matter: birthdays, buildings, cats, concerts, food, graduations, posters, screenshots, etc. Users can manually remove categorization errors.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/>\n\nRecipients of shared images can view web galleries without needing to download the app.<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> Users can swipe their fingers across the screen to adjust the service's photo editing settings, as opposed to using sliders.<ref name=\"The Verge: hands\"/> Images can be easily shared with social networks (Google+, Facebook, [[Twitter]]) and other services.

The shoreline was in the vicinity of Greenwich Street, which is closer to the site's eastern border. It was on this shoreline, close to the intersection of Greenwich and the former Dey Street, that Dutch explorer [[Adriaen Block]]'s ship, ''[[Tyger (ship)|Tyger]]'', burned to the waterline in November 1613, stranding him and his crew and forcing them to overwinter on the island. They built the first European settlement in [[Manhattan]].

That became something that you couldn't do even retroactively after 9/11.\" Other motifs included romance, depicted in the 1988 film ''[[Working Girl (film)|Working Girl]]'', and corporate avarice, depicted in ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite news |last=Poulou |first=Penelope |title=New York's Twin Towers Appear in Many Hollywood Films |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/new-yorks-twin-towers-appear-in-many-hollywood-films-128592413/165032.html |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |website=VOANews.com |date=August 29, 2011|access-date=February 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164507/https://www.voanews.com/a/new-yorks-twin-towers-appear-in-many-hollywood-films-128592413/165032.html|archive-date=March 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Comic books, animated cartoons, television shows, video games, and music videos also used the complex as a setting.{{sfnp|Langmead|2009|p=354}}\n\n==== After the September 11 attacks ====\n{{see also|List of entertainment affected by the September 11 attacks|List of cultural references to the September 11 attacks}}\nAfter the September 11 attacks, some movies and TV shows [[Cultural influence of the September 11 attacks|deleted scenes or episodes]] set within the World Trade Center.<ref name=\"Mashberg 2019\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/movies/9-11-twin-towers-tv-movies.html|title=After Sept. 11, Twin Towers Onscreen Are a Tribute and a Painful Reminder|last=Mashberg|first=Tom|date=September 10, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 13, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"EW.com 2013\">{{cite news |last=Bahr |first=Lindsay |title=Television's uneasy relationship with the World Trade Center |url=https://ew.com/article/2013/01/21/televisions-uneasy-relationship-with-the-world-trade-center/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=January 21, 2013|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226153248/http://ew.com/article/2013/01/21/televisions-uneasy-relationship-with-the-world-trade-center/|archive-date=February 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lemire |first=Christy |title=Twin towers erased from some films after 9/11 |url=http://www.today.com/id/44206574/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/twin-towers-erased-some-films-after/ |publisher=[[NBC News]] |website=Today.com |date=September 13, 2011|access-date=November 9, 2018 |language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109133908/http://www.today.com/id/44206574/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/twin-towers-erased-some-films-after/|archive-date=November 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfnp|Dixon|2004|p=4}} For example, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson]]\", which first aired in 1997, was removed from syndication after the attacks because a scene showed the World Trade Center.<ref>{{cite news |last=Snierson |first=Dan |title='Simpsons' exec producer Al Jean: 'I completely understand' if reruns with nuclear jokes are pulled |url=https://ew.com/article/2011/03/27/simpsons-al-jean-nuclear-japan/ |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |date=March 27, 2011|access-date=November 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708205626/http://ew.com/article/2011/03/27/simpsons-al-jean-nuclear-japan/|archive-date=July 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Songs that mentioned the World Trade Center were no longer aired on radio, and the release dates of some films, such as the 2001\u20132002 films ''[[Sidewalks of New York (2001 film)|Sidewalks of New York]], [[People I Know]],'' and [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|''Spider-Man'']], were delayed so producers could remove scenes that included the World Trade Center.<ref name=\"Mashberg 2019\" />{{sfnp|Langmead|2009|p=354}} The 2001 film ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]'', which was shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] the day before the attacks, had to be modified before its general public release, so the filmmakers could delete the scenes that depicted the World Trade Center.<ref name=\"Mashberg 2019\" />\n\nOther episodes and films mentioned the attacks directly, or depicted the World Trade Center in alternate contexts.<ref name=\"EW.com 2013\" /> The production of some family-oriented films was also sped up due to a large demand for that genre following the attacks.

''Mormon'' also commonly refers, specifically, to a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), which is often [[colloquially]], but imprecisely, referred to as the ''Mormon Church''. In addition, the term ''Mormon'' may refer to any of the relatively small sects of [[Mormon fundamentalism]], and any branch of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] that recognizes [[Brigham Young]] as the successor to founder [[Joseph Smith]]. The term ''Mormon'' applies to the religion of Mormonism, as well as its culture, texts, and art.\n\nThe term derives from the [[Book of Mormon]], a [[sacred text]] published in 1830 regarded by the faith as a supplemental Testament to the [[Bible]]. Adherents believe that the book was translated from an ancient record by Smith by the gift and power of God.  The text is said to be an ancient chronicle of a fallen and lost [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] nation, compiled by the prophet\u2013warrior, [[Mormon (Book of Mormon)|Mormon]], and his son, [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]], the last of the [[Nephite]] people. The term ''Mormon'' was applied to [[Latter Day Saint movement]] in the 1830s, and was soon embraced by the faith. Because the term became identified with [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]] in the mid-to-late-19th century, some Latter Day Saint denominations who never practiced polygamy have renounced the term.\n\n==Origin of the term==\n{{See also|Book of Mormon}}\nThe term ''Mormon'' is taken from the title of the Book of Mormon, a sacred text adherents believe to have been translated from [[golden plates]] which had their location revealed by [[Angel Moroni|an angel]] to Joseph Smith and published in 1830. According to the text of the Book of Mormon, the word Mormon stems from the [[Waters of Mormon|Land of Mormon]],<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://webdevilaz.com/religion/where-do-mormons-get-their-name-from |title=Where Do Mormons Get Their Name From? |publisher=WebDevilAZ |date=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref> where the prophet [[Alma (son of Alma)|Alma]] preached the gospel and baptized converts.

(Detroit: Gale, {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}}) pp. 561\u2013585.</ref> In this scheme, the \"Utah Mormon\" group includes the non-polygamous organizations descending from those Mormons who followed [[Brigham Young]] to what is now [[Utah]]. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is by far the largest of these groups, with a membership count totaling over 15,000,000 worldwide and the only group to initially reside in Utah. The \"Missouri Mormon\" groups include those non-polygamous groups that chose not to travel to Utah and are currently headquartered in Missouri, which Joseph Smith designated as the future site of the [[New Jerusalem]]. These organizations include [[Community of Christ]], [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], and others. \"Polygamy-Practicing Mormon\" groups are those that currently practice polygamy, regardless of location. Most notably, this category includes the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] (FLDS Church) and the  [[Apostolic United Brethren]] (AUB). \"Other Mormon\" groups include those that are not headquartered in Utah or Missouri and do not practice polygamy, such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]] and the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]].\n\nThe terms ''Utah Mormon'' and ''Missouri Mormon'' can be problematic if interpreted to mean more than the location of the various groups' headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The majority of members of \"Utah Mormon\" groups and \"Missouri Mormon\" groups no longer live in either of these US states. Although a majority of Utahns are members of the LDS Church, it has a worldwide membership with the majority of its members outside the [[United States]]. Nor do most \"Missouri Mormons\" live in Missouri.\n\n==Meaning of the word==\nThe May 15, 1843, issue of the official Mormon periodical ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' contains an article, purportedly written by Joseph Smith, deriving the etymology of the name ''Mormon'' from English \"more\" + Egyptian ''mon'', \"good\", and extolling the meaning as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt has been stated that this word [mormon] was derived from the Greek word ''mormo''.  This is not the case.  There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of God, translated the Book of Mormon. Let the  language of that book speak for itself. On the 523d page, of the fourth edition, it reads: And now behold we have written this record according to our knowledge in the characters which are called among us the ''Reformed Egyptian'' ... none other people knoweth our language; therefore [God] hath prepared means for the interpretation thereof.\" ... [The] Bible in its widest sense, means ''good''; for the Savior says according to the gospel of John, \"I am the ''good'' shepherd;\" and it will not be beyond the common use of terms, to say that good is among the most important in use, and though known by various names in different languages, still its meaning is the same, and is ever in opposition to ''bad''.  We say from the Saxon, ''good''; the Dane, ''god''; the Goth, ''goda''; the German, ''gut''; the Dutch, ''goed''; the Latin, ''bonus''; the Greek, ''kalos''; the Hebrew, ''tob''; and the Egyptian, ''mon''.  Hence, with the addition of ''more'', or the contraction, ''mor'', we have the word MOR-MON; which means, literally, ''more good''.<ref>[https://archive.today/20121202101852/http://patriot.lib.byu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/NCMP1820-1846&CISOPTR=8618&REC=9 \"Correspondence\"], ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' ([[Nauvoo, Illinois]]), vol. 4, no. 13, p. 194] (May 15, 1843); quoted in Joseph Smith ([[Joseph Fielding Smith]] ed., 1938) ''[[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) pp. 299\u2013300.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhether Smith was the actual author of this passage is uncertain.

''Mormon'' also commonly refers, specifically, to a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), which is often [[colloquially]], but imprecisely, referred to as the ''Mormon Church''. In addition, the term ''Mormon'' may refer to any of the relatively small sects of [[Mormon fundamentalism]], and any branch of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] that recognizes [[Brigham Young]] as the successor to founder [[Joseph Smith]]. The term ''Mormon'' applies to the religion of Mormonism, as well as its culture, texts, and art.\n\nThe term derives from the [[Book of Mormon]], a [[sacred text]] published in 1830 regarded by the faith as a supplemental Testament to the [[Bible]]. Adherents believe that the book was translated from an ancient record by Smith by the gift and power of God.  The text is said to be an ancient chronicle of a fallen and lost [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] nation, compiled by the prophet\u2013warrior, [[Mormon (Book of Mormon)|Mormon]], and his son, [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]], the last of the [[Nephite]] people. The term ''Mormon'' was applied to [[Latter Day Saint movement]] in the 1830s, and was soon embraced by the faith. Because the term became identified with [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]] in the mid-to-late-19th century, some Latter Day Saint denominations who never practiced polygamy have renounced the term.\n\n==Origin of the term==\n{{See also|Book of Mormon}}\nThe term ''Mormon'' is taken from the title of the Book of Mormon, a sacred text adherents believe to have been translated from [[golden plates]] which had their location revealed by [[Angel Moroni|an angel]] to Joseph Smith and published in 1830. According to the text of the Book of Mormon, the word Mormon stems from the [[Waters of Mormon|Land of Mormon]],<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://webdevilaz.com/religion/where-do-mormons-get-their-name-from |title=Where Do Mormons Get Their Name From? |publisher=WebDevilAZ |date=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref> where the prophet [[Alma (son of Alma)|Alma]] preached the gospel and baptized converts.

These organizations include [[Community of Christ]], [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], and others. \"Polygamy-Practicing Mormon\" groups are those that currently practice polygamy, regardless of location. Most notably, this category includes the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] (FLDS Church) and the  [[Apostolic United Brethren]] (AUB). \"Other Mormon\" groups include those that are not headquartered in Utah or Missouri and do not practice polygamy, such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]] and the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]].\n\nThe terms ''Utah Mormon'' and ''Missouri Mormon'' can be problematic if interpreted to mean more than the location of the various groups' headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The majority of members of \"Utah Mormon\" groups and \"Missouri Mormon\" groups no longer live in either of these US states.

This is not the case.  There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of God, translated the Book of Mormon. Let the  language of that book speak for itself. On the 523d page, of the fourth edition, it reads: And now behold we have written this record according to our knowledge in the characters which are called among us the ''Reformed Egyptian'' ... none other people knoweth our language; therefore [God] hath prepared means for the interpretation thereof.\" ... [The] Bible in its widest sense, means ''good''; for the Savior says according to the gospel of John, \"I am the ''good'' shepherd;\" and it will not be beyond the common use of terms, to say that good is among the most important in use, and though known by various names in different languages, still its meaning is the same, and is ever in opposition to ''bad''.  We say from the Saxon, ''good''; the Dane, ''god''; the Goth, ''goda''; the German, ''gut''; the Dutch, ''goed''; the Latin, ''bonus''; the Greek, ''kalos''; the Hebrew, ''tob''; and the Egyptian, ''mon''.  Hence, with the addition of ''more'', or the contraction, ''mor'', we have the word MOR-MON; which means, literally, ''more good''.<ref>[https://archive.today/20121202101852/http://patriot.lib.byu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/NCMP1820-1846&CISOPTR=8618&REC=9 \"Correspondence\"], ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' ([[Nauvoo, Illinois]]), vol. 4, no. 13, p. 194] (May 15, 1843); quoted in Joseph Smith ([[Joseph Fielding Smith]] ed., 1938) ''[[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) pp. 299\u2013300.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhether Smith was the actual author of this passage is uncertain.

Notably, the majority opinion found all judges are independent, not just superior court judges and inferior court judges concerned with criminal law, as the written constitution stipulates.  Unwritten constitutional principles were relied upon to demonstrate this, indicating such principles were growing in importance in constitutional interpretation.  The reference also remains one of the most definitive statements on the extent to which all judges in [[Canada]] are protected by the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]].\n\nThe majority opinion established that independent compensation commissions are required to help set salaries free of political manipulation.  These commissions, described by the majority as \"an institutional sieve\"<ref>Lamer C.J., para. 170.</ref> and by the dissent as \"a virtual [[fourth branch of government]]\", make recommendations that governments may deviate from only with rational explanations.  However, the reference has been subject to harsh published criticisms.\n\n==Background==\nThe reference was the amalgamation of three different sets of challenges to the impartiality and independence of provincial court judges in [[Manitoba]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Alberta]]. The powers of the provincial legislatures to reduce the salaries of the provincial court judges was challenged as a violation of [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11(d)]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which gives an accused the right to be [[presumption of innocence|presumed innocent]] until proven guilty \"in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal\".\n\nIn Prince Edward Island and Manitoba, the salaries of judges were lowered along with those of other [[civil servants]] to help combat [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]s.  In Prince Edward Island, various challenges of the judges' consequent independence were raised by defendants, causing the government to bring two reference questions to its Supreme Court.  Only one reference resulted in a finding of dependence, namely for lack of adequate security of tenure.  In Manitoba, the pay cut was challenged directly by a provincial judges association.  Meanwhile, in Alberta, cuts to judicial salaries were challenged by defendants.  Concerns in Alberta were also raised by [[Premier of Alberta|Alberta Premier]] [[Ralph Klein]] saying on the radio that a certain judge should be \"very, very quickly fired\". The judge had threatened to simply stop working due to his belief that his salary was insufficient.<ref>Lamer, para. 19.</ref>  (The Supreme Court only briefly addressed this, saying Klein's words were \"unfortunate and reflect a misunderstanding of the theory and practice of judicial independence in Canada\".<ref>Lamer, para. 286.</ref>)\n\n==Opinion of the Court==\n[[Antonio Lamer|Lamer]] C.J. with L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci JJ, allowed the appeals in part, stating that there was constitutional protection of judicial independence and impartiality for all judges.\n\nOne problem identified was that the independence of provincial judges was not protected as extensively as the federal judges were under sections 96 to 100 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]].  The majority read section 11(d) as only protecting independence in the exercise of jurisdiction in relation to offence (i.e., it would protect judges concerned with criminal law, but not [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]). However, section 11(d) is not a broad or exhaustive code. Instead, the Court looked to constitutional norms and found that judicial independence was one such norm implied by the [[preamble]] to the Constitution.  Although Lamer recognized case law such as the [[Patriation Reference]] which noted the preamble technically has no binding effect in itself, he also found the preamble reveals the \"basic principles which are the very source of the substantive provisions of the Constitution Act, 1867\" and \"invites the use of those organizing principles to fill out gaps in the express terms of the constitutional scheme\".<ref>Lamer C.J., para. 94\u201395.</ref> The implication of the importance of judicial independence came from the preamble's statement that Canada's constitution should be similar to the [[United Kingdom]]'s, and the UK has a tradition of judicial independence. The [[Act of Settlement of 1701]] was particularly important for independence. The Supreme Court had previously reached this conclusion in ''[[Beauregard v. Canada]]'' (1986).<ref>Lamer, para. 105.</ref> However, the Court now claimed that since courts are more important today, judicial independence has become a fundamental issue that should not just be reserved for the superior courts, as dictated by the Act of Settlement. The Constitution could adapt to changing circumstances in this regard. (This interpretation of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]] has inspired criticism. The British form of judicial independence was more limited in 1867, neither extending to inferior courts nor limiting government power to lower the judges' remuneration. At any rate, no act of Parliament can be declared ''[[ultra vires]]'' by a court in British law. This is why academic [[Jeffrey Goldsworthy]] attacked the decision as \"a self-contradiction, a vague reference to 'evolution' combined with a plainly false analogy, and an evasion\".<ref>Goldsworthy, Jeffrey. \"The Preamble, Judicial Independence and Judicial Integrity.\" ''FORUM Constitutionnel'' (2000) 11:2.</ref>)\n\nThe Court turned back to examine section 11(d) and from precedent, namely ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'', identified three fundamental requirements of judicial independence: 1) security of tenure, 2) financial security, and 3) some administrative independence. As well, judicial independence can be divided into two types of independence: 1) individual independence belonging to a judge and 2) institutional independence of a court as a whole. A judge must also be reasonably seen as being independent. It is possible, Lamer found, to interpret each of the three requirements in light of the two types of independence; this case, in particular, would explore how financial security belongs to both a judge and the court as a whole. This discussion would go beyond ''Valente'', since that decision only treated financial security as a matter of individual independence.<ref>Lamer, para. 119\u2013121.</ref>\n\nThe Court emphasized that the role of institutional independence has become expected of provincial courts due to their increased role in dispute resolution in the country. As a previous judicial independence case, ''Beauregard'', had demonstrated, institutional independence was needed so that courts could guard the Constitution, the [[rule of law]] and [[fundamental justice]].<ref>Lamer, para. 123.</ref>  This required more [[separation of powers]]; whereas judicial independence has normally been understood to protect the judiciary from the executive, the Court now found the judiciary should be free of manipulation from the legislative branch.<ref>Lamer, para. 125.</ref>  Provincial courts should benefit from this independence, as demonstrated by their handling of important cases such as ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.]]'' in 1983.<ref>Lamer, para. 127.</ref>\n\nFor these reasons, it was strongly suggested that the government establish judicial salary commissions, thus overruling ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in the previous landmark judicial independence case, ''Valente v. The Queen'', which had found such commissions were desirable but not necessary. In this case, it was noted commissions could guard against manipulation by both the executive ''and'' legislatures.  If remuneration of provincial judges is to be raised, lowered or kept the same, this may be done along with the remuneration of other government employees or with the judges' alone. The continued independence of judges, however, will be kept apparent in any of these circumstances if it involves review by an \"independent, effective, and objective\" body, i.e. the salary commissions.  While salary recommendations of these commissions should not be binding, they should be taken seriously. Any government rejection of a recommendation will have to be justified and may be challenged in a court.<ref>Lamer, para. 133.</ref> However, the justification need not be scrutinized to the extent that a government decision will be scrutinized under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Instead, governments must only show their rejections are rational, and rationality can be measured in the way it was measured by the Supreme Court in ''[[Reference re Anti-Inflation Act]]'' (1976).<ref>Lamer, para. 182\u2013183.</ref>\n\nAnother benefit for having salary commissions was that it eliminated direct salary negotiations between the government and judges. Such direct negotiations would naturally raise concerns about what exactly is being negotiated.  Namely, there was a concern that governments could manipulate judges to make decisions in certain ways.<ref>Lamer, para. 134.</ref> In order to ensure the government would not deliberately let judges' salaries fall below the cost of living, in relation to [[inflation]], it was also decided that the commissions should meet regularly, for example once every three to five years.<ref>Lamer, para. 147.</ref>\n\nSince judicial independence is guaranteed by the preamble, civil law judges have a right to these salary commissions, even though they have no rights under section 11(d).\n\nTurning to the facts of the case, the Supreme Court faulted the governments of Prince Edward Island and Alberta for neither consulting salary commissions nor having such bodies to begin with. For this reason, the actions of these governments breached section 11(d) of the Charter of Rights.<ref>Lamer, para. 200, 217.</ref>  Manitoba did have a salary commission, but its actions were unconstitutional because the provincial government did not use it.<ref>Lamer para. 224.</ref> Since these considerations were made using section 11(d), the Court considered whether violations of these rights could be justified under section 1 of the Charter of Rights, as is normal procedure. Section 1 typically requires a valid government reason for violating rights, and in this case Prince Edward Island and Alberta's actions failed the section 1 test because they did not explain why they did not have salary commissions. Likewise, Manitoba did not explain why they did not use their salary commission.<ref>Lamer, para. 278\u2013280.</ref>  An academic commentator has suggested the section 1 analysis was actually unneeded since the right to a commission is based in the preamble, which is not subject to section 1; the analysis was thus \"a first year law school mistake\".<ref>Kahana, Tsvi. \"The Constitution as a Collective Agreement: Remuneration of Provincial Court Judges in Canada\", (2004) 29 Queen's L.J., page 487.</ref>\n\n==Dissent==\nLa Forest J., alone in dissent, rejected the majority's finding of an unwritten constitutional principle that protects a right to judicial salary commissions. He was very wary of the \"discovery\" of such new principles, especially when some protection of judges can already be found elsewhere in the text of the Constitution, namely section 11(d), which was the subject of this case. The counsel had primarily relied on section 11(d) and only briefly spoke of unwritten rules.<ref>La Forest, para. 297.</ref> La Forest also suggested that section 11(d) granting independence only to inferior criminal law judges, and not inferior civil law judges, was deliberate, because \"Being accused of a crime is one of the most momentous encounters an individual can have with the power of the state.\"<ref>La Forest, para. 298.</ref>\n\nLa Forest went on to caution that \"judicial power\" is limited so that a court \"does not initiate matters and has no agenda of its own\".<ref>La Forest, para. 300.</ref> This made him worried about the majority launching into an extensive, unneeded discussion on unwritten principles.<ref>La Forest, para. 302.</ref> He accepted unwritten principles exist, but disputed that limits on government decisions can be found in the preamble. There was no tradition guarding judicial independence against Parliament.<ref>La Forest, para. 305.</ref> [[Parliamentary supremacy]] remained important in Britain even after the Act of Settlement; thus British courts cannot invalidate a law, even if the law is generally thought to be wrong.<ref>La Forest, para. 309.</ref> La Forest acknowledged this could be seen as a \"technical quibble\" since courts in Canada can invalidate laws, but he went on to point out that the Act of Settlement only covered superior judges, and not inferior judges.<ref>La Forest, para. 312\u2013313.</ref>  He also said courts should have clearer grounds for limiting legislative actions, casting previous decisions such as ''[[Switzman v. Elbling]]'' (1957), which relied on the [[Implied Bill of Rights]], into doubt. He pointed to ''[[Attorney General for Canada and Dupond v. Montreal]]'' (1978) as a prior Supreme Court decision questioning the Implied Bill of Rights.<ref>La Forest, para. 316-317.</ref> If an implied bill of rights existed, it should be found in the creation of Parliament, in section 17 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and should allow for Parliamentary supremacy instead of limiting it.<ref>La Forest, para. 318.</ref>\n\nIn this case, La Forest pointed to ''Valente'' and ''[[R. v. Lipp\u00e9]]'' to show section 11(d) does not guarantee a type of independence that is most favourable to judges.<ref>La Forest, para. 330.</ref> The conclusion in ''Valente'' that judicial compensation committees were not needed was therefore valid; section 11(d) left room for determining what methods can be used to achieve independence. In this case, judges' salaries were lowered along with those of other government employees, and this did not seem to raise reasonable concerns about judicial independence.<ref>La Forest, para. 334\u2013337.</ref> As a judicial compensation commission likely should not have a problem with this, as acknowledged by Lamer, La Forest found the requirement that the commission look into the matter to be \"a triumph of form over substance\".<ref>La Forest, para. 343.</ref>\n\nLa Forest also felt requiring such commissions was also \"tantamount to enacting a new constitutional provision to extend the protection provided by s. 11(d)\" by forcing the creation of \"what in some respects is a virtual fourth branch of government to police the interaction between the political branches and the judiciary\".  Judges simply asking whether government decisions seem reasonable would be enough.<ref>La Forest, para. 344.</ref>\n\n==Rehearing==\n{{main|Re Remuneration of Judges (No. 2)}}\nThe 1997 Reference caused numerous challenges regarding the creation of compensation committees.  Some governments needed more time to establish and consult them.  Moreover, by finding provincial courts were not independent because salary commissions were not used, the Reference seemed to imply criminal law decisions by provincial courts were invalid under section 11(d), since defendants were not tried before independent tribunals.  Consequently, the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island turned to the Court again.  In ''[[Re Remuneration of Judges (No. 2)]]'' (1998), Lamer for a unanimous court decided that necessity dictated that dependent provincial courts be deemed acceptable for the time being.  Also as a result of the second decision, the requirement for commissions did not become binding until September 18, 1998.\n\n==Aftermath==\nNotably, the reference had the effect of damaging the reputation of the judicial system. The outcome affecting remuneration has been seen as being motivated by greed. As one academic wrote, the judiciary's \"integrity has been tarnished by the perception of self-interest and [[bias]]\". This author also claimed that a resulting 35% raise for federal judges has led to burdensome [[tax]]es.<ref>LeRoy, Sylvia, \"Judicial Independence and the Integrity of the Judiciary\", ''Fraser Forum'', August 2004. Page 3.</ref> Another scholar wrote that the reference \"demonstrates that judges can be audacious, greedy and jealous\". This scholar said judges' [[standard of living]] prior to the reference was already good, and that provincial judges only seemed to want the same pay as federal judges.<ref>Kahana, page 448.</ref>\n\nScholars have offered various specific critiques for the majority opinion. Among these was that it was self-contradictory. The request that government reasons should be rational and legitimate seemed to ask for two separate things, namely reasonableness and correctness. Rationality allows for government reasons to be accepted if they are not overly flawed, even if courts disagree with them. Legitimacy, meanwhile, implies government decisions should be correct, i.e., consistent with commission recommendations.<ref>Kahana, 452.</ref> Professor [[Peter Hogg]] objected to the notion that governments and judges cannot directly negotiate. He wrote that \"It assumes that there is a real possibility that judges would violate their oath of office and decide cases wrongly (for example, by convicting an innocent person or imposing an unduly harsh penalty) in order to obtain some (highly speculative and likely trivial) advantage at the negotiating table.\"<ref>Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 188.</ref>\n\nHogg also felt the Reference made it increasingly unlikely that judges' salaries can be lowered.  In terms of case law, he pointed to ''[[Mackin v. New Brunswick]]'' (2002) as a case that, after the 1997 Reference, \"reinforced and even extended\" the notion that lowering judges' salaries could be unconstitutional.<ref>Hogg, page 187.</ref>\n\nAfter the Reference, all provinces had salary commissions. The Reference also inspired the federal government under [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] to establish a salary commission for federal judges, the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]].<ref>F.L. Morton and Ranier Knopff, ''The Charter Revolution & the Court Party'', (Toronto: Broadview Press, 2000), page 109.</ref> Still, the ''Provincial Judges Reference'' sparked further litigation as some provincial government's decisions not to follow commissions' salary recommendations were challenged in the courts. The Supreme Court addressed the matter again in 2005 in ''[[Provincial Court Judges' Assn. of New Brunswick v. New Brunswick (Minister of Justice)]]'' and urged courts to be deferential when governments give sufficient reasons for rejecting salary commissions' recommendations.\n\nSome scholars also expressed concern that the reference set a precedent for enforcing unwritten rules. This could lead to even wider grounds for [[judicial review]].<ref>LeRoy, 4.</ref> The study of unwritten rules is also said to have surfaced in the Supreme Court decisions ''[[New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)]]'' (1993) and ''[[Reference re Secession of Quebec]]'' (1998), and one scholar called it a \"very old and venerable\" feature of [[common law]].<ref>Walters, Mark D. \"The Common Law Constitution in Canada:  Return of ''Lex Non Scripta'' as Fundamental Law.\"  The University of Toronto Law Journal, Vol. 51, No. 2. (Spring 2001), page 91.</ref> Conversely, one critic, who claimed the 1997 Reference represented the first time that the unwritten constitution was used to invalidate a statute in Canada,<ref>Leclair, Jean.  \"Canada's Unfathomable Unwritten Constitutional Principles\", 27 Queen's L.J. 2002. page 391.</ref> said that courts had consequently grown \"bolder in their law-creating enterprise\"<ref>Leclair, 392.</ref> and that \"If law requires certainty, unwritten principles are bound to create problems.\"<ref>Leclair, 400.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Lamer Court)]]\n* ''[[Mackeigan v.

It is possible, Lamer found, to interpret each of the three requirements in light of the two types of independence; this case, in particular, would explore how financial security belongs to both a judge and the court as a whole. This discussion would go beyond ''Valente'', since that decision only treated financial security as a matter of individual independence.<ref>Lamer, para. 119\u2013121.</ref>\n\nThe Court emphasized that the role of institutional independence has become expected of provincial courts due to their increased role in dispute resolution in the country. As a previous judicial independence case, ''Beauregard'', had demonstrated, institutional independence was needed so that courts could guard the Constitution, the [[rule of law]] and [[fundamental justice]].<ref>Lamer, para. 123.</ref>  This required more [[separation of powers]]; whereas judicial independence has normally been understood to protect the judiciary from the executive, the Court now found the judiciary should be free of manipulation from the legislative branch.<ref>Lamer, para. 125.</ref>  Provincial courts should benefit from this independence, as demonstrated by their handling of important cases such as ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.]]'' in 1983.<ref>Lamer, para. 127.</ref>\n\nFor these reasons, it was strongly suggested that the government establish judicial salary commissions, thus overruling ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in the previous landmark judicial independence case, ''Valente v. The Queen'', which had found such commissions were desirable but not necessary. In this case, it was noted commissions could guard against manipulation by both the executive ''and'' legislatures.  If remuneration of provincial judges is to be raised, lowered or kept the same, this may be done along with the remuneration of other government employees or with the judges' alone. The continued independence of judges, however, will be kept apparent in any of these circumstances if it involves review by an \"independent, effective, and objective\" body, i.e. the salary commissions.  While salary recommendations of these commissions should not be binding, they should be taken seriously. Any government rejection of a recommendation will have to be justified and may be challenged in a court.<ref>Lamer, para. 133.</ref> However, the justification need not be scrutinized to the extent that a government decision will be scrutinized under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Instead, governments must only show their rejections are rational, and rationality can be measured in the way it was measured by the Supreme Court in ''[[Reference re Anti-Inflation Act]]'' (1976).<ref>Lamer, para. 182\u2013183.</ref>\n\nAnother benefit for having salary commissions was that it eliminated direct salary negotiations between the government and judges. Such direct negotiations would naturally raise concerns about what exactly is being negotiated.  Namely, there was a concern that governments could manipulate judges to make decisions in certain ways.<ref>Lamer, para. 134.</ref> In order to ensure the government would not deliberately let judges' salaries fall below the cost of living, in relation to [[inflation]], it was also decided that the commissions should meet regularly, for example once every three to five years.<ref>Lamer, para. 147.</ref>\n\nSince judicial independence is guaranteed by the preamble, civil law judges have a right to these salary commissions, even though they have no rights under section 11(d).\n\nTurning to the facts of the case, the Supreme Court faulted the governments of Prince Edward Island and Alberta for neither consulting salary commissions nor having such bodies to begin with. For this reason, the actions of these governments breached section 11(d) of the Charter of Rights.<ref>Lamer, para. 200, 217.</ref>  Manitoba did have a salary commission, but its actions were unconstitutional because the provincial government did not use it.<ref>Lamer para. 224.</ref> Since these considerations were made using section 11(d), the Court considered whether violations of these rights could be justified under section 1 of the Charter of Rights, as is normal procedure. Section 1 typically requires a valid government reason for violating rights, and in this case Prince Edward Island and Alberta's actions failed the section 1 test because they did not explain why they did not have salary commissions. Likewise, Manitoba did not explain why they did not use their salary commission.<ref>Lamer, para. 278\u2013280.</ref>  An academic commentator has suggested the section 1 analysis was actually unneeded since the right to a commission is based in the preamble, which is not subject to section 1; the analysis was thus \"a first year law school mistake\".<ref>Kahana, Tsvi. \"The Constitution as a Collective Agreement: Remuneration of Provincial Court Judges in Canada\", (2004) 29 Queen's L.J., page 487.</ref>\n\n==Dissent==\nLa Forest J., alone in dissent, rejected the majority's finding of an unwritten constitutional principle that protects a right to judicial salary commissions. He was very wary of the \"discovery\" of such new principles, especially when some protection of judges can already be found elsewhere in the text of the Constitution, namely section 11(d), which was the subject of this case. The counsel had primarily relied on section 11(d) and only briefly spoke of unwritten rules.<ref>La Forest, para. 297.</ref> La Forest also suggested that section 11(d) granting independence only to inferior criminal law judges, and not inferior civil law judges, was deliberate, because \"Being accused of a crime is one of the most momentous encounters an individual can have with the power of the state.\"<ref>La Forest, para. 298.</ref>\n\nLa Forest went on to caution that \"judicial power\" is limited so that a court \"does not initiate matters and has no agenda of its own\".<ref>La Forest, para. 300.</ref> This made him worried about the majority launching into an extensive, unneeded discussion on unwritten principles.<ref>La Forest, para. 302.</ref> He accepted unwritten principles exist, but disputed that limits on government decisions can be found in the preamble. There was no tradition guarding judicial independence against Parliament.<ref>La Forest, para. 305.</ref> [[Parliamentary supremacy]] remained important in Britain even after the Act of Settlement; thus British courts cannot invalidate a law, even if the law is generally thought to be wrong.<ref>La Forest, para. 309.</ref> La Forest acknowledged this could be seen as a \"technical quibble\" since courts in Canada can invalidate laws, but he went on to point out that the Act of Settlement only covered superior judges, and not inferior judges.<ref>La Forest, para. 312\u2013313.</ref>  He also said courts should have clearer grounds for limiting legislative actions, casting previous decisions such as ''[[Switzman v. Elbling]]'' (1957), which relied on the [[Implied Bill of Rights]], into doubt. He pointed to ''[[Attorney General for Canada and Dupond v. Montreal]]'' (1978) as a prior Supreme Court decision questioning the Implied Bill of Rights.<ref>La Forest, para. 316-317.</ref> If an implied bill of rights existed, it should be found in the creation of Parliament, in section 17 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and should allow for Parliamentary supremacy instead of limiting it.<ref>La Forest, para. 318.</ref>\n\nIn this case, La Forest pointed to ''Valente'' and ''[[R. v. Lipp\u00e9]]'' to show section 11(d) does not guarantee a type of independence that is most favourable to judges.<ref>La Forest, para. 330.</ref> The conclusion in ''Valente'' that judicial compensation committees were not needed was therefore valid; section 11(d) left room for determining what methods can be used to achieve independence. In this case, judges' salaries were lowered along with those of other government employees, and this did not seem to raise reasonable concerns about judicial independence.<ref>La Forest, para. 334\u2013337.</ref> As a judicial compensation commission likely should not have a problem with this, as acknowledged by Lamer, La Forest found the requirement that the commission look into the matter to be \"a triumph of form over substance\".<ref>La Forest, para. 343.</ref>\n\nLa Forest also felt requiring such commissions was also \"tantamount to enacting a new constitutional provision to extend the protection provided by s. 11(d)\" by forcing the creation of \"what in some respects is a virtual fourth branch of government to police the interaction between the political branches and the judiciary\".  Judges simply asking whether government decisions seem reasonable would be enough.<ref>La Forest, para. 344.</ref>\n\n==Rehearing==\n{{main|Re Remuneration of Judges (No. 2)}}\nThe 1997 Reference caused numerous challenges regarding the creation of compensation committees.  Some governments needed more time to establish and consult them.  Moreover, by finding provincial courts were not independent because salary commissions were not used, the Reference seemed to imply criminal law decisions by provincial courts were invalid under section 11(d), since defendants were not tried before independent tribunals.  Consequently, the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island turned to the Court again.  In ''[[Re Remuneration of Judges (No. 2)]]'' (1998), Lamer for a unanimous court decided that necessity dictated that dependent provincial courts be deemed acceptable for the time being.  Also as a result of the second decision, the requirement for commissions did not become binding until September 18, 1998.\n\n==Aftermath==\nNotably, the reference had the effect of damaging the reputation of the judicial system. The outcome affecting remuneration has been seen as being motivated by greed. As one academic wrote, the judiciary's \"integrity has been tarnished by the perception of self-interest and [[bias]]\". This author also claimed that a resulting 35% raise for federal judges has led to burdensome [[tax]]es.<ref>LeRoy, Sylvia, \"Judicial Independence and the Integrity of the Judiciary\", ''Fraser Forum'', August 2004. Page 3.</ref> Another scholar wrote that the reference \"demonstrates that judges can be audacious, greedy and jealous\". This scholar said judges' [[standard of living]] prior to the reference was already good, and that provincial judges only seemed to want the same pay as federal judges.<ref>Kahana, page 448.</ref>\n\nScholars have offered various specific critiques for the majority opinion. Among these was that it was self-contradictory. The request that government reasons should be rational and legitimate seemed to ask for two separate things, namely reasonableness and correctness. Rationality allows for government reasons to be accepted if they are not overly flawed, even if courts disagree with them. Legitimacy, meanwhile, implies government decisions should be correct, i.e., consistent with commission recommendations.<ref>Kahana, 452.</ref> Professor [[Peter Hogg]] objected to the notion that governments and judges cannot directly negotiate. He wrote that \"It assumes that there is a real possibility that judges would violate their oath of office and decide cases wrongly (for example, by convicting an innocent person or imposing an unduly harsh penalty) in order to obtain some (highly speculative and likely trivial) advantage at the negotiating table.\"<ref>Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 188.</ref>\n\nHogg also felt the Reference made it increasingly unlikely that judges' salaries can be lowered.  In terms of case law, he pointed to ''[[Mackin v. New Brunswick]]'' (2002) as a case that, after the 1997 Reference, \"reinforced and even extended\" the notion that lowering judges' salaries could be unconstitutional.<ref>Hogg, page 187.</ref>\n\nAfter the Reference, all provinces had salary commissions. The Reference also inspired the federal government under [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] to establish a salary commission for federal judges, the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]].<ref>F.L. Morton and Ranier Knopff, ''The Charter Revolution & the Court Party'', (Toronto: Broadview Press, 2000), page 109.</ref> Still, the ''Provincial Judges Reference'' sparked further litigation as some provincial government's decisions not to follow commissions' salary recommendations were challenged in the courts. The Supreme Court addressed the matter again in 2005 in ''[[Provincial Court Judges' Assn. of New Brunswick v. New Brunswick (Minister of Justice)]]'' and urged courts to be deferential when governments give sufficient reasons for rejecting salary commissions' recommendations.\n\nSome scholars also expressed concern that the reference set a precedent for enforcing unwritten rules. This could lead to even wider grounds for [[judicial review]].<ref>LeRoy, 4.</ref> The study of unwritten rules is also said to have surfaced in the Supreme Court decisions ''[[New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)]]'' (1993) and ''[[Reference re Secession of Quebec]]'' (1998), and one scholar called it a \"very old and venerable\" feature of [[common law]].<ref>Walters, Mark D. \"The Common Law Constitution in Canada:  Return of ''Lex Non Scripta'' as Fundamental Law.\"  The University of Toronto Law Journal, Vol. 51, No. 2. (Spring 2001), page 91.</ref> Conversely, one critic, who claimed the 1997 Reference represented the first time that the unwritten constitution was used to invalidate a statute in Canada,<ref>Leclair, Jean.  \"Canada's Unfathomable Unwritten Constitutional Principles\", 27 Queen's L.J. 2002. page 391.</ref> said that courts had consequently grown \"bolder in their law-creating enterprise\"<ref>Leclair, 392.</ref> and that \"If law requires certainty, unwritten principles are bound to create problems.\"<ref>Leclair, 400.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Lamer Court)]]\n* ''[[Mackeigan v.
