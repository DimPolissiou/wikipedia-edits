Portrayed as a snobbish and self-centered character, Rimmer is unpopular with his crewmates, and is often the target of insults and general ridicule.\n\nAfter he is killed by a radiation leak during an [[ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipsis]] in the series' first episode \"[[The End (Red Dwarf)|The End]]\" (1988) Rimmer is present for most of the series as a computer-generated [[Holography|hologram]], indicated by the \u2018H\u2019 symbol on his forehead. From series I-V, Rimmer is intangible as a hologram and unable to interact with his environment, referred to in-universe as 'soft-light'; come the series VI episode \"[[Legion (Red Dwarf)|Legion]]\" (1993), Rimmer is upgraded as a 'hard-light' hologram where he is now able to interact with his surroundings as well as being essentially indestructible, yet still able to feel pain. Following the character's departure in the series VII episode \"[[Stoke Me a Clipper]]\" (1997), Rimmer is absent from the show until series VIII, where a flesh and blood version of Rimmer is shown having been resurrected by [[nanobot]]s with no memory of the hologrammatic Rimmer's experiences and only those of Rimmer prior to the radiation leak in the first episode. However, following a ten-year hiatus after series VIII, the character reappeared as a hologram in the miniseries ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]'' (2009) onward.\n\nIt remains unclear whether this incarnation of Rimmer seen in ''Back to Earth'' and later series is the original hologram from series I-VII or a hologram of the Rimmer introduced in series VIII that was resurrected through [[nanotechnology]]. The fictional world of ''Red Dwarf'' would also allow for the possibility of Rimmer's latest incarnation being an amalgamation of the memories of both.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=M-Corp |episode-link=M-Corp (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=9 November 2017 |season= |series-no=XII |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Grant Naylor|creators]] of the series acknowledge that Rimmer's [[surname]] comes from a snobby [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]] with whom they attended school.

As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on [[vending machine]]s that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his \"engineer's exam\" which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers. After Lister is awakened from [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]], where he was put as punishment for bringing an unquarantined cat on board, the ship's computer [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] ([[Norman Lovett]]) tells Lister that the ship's crew died in a radiation leak from a drive plate Rimmer had improperly repaired and Lister was kept in stasis until the radiation levels returned to normal three million years later. Rimmer is depicted as having been brought back to life as a [[hologram]], having the same drives, feelings and emotions as the living Rimmer, but being unable to touch anything. The only other survivor on board ''Red Dwarf'' is a creature called \"[[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]]\" ([[Danny John-Jules]]), a descendant of Lister's pregnant cat who was safely sealed in the hold along with her unborn kittens during the radioactive crisis.<ref name=\"the end\">{{Cite episode |title=The End |episode-link=The End (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=15 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of \"[[Future Echoes]]\" (1988), Rimmer claims to have taken the \"astronavigation exam\" without passing nine times, or \"[t]en, if you count the time [he] had [his] spasm.\" He also claims in this episode that his father had said, \"Shiny clean boots and a spanking short haircut, and you can cope with anything,\" right before \"that unfortunate [[suicide]] business\".<ref name=\"future echoes\">{{Cite episode |title=Future Echoes |episode-link=Future Echoes |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=22 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=2 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Balance of Power (Red Dwarf)|Balance of Power]]\" (1988), Holly reveals that reason Rimmer was brought back as a hologram was because, in Holly's judgment, Rimmer was the best person to keep Lister sane because the two had shared fourteen million words between each other, making Rimmer the crew member with which Lister had the most interaction; in Holly's judgment, the fact that their interactions were almost entirely antagonistic was irrelevant. Lister later asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Navigation Officer [[Kristine Kochanski]]'s ([[Clare Grogan|C P Grogan]]) hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Lister might not turn Rimmer's hologram on again.<ref name=\"balance\">{{Cite episode |title=Balance of Power |episode-link=Balance of Power (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |author-link2=Doug Naylor |last2=Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=29 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Holly has the ability to override Rimmer and switch his disc off but cannot do so because Rimmer outranks Lister and he is programmed to prioritise the former's orders over the latter's.<ref name=\"balance\" />\n\nIn \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" (1988), Lister believes that the only reason that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a [[concussion]]. Lister, with the help of a solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by [[Craig Ferguson]]), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski's box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer.<ref name=\"confidence\">{{Cite episode |title=Confidence and Paranoia |episode-link=Confidence and Paranoia |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=14 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Me\u00b2]]\" (1988), Rimmer is shown moving in with his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also mentions taking a film course at [[night school]], although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are \"[[gazpacho soup]]\". Demonstrating intense, literal [[self-hatred]], the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to  a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during which he made a ''faux pas'' where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer for the rest of his life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that \"anybody could make a mistake like that.\" His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his \"death\" was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the \"gazpacho soup\" remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.<ref name=\"me squared\">{{Cite episode |title=Me\u00b2 |episode-link=Me\u00b2 |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nDespite \"Future Echoes\" having previously suggested that Rimmer's father killed himself, according to a letter received from Rimmer's mother in \"[[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf)|Better Than Life]]\" (1988), Rimmer's father (played by [[John Abineri]]) had died peacefully in his sleep and Rimmer appeared unaware about how his father had died before Lister read out to Rimmer what his letter said. Rimmer's backstory in this episode revealed that Rimmer had hated his father, who had fixated on Rimmer and his three brothers to join the Space Corps and become officers when Rimmer's father had been rejected for being an inch below regulation height. To this end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions. This led to Rimmer almost dying of [[malnutrition]]. Rimmer's father also stretched his sons on a [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] machine to make them taller, causing Frank to be 6'5\" by the time he was eleven. Rimmer disliked his parents enough to the point where he [[divorce]]d them from himself when he was fourteen; Rimmer getting paid [[Alimony|maintenance]] until employment age and access to the family dog every fourth weekend.<ref name=\"better than life episode\"/>\n\nAccording to \"[[Thanks for the Memory (Red Dwarf)|Thanks for the Memory]]\" (1988), Rimmer did a maintenance course at Saturn Tech.

He explains that when he was fifteen, he had a \"friend\", Porky Roebuck, to whom Rimmer believed that Porky's father having an affair with Rimmer's mother proved how close he and Porky were. Porky and Rimmer went on a Space Scouts survival course together, where Porky was the ringleader of a plan to eat Rimmer; Rimmer being tied to a stake and having [[barbecue sauce]] poured on him before he was almost cooked.

The ship crash lands on Earth in a reality where time runs backwards, leaving Kryten, Rimmer and Holly (now played by [[Hattie Hayridge]]) stranded. Rimmer and Kryten start working as the novelty act \"the Sensational Reverse Brothers\" and begin to enjoy life in this new reality, but after three weeks, they are fired by a pub manager ([[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]]) for a fight that Rimmer and Kryten only become involved in later that night.

Whilst the crew are chased by Rodon's battlecruiser, Cat angrily insists Rimmer is a simple machine. Rimmer rejects this initially, quoting \"[[cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore, I am]]\", however quickly loses confidence in this and enters an existential crisis. After the crew successfully escape into a sandstorm, Rimmer is comforted by Lister, who compares their dynamic to the sun and moon, producing moonlight even though the moon cannot initially generate it itself. By morning, the crew discover their buried under the sand, however Rimmer formulates a plan to contact the rebooted Holly, which Kryten manages using an antenna extension from his hand. Rimmer tricks the rebooted Holly into downloading his former incarnation's memories, with the rebooted Holly believing he'll inherit his \"wisdom\" from all the years he was alive. After doing so, the restored Holly rescues the crew and they manage to return to ''Red Dwarf''. However, the felis sapiens under Rodon are waiting for them, and Rodon orders their deaths by planting a bomb on ''Red Dwarf''. Using the acquired Anubis Stone attained from the cat clerics, they once again transform Rimmer into his former \"Diamond Light\" incarnation, who uses his powers to dispose of the bomb off ''Red Dwarf'', and subsequently helps bring down Rodon's main battlecruiser in the following confrontation.\n\nKryten, in a state of disrepair since the beginning of the story, is now on his last legs.

Instead the radiation leak is an entirely unrelated event caused by the negligence of a navigation officer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=2 November 1989 |title=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |title-link=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=46 |isbn=0-14-012437-3  |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Better Than Life]]'' (1990), similar to the [[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf episode)|episode of the same name]], the crew play Better Than Life, an extremely addictive [[virtual reality]] video game that slowly kills the user through tantalizing their yearnings by utilizing the user's [[subconscious]] desires. The crew slowly become engrossed in their individual fantasies, with Rimmer imagining himself as gaining enormous fame and adoration upon the crew's return to Earth and earning billions from memoirs and other deals. However, Rimmer's subconscious, unable to cope with good things happening to him, corrupts the game to make Rimmer's fantasy and later the other crew's fantasies go terribly wrong and make them want to leave the game. After Lister is trapped on another planet for over thirty years while the rest of the crew are trapped in the time dilation of a black hole, the now-sixty-year-old Lister has a heart attack while confronting a Polymorph, but Holly gives Rimmer instructions on how they can bring Lister back to life by taking him to a universe where time flows backwards.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=25 October 1990 |title=Better Than Life |title-link=Better Than Life |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe two novels follow divergent paths after the crew retrieve Lister from the backwards reality. \n\nIn ''[[Last Human]]'' (1995), Rimmer's one-night stand with Yvonne McGruder led to the birth of a son. Unbeknownst to either, there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night- Rimmer to prove a point and McGruder because she was delusional due to her concussion- leading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off ''Red Dwarf'' where she had Michael McGruder, who was born prior to the radiation leak that killed Rimmer and most of the crew onboard ''Red Dwarf''. She would tell him false stories of his father's courageous acts of valour and through these fictitious tales McGruder was inspired to become a Space Corps Marine and sign-up for a dangerous mission on board the ''Mayflower'', a large spaceship with [[terraformation]] capabilities, with the potential prospect of meeting his father, who via the [[black box]] of ''Red Dwarf'' he learned was resurrected as a hologram to keep the sole survivor, Lister, sane.\n\nFollowing a series of events, Lister had spent a period of time alongside McGruder and a handful of survivors from the ''Mayflower'', separate from the main crew of Rimmer, Kochanski, Cat, and Kryten. Upon their reunion with Lister, Rimmer was introduced to McGruder by Lister, who fainted at first glimpse of Rimmer, who also fainted when told who McGruder was. Later, encouraged by Lister, Rimmer confessed he was not the hero McGruder was told he was by his mother and that he should look up to her instead. However, McGruder was distraught by this and left, later being held hostage by Lister's Other Self, an evil doppelganger of the real Lister. Rimmer would choke when given the opportunity to incapacitate Lister's Other Self and was also taken hostage, further disappointing McGruder.\n\nImprisoned, Rimmer, with the help of Kryten, escapes and equips himself with a weapon he uses to defend the crew from Lister's Other Self, gaining the respect of Lister, Kochanski, and McGruder, but is shot through the light-bee and critically injured in the process. The crew manage to dispatch of Lister's Other Self but are quickly confronted by the Rage, a [[holism|gestalt]] manifestation of pure anger, which threatens to destroy everything in its path, including the crew. Rimmer, via his light-bee, volunteers to deliver the Oblivion Virus, the antidote able to eliminate the Rage. Kryten uploads in onto Rimmer's light-bee and as the crew take refuge in nearby caves Rimmer flings himself into the gestalt, killing it. Following this, the crew set up a search-party, headed by McGruder, to retrieve Rimmer's light-bee and hopefully bring him back.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Doug |author-link=Doug Naylor |date=1995 |title=Last Human |title-link=Last Human |url= |location= |publisher=[[Viking Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Backwards (novel)|Backwards]]'' (1996), after the crew spend a decade trapped on the backwards Earth, they return to their universe to find that ''Red Dwarf'' has been stolen and Holly basically destroyed by the [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Agonoids]], a race of [[misanthropic]] robots. The crew gain a brief ally in the form of Ace Rimmer, an alternate and dynamic version of Rimmer who arrived in their world in a dimension-hopping prototype ship, but Ace subsequently sacrifices himself to save Lister from an Agonoid. When one Agonoid kills the rest of his race so that he can be the one to torture Lister, the crew are able to expel him into deep space, but the agonoid is able to infect ''Starbug'' with the Armageddon Virus before they can return to ''Red Dwarf''. In an attempt to fight it, Kryten purposely contracts it himself and, in a simulation of the [[American frontier|American wild west]], is the sheriff of a small town in a battle against the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Apocalypse Boys]], the simulated manifestation of the Armageddon Virus. Rimmer, alongside Lister and Cat, enter the simulation to help Kryten. However, the Apocalypse Boys prove stronger than anticipated and end up melting Rimmer's light-bee and destroying Kryten, as well as rending ''Starbug'' inoperable. With nothing left to keep them in this reality, Lister and the Cat use Ace's ship to travel to another reality where their counterparts died while playing ''Better Than Life'' but Rimmer and Kryten are still alive. \n\nIn the abridged audiobook, as read by author [[Rob Grant]], the wild west simulation section is cut and instead Rimmer's light-bee is sucked into deep space following a hostage crisis with the Agonoid, Djuhn'Keep, onboard ''Starbug''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Rob |author-link=Rob Grant |date=1996 |title=Backwards |title-link=Backwards (Red Dwarf) |url= |location= |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nRimmer's primary character traits include [[anal retentive|anal-retentiveness]], over-adherence to protocol, [[cowardice]], bitterness and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of [[self-loathing]], which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others.

Kryten further argues that Rimmer only felt guilty for causing the accident because of his delusions about his importance to the mission, comparing him to a front-gate security guard who considers himself corporate head. Kryten then went on to state that Rimmer's only crime is that of being Arnold J. Rimmer, which should also serve as a punishment. In keeping with his defective personality, Rimmer continually objects to his own defence (despite its effectiveness) on the grounds that he believes he is being portrayed unfairly.<ref name=\"justice\"/>\n\nRimmer was finally able to live his fantasy of commanding an army in the episode \"[[Meltdown (Red Dwarf)|Meltdown]]\" (1991), leading an army of \"good\" wax-droids against a much larger force of \"evil\" wax-droids.

Following the character's departure in the series VII episode \"[[Stoke Me a Clipper]]\" (1997), Rimmer is absent from the show until series VIII, where a flesh and blood version of Rimmer is shown having been resurrected by [[nanobot]]s with no memory of the hologrammatic Rimmer's experiences and only those of Rimmer prior to the radiation leak in the first episode. However, following a ten-year hiatus after series VIII, the character reappeared as a hologram in the miniseries ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]'' (2009) onward.\n\nIt remains unclear whether this incarnation of Rimmer seen in ''Back to Earth'' and later series is the original hologram from series I-VII or a hologram of the Rimmer introduced in series VIII that was resurrected through [[nanotechnology]]. The fictional world of ''Red Dwarf'' would also allow for the possibility of Rimmer's latest incarnation being an amalgamation of the memories of both.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=M-Corp |episode-link=M-Corp (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=9 November 2017 |season= |series-no=XII |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Grant Naylor|creators]] of the series acknowledge that Rimmer's [[surname]] comes from a snobby [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]] with whom they attended school.

As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on [[vending machine]]s that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his \"engineer's exam\" which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers.

Lister later asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Navigation Officer [[Kristine Kochanski]]'s ([[Clare Grogan|C P Grogan]]) hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Lister might not turn Rimmer's hologram on again.<ref name=\"balance\">{{Cite episode |title=Balance of Power |episode-link=Balance of Power (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |author-link2=Doug Naylor |last2=Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=29 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Holly has the ability to override Rimmer and switch his disc off but cannot do so because Rimmer outranks Lister and he is programmed to prioritise the former's orders over the latter's.<ref name=\"balance\" />\n\nIn \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" (1988), Lister believes that the only reason that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a [[concussion]]. Lister, with the help of a solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by [[Craig Ferguson]]), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once.

Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also mentions taking a film course at [[night school]], although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are \"[[gazpacho soup]]\". Demonstrating intense, literal [[self-hatred]], the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to  a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during which he made a ''faux pas'' where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer for the rest of his life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that \"anybody could make a mistake like that.\" His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his \"death\" was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the \"gazpacho soup\" remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.<ref name=\"me squared\">{{Cite episode |title=Me\u00b2 |episode-link=Me\u00b2 |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nDespite \"Future Echoes\" having previously suggested that Rimmer's father killed himself, according to a letter received from Rimmer's mother in \"[[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf)|Better Than Life]]\" (1988), Rimmer's father (played by [[John Abineri]]) had died peacefully in his sleep and Rimmer appeared unaware about how his father had died before Lister read out to Rimmer what his letter said. Rimmer's backstory in this episode revealed that Rimmer had hated his father, who had fixated on Rimmer and his three brothers to join the Space Corps and become officers when Rimmer's father had been rejected for being an inch below regulation height. To this end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions. This led to Rimmer almost dying of [[malnutrition]]. Rimmer's father also stretched his sons on a [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] machine to make them taller, causing Frank to be 6'5\" by the time he was eleven.

In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to ''Red Dwarf''.\n\nIt is strongly implied in this episode that this version of Rimmer remembers dying from the radiation leak but also remembers saving the ship from the corrosive micro-organism that was devouring it in the episode \"Only the Good...\".

After receiving a distress signal, Rimmer refuses to respond, deciding their too old to be embarking on new adventures, ordering Kryten to erase the memory of receiving it from his memory. After being banished off ''Red Dwarf'' by the newly-rebooted Holly (void of his old memories and personality), the crew eventually come across a ship possessing new and powerful technology, specifically related to holograms. Against Kryten's initial warnings, Rimmer is upgraded to 'Dimaond Light', which grants his superpowers; however, Rimmer is quickly depleted of power and returns to his old form, now forced to be \"plugged-in\" to several power leads to stay online.

Whilst the crew are chased by Rodon's battlecruiser, Cat angrily insists Rimmer is a simple machine. Rimmer rejects this initially, quoting \"[[cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore, I am]]\", however quickly loses confidence in this and enters an existential crisis. After the crew successfully escape into a sandstorm, Rimmer is comforted by Lister, who compares their dynamic to the sun and moon, producing moonlight even though the moon cannot initially generate it itself. By morning, the crew discover their buried under the sand, however Rimmer formulates a plan to contact the rebooted Holly, which Kryten manages using an antenna extension from his hand. Rimmer tricks the rebooted Holly into downloading his former incarnation's memories, with the rebooted Holly believing he'll inherit his \"wisdom\" from all the years he was alive. After doing so, the restored Holly rescues the crew and they manage to return to ''Red Dwarf''. However, the felis sapiens under Rodon are waiting for them, and Rodon orders their deaths by planting a bomb on ''Red Dwarf''.

However, Rimmer's subconscious, unable to cope with good things happening to him, corrupts the game to make Rimmer's fantasy and later the other crew's fantasies go terribly wrong and make them want to leave the game. After Lister is trapped on another planet for over thirty years while the rest of the crew are trapped in the time dilation of a black hole, the now-sixty-year-old Lister has a heart attack while confronting a Polymorph, but Holly gives Rimmer instructions on how they can bring Lister back to life by taking him to a universe where time flows backwards.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=25 October 1990 |title=Better Than Life |title-link=Better Than Life |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe two novels follow divergent paths after the crew retrieve Lister from the backwards reality. \n\nIn ''[[Last Human]]'' (1995), Rimmer's one-night stand with Yvonne McGruder led to the birth of a son. Unbeknownst to either, there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night- Rimmer to prove a point and McGruder because she was delusional due to her concussion- leading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off ''Red Dwarf'' where she had Michael McGruder, who was born prior to the radiation leak that killed Rimmer and most of the crew onboard ''Red Dwarf''. She would tell him false stories of his father's courageous acts of valour and through these fictitious tales McGruder was inspired to become a Space Corps Marine and sign-up for a dangerous mission on board the ''Mayflower'', a large spaceship with [[terraformation]] capabilities, with the potential prospect of meeting his father, who via the [[black box]] of ''Red Dwarf'' he learned was resurrected as a hologram to keep the sole survivor, Lister, sane.\n\nFollowing a series of events, Lister had spent a period of time alongside McGruder and a handful of survivors from the ''Mayflower'', separate from the main crew of Rimmer, Kochanski, Cat, and Kryten. Upon their reunion with Lister, Rimmer was introduced to McGruder by Lister, who fainted at first glimpse of Rimmer, who also fainted when told who McGruder was. Later, encouraged by Lister, Rimmer confessed he was not the hero McGruder was told he was by his mother and that he should look up to her instead. However, McGruder was distraught by this and left, later being held hostage by Lister's Other Self, an evil doppelganger of the real Lister. Rimmer would choke when given the opportunity to incapacitate Lister's Other Self and was also taken hostage, further disappointing McGruder.\n\nImprisoned, Rimmer, with the help of Kryten, escapes and equips himself with a weapon he uses to defend the crew from Lister's Other Self, gaining the respect of Lister, Kochanski, and McGruder, but is shot through the light-bee and critically injured in the process. The crew manage to dispatch of Lister's Other Self but are quickly confronted by the Rage, a [[holism|gestalt]] manifestation of pure anger, which threatens to destroy everything in its path, including the crew. Rimmer, via his light-bee, volunteers to deliver the Oblivion Virus, the antidote able to eliminate the Rage. Kryten uploads in onto Rimmer's light-bee and as the crew take refuge in nearby caves Rimmer flings himself into the gestalt, killing it. Following this, the crew set up a search-party, headed by McGruder, to retrieve Rimmer's light-bee and hopefully bring him back.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Doug |author-link=Doug Naylor |date=1995 |title=Last Human |title-link=Last Human |url= |location= |publisher=[[Viking Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Backwards (novel)|Backwards]]'' (1996), after the crew spend a decade trapped on the backwards Earth, they return to their universe to find that ''Red Dwarf'' has been stolen and Holly basically destroyed by the [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Agonoids]], a race of [[misanthropic]] robots. The crew gain a brief ally in the form of Ace Rimmer, an alternate and dynamic version of Rimmer who arrived in their world in a dimension-hopping prototype ship, but Ace subsequently sacrifices himself to save Lister from an Agonoid. When one Agonoid kills the rest of his race so that he can be the one to torture Lister, the crew are able to expel him into deep space, but the agonoid is able to infect ''Starbug'' with the Armageddon Virus before they can return to ''Red Dwarf''. In an attempt to fight it, Kryten purposely contracts it himself and, in a simulation of the [[American frontier|American wild west]], is the sheriff of a small town in a battle against the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Apocalypse Boys]], the simulated manifestation of the Armageddon Virus. Rimmer, alongside Lister and Cat, enter the simulation to help Kryten. However, the Apocalypse Boys prove stronger than anticipated and end up melting Rimmer's light-bee and destroying Kryten, as well as rending ''Starbug'' inoperable. With nothing left to keep them in this reality, Lister and the Cat use Ace's ship to travel to another reality where their counterparts died while playing ''Better Than Life'' but Rimmer and Kryten are still alive. \n\nIn the abridged audiobook, as read by author [[Rob Grant]], the wild west simulation section is cut and instead Rimmer's light-bee is sucked into deep space following a hostage crisis with the Agonoid, Djuhn'Keep, onboard ''Starbug''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Rob |author-link=Rob Grant |date=1996 |title=Backwards |title-link=Backwards (Red Dwarf) |url= |location= |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nRimmer's primary character traits include [[anal retentive|anal-retentiveness]], over-adherence to protocol, [[cowardice]], bitterness and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of [[self-loathing]], which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others.

Kryten further argues that Rimmer only felt guilty for causing the accident because of his delusions about his importance to the mission, comparing him to a front-gate security guard who considers himself corporate head. Kryten then went on to state that Rimmer's only crime is that of being Arnold J. Rimmer, which should also serve as a punishment. In keeping with his defective personality, Rimmer continually objects to his own defence (despite its effectiveness) on the grounds that he believes he is being portrayed unfairly.<ref name=\"justice\"/>\n\nRimmer was finally able to live his fantasy of commanding an army in the episode \"[[Meltdown (Red Dwarf)|Meltdown]]\" (1991), leading an army of \"good\" wax-droids against a much larger force of \"evil\" wax-droids.

It is used in the study of [[differential equations]], where it can sometimes show [[linear independence]] in a set of solutions.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe Wronskian of two differentiable functions {{math|''f''\u2009}} and {{math|''g''}} is {{math|''W''(''f'',\u2009''g'') {{=}} ''f\u2009g''\u2032 \u2013 ''g\u2009f\u2009''\u2032}}.\n\nMore generally, for {{math|''n''}} [[real number|real]]- or [[complex number|complex]]-valued functions {{math|''f''<sub>1</sub>, . . . , ''f<sub>n</sub>''}}, which are {{math|''n'' \u2013 1}} times [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|''I''}}, the Wronskian {{math|''W''(''f''<sub>1</sub>, . . . , ''f<sub>n</sub>'')}} as a function on {{math|''I''}} is defined by\n\n:<math>\nW(f_1, \\ldots, f_n) (x)=\n\\begin{vmatrix}\nf_1(x) & f_2(x) & \\cdots & f_n(x) \\\\\nf_1'(x) & f_2'(x) & \\cdots & f_n' (x)\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nf_1^{(n-1)}(x)& f_2^{(n-1)}(x) & \\cdots & f_n^{(n-1)}(x)\n\\end{vmatrix},\\qquad x\\in I.\n</math>\n\nThat is, it is the [[determinant]] of the [[matrix (math)|matrix]] constructed by placing the functions in the first row, the first derivative of each function in the second row, and so on through the {{math|(''n'' \u2013 1)}}th derivative, thus forming a [[square matrix]] sometimes called a '''fundamental matrix'''.\n\nWhen the functions {{math|''f<sub>i</sub>''}} are solutions of a [[linear differential equation]], the Wronskian can be found explicitly using [[Abel's identity]], even if the functions {{math|''f<sub>i</sub>''}} are not known explicitly.\n\n== The Wronskian and linear independence ==\n\nIf the functions {{math|''f<sub>i</sub>''}} are linearly dependent, then so are the columns of the Wronskian as differentiation is a linear operation, so the Wronskian vanishes. Thus, the Wronskian can be used to show that a set of differentiable functions is [[linear independence|linearly independent]] on an interval by showing that it does not vanish identically.

There are several extra conditions which ensure that the vanishing of the Wronskian in an interval implies linear dependence.\n{{harvtxt|Peano|1889}} observed that if the functions are analytic, then the vanishing of the Wronskian in an interval implies that they are linearly dependent. (Peano  published his example twice, because the first time he published it, an editor, [[Paul Mansion]], who had written a textbook incorrectly claiming that the vanishing of the Wronskian implies linear dependence, added a footnote to Peano's paper claiming that this result is correct as long as neither function is identically zero. Peano's second paper pointed out that this footnote was nonsense.) {{harvtxt|Bocher|1901}} gave several other conditions for the vanishing of the Wronskian to imply linear dependence; for example, if the Wronskian of {{math|''n''}} functions is identically zero and the {{math|''n''}} Wronskians of {{math|''n'' \u2013 1}} of them do not all vanish at any point then the functions are linearly dependent. {{harvtxt|Wolsson|1989a}} gave a more general condition that together with the vanishing of the Wronskian implies linear dependence.\n\nOver fields of positive characteristic ''p'' the Wronskian may vanish even for linearly independent polynomials; for example, the Wronskian of ''x''<sup>''p''</sup> and 1 is identically 0.\n\n== Application to linear differential equations ==\nIn general, for an <math>n</math>th order linear differential equation, if <math> (n-1) </math> solutions are known, the last one can be determined by using the Wronskian.\n\nConsider the second order differential equation in [[Notation for differentiation#Lagrange's notation|Lagrange's notation]]\n\n:<math>\ny''=a(x)y'+b(x)y\n</math>\n\nwhere <math> a(x),b(x) </math> are known. Let us call <math> y_1, y_2 </math> the two solutions of the equation and form their Wronskian\n\n:<math>\nW(x)=y_1 y'_2 - y_2 y'_1\n</math>\n\nThen differentiating <math> W(x) </math> and using the fact that <math> y_i </math> obey the above differential equation shows that\n\n:<math>\nW'(x)=a W(x)\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the Wronskian obeys a simple first order differential equation and can be exactly solved:\n\n:<math>\nW(x)= e^{A(x)}\n</math>\nwhere <math> A'(x)=a(x) </math>\n\nNow suppose that we know one of the solutions, say <math> y_2 </math>. Then, by the definition of the Wronskian, <math> y_1 </math> obeys a first order differential equation:\n\n:<math>\ny'_1 -\\frac{y'_2}{y_2} y_1 = -W(x)/y_2\n</math>\n\nand can be solved exactly (at least in theory).\n\nThe method is easily generalized to higher order equations.\n\n== Generalized Wronskians ==\n\nFor {{math|''n''}} functions of several variables, a '''generalized Wronskian''' is a determinant of an {{math|''n''}} by {{math|''n''}} matrix with entries {{math|''D<sub>i</sub>''(''f<sub>j</sub>'')}} (with {{math|0 \u2264 ''i'' < ''n''}}), where each {{math|''D<sub>i</sub>''}} is some constant coefficient linear partial differential operator of order {{math|''i''}}. If the functions are linearly dependent then all generalized Wronskians vanish. As in the 1 variable case the converse is not true in general: if all generalized Wronskians vanish, this does not imply that the functions are linearly dependent.

Thus, the Wronskian can be used to show that a set of differentiable functions is [[linear independence|linearly independent]] on an interval by showing that it does not vanish identically. It may, however, vanish at isolated points.<ref name=\"BenderAndOrszag\">{{Citation\n | last = Bender\n | first = Carl M.\n | author-link = Carl M.

There are several extra conditions which ensure that the vanishing of the Wronskian in an interval implies linear dependence.\n{{harvtxt|Peano|1889}} observed that if the functions are analytic, then the vanishing of the Wronskian in an interval implies that they are linearly dependent. (Peano  published his example twice, because the first time he published it an editor [[Paul Mansion]], who had written a textbook incorrectly claiming that the vanishing of the Wronskian implies linear dependence, added a footnote to Peano's paper claiming that this result is correct as long as neither function is identically zero. Peano's second paper pointed out that this footnote was nonsense.) {{harvtxt|Bocher|1901}} gave several other conditions for the vanishing of the Wronskian to imply linear dependence; for example, if the Wronskian of {{math|''n''}} functions is identically zero and the {{math|''n''}} Wronskians of {{math|''n'' \u2013 1}} of them do not all vanish at any point then the functions are linearly dependent. {{harvtxt|Wolsson|1989a}} gave a more general condition that together with the vanishing of the Wronskian implies linear dependence.\n\nOver fields of positive characteristic ''p'' the Wronskian may vanish even for linearly independent polynomials; for example, the Wronskian of ''x''<sup>''p''</sup> and 1 is identically 0.\n\n== Application to linear differential equations ==\nIn general, for an <math>n</math>th order linear differential equation, if <math> (n-1) </math> solutions are known, the last one can be determined by using the Wronskian.\n\nConsider the second order differential equation in [[Notation for differentiation#Lagrange's notation|Lagrange's notation]]\n\n:<math>\ny''=a(x)y'+b(x)y\n</math>\n\nwhere <math> a(x),b(x) </math> are known. Let us call <math> y_1, y_2 </math> the two solutions of the equation and form their Wronskian\n\n:<math>\nW(x)=y_1 y'_2 - y_2 y'_1\n</math>\n\nThen differentiating <math> W(x) </math> and using the fact that <math> y_i </math> obey the above differential equation shows that\n\n:<math>\nW'(x)=a W(x)\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the Wronskian obeys a simple first order differential equation and can be exactly solved:\n\n:<math>\nW(x)= e^{A(x)}\n</math>\nwhere <math> A'(x)=a(x) </math>\n\nNow suppose that we know one of the solutions, say <math> y_2 </math>. Then, by the definition of the Wronskian, <math> y_1 </math> obeys a first order differential equation:\n\n:<math>\ny'_1 -\\frac{y'_2}{y_2} y_1 = -W(x)/y_2\n</math>\n\nand can be solved exactly (at least in theory).\n\nThe method is easily generalized to higher order equations.\n\n== Generalized Wronskians ==\n\nFor {{math|''n''}} functions of several variables, a '''generalized Wronskian''' is a determinant of an {{math|''n''}} by {{math|''n''}} matrix with entries {{math|''D<sub>i</sub>''(''f<sub>j</sub>'')}} (with {{math|0 \u2264 ''i'' < ''n''}}), where each {{math|''D<sub>i</sub>''}} is some constant coefficient linear partial differential operator of order {{math|''i''}}. If the functions are linearly dependent then all generalized Wronskians vanish. As in the 1 variable case the converse is not true in general: if all generalized Wronskians vanish, this does not imply that the functions are linearly dependent. However, the converse is true in many special cases. For example, if the functions are polynomials and all generalized Wronskians vanish, then the functions are linearly dependent. Roth used this result about generalized Wronskians in his proof of [[Thue\u2013Siegel\u2013Roth theorem|Roth's theorem]].

The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees. The agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far away as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joel Campagna |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php |title=Between Two Worlds |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Bryson |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified? |publisher=Newsmax |date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127185534/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Eskenazi |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/ |title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says |publisher=Jweekly |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fouad Ajami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all |title=What the Muslim World Is Watching |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage.

An English language web site had launched earlier in March 2003. The channel had about 1,300 to 1,400 employees, its newsroom editor told [[The New York Times]].

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

Friedman]] called Al-Jazeera \"the freest, most widely watched TV network in the Arab world\". \u2013 {{cite journal |author=Friedman, Thomas L. |title=Fathers and Sons |journal=[[The New York Times]] |date=12 February 1999 |pages=A27 }}</ref> and Al Jazeera claimed to be the only [[politics|politically]] independent television station in the Middle East. However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]]. The ''[[New York Times]]'' stated in January 2011: \"The protests rocking the Arab world this week have one thread uniting them: Al Jazeera,&nbsp;... whose aggressive coverage has helped propel insurgent emotions from one capital to the next.\" The newspaper quoted Marc Lynch, a professor of Middle East Studies at [[George Washington University]]: \"They did not cause these events, but it's almost impossible to imagine all this happening without Al Jazeera.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/middleeast/28jazeera.html \"Seizing a Moment, Al Jazeera Galvanizes Arab Frustration\"], ''The New York Times'', 27 January 2011</ref>\n\nWith Al Jazeera's growing global outreach and influence, some scholars including [[Adel Iskandar]] have described the station as a transformation of the very definition of \"[[alternative media]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tbsjournal.com/Iskandar.html |title=Is Al Jazeera Alternative?

Also [[Algeciras]].\n\n==History==\n===Launch===\n'''Al Jazeera Satellite Channel''', now known as AJA, was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the [[BBC]]'s [[Arabic language]] television station, a joint venture with [[Orbit Communications Company]]. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees. The agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far away as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joel Campagna |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php |title=Between Two Worlds |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Bryson |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified? |publisher=Newsmax |date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127185534/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Eskenazi |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/ |title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says |publisher=Jweekly |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fouad Ajami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all |title=What the Muslim World Is Watching |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage.

It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world. Al Jazeera soon had to contend with a new rival, [[Al Arabiya]], an offshoot of the [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]], which was set up in nearby Dubai with Saudi financial backing.<ref>{{cite news |author=Peter Feuilherade |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2780985.stm |title=Al-Jazeera competitor launches |newspaper=BBC News |date=20 February 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2003 Iraq War===\nBefore and during the United States-led invasion of Iraq, where Al Jazeera had a presence since 1997, the network's facilities and footage were again highly sought by international networks. The channel and its web site also were seeing unprecedented attention from viewers looking for alternatives to embedded reporting and military press conferences.\n\nAl Jazeera moved its sports coverage to a new, separate channel on 1 November 2003, allowing for more news and public affairs programming on the original channel.

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]].
