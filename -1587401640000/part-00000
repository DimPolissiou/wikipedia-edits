Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters.

Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

Marley was raised by his mother, Lucy Pounder in England and would make frequent trips to Jamaica to visit his brothers. Growing up, he was surrounded by a musical atmosphere, which helped him quickly develop and adopt into the musical lifestyle. At an early age, he taught himself how to master the bass, drums, guitar, and keyboards. By the young age of 5, Marley had recorded his first demo at the family home of the Marley's in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. While growing up, Marley lived between England and Jamaica and eventually he found himself creating a home base in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]] where the family owned their own studio called The Lions Den. Although Marley was a Jamaican at heart, he is said to credit his British upbringing as a major influence on his music. Marley reflects: \"I feel privileged to be part of the musical roots that my father, Bob Marley, laid in England. I look forward to relate the cultural gifts and musical creations that he has bestowed on me.\u201d\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/The-hopes-of-the-rising-son-463046|work=The Jerusalem Post|last=Solomon|first=Josh}}</ref> In 1993, Marley moved to Jamaica to be closer to his brothers. By making that move, it inspired the Marley Brothers to form their own musical path. They created the group called the [[Ghetto Youths Crew]] which was formed by Julian, Stephen, Damian, and [[Ky-Mani Marley|Kymani Marley.]] The project showed to be such a success that the brothers toured the United States for three years.   Marley, also known as \"Ju Ju\" Marley will remain a spiritual soul with a musical visionary that he will embark on an international mission. Marley stated, \"I do not plan the next step, I just continue on with Jah Works and somehow things will just come together naturally that way.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Hope of the Rising Son|last=Gil|first=Hoffman}}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\nIn 1996, Marley released his debut album titled ''[[Lion in the Morning]]''. That first album helped launch him into the public eye. The album was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. Marley created ''Lion in the Morning'' to reflect on his roots and heritage which he is very proud of. The album features a wide range of popular musicians from Owen \"Dreddie\" Reid, [[Earl \"Chinna\" Smith|Earl Chinna Smith]], [[Tyrone Downie|Tyron Downie]], [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen Marley]], [[Cedella Marley]] and [[Sharon Marley]], among others.  The record was followed by a successful international tour with The Uprising. Some of the tour stops from his tour were Jamaica\u2019s Sumfest and Sunsplash Show, Marley Magic family performance at Central Park Summer Stage Concert Series in New York, and also territories like Brazil, Japan, and Mexico. Marley also got the opportunity to work with his brother Damian at the [[Lollapalooza|Lollapalooza Tour]].\n\nDuring these times he had in Jamaica, he studied a lot of legendary veterans that he looked up to like Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett, Earl \"Wire\" Lindo, Tyrone Downie, and Earl Smith all which inspired the song-bird. Marley wrote two un-released songs at this time called \"Uprising\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Julian-Marley-Uprising-Good-People/release/5161793|title=Julian Marley \u2013 Uprising (Good People)|publisher=discogs|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref> and \"What They Did Wrong\" in response to the accident of his companion which is also the Wailers drummer, Carlton Barrett's, murder outside of his home in Jamaica. Subsequently, he formed a reggae band called The Uprising, which was inspired by his song, made up of young Jamaican musicians. The Uprising and Marleywould go on to open up for his brother Ziggy Marley and his band, [[Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers|The Melody Makers]]. He also got the chance to perform with the Wailers, which included [[Carlton Barrett]]'s son who played the drums. Marley contributed to a vast range of musical elements on [[Lauryn Hill]]'s album, ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]'' which became an award-winning album. They recorded the album on [[Tuff Gong Records]] in Jamaica while Marley played the guitar on some tracks. During 1999, Marley went back to the studio alongside his brothers Damian and Stephen and started to produce the platinum-selling remix album, ''[[Chant Down Babylon]]'', which had various rock and hip-hop artists covering Bob Marley's and The Wailers songs.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nMarley is a humanitarian and continues to build charitable missions and still contributes to the Ghetto Youths Foundation in the spirit of his father. He enjoys giving back to the youths in various communities whether it is playing with the children at the football fields in London or offering his free time with benefit concerts.

Marley views himself as a very religious man who follows the faiths of [[Rastafari]] and Christianity.  He was in the country to perform and he states, \"it was [[Spirituality|spiritually]] uplifting\" to be able to see where Christ came from. Many of the Marley family have visited [[Jerusalem]] before but this was the first time Marley was invited to perform at the Barby Club in Tel Aviv during his global tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hightimes.com/culture/exclusive-julian-marley-discusses-his-spiritual-connection-with-pot/|title=Exclusive: Julian Marley Discusses His Spiritual Connection with Pot \u2013 High Times|publisher=hightimes.com|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref> Marley had no problems at all performing in Israel because he wanted to tackle issues in a different way while during that time there were many [[boycott]]s in the country. He states, \"It's great to travel all around the world because there is no place that the message of love is not needed.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theknow.denverpost.com/2010/06/04/the-reverb-interview-julian-marley/16641/|title=Julian Marley was born in London and reborn in Kingston|date=4 June 2010|website=The Know|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref> Marley believes and expressed good vibes and intentions.

Marley was raised by his mother, Lucy Pounder in England and would make frequent trips to Jamaica to visit his brothers. Growing up, he was surrounded by a musical atmosphere, which helped him quickly develop and adopt into the musical lifestyle. At an early age, he taught himself how to master the bass, drums, guitar, and keyboards. By the young age of 5, Marley had recorded his first demo at the family home of the Marley's in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. While growing up, Marley lived between England and Jamaica and eventually he found himself creating a home base in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]] where the family owned their own studio called The Lions Den. Although Marley was a Jamaican at heart, he is said to credit his British upbringing as a major influence on his music. Marley reflects: \"I feel privileged to be part of the musical roots that my father, Bob Marley, laid in England. I look forward to relate the cultural gifts and musical creations that he has bestowed on me.\u201d\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/The-hopes-of-the-rising-son-463046|work=The Jerusalem Post|last=Solomon|first=Josh}}</ref> In 1993, Marley moved to Jamaica to be closer to his brothers. By making that move, it inspired the Marley Brothers to form their own musical path. They created the group called the [[Ghetto Youths Crew]] which was formed by Julian, Stephen, Damian, and [[Ky-Mani Marley|Kymani Marley.]] The project showed to be such a success that the brothers toured the United States for three years.   Marley, also known as \"Ju Ju\" Marley will remain a spiritual soul with a musical visionary that he will embark on an international mission. Marley stated, \"I do not plan the next step, I just continue on with Jah Works and somehow things will just come together naturally that way.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Hope of the Rising Son|last=Gil|first=Hoffman}}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\nIn 1996, Marley released his debut album titled ''[[Lion in the Morning]]''. That first album helped launch him into the public eye. The album was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. Marley created ''Lion in the Morning'' to reflect on his roots and heritage which he is very proud of. The album features a wide range of popular musicians from Owen \"Dreddie\" Reid, [[Earl \"Chinna\" Smith|Earl Chinna Smith]], [[Tyrone Downie|Tyron Downie]], [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen Marley]], [[Cedella Marley]] and [[Sharon Marley]], among others.  The record was followed by a successful international tour with The Uprising. Some of the tour stops from his tour were Jamaica\u2019s Sumfest and Sunsplash Show, Marley Magic family performance at Central Park Summer Stage Concert Series in New York, and also territories like Brazil, Japan, and Mexico. Marley also got the opportunity to work with his brother Damian at the [[Lollapalooza|Lollapalooza Tour]].\n\nDuring these times he had in Jamaica, he studied a lot of legendary veterans that he looked up to like Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett, Earl \"Wire\" Lindo, Tyrone Downie, and Earl Smith all which inspired the song-bird. Marley wrote two un-released songs at this time called \"Uprising\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Julian-Marley-Uprising-Good-People/release/5161793|title=Julian Marley \u2013 Uprising (Good People)|publisher=discogs|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref> and \"What They Did Wrong\" in response to the accident of his companion which is also the Wailers drummer, Carlton Barrett's, murder outside of his home in Jamaica. Subsequently, he formed a reggae band called The Uprising, which was inspired by his song, made up of young Jamaican musicians. The Uprising and Marleywould go on to open up for his brother Ziggy Marley and his band, [[Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers|The Melody Makers]]. He also got the chance to perform with the Wailers, which included [[Carlton Barrett]]'s son who played the drums. Marley contributed to a vast range of musical elements on [[Lauryn Hill]]'s album, ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]'' which became an award-winning album. They recorded the album on [[Tuff Gong Records]] in Jamaica while Marley played the guitar on some tracks. During 1999, Marley went back to the studio alongside his brothers Damian and Stephen and started to produce the platinum-selling remix album, ''[[Chant Down Babylon]]'', which had various rock and hip-hop artists covering Bob Marley's and The Wailers songs.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nMarley is a humanitarian and continues to build charitable missions and still contributes to the Ghetto Youths Foundation in the spirit of his father. He enjoys giving back to the youths in various communities whether it is playing with the children at the football fields in London or offering his free time with benefit concerts. In February 2010, Marley and his brother Kymani Marley produced a \"Miami for Haiti\" [[Benefit concert|benefit show]] which raised money towards the Haitian relief efforts alongside the Ghetto Youths Foundation by their side.\n\nMarley was only 13 years old when he travelled to [[Israel]] in 1988. Marley views himself as a very religious man who follows the faiths of [[Rastafari]] and Christianity.  He was in the country to perform and he states, \"it was [[Spirituality|spiritually]] uplifting\" to be able to see where Christ came from. Many of the Marley family have visited [[Jerusalem]] before but this was the first time Marley was invited to perform at the Barby Club in Tel Aviv during his global tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hightimes.com/culture/exclusive-julian-marley-discusses-his-spiritual-connection-with-pot/|title=Exclusive: Julian Marley Discusses His Spiritual Connection with Pot \u2013 High Times|publisher=hightimes.com|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref> Marley had no problems at all performing in Israel because he wanted to tackle issues in a different way while during that time there were many [[boycott]]s in the country. He states, \"It's great to travel all around the world because there is no place that the message of love is not needed.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theknow.denverpost.com/2010/06/04/the-reverb-interview-julian-marley/16641/|title=Julian Marley was born in London and reborn in Kingston|date=4 June 2010|website=The Know|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref> Marley believes and expressed good vibes and intentions.

For example, the [[Kansas City Scouts]], [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]], and [[New Jersey Devils]] are one franchise. A franchise's history includes the records of competition won in different cities, as differently-named teams. Naming and team logos and designs are registered with the league.

The biggest difference in Europe is the presence of unauthorised halting sites (or trailer parks). This stems from the practice by traditionally itinerant ethnic groups, such as the [[Romani]] and [[Irish Travellers]] to periodically during the year set up a transient community. From the late 1970\u2019s onward there was also a growth in [[New Age travelers]] culture; these groups espoused alternative lifestyles combined with a Do-It-Yourself punk ethic. The latter were a commonplace phenomenon in Germany<ref>Cool Places: Geographies of Youth Cultures, (eds) Tracey Skelton, Gill Valentine, p. 289</ref>, giving rise to words such as ''Wagenburg'', ''Wagendorf'' or ''Bauwagenplatz'' (tr. \"wagon fort\", \"trailer village\" and \"construction trailer place\" respectively). \n\nEither rejected from or refusing to seek entrance in municipally authorised halting sites, groups of families practising a nomadic lifestyle would establish themselves under the cover of darkness on idle land near urban centers. These unauthorised encampments were often resented by local people, perpetuating a cycle of discrimination, violence, fear and discrimination. The use of land without the necessary permission also carried the threat of imprisonment for the squatting families, further worsening the socio-economic disadvantage experienced by these minorities.<ref>Aodhan O'Faolain (03/10/2019). \"Traveller couples given 24 hours to move away from vicinity of illegal halting site|https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/traveller-couples-given-24-hours-to-move-away-from-vicinity-of-illegal-halting-site-954709.html\". Breaking News.ie Dublin. Retrieved 2020-04-20</ref> \n\n====Authorised Caravan Parks====  \nIn Germany, the Netherlands and some other European countries local law allows for normal camping at [[RV park]]s for a short time and seasonal camping for holiday makers, and also long-time camping (for years) with hardly movable travel trailers. Sometimes the inhabitants also cultivate a [[Allotment (gardening)#United Kingdom|garden]]. Some cities allow a long-time camping lot to be the regular address registered with the authorities; others do not. Many of mobile home plots are offered by [[RV park]]s that allow for all sorts of camping and offer extra plots for mobile homes (static caravans).The cost for such a plot tends to be between 400 \u20ac and 1.500 \u20ac a year, depending on the location and facilities.\n\nIn France, living in a trailer or mobile home for more than three months is prohibited by law, even if the resident owns the land; however, building requirements and permissions for self building of recreational solid (static) country cottages are more relaxed in France if one stays within a certain amount of square meters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"trailers\" are commonly known as static caravans, and are generally used for one of two purposes:  firstly as holiday homes, designed for short-term living; and secondly as retirement homes for the elderly, designed for long-term occupancy. Both types of trailers usually enjoy good amenities and are surrounded by highly manicured gardens.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn [[Australia]], there is generally no differentiation between a trailer park and an [[RV park]]. The term \"caravan park\" is used to refer to both.\n\nIn New Zealand, the suburb of [[Favona]] in [[Auckland]] is an area where trailer parks are concentrated.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Housing}}\n* [[RV park]] \n* [[Halting site]] \n* [[Shanty town]]\n* ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]''\n* [[Trailer trash]], a derogatory term for white people who live in trailer parks\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal | last=Sullivan | first=Esther | title=Moving Out: Mapping Mobile Home Park Closures to Analyze Spatial Patterns of Low-Income Residential Displacement | journal=City & Community | publisher=Wiley | volume=16 | issue=3 | year=2017 | issn=1535-6841 | doi=10.1111/cico.12252 | pages=304\u2013329}}\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24135022 Why do so many Americans live in mobile homes?] by the [[BBC News|BBC News Magazine]]\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Caravan (mobile home) sites}}\n*[http://allparksallianceforchange.org/files/6%20-%20Park%20Prejudice%20Section.pdf Park Prejudice] by [[All Parks Alliance for Change]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trailer Park}}\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods]]\n[[Category:Urban geography]]\n[[Category:American society]]\n[[Category:Portable buildings and shelters]]\n[[Category:Types of populated places]]\n", "text_old": "{{about||the studio|Trailer Park, Inc.|the album|Trailer Park (album)|the television show|Trailer Park Boys}}\n\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Trailerpark.jpg|right|thumb|Trailer park in [[West Miami, Florida]]]]\n[[File:1958 photo of Zimmer trailer in a trailer park in Tampa Florida.jpg|thumb|1958 photo of Zimmer trailer in a trailer park in Tampa, Florida.
