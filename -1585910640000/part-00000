It airs daily (except during public holidays) on the [[People's Television Network]] (PTV) since March 8, 1995, and involves the PCSO workforce consisting of more than 2,000 employees nationwide. The program consists of drawing of parimutuel and fixed payout lottery games, sweepstakes games, and since November 15, 2017, it added the centralized draws of the Small Town Lottery (Pares, Swer3 and Swer2) for the provinces that do not conduct their own local STL draws.\n\nThe program is also simulcast over [[DZRB-AM|Radyo \nPilipinas 1 738]] kHz, [[DZSR|Radyo Pilipinas 2 918]] kHz, [[DZME|DZME 1530]] kHz, and [[Brigada Mass Media Corporation|Brigada News FM]] stations [[ Love Radio]] \n[[Yes the best]] and PCSO and PTV's websites, [[Facebook]] pages and [[YouTube]] accounts.\n\nOn July 27, 2019, the program was put into temporary hiatus following a speech from President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] to suspend all gambling-related operations of PCSO due to corruption allegations. However, the program partially resumed on July 31 as the suspension of the lotto game was lifted by the President. Though the Small Town Lottery among other games, which has a segment in the program remains suspended until August 22, 2019.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/PTVph/videos/2360697084020622/ WATCH: PCSO Statement (July 27, 2019)]</ref><ref>https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1148151/break-suspension-of-lotto-operations-lifted-panelo</ref>\n\nOn October 27, 2019, the program launched a new segment called ''Handog Pasasalamat sa Pamilyang Pilipino'', as part of the 85th anniversary celebration of the PCSO. Five families from a selected barangay will receive various items, such as grocery items, cash prize, etc. from a sponsor, usually associated with PCSO. The segment is hosted by one of the main hosts and a guest co-host, either by Dennis Padilla or Gary Lim. It is held every Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, the program is put into temporary hiatus again, as PCSO gaming operations and small-town lottery in Luzon suspended again following the implementation of [[2020 Luzon enhanced community quarantine|enhanced community quarantine]] in [[Luzon]] amid [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Christopher Lloyd Caliwan| url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1096945|title=PCSO suspends lotto draws, games amid Covid-19 threat|date=March 17, 2020|agency=[[Philippine News Agency]]||accessdate=March 18, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/03/18/20/lotto-draws-suspended-due-to-covid-19-says-pcso|title=Lotto draws suspended due to COVID-19, says PCSO|website=[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs|ABS-CBN News]]|date=March 18, 2020|accessdate=March 18, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Jel Santos|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/03/17/pcso-suspends-game-operations-luzon-stl/|title=PCSO suspends game operations, Luzon STL|newspaper=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=March 17, 2020|accessdate=March 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Draw procedure==\nBefore every draw day begins with the airing of a clip in which the blowing machines, called \"Mega Gems\", and the balls used in each game are inspected to ensure that everything is fair and nothing is concealed in the machines and balls for the draw day. The inspection is undertaken by a panel of judges, composed of a neutral set of people not connected with the PCSO. Representatives from the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]] oversee the proceedings and the draw to see that everything goes according to protocol. The pre-draw procedure is as follows:\n#The panel inspects each of the Mega Gems to be used in the draws for a draw day, including the interior of the blowing chamber and the blowing mechanisms. This is to make sure there is nothing hidden in the Mega Gems that will invalidate the entire draw, such as hidden balls or obstructions. The Mega Gems are also given a dry run using a set of unmarked ping-pong balls to test if they would work as they should come the actual draw.\n#The balls to be used in each game are stored inside briefcases. There are usually three cases of balls to be used on each game, distinguished by either numbers or uppercase or lowercase letters. The panel randomly chooses one set using cards and its chosen card is shown. In the lot games such as the Super Lotto 6/49 and 2D Lotto, the balls are of one color, and each set may have a different color. In the digit games such as the 6D Lotto, no matter the set chosen, each digit from 0 to 9 has a different color, and each set is identical. In Small Town Lottery games, all balls are of one color.\n#After one set of balls has been chosen for a game, each of the balls is weighed to see if they have the same or almost the same weight using a digital scale. This part of the procedure is covered by a separate video camera, which will record any abnormal circumstance, such as ball switching or a ball which either is overweight or is too light, should it comes out.\n#After the balls for the game are weighed, they are loaded by hand by the head of the panel into the loading bays of the game's Mega Gem. This is the only first of the two times human intervention is needed as each Mega Gem is operated using a remote console stationed a small distance away from the unit. The second, never shown but implied, is the removal of the balls from the Mega Gem after each draw show has ended and the results of the draws are recorded. In the case of digit lottery games, the removal of balls is the third time, as the drawn balls are also adjusted (see below).\n\nEach Mega Gem, depending on the type of game, as already mentioned, is operated by automation. The Mega Gem loads the balls from the loading bays to the draw chamber, after which the blower starts to mix the balls. In the number lottery games (excluding the Power Lotto), the machine draws six numbers one-by-one and is inserted into the inner left loading bay. In machines used in the 2D Lotto and the digit lottery games, each number/digit in the combination is drawn from its own chamber. Once a ball is drawn, it is locked into place by slats placed over the pipe leading from the drawing chamber. Once the necessary number of balls has been picked, the Mega Gem is turned off.\n\nThe Mega Gem used in Power Lotto (mentioned below) was a compound version of the two types of Mega Gems stated above. The chamber which drew the main five numbers has its ball loading bays placed at the back, but had a separate tube where the five drawn number balls are directed. It was operated the same way as the Mega Gem used in the other number lottery games. The chamber that draws the power number was the same one used as those in 6D Lotto. The first chamber was first turned on to draw the five main numbers. Afterwards, the first chamber was turned off and the second chamber was then switched on to draw the power number. After the power number has been drawn, the entire machine was turned off.\n\nBalls typically have numbers all over their outer edges. The numbers on balls used in number lottery games (except the 2D Lotto), are read on the spot without the need of touching them. In the digit lottery games and the 2D Lotto with top drawing Mega Gems, the balls are adjusted to clearly show the numbers drawn. Because of the nature of the Power Lotto Mega Gem, each of the methods mentioned were applied in each of the machine's two chambers.\n\nHowever since 2014, the balls are no longer adjusted, instead the numbers on balls are read on the spot by the host. This applies to all games.\n\n==The Games==\nThe PCSO Lottery Draw currently hosts a total of nine games, each with their own combinations and mechanics of play.\n\nThe number lottery games are:\n[[File:Angeles City lotto outlet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A typical outlet for purchasing tickets.]]\n[[Image:SuperLottoCard.jpg|thumb|250px|The card for playing Super Lotto 6/49.]]\n[[File:PCSO Gapan Officejf.jpg|thumb|A provincial PCSO office ([[Gapan|Gapan City]], Nueva Ecija Provincial District Office).]]\n\n===Pari-mutuel games===\n*'''Lotto 6/42''' is the flagship lotto draw, first introduced in 1995. The game was initially introduced in Luzon, with a separate game for \"VisMin\" geographical regions as a single unit. The two draws were later combined into a nationwide one in 2005. As the name states, a six-number combination is chosen from a lot of numbers from 1 to 42. To win a prize, at least three of one's chosen numbers must match with to those of the six winning numbers. The odds of getting all six winning numbers, and thus the jackpot, are 1 in 5,245,786. Draws are held on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.\n*'''Mega Lotto 6/45''' is a more improved version of the 6/42 draw and is also introduced as nationwide one. As the name states, a six-number combination is chosen from a lot of numbers from 1 to 45. As with 6/42, at least three of one's chosen numbers must appear among the six winning numbers to win a prize. The odds of getting all six winning numbers are much larger at 1 in 8,145,060. Draws are held on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.\n*'''Super Lotto 6/49''' increases odds and makes winning more difficult than the previous two, this time with a lot of numbers ranging from 1 to 49. Draw mechanics are the same. The odds of winning are now higher at 1 in 13,983,816. Draws are held on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays.\n*'''Grand Lotto 6/55''' was introduced in April 2010. Draw mechanics are the same as the previous three, but this time, the number lot is from 1 to 55. The Grand Lotto draw and currently uses the larger of the two-chamber Power Lotto Mega Gem. While its minimum jackpot is pegged at \u20b130,000,000, it had the Power Lotto's \u20b1108,000,000 final jackpot as its jackpot prize on its first draw. The odds are at 1 in 28,989,675. Draws are held on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n*'''Ultra Lotto 6/58''' is the most recent of all the lottery draw. It was launched on February 7, 2015. Its first draw was on February 8, 2015. Draw mechanics are the same as the previous four, but this time, the number is from 1 to 58. Draws are held on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays. Its minimum jackpot is PHP50,000,000.00.<ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/pcso-launches-ultra-lotto-658-feb-7/ PCSO launches Ultra Lotto 6/58 Feb. 7.]</ref><ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/pcso-holds-first-ultra-lotto-658-draw-today/ PCSO holds first Ultra Lotto 6/58 draw today.]</ref> The odds are, at their highest, at 1 in 40,475,358. On October 14, 2018, two bettors from Albay and Samar split the \u20b11,180,622,508 (US$21,862,177) jackpot, the largest won.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1042706/finally-2-bettors-to-split-ultralotto-jackpot-of-p1-18-billion |title=At last, 2 bettors hit UltraLotto 6/58 jackpot of P1.18 billion |last=Ramos |first=Christia Marie |periodical=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date= October 14, 2018|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are also three digit lottery games. Unlike the number lottery games, the digits must appear in \"exact order\", i.e. in the order of the numbered chambers from which each digit is drawn:\n*'''4D Lotto''' uses a four-chambered Mega Gem, each drawing a digit from 0 to 9. To win, one must have at least the last two digits of the winning combination. The odds of winning are 1 in 10,000. It is held on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\n*'''6D Lotto''' draws six digits from a six-chambered Mega Gem. To win, one must have at least the first or last three digits of the winning combination in exact order. Odds in winning are increased at 1 in 1,000,000. Exclusively played in Luzon, it is held on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.\n\n===Fixed payout games===\n*'''3D Lotto''' uses a three-chambered Mega Gem, each drawing a digit from 0 to 9. The 3D Lotto is drawn 3 (three) times daily, Monday-Sunday. The nationwide draws are the morning (11AM), afternoon (4PM) and evening (on PTV) (9PM). This game perhaps is the most popular among the fixed payout games, garnering a solid following in social media especially through varied Facebook groups.\n\nA multitude of websites also have been created and are updated regularly every after the morning, afternoon, and evening draws are recorded. Most of these websites also try to compile and pseudo-analyze results based on prevailing results and techniques used by bettors of the game- this even though results are drawn in random.\n\n*'''2D Lotto''' uses a two-chambered Mega Gem, each drawing a number from a lot of 1 to 31, thus ensuing a possibility of the same number appearing twice in a combination or a Double. To win the jackpot, one must have the two numbers in exact order as they appear in the chambers. The odds of getting exact order are in 1 in 961. The odds in LLAVE order are 1 in 465. Therefore 465 numbers are LLave (Rambol) (01-02, 02-01). The 2D Lotto is drawn 3 (three) times daily, Monday-Sunday. The nationwide draws are the morning (11AM), afternoon (4PM) and  evening (on PTV) (9PM).\n\n===Small Town Lottery games===\nOn November 15, 2017, centralized Small Town Lottery games were added into the show. The results of these draws are for provinces that do not have a local franchise of STL.\n\nThe Small Town Lottery games are also held three times daily, every 11AM, 4PM, and 9PM.\n\n*'''STL Pares''' uses a single-chambered machine, which draws two numbers from 1 to 40. After the first number is drawn, the machine is restarted to draw the second number. To win a prize, one must match the numbers in exact order.\n*'''STL Swer3''' uses a three-chamber machine, with each one drawing a number from 0 to 9. Until October 1, 2019, it is originally single-chambered, but now it uses three separate chambers. It is similar to 3D Lotto in gameplay.\n*'''STL Swer2''' uses a two-chamber machine, each one drawing a number from 0 to 9. Like STL Swer3, it is also originally single-chambered, until October 1, 2019, and is formerly known as ''STL 2-Digits''.\n\n===Defunct games===\n*'''Power Lotto 5-55+1''' Power Lotto uses 2 Mega Gems, the larger one draws 5 numbers out of 55 balls, and another one draws one ball out of 10 balls numbered from 1 to 10 for the power number. Its minimum jackpot is PHP 50,000,000.00. The odds of winning the jackpot are at 1 in 34,787,610. It was replaced by Grand Lotto 6/55 on April 2010.\n\n==Current hosts==\n===Main hosts===\n* Erik Imson\n* Romi Sison\n* Jasper Espino\n* Dindo de Viterbo\n* Sherrie Pamintuan\n* Pilar Pinga Cruz\n* Queenie Balita\n* Fe Celebrado III\n* Rizza Roxas-De Leon\n* Rod Allen Candelario\n* Liz Cantor\n===Handog Pasasalamat sa Pamilyang Pilipino hosts (guest hosts)===\n* Dennis Padilla\n* Gary Lim\n\n==Previous hosts==\n* Tonette Escario\n* Dr. Jun Dequina\n* Joel Pastores\n* Trixie Abogado\n* Kathy de Leon Villar\n* Tina Revilla\n* [[Timmy Cruz]]\n* Charisse de Castro\n* Shelly Anne\n\n==Draw coordinators==\n* Ariel de Ocampo\n* Eugene Muyot\n\n==See also==\n* [[Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office]]\n* [[Gambling in the Philippines]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==External links==\n*[https://pcsoonlinelottoresults.com/ Daily lotto results website]\n*[https://www.pcso.gov.ph/ PCSO Official Website]\n[[Category:Lotteries by country]]\n[[Category:Philippine game shows]]\n[[Category:People's Television Network shows]]\n[[Category:1995 Philippine television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Filipino-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Lottery game shows]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Philippine television lottery game show}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2012}}\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = PCSO Lottery Draw\n| show_name_2 = Philippine Lotto Draw (1995-2013) <br> Philippine Lottery Draw (2013-2016)\n| image = \n| caption = \n| genre = [[Lottery]] [[game show]]\n| camera = [[Multiple-camera setup]]\n| creator = [[Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office]]\n| developer =\n| executive_producer = \n| director = Andy Macapagal <br> Carmelo Vidanes\n| presenter = [[PCSO Lottery Draw#Current hosts|various]]\n| narrated = Erik Imson\n| opentheme = \"Araw-Araw, Let's Play Lotto\" by Jude Ralph Roldan\n| endtheme = \"Araw-Araw, Let's Play Lotto\" by Jude Ralph Roldan\n| country = [[Philippines]]\n| company = [[Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office]]\n| network = [[People's Television Network|PTV]]\n| picture_format = {{Plainlist|\n* [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]]) (1995-2017)\n*  [[1080i]] ([[High-definition television|HDTV]]) (2017-present)\n}}\n| runtime = 15\u201330 minutes\n| first_aired = {{start date|1995|3|8}}\n| last_aired = {{end date|present}} ''({{small|on-hiatus since March 17, 2020}})''\n| num_episodes = n/a (airs daily)\n| website = http://www.pcso.gov.ph\n}}\n\n'''''PCSO Lottery Draw''''' is a Philippine television [[game show]] produced by the [[Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office]] (PCSO).

Its minimum jackpot is PHP50,000,000.00.<ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/pcso-launches-ultra-lotto-658-feb-7/ PCSO launches Ultra Lotto 6/58 Feb. 7.]</ref><ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/pcso-holds-first-ultra-lotto-658-draw-today/ PCSO holds first Ultra Lotto 6/58 draw today.]</ref> The odds are, at their highest, at 1 in 40,475,358. On October 14, 2018, two bettors from Albay and Samar split the \u20b11,180,622,508 (US$21,862,177) jackpot, the largest won.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1042706/finally-2-bettors-to-split-ultralotto-jackpot-of-p1-18-billion |title=At last, 2 bettors hit UltraLotto 6/58 jackpot of P1.18 billion |last=Ramos |first=Christia Marie |periodical=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date= October 14, 2018|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are also three digit lottery games. Unlike the number lottery games, the digits must appear in \"exact order\", i.e. in the order of the numbered chambers from which each digit is drawn:\n*'''4D Lotto''' uses a four-chambered Mega Gem, each drawing a digit from 0 to 9. To win, one must have at least the last two digits of the winning combination. The odds of winning are 1 in 10,000. It is held on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\n*'''6D Lotto''' draws six digits from a six-chambered Mega Gem. To win, one must have at least the first or last three digits of the winning combination in exact order. Odds in winning are increased at 1 in 1,000,000. Exclusively played in Luzon, it is held on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.\n\n===Fixed payout games===\n*'''3D Lotto''' uses a three-chambered Mega Gem, each drawing a digit from 0 to 9. The 3D Lotto is drawn 3 (three) times daily, Monday-Sunday. The nationwide draws are the morning (11AM), afternoon (4PM) and evening (on PTV) (9PM). This game perhaps is the most popular among the fixed payout games, garnering a solid following in social media especially through varied Facebook groups.\n\nA multitude of websites also have been created and are updated regularly every after the morning, afternoon, and evening draws are recorded. Most of these websites also try to compile and pseudo-analyze results based on prevailing results and techniques used by bettors of the game- this even though results are drawn in random.\n\n*'''2D Lotto''' uses a two-chambered Mega Gem, each drawing a number from a lot of 1 to 31, thus ensuing a possibility of the same number appearing twice in a combination or a Double. To win the jackpot, one must have the two numbers in exact order as they appear in the chambers. The odds of getting exact order are in 1 in 961. The odds in LLAVE order are 1 in 465. Therefore 465 numbers are LLave (Rambol) (01-02, 02-01). The 2D Lotto is drawn 3 (three) times daily, Monday-Sunday. The nationwide draws are the morning (11AM), afternoon (4PM) and  evening (on PTV) (9PM).\n\n===Small Town Lottery games===\nOn November 15, 2017, centralized Small Town Lottery games were added into the show. The results of these draws are for provinces that do not have a local franchise of STL.\n\nThe Small Town Lottery games are also held three times daily, every 11AM, 4PM, and 9PM.\n\n*'''STL Pares''' uses a single-chambered machine, which draws two numbers from 1 to 40. After the first number is drawn, the machine is restarted to draw the second number. To win a prize, one must match the numbers in exact order.\n*'''STL Swer3''' uses a three-chamber machine, with each one drawing a number from 0 to 9. Until October 1, 2019, it is originally single-chambered, but now it uses three separate chambers. It is similar to 3D Lotto in gameplay.\n*'''STL Swer2''' uses a two-chamber machine, each one drawing a number from 0 to 9. Like STL Swer3, it is also originally single-chambered, until October 1, 2019, and is formerly known as ''STL 2-Digits''.\n\n===Defunct games===\n*'''Power Lotto 5-55+1''' Power Lotto uses 2 Mega Gems, the larger one draws 5 numbers out of 55 balls, and another one draws one ball out of 10 balls numbered from 1 to 10 for the power number. Its minimum jackpot is PHP 50,000,000.00. The odds of winning the jackpot are at 1 in 34,787,610. It was replaced by Grand Lotto 6/55 on April 2010.\n\n==Current hosts==\n===Main hosts===\n* Erik Imson\n* Romi Sison\n* Jasper Espino\n* Dindo de Viterbo\n* Sherrie Pamintuan\n* Pilar Pinga Cruz\n* Queenie Balita\n* Fe Celebrado III\n* Rizza Roxas-De Leon\n* Rod Allen Candelario\n* Liz Cantor\n===Handog Pasasalamat sa Pamilyang Pilipino hosts (guest hosts)===\n* Dennis Padilla\n* Gary Lim\n\n==Previous hosts==\n* Tonette Escario\n* Dr. Jun Dequina\n* Joel Pastores\n* Trixie Abogado\n* Kathy de Leon Villar\n* Tina Revilla\n* [[Timmy Cruz]]\n* Charisse de Castro\n* Shelly Anne\n\n==Draw coordinators==\n* Ariel de Ocampo\n* Eugene Muyot\n\n==See also==\n* [[Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office]]\n* [[Gambling in the Philippines]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==External links==\n*[https://pcsoonlinelottoresults.com/ Daily lotto results website]\n*[https://www.pcso.gov.ph/ PCSO Official Website]\n[[Category:Lotteries by country]]\n[[Category:Philippine game shows]]\n[[Category:People's Television Network shows]]\n[[Category:1995 Philippine television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Filipino-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Lottery game shows]]\n", "name_user": "49.150.146.239", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCSO_Lottery_Draw"}

Cavafy - Greek writer|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nCavafy wrote 155 poems, while dozens more remained incomplete or in sketch form. During his lifetime, he consistently refused to formally publish his work and preferred to share it through local [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, or even print it out himself and give it away to anyone interested. His most important poems were written after his fortieth birthday, and officially published two years after his death.\n\n==Biography==\n\nCavafy was born in 1863 in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt Province|Egypt]], to [[Greek people|Greek]] parents, originated from the Greek community of Constantinople (Istanbul), and was baptized into the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Greek Orthodox Church]]. His father's name was {{lang|el|\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f38\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2}}, ''Petros Ioann\u0113s'' \u2014hence the ''Petrou'' [[patronymic]] (<small>[[Genitive case|GEN]]</small>) in his name\u2014 and his mother's ''Charicleia'' (Greek: {{lang|el|\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}}; n\u00e9e {{lang|el|\u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7 \u03a6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b7}}, ''Georgak\u0113 Photiad\u0113''). His father was a prosperous importer-exporter who had lived in [[England]] in earlier years and acquired [[UK|British]] nationality.  After his father died in 1870, Cavafy and his family settled for a while in [[Liverpool]].  In 1876, his family faced financial problems due to the [[Panic of 1873|Long Depression of 1873]], so, by 1877, they had to move back to Alexandria.\n\nIn 1882, disturbances in Alexandria caused the family to move again, though temporarily, to [[Constantinople]].  This was the year when a revolt broke out in Alexandria against the Anglo-French control of Egypt, thus precipitating the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War]].  [[Bombardment of Alexandria (1882)|Alexandria was bombarded]] by a British fleet, and the family apartment at Ramleh was burned.\n\nIn 1885, Cavafy returned to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life.  His first work was as a journalist; then he took a position with the British-run Egyptian Ministry of Public Works for thirty years. (Egypt was a British [[protectorate]] until 1926.) He published his poetry from 1891 to 1904 in the form of broadsheets, and only for his close friends.  Any acclaim he was to receive came mainly from within the Greek community of Alexandria.  Eventually, in 1903, he was introduced to mainland-Greek literary circles through a favourable review by [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]].  He received little recognition because his style differed markedly from the then-mainstream Greek poetry.  It was only twenty years later, after the Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)]], that a new generation of almost [[nihilism|nihilist]] poets (e.g. [[Karyotakis]]) would find inspiration in Cavafy's work.\n\nA biographical note written by Cavafy reads as follows:\n:I am from Constantinople by descent, but I was born in Alexandria\u2014at a house on Seriph Street; I left very young, and spent much of my childhood in England. Subsequently I visited this country as an adult, but for a short period of time. I have also lived in France. During my adolescence I lived over two years in Constantinople. It has been many years since I last visited Greece. My last employment was as a clerk at a government office under the Ministry of Public Works of Egypt. I know [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and a little [[Italian language|Italian]].<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Woods\n | first =Gregory\n | authorlink =\n | title =A History of Gay Literature, the Male Tradition\n | publisher =Yale University Press\n | date = 1999\n | location =\n | pages =\n | url =\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn =978-0-300-08088-9 }}</ref>\n\nHe died of [[cancer of the larynx]] on April 29, 1933, his 70th birthday. Since his death, Cavafy's reputation has grown. His poetry is taught in school in [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]], and in universities around the world.\n\n[[E. M. Forster]] knew him personally and wrote a memoir of him, contained in his book ''Alexandria''. Forster, [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], and [[T. S. Eliot]] were among the earliest promoters of Cavafy in the English-speaking world before the Second World War. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  In 1966, [[David Hockney]] made a series of prints to illustrate a selection of Cavafy's poems, including ''[[In the dull village]]''.\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Thermopyles.jpg|thumb|200px|Manuscript of his poem \"Thermopylae\" (\"''\u0398\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2''\").]]\n[[File:Kavafis.jpg|thumb|200px|Cavafy's poem \u039a\u03c1\u03c5\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 (\"Krimmena\", ''Hidden Things'') painted on a building in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]].]]\n\nCavafy was instrumental in the revival and recognition of [[Greek literature|Greek]] [[poetry]] both at home and abroad. His poems are, typically, concise but intimate evocations of real or literary figures and ''milieux'' that have played roles in Greek culture. Uncertainty about the future, sensual pleasures, the moral character and [[psychology]] of individuals, [[homosexuality]], and a fatalistic [[existential crisis|existential]] [[nostalgia]] are some of the defining themes.\n\nBesides his subjects, unconventional for the time, his poems also exhibit a skilled and versatile craftsmanship, which is extremely difficult to [[translation|translate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2008/01/more-cavafy/|title=More Cavafy by A. E. Stallings|date=27 January 2018|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref> Cavafy was a perfectionist, obsessively refining every single line of his poetry. His mature style was a free [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] form, free in the sense that verses rarely [[rhyme]] and are usually from 10 to 17 [[syllable]]s. In his poems, the presence of rhyme usually implies [[irony]].\n\nCavafy drew his themes from personal experience, along with a deep and wide knowledge of history, especially of the [[Hellenistic era]]. Many of his poems are pseudo-historical, or seemingly historical, or accurately but quirkily historical.\n\nOne of Cavafy's most important works is his 1904 poem ''[[Waiting for the Barbarians (poem)|Waiting for the Barbarians]]''. The poem begins by describing a city-state in decline, whose population and legislators are waiting for the arrival of the barbarians. When night falls, the barbarians have not arrived. The poem ends: \"What is to become of us without barbarians? Those people were a solution of a sort.\"\n\nIn 1911, Cavafy wrote \"Ithaca\", inspired by the [[Homer]]ic return journey of [[Odysseus]] to [[Ithaca|his home island]], as depicted in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The poem's theme is the destination which produces the journey of life: \"Keep Ithaka always in your mind. / Arriving there is what you\u2019re destined for\". The traveller should set out with hope, and at the end you may find Ithaca has no more riches to give you, but \"Ithaca gave you the marvelous journey\".\n\nAlmost all of Cavafy's work was in Greek; yet, his poetry remained unrecognized and underestimated in Greece, until after the publication of the first anthology in 1935 by Heracles Apostolidis (father of [[Renos Apostolidis]]). His unique style and language (which was a mixture of [[Katharevousa]] and [[Demotic Greek]]) had attracted the criticism  of [[Kostis Palamas]], the greatest poet of his era in mainland Greece, and his followers, who were in favour of the simplest form of [[Demotic Greek]].\n\nHe is known for his prosaic use of metaphors, his brilliant use of historical imagery, and his aesthetic perfectionism. These attributes, amongst others, have assured him an enduring place in the literary pantheon of the Western World.\n\n===Excerpt from ''Ithaca''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

He was mainly inspired by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic era]] with [[Alexandria]] at primary focus. Other poems originate from [[Classical antiquity|Helleno-romaic antiquity]] and the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine era]]. Mythological references are also present. The periods chosen are mostly of decline and decadence (e.g. Trojans); his heroes facing the final end. His historical poems include: ''The Glory of the Ptolemies'', ''In Sparta'', ''Come, O King of Lacedaemonians'', ''The First Step'', ''In the Year 200 B.C.'', ''If Only They Had Seen to It'', ''The Displeasure of Seleucid'', ''Theodotus'', ''Alexandrian Kings'', ''In Alexandria, 31 B.C''., ''The God Forsakes Antony'', ''In a Township of Asia Minor'', ''Caesarion'', ''The Potentate from Western Libya'', ''Of the Hebrews (A.D. 50)'', ''Tomb of Eurion'', ''Tomb of Lanes'', ''Myres: Alexandrian A.D. 340'', ''Perilous Things'', ''From the School of the Renowned Philosopher'', ''A Priest of the Serapeum'', ''Kleitos' Illness'', ''If Dead Indeed'', ''In the Month of Athyr'', ''Tomb of Ignatius'', ''From Ammones Who Died Aged 29 in 610'', ''Aemilianus Monae'', ''Alexandrian, A.D. 628-655'', ''In Church'', ''Morning Sea'' (a few poems about Alexandria were left unfinished due to his death).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Savvopoulos |first1=Kyriakos |title=A Historical Guide to Cavafy's Alexandria (331 BCE - 641 CE) |date=2013 |publisher=Bibliotheca Alexandrina |location=Alexandria |isbn=978-977-452-243-3 |pages=105\u2013194}}</ref>\n\n===Sensual poems===\nThe sensual poems are filled with the lyricism and emotion of same-sex love; inspired by recollection and remembrance. The past and former actions, sometimes along with the vision for the future underlie the muse of Cavafy in writing these poems.\n\n===Philosophical poems===\nAlso called instructive poems, they are divided into poems with consultations to poets, and poems that deal with other situations such as isolation (for example, \"The walls\"), duty (for example, \"Thermopylae\"), and human dignity (for example, \"[[The God Abandons Antony]]\").\n\nThe poem \"Thermopylae\" reminds us of the famous [[battle of Thermopylae]] where the 300 Spartans and their allies fought against the greater numbers of Persians, although they knew that they would be defeated. There are some principles in our lives that we should live by, and Thermopylae is the ground of duty. We stay there fighting although we know that there is the potential for failure. (At the end the traitor [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] will appear, leading the Persians through the secret trail).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brushheadmusings.wordpress.com/2008/06/30/thermopylae-a-poem-on-the-good-kind-of-life/|title=Thermopylae \u2013 a poem on the good kind of life|date=30 June 2008|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn another poem, \"In the Year 200 B.C.\", he comments on the historical epigram \u201cAlexander, son of Philip, and the Greeks, except of Lacedaemonians,...\u201d, from the donation of Alexander to Athens after the [[Battle of the Granicus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cavafy.com/poems/content.asp?id=129&cat=1|title=C.P. Cavafy - Poems - The Canon|website=www.cavafy.com|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref> Cavafy praises the [[Hellenistic era]] and idea, so condemning the closed-mind and localistic ideas about Hellenism. However, in other poems, his stance displays ambiguity between the [[Classical Greece|Classical]] ideal and the Hellenistic era (which is sometimes described with a tone of decadence).\n\n==Museum==\n[[File:AlexCavafyHouse.jpg|thumb|160px|House-museum of Cavafy, Alexandria.]]\n[[File:Cavafy bust.jpg|thumb|160px|A bust of Constantine Cavafy located in his apartment.]]\n[[File:AlexCavafyDeathMask.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Death mask]] of Cavafy.]]\n\n[[Cavafy Museum|Cavafy's Alexandria apartment]] has since been converted into a museum. The museum holds several of Cavafy's sketches and original manuscripts as well as containing several pictures and portraits of and by Cavafy.\n\n==Bibliography==\nSelections of Cavafy's poems appeared only in pamphlets, privately printed booklets and broadsheets during his lifetime. The first publication in book form was \"\u03a0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\" (''Poi\u0113mata'', \"Poems\"), published posthumously in Alexandria, 1935.\n\n===Volumes with translations of Cavafy's poetry in English===\n* ''Poems by C.

Cavafy - Greek writer|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nCavafy wrote 155 poems, while dozens more remained incomplete or in sketch form. During his lifetime, he consistently refused to formally publish his work and preferred to share it through local [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, or even print it out himself and give it away to anyone interested. His most important poems were written after his fortieth birthday, and officially published two years after his death.\n\n==Biography==\n\nCavafy was born in 1863 in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt Province|Egypt]], to [[Greek people|Greek]] parents, originated from the Greek community of Constantinople (Istanbul), and was baptized into the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Greek Orthodox Church]]. His father's name was {{lang|el|\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f38\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2}}, ''Petros Ioann\u0113s'' \u2014hence the ''Petrou'' [[patronymic]] (<small>[[Genitive case|GEN]]</small>) in his name\u2014 and his mother's ''Charicleia'' (Greek: {{lang|el|\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}}; n\u00e9e {{lang|el|\u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7 \u03a6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b7}}, ''Georgak\u0113 Photiad\u0113''). His father was a prosperous importer-exporter who had lived in [[England]] in earlier years and acquired [[UK|British]] nationality.  After his father died in 1870, Cavafy and his family settled for a while in [[Liverpool]].  In 1876, his family faced financial problems due to the [[Panic of 1873|Long Depression of 1873]], so, by 1877, they had to move back to Alexandria.\n\nIn 1882, disturbances in Alexandria caused the family to move again, though temporarily, to [[Constantinople]].  This was the year when a revolt broke out in Alexandria against the Anglo-French control of Egypt, thus precipitating the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War]].  [[Bombardment of Alexandria (1882)|Alexandria was bombarded]] by a British fleet, and the family apartment at Ramleh was burned.\n\nIn 1885, Cavafy returned to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life.  His first work was as a journalist; then he took a position with the British-run Egyptian Ministry of Public Works for thirty years. (Egypt was a British [[protectorate]] until 1926.) He published his poetry from 1891 to 1904 in the form of broadsheets, and only for his close friends.  Any acclaim he was to receive came mainly from within the Greek community of Alexandria.  Eventually, in 1903, he was introduced to mainland-Greek literary circles through a favourable review by [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]].  He received little recognition because his style differed markedly from the then-mainstream Greek poetry.  It was only twenty years later, after the Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)]], that a new generation of almost [[nihilism|nihilist]] poets (e.g. [[Karyotakis]]) would find inspiration in Cavafy's work.\n\nA biographical note written by Cavafy reads as follows:\n:I am from Constantinople by descent, but I was born in Alexandria\u2014at a house on Seriph Street; I left very young, and spent much of my childhood in England. Subsequently I visited this country as an adult, but for a short period of time. I have also lived in France. During my adolescence I lived over two years in Constantinople. It has been many years since I last visited Greece. My last employment was as a clerk at a government office under the Ministry of Public Works of Egypt. I know [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and a little [[Italian language|Italian]].<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Woods\n | first =Gregory\n | authorlink =\n | title =A History of Gay Literature, the Male Tradition\n | publisher =Yale University Press\n | date = 1999\n | location =\n | pages =\n | url =\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn =978-0-300-08088-9 }}</ref>\n\nHe died of [[cancer of the larynx]] on April 29, 1933, his 70th birthday. Since his death, Cavafy's reputation has grown. His poetry is taught in school in [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]], and in universities around the world.\n\n[[E. M. Forster]] knew him personally and wrote a memoir of him, contained in his book ''Alexandria''. Forster, [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], and [[T. S. Eliot]] were among the earliest promoters of Cavafy in the English-speaking world before the Second World War. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  In 1966, [[David Hockney]] made a series of prints to illustrate a selection of Cavafy's poems, including ''[[In the dull village]]''.\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Thermopyles.jpg|thumb|200px|Manuscript of his poem \"Thermopylae\" (\"''\u0398\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2''\").]]\n[[File:Kavafis.jpg|thumb|200px|Cavafy's poem \u039a\u03c1\u03c5\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 (\"Krimmena\", ''Hidden Things'') painted on a building in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]].]]\n\nCavafy was instrumental in the revival and recognition of [[Greek literature|Greek]] [[poetry]] both at home and abroad. His poems are, typically, concise but intimate evocations of real or literary figures and ''milieux'' that have played roles in Greek culture. Uncertainty about the future, sensual pleasures, the moral character and [[psychology]] of individuals, [[homosexuality]], and a fatalistic [[existential crisis|existential]] [[nostalgia]] are some of the defining themes.\n\nBesides his subjects, unconventional for the time, his poems also exhibit a skilled and versatile craftsmanship, which is extremely difficult to [[translation|translate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2008/01/more-cavafy/|title=More Cavafy by A. E. Stallings|date=27 January 2018|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref> Cavafy was a perfectionist, obsessively refining every single line of his poetry. His mature style was a free [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] form, free in the sense that verses rarely [[rhyme]] and are usually from 10 to 17 [[syllable]]s. In his poems, the presence of rhyme usually implies [[irony]].\n\nCavafy drew his themes from personal experience, along with a deep and wide knowledge of history, especially of the [[Hellenistic era]]. Many of his poems are pseudo-historical, or seemingly historical, or accurately but quirkily historical.\n\nOne of Cavafy's most important works is his 1904 poem ''[[Waiting for the Barbarians (poem)|Waiting for the Barbarians]]''. The poem begins by describing a city-state in decline, whose population and legislators are waiting for the arrival of the barbarians. When night falls, the barbarians have not arrived. The poem ends: \"What is to become of us without barbarians? Those people were a solution of a sort.\"\n\nIn 1911, Cavafy wrote \"Ithaca\", inspired by the [[Homer]]ic return journey of [[Odysseus]] to [[Ithaca|his home island]], as depicted in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The poem's theme is the destination which produces the journey of life: \"Keep Ithaka always in your mind. / Arriving there is what you\u2019re destined for\". The traveller should set out with hope, and at the end you may find Ithaca has no more riches to give you, but \"Ithaca gave you the marvelous journey\".\n\nAlmost all of Cavafy's work was in Greek; yet, his poetry remained unrecognized and underestimated in Greece, until after the publication of the first anthology in 1935 by Heracles Apostolidis (father of [[Renos Apostolidis]]). His unique style and language (which was a mixture of [[Katharevousa]] and [[Demotic Greek]]) had brought him under the criticism  of [[Kostis Palamas]], the greatest poet of his era in mainland Greece, and his followers, who were in favour of the simplest form of [[Demotic Greek]].\n\nHe is known for his prosaic use of metaphors, his brilliant use of historical imagery, and his aesthetic perfectionism. These attributes, amongst others, have assured him an enduring place in the literary pantheon of the Western World.\n\n===Excerpt from ''Ithaca''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

He was mainly inspired by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic era]] with [[Alexandria]] at primary focus. Other poems originate from [[Classical antiquity|Helleno-romaic antiquity]] and the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine era]]. Mythological references are also present. The periods chosen are mostly of decline and decadence (e.g. Trojans); his heroes facing the final end. His historical poems include: ''The Glory of the Ptolemies'', ''In Sparta'', ''Come, O King of Lacedaemonians'', ''The First Step'', ''In the Year 200 B.C.'', ''If Only They Had Seen to It'', ''The Displeasure of Seleucid'', ''Theodotus'', ''Alexandrian Kings'', ''In Alexandria, 31 B.C''., ''The God Forsakes Antony'', ''In a Township of Asia Minor'', ''Caesarion'', ''The Potentate from Western Libya'', ''Of the Hebrews (A.D. 50)'', ''Tomb of Eurion'', ''Tomb of Lanes'', ''Myres: Alexandrian A.D. 340'', ''Perilous Things'', ''From the School of the Renowned Philosopher'', ''A Priest of the Serapeum'', ''Kleitos' Illness'', ''If Dead Indeed'', ''In the Month of Athyr'', ''Tomb of Ignatius'', ''From Ammones Who Died Aged 29 in 610'', ''Aemilianus Monae'', ''Alexandrian, A.D. 628-655'', ''In Church'', ''Morning Sea'' (a few poems about Alexandria were left unfinished due to his death).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Savvopoulos |first1=Kyriakos |title=A Historical Guide to Cavafy's Alexandria (331 BCE - 641 CE) |date=2013 |publisher=Bibliotheca Alexandrina |location=Alexandria |isbn=978-977-452-243-3 |pages=105\u2013194}}</ref>\n\n===Sensual poems===\nThe sensual poems are filled with the lyricism and emotion of same-sex love; inspired by recollection and remembrance. The past and former actions, sometimes along with the vision for the future underlie the muse of Cavafy in writing these poems.\n\n===Philosophical poems===\nAlso called instructive poems, they are divided into poems with consultations to poets, and poems that deal with other situations such as isolation (for example, \"The walls\"), duty (for example, \"Thermopylae\"), and human dignity (for example, \"[[The God Abandons Antony]]\").\n\nThe poem \"Thermopylae\" reminds us of the famous [[battle of Thermopylae]] where the 300 Spartans and their allies fought against the greater numbers of Persians, although they knew that they would be defeated. There are some principles in our lives that we should live by, and Thermopylae is the ground of duty. We stay there fighting although we know that there is the potential for failure. (At the end the traitor [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] will appear, leading the Persians through the secret trail).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brushheadmusings.wordpress.com/2008/06/30/thermopylae-a-poem-on-the-good-kind-of-life/|title=Thermopylae \u2013 a poem on the good kind of life|date=30 June 2008|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn another poem, \"In the Year 200 B.C.\", he comments on the historical epigram \u201cAlexander, son of Philip, and the Greeks, except of Lacedaemonians,...\u201d, from the donation of Alexander to Athens after the [[Battle of the Granicus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cavafy.com/poems/content.asp?id=129&cat=1|title=C.P. Cavafy - Poems - The Canon|website=www.cavafy.com|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref> Cavafy praises the [[Hellenistic era]] and idea, so condemning the closed-mind and localistic ideas about Hellenism. However, in other poems, his stance displays ambiguity between the [[Classical Greece|Classical]] ideal and the Hellenistic era (which is sometimes described with a tone of decadence).\n\n==Museum==\n[[File:AlexCavafyHouse.jpg|thumb|160px|House-museum of Cavafy, Alexandria.]]\n[[File:Cavafy bust.jpg|thumb|160px|A bust of Constantine Cavafy located in his apartment.]]\n[[File:AlexCavafyDeathMask.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Death mask]] of Cavafy.]]\n\n[[Cavafy Museum|Cavafy's Alexandria apartment]] has since been converted into a museum.

{"title_page": "Game controller", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=May 2019}}\n{{short description|Device used with games or entertainment systems}}\nA '''game controller''', or simply '''controller''', is an [[input device]] used with [[Video game|video games]] or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game, typically to control an object or character in the game. Before the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]], plugging in a controller into one of a console's controller ports were the primary means of using a game controller, although since then they have been replaced by wireless controllers, which do not require controller ports on the console but are [[Electric battery|battery]]-powered. [[USB]] game controllers could also be connected to a [[computer]] with a USB port. [[Input devices]] that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as [[steering wheels]] for [[Racing video game|driving games]] and light guns for [[Shooter games|shooting games]], are also game controllers.\n\nGame controllers have been designed and improved over the years to be as user friendly as possible. The [[Xbox (console)|Microsoft Xbox]] controller, with its ''shoulder triggers'' that mimic actual triggers such as those found on guns, has become popular for [[Shooter game|shooting games]].<ref name = \"stanford\">{{cite web|title = Evolution of Video Game Controllers| url = http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/sites/default/files2/wlu_2003_1.pdf| first = William| last = Lu|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Some controllers are designed to be best for one type of game, such as steering wheels for [[Racing video game|driving games]], or [[dance pad]]s for dancing games.\n\nOne of the first video game controllers was a simple dial and single button, used to control the game ''[[Tennis for Two]]''. Controllers have since evolved to include [[D-pad|directional pads]], multiple buttons, [[analog stick]]s, [[joystick]]s, [[motion detection]], [[touch screen]]s and a plethora of other features.\n\n== Variants ==\n{{Cleanup|section|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Gamepad ===\n[[File:Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-FL.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A [[ Nintendo Switch Pro Controller]]]]\n{{Main article|Gamepad}}\n:A [[gamepad]], also known as a joypad, is held in both hands with thumbs and fingers used to provide input. Gamepads can have a number of [[Gamepad|action button]]s combined with one or more omnidirectional control sticks or buttons. Action buttons are generally handled with the digits on the right hand, and the directional input handled with the left. Gamepads are the primary means of input on most modern [[video game console]]s. Due to the ease of use and user-friendly nature of gamepads, they have spread from their origin on traditional consoles to [[computer]]s, where a variety of games and emulators support their input as a replacement for [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] input.<ref name=\"PCGamepad\">{{cite web| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/187658/how_to_use_your_console_gamepad_with_your_PC.html| title = How to use your console gamepad with your PC| accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Most modern game controllers are a variation of a standard gamepad. Common additions include shoulder buttons placed along the edges of the pad, centrally placed buttons labeled ''start'', ''select'', and ''mode'', and an internal motor to provide [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]]. \n:As modern game controllers advance, so too do their user ability qualities. Typically, the controllers become smaller and more compact to more easily, and comfortably, fit within the user's hand. Modern examples can be drawn from systems such as Xbox, whose controller has transformed subtly, yet dramatically, from the original [[Xbox 360 controller]] to the Xbox One controller introduced in 2013.\n:\n\n=== Paddle ===\n[[File:Atari-2600-Paddle-Controller-FR.jpg|thumb|Paddle controllers were popular early in the 2nd console generation for Pong games.]]\n{{Main article|Paddle (game controller)}}\n: A [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] is a controller that features a round wheel and one or more fire buttons. The wheel is typically used to control movement of the player or of an object along one axis of the video screen. As the user turns the wheel further from the default position, the speed of control in the game become more intensive. Paddle controllers were the first analog controllers and they lost popularity when \"paddle and ball\" type games fell out of favor. A variation, the Atari driving controller, appeared on the [[Atari 2600]]. Designed specifically for the game ''[[Indy 500 (1977 video game)|Indy 500]]'', it functioned almost identically in operation and design to the regular paddle controller. The exceptions were that its wheel could be continuously rotated in either direction, and that it was missing the extra paddle included on the previous model. Unlike a spinner, friction prevented the wheel from gaining momentum.\n\n=== Joystick ===\n[[File:PlayStation-Analog-Joystick.jpg|thumb|A dual-joystick controller for the original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]]][[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Arcade-Stick.jpg|thumb|An [[Arcade controller|arcade style controller]] for the Sega [[Dreamcast]].]]\n{{Main article|Joystick}}\n:A [[joystick]] is a [[peripheral]] that consists of a handheld stick that can be tilted around either of two axes and (sometimes) twisted around a third. The joystick is often used for [[flight simulator]]s. [[HOTAS]] (hands on throttle and stick) controllers, composed of a joystick and throttle quadrant (see below) are a popular combination for flight simulation among its most fanatic devotees. Most joysticks are designed to be operated with the user's primary hand (e.g. with the right hand of a right-handed person), with the base either held in the opposite hand or mounted on a desk. [[Arcade controller]]s are typically joysticks featuring a shaft that has a ball or drop-shaped handle, and one or more buttons for in game actions. Generally the layout has the joystick on the left, and the buttons on the right, although there are instances when this is reversed.\n\n=== Trackball ===\n{{Main article|Trackball}}\n: A [[trackball]] is a smooth sphere that is manipulated with the palm of one's hand. The user can roll the ball in any direction to control the cursor. It has the advantage that it can be faster than a mouse depending on the speed of rotation of the physical ball. Another advantage is that it requires less space than a [[Computer mouse|mouse]], which the trackball was a precursor of. Notable uses of a Trackball as a gaming controller would be games such as ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Marble Madness]]'', ''[[Golden Tee Golf]]'' and ''[[SegaSonic the Hedgehog]]''.\n\n=== Throttle quadrant ===\n: A throttle quadrant is a set of one or more levers that are most often used to simulate throttles or other similar controls in a real vehicle, particularly an aircraft. Throttle quadrants are most popular in conjunction with joysticks or yokes used in flight simulation.\n\n=== Steering wheel ===\n[[File:Logitech-Driving-Force-PS3.jpg|thumb|A [[Logitech]] steering wheel for the [[PlayStation 3]]]]\n{{Main article|Racing wheel}}\n:A [[Racing wheel]], essentially a larger version of a paddle, is used in most [[racing video game|racing]] [[arcade game]]s as well as more recent [[Sim racing|racing simulators]] such as ''[[Live for Speed]]'', ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'', ''[[GTR 2 \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR2]]'', and ''[[Richard Burns Rally]]''. While most [[Arcade racer|arcade racing]] games have been using steering wheels since ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'' in 1974,<ref name=\"Kohler-16\">{{citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-up: how Japanese video games gave the world an extra life|page=16|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> the first steering wheels for home systems appeared on [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth-generation consoles]] such as the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Nintendo 64]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Many are [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] (see [[Haptic technology|Force Feedback Wheel]]), designed to give the same feedback as would be experienced when driving a real car, but the realism of this depends on the game. They usually come with pedals to control the gas and brake. Shifting is taken care of in various ways including paddle shifting systems, simple stick shifters which are moved forward or back to change gears or more complex shifters which mimic those of real vehicles, which may also use a clutch. Most wheels turn only 200 to 270 degrees lock-to-lock but some models, such as the [[Logitech]] [[Driving Force Pro]], [[Logitech G25]] and [[Logitech G27]] can turn 900 degrees, or 2.5 turns, lock-to-lock. The [[Namco]] [[Jogcon]] paddle was available for the PlayStation game ''[[R4: Ridge Racer Type 4]]''. Unlike \"real\" video game steering wheels, the Jogcon was designed to fit in the player's hand. Its much smaller wheel (diameter roughly similar to a [[aluminum can|soda can]]'s) resembles the jog-and-shuttle control wheel used on some [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s. The [[Nintendo Wii]] game ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' is bundled with the [[Wii Wheel]]: a steering wheel-shaped shell that the [[Wii Remote]] is placed inside thus using the Wii Remote's motion sensing capabilities to control the [[Go-kart|kart]] during the game. Hori also has a steering wheel that is made for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''. When the steering wheel is placed on the back of the console, then it will have the same ability as in ''Mario Kart Wii'' by using the [[gyroscope]] in [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] mode.\n\n=== Yoke ===\n: A yoke is very similar to a steering wheel except that it resembles the control yoke found on many aircraft and has two axes of movement: not only rotational movement about the shaft of the yoke, but also a forward-and-backward axis equivalent to that of pitch control on the yoke of an aircraft. Some yokes have additional controls attached directly to the yoke for simulation of aircraft functions such as radio push-to-talk buttons. Some flight simulator sets that include yokes also come with various other aircraft controls such as throttle quadrants and pedals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.logitechg.com/en-roeu/products/flight/flight-simulator-yoke-system.html|title=Logitech G Flight Simulator Yoke System with Throttle Quadrant|website=www.logitechg.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref> These sets, including the yoke, are intended to be used in a [[flight simulator]].\n\n=== Pedals ===\n:[[File:LDFGT.JPG|thumb|Logitech Driving Force GT]]Pedals may be used for driving simulations or flight simulations and often ships with a steering-wheel-type input device.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals|last=Shelly|first=Gary|last2=Vermaat|first2=Misty|publisher=Course Technology Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=9781423927020|location=Boston, MA|pages=172}}</ref> In the former case, an asymmetric set of pedals can simulate accelerator, brake, and clutch pedals in a real automobile. In the latter case, a symmetric set of pedals simulates rudder controls and toe brakes in an aircraft. As mentioned, most steering wheel controllers come with a set of pedals. There are also variations of the pedal controller such as the proposed rotating pedal device for a cycling game, which relies on an ergometer to generate user inputs such as pedal rpm and pedal resistance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals|last=Chorianopoulos|first=Konstantinos|last2=Divitini|first2=Monica|last3=Hauge|first3=Jannicke|last4=Jaccheri|first4=Letizia|last5=Malaka|first5=Rainer|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783319245881|location=Heidelberg|pages=158}}</ref> A variation of this concept surfaced in 2016 when a startup called VirZoom debuted a set of sensors that can be installed in the pedal and handlebars, turning a physical bike into one controller for games on the [[HTC Vive]] and [[Oculus Rift]] [[Virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]] platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/virzoom-vr-game-controller,news-22601.html|title=This Bike Lets You Pedal Through Virtual Reality|last=Michaels|first=Philip|date=2016-04-28|work=Tom's Guide|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}</ref> The same concept is behind a product called Cyber ExerCycle,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyberbiking.com/|title=Cyber ExerCycle: Interactive Exercise Bike Kit|last=Ltd.|first=Universal Timer|website=www.cyberbiking.com|access-date=2018-08-21}}</ref> which is a set of sensors attached to the pedal and connected to the PC via [[USB]] for bicycle simulation games such as NetAthlon and [[Fuel (video game)|Fuel]].\n\n[[File:W-A-S-D.jpg|thumb|The [[Arrow keys#WASD keys|WASD]] KEYBOARD setup is used widely, but by no means universally.]]\n\n=== Mouse and keyboard ===\n: A [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] and [[computer keyboard]] are typical [[input device]]s for a [[personal computer]] and are currently the main game controllers for [[Video game|computer game]]s. The mouse is often used with a [[mousepad]] to achieve greater speed, comfort, accuracy and smoother movement for the gamer. Some video game consoles also have the ability to function with a keyboard and a mouse. The computer keyboard is modelled after the [[typewriter keyboard]] and was designed for the input of written text. A mouse is a handheld [[pointing device]] used in addition to the keyboard. For games, the keyboard typically controls movement of the character while the mouse is used to control the game camera or used for aiming. While originally designed for general computer input, there are several keyboard and mouse peripherals available which are designed specifically for gaming, often with gaming-specific functions built-in. Examples include peripherals by [[Razer USA|Razer]], such as the [https://gamehub.blog/razer-huntsman-elite-review/ Razer Huntsman Elite]. The numeric [[Keyboard technology|keypad]] found on the keyboard is also used as a game controller and can be found on a number of separate devices, most notably early consoles, usually attached to a joystick or a paddle. The keypad is a small grid of keys with at least the digits 0-9. A [[Gaming keypad]] is a specialized controller used for [[first-person shooter|FPSs]], [[Real-time strategy|RTSs]] and some arcade type games. These controllers can be programmed to allow the emulation of keys, and macros in some cases. These generally resemble a small part of a keyboard but may also feature other inputs such as [[analog stick]]s. They were developed because some of these games require a keyboard to play, and some players find this to be awkward for such a task.\n\n=== Touchscreen ===\n:[[File:Nintendo-DS-Lite-w-stylus.png|thumb|240px|Nintendo DS touchscreen (bottom) with [[stylus]].]]A [[touchscreen]] is an input device that allows the user to interact with the computer by touching the display screen. The first attempt at a [[handheld game console]] with touchscreen controls was Sega's intended successor to the [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]], though the device was ultimately shelved and never released due to the high cost of touchscreen technology in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p7.html|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA|page=7|website=IGN|first=Travis|last=Fahs|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref> The first released console to use a touchscreen was the [[Tiger Electronics|Tiger]] [[game.com]] in 1997. Nintendo popularized it for use in video games with the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]]; other systems including the [[Tapwave Zodiac]] as well as [[Smartphone]]s and the vast majority of [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] have also included this feature. The primary controller for Nintendo's [[Wii U]] console, the [[Wii U GamePad]], features an embedded touchscreen. Modern touch screens use a thin, durable, transparent plastic sheet overlaid onto a glass screen. The location of a touch is calculated from the [[capacitance]] for the X and Y [[Coordinate system|axes]], which varies based upon where the sheet is touched. One console that is touchscreen, but is not manufactured by Nintendo is Sony's PlayStation Vita which has a 5 inch OLED touchscreen. The [[Nintendo Switch]] features a 6.2 inch touchscreen.\n\n=== Breathing controllers ===\n: Breathing controllers help their users improve breathing through video games. All controllers have sensors that sense users breath, with which user controls video game on computer, tablet or on smartphone.

The [[Sixaxis]], [[DualShock 3]], and [[PlayStation Move]] controllers for Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] system have similar motion sensing capabilities. In 2010, Microsoft released the [[Kinect]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. This motion sensing controller uses cameras to track a players movement. Microsoft released a revised version of the Kinect with the launch of the [[Xbox One]]. This controller was bundled with the console on launch, and was removed from the default bundle in June 2014. Sony's [[EyeToy]] similarly uses cameras to detect the player's motions and translate them into inputs for the game.\n\n=== Light gun ===\n[[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Lightgun-FL.jpg|thumb|The Dreamcast light gun]]\n{{Main article|Light gun}}\n: A [[light gun]] is a peripheral used to \"shoot\" targets on a screen. They usually roughly resemble firearms or ray guns. Their use is normally limited to [[rail shooter]]s, or [[Shooter game#Shooting gallery|shooting gallery]] games like [[Duck Hunt]] and those which came with the ''[[Shooting Gallery (game accessory)|Shooting Gallery]]'' light gun. A rare example of a non-rail first person shooter game is [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s 1992 [[video game]] ''Gun Buster'', a [[first-person shooter]] that used a [[joystick]] to move and a light gun to [[Free look|aim]].<ref>{{KLOV game|8036|Gun Buster}}</ref> Though light guns have been used in earlier [[arcade game]]s such as [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sega Periscope|Periscope]]'' in 1966<ref>Ashcraft, Brian (2008), ''Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers'', p. 133, Kodansha International</ref> and ''Missile'' in 1969,<ref>{{KLOV game|10600|Missile}}</ref> the first home console light gun was released for the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] in 1972; later on, [[Nintendo]] would include one standard on their Famicom and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], called the [[NES Zapper]]. Nintendo has also released a \"shell\" in the style of a light gun for the more recent [[Wii Remote]] called the [[Wii Zapper]] which comes bundled with the game ''[[Link's Crossbow Training]]''.\n\n=== Rhythm game controllers ===\n\n[[File:Guitar Hero series controllers.jpg|thumb|Guitar controllers.]]\n: A [[Rhythm game accessories]] used for [[rhythm games]] can resemble musical instruments, such as [[guitar]]s (from 5-button guitars in ''[[Guitar Freaks]]'', the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' series, the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series to real guitars in ''[[Rock Band 3]]'' and ''[[Rocksmith]]''), [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s (''Rock Band 3''), [[drum]]s (''[[Donkey Konga]]'', ''[[Drum Mania]]'', the ''Rock Band'' series and the ''Guitar Hero'' series), or [[maraca]]s (''[[Samba de Amigo]]'') have also seen some success in arcades and home consoles. Other rhythm games are based around the art of Djing or [[turntablism]] (''[[DJ Hero]]''), or playing a [[synthesizer]] (''[[IIDX]]'')  using a [[Turntablism|turntable]] shaped peripheral with buttons.\n\n=== Wireless ===\n: [[Wireless]] versions of many popular controller types (joypads, mice, keyboards) exist, and wireless motion controls are an emerging class for virtual reality.\n\n=== Others ===\n* Pinball controllers and multi-button consoles for strategy games were released in the past, but their popularity was limited to hardcore fans of the genre.\n* [[Dance pad]]s, essentially a grid of flat pressure-sensitive gamepad buttons set on a mat meant to be stepped on, have seen niche success with the popularity of rhythm games like ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' and ''[[Pump It Up (video game)|Pump It Up]]''. The dance pad was first introduced by Bandai on the Famicom in 1986 as a part of their \"Family Fun Fitness\" set, then Exus released the \"Foot Craz\" pad for the Atari 2600 in 1987. Nintendo purchased the technology from Bandai in 1988 and used it on their \"Power Pad\", for the Famicom and NES.\n* [[Balance board]]: The [[Wii Balance Board]] comes with the game ''[[Wii Fit]]''. Several other game are in development which will be compatible with the balance board. This was preceded by decades by the ''[[Joyboard]]'', made to plug into an Atari 2600, to play skiing and surfing games.\n* Buzzers: A recent example of specialized, while very simple, game controllers, is the four large \"buzzers\" (round buttons) supplied with the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 [[Game show|quiz show]] game series ''[[Buzz!]]'' (2005\u2013present); both game and controllers clearly being inspired by the television show genre.\n* [[NeGcon]]: is a unique controller for racing games on the PlayStation. Physically it resembles a gamepad, but its left and right halves twist relative to each other, making it a variation of the paddle controller.\n* [[Microphone]]: A few games have made successes in using a headset or microphone as a secondary controller, such as ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'', the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series, the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]], the ''[[SingStar]]'' series, ''[[Tom Clancy's Endwar]]'', the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, and the ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' series. The use of these microphones allowed players to issue commands to the game, controlling teammates (as in ''SOCOM'') and other AI characters (e.g., Pikachu). The [[Nintendo DS]] features a microphone that is built into the system. It has been used for a variety of purposes, including [[speech recognition]] (''[[Nintendogs]]'', ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!]]''), chatting online between and during gameplay sessions ([[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]), and minigames that require the player to blow or shout into the microphone (''[[Feel the Magic: XY/XX]]'', ''[[WarioWare: Touched!]]'', ''[[Mario Party DS]]'').\n* ''[[Steel Battalion]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] was bundled with a full dashboard, with 2 joysticks and over 30 buttons, in an attempt to make it feel like an actual mecha simulator.\n* [[Fishing rod]]: the first fishing rod controller appeared as an accessory for the [[Dreamcast]] video console for playing ''[[Sega Marine Fishing]]''. Later other games for PlayStation console use also a similar controllers.\n* [[Fog display|Floating Interactive Display]]: at least two commercial systems ([[Heliodisplay]] and [http://fogscreen.com/ FogScreen]) offer interactive \"floating interfaces\" which display an image projected in mid-air but can be interacted with by finger similar to a touch screen.\n* [[Brain\u2013computer interface|Mind-controlled]] headset: As of March 24, 2007 a United States/Australian company called [[Emotiv Systems]] began launching a mind-controlled device for [[video game]]s based on [[electroencephalography]]. It was reported by [[The Wall Street Journal]]'s Don Clark on [[MSNBC]].<ref name=\"MSNBC report\">{{cite web|url=http://video.msn.com/?mkt=en-us&brand=msnbc&tab=m5&rf=&from=00&vid=09e9f856-63f3-40cd-83e6-eb6f2910a31c| publisher=MSNBC|title=Video Game Mind Control|accessdate=2007-03-25|year=2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n* [[PCGamerBike]] similar to a pair of pedals removed from an exercise bike, then set down in front of a chair & used to precisely control game characters instead.\n* [[Optical motion tracking]] systems such as [[TrackIR]] and [[FreeTrack]] use a video camera to track an infrared illuminated or emissive headpiece. Small head movements are tracked and then translated into much larger virtual in-game movements, allowing hands-free view control and improved immersiveness.\n* Mechanical motion tracking systems like [[Gametrak]] use cables attached to gloves for tracking position of physical elements in [[three-dimensional space]] in [[wiktionary:real time|real time]]. The Gametrak mechanism contains a retracting cable reel and a small tubular guide arm from which the cable passes out. The guide arm is articulated in a [[ball joint]] such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism. The distance of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure the rotation of the spool drum for the retracting cable reel, and calculating how far the cable is extended.\n* Exoskeleton controllers use exoskeleton technology to provide the player with different responses based on the player's body position, speed of movement, and other sensed data. In addition to audio and visual responses, an exoskeleton controller may provide a controlled resistance to movement and other stimuli to provide realism to the action. This not only lets players feel as if they are actually performing the function, but also helps reinforce the correct muscle pattern for the activity being simulated. The Forcetek XIO is an example of an exoskeleton video game controller.\n* [[Flight instruments|Instrument panels]] are simulated aircraft instrument panels, either generic or specific to a real aircraft, that are used in place of the keyboard to send commands to a flight simulation program. Some of these are far more expensive than all the rest of a computer system combined. The panels usually only simulate switches, buttons, and controls, rather than output instrument displays.\n** Train controls: Other instrument panel like hardware such as train controls have been produced.

Known in Japan as the ''Famicom Robot'', this short-lived accessory jumpstarted [[Nintendo]]'s involvement in the western market, though only used for ''[[Stack-Up]]'' and ''[[Gyromite]]''. It has been considered a \"Trojan horse\" for getting NESs into stores during the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game market crash of 1983]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} and the accessory was called by GameSpy the fifth greatest video game marketing move within twenty-five.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} As a character, R.O.B. appeared in later Nintendo games such as ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros.

Before the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]], plugging in a controller into one of a console's controller ports were the primary means of using a game controller, although since then they have been replaced by wireless controllers, which do not require controller ports on the console but are [[Electric battery|battery]]-powered. [[USB]] game controllers could also be connected to a [[computer]] with a USB port. [[Input devices]] that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as [[steering wheels]] for [[Racing video game|driving games]] and light guns for [[Shooter games|shooting games]], are also game controllers.\n\nGame controllers have been designed and improved over the years to be as user friendly as possible. The [[Xbox (console)|Microsoft Xbox]] controller, with its ''shoulder triggers'' that mimic actual triggers such as those found on guns, has become popular for [[Shooter game|shooting games]].<ref name = \"stanford\">{{cite web|title = Evolution of Video Game Controllers| url = http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/sites/default/files2/wlu_2003_1.pdf| first = William| last = Lu|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Some controllers are designed to be best for one type of game, such as steering wheels for [[Racing video game|driving games]], or [[dance pad]]s for dancing games.\n\nOne of the first video game controllers was a simple dial and single button, used to control the game ''[[Tennis for Two]]''. Controllers have since evolved to include [[D-pad|directional pads]], multiple buttons, [[analog stick]]s, [[joystick]]s, [[motion detection]], [[touch screen]]s and a plethora of other features.\n\n== Variants ==\n{{Cleanup|section|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Gamepad ===\n[[File:Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-FL.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A [[ Nintendo Switch Pro Controller]]]]\n{{Main article|Gamepad}}\n:A [[gamepad]], also known as a joypad, is held in both hands with thumbs and fingers used to provide input. Gamepads can have a number of [[Gamepad|action button]]s combined with one or more omnidirectional control sticks or buttons. Action buttons are generally handled with the digits on the right hand, and the directional input handled with the left. Gamepads are the primary means of input on most modern [[video game console]]s. Due to the ease of use and user-friendly nature of gamepads, they have spread from their origin on traditional consoles to [[computer]]s, where a variety of games and emulators support their input as a replacement for [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] input.<ref name=\"PCGamepad\">{{cite web| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/187658/how_to_use_your_console_gamepad_with_your_PC.html| title = How to use your console gamepad with your PC| accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Most modern game controllers are a variation of a standard gamepad. Common additions include shoulder buttons placed along the edges of the pad, centrally placed buttons labeled ''start'', ''select'', and ''mode'', and an internal motor to provide [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]]. \n:As modern game controllers advance, so too do their user ability qualities. Typically, the controllers become smaller and more compact to more easily, and comfortably, fit within the user's hand. Modern examples can be drawn from systems such as Xbox, whose controller has transformed subtly, yet dramatically, from the original [[Xbox 360 controller]] to the Xbox One controller introduced in 2013.\n:\n\n=== Paddle ===\n[[File:Atari-2600-Paddle-Controller-FR.jpg|thumb|Paddle controllers were popular early in the 2nd console generation for Pong games.]]\n{{Main article|Paddle (game controller)}}\n: A [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] is a controller that features a round wheel and one or more fire buttons. The wheel is typically used to control movement of the player or of an object along one axis of the video screen. As the user turns the wheel further from the default position, the speed of control in the game become more intensive. Paddle controllers were the first analog controllers and they lost popularity when \"paddle and ball\" type games fell out of favor. A variation, the Atari driving controller, appeared on the [[Atari 2600]]. Designed specifically for the game ''[[Indy 500 (1977 video game)|Indy 500]]'', it functioned almost identically in operation and design to the regular paddle controller. The exceptions were that its wheel could be continuously rotated in either direction, and that it was missing the extra paddle included on the previous model. Unlike a spinner, friction prevented the wheel from gaining momentum.\n\n=== Joystick ===\n[[File:PlayStation-Analog-Joystick.jpg|thumb|A dual-joystick controller for the original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]]][[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Arcade-Stick.jpg|thumb|An [[Arcade controller|arcade style controller]] for the Sega [[Dreamcast]].]]\n{{Main article|Joystick}}\n:A [[joystick]] is a [[peripheral]] that consists of a handheld stick that can be tilted around either of two axes and (sometimes) twisted around a third. The joystick is often used for [[flight simulator]]s. [[HOTAS]] (hands on throttle and stick) controllers, composed of a joystick and throttle quadrant (see below) are a popular combination for flight simulation among its most fanatic devotees. Most joysticks are designed to be operated with the user's primary hand (e.g. with the right hand of a right-handed person), with the base either held in the opposite hand or mounted on a desk. [[Arcade controller]]s are typically joysticks featuring a shaft that has a ball or drop-shaped handle, and one or more buttons for in game actions. Generally the layout has the joystick on the left, and the buttons on the right, although there are instances when this is reversed.\n\n=== Trackball ===\n{{Main article|Trackball}}\n: A [[trackball]] is a smooth sphere that is manipulated with the palm of one's hand. The user can roll the ball in any direction to control the cursor. It has the advantage that it can be faster than a mouse depending on the speed of rotation of the physical ball. Another advantage is that it requires less space than a [[Computer mouse|mouse]], which the trackball was a precursor of. Notable uses of a Trackball as a gaming controller would be games such as ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Marble Madness]]'', ''[[Golden Tee Golf]]'' and ''[[SegaSonic the Hedgehog]]''.\n\n=== Throttle quadrant ===\n: A throttle quadrant is a set of one or more levers that are most often used to simulate throttles or other similar controls in a real vehicle, particularly an aircraft. Throttle quadrants are most popular in conjunction with joysticks or yokes used in flight simulation.\n\n=== Steering wheel ===\n[[File:Logitech-Driving-Force-PS3.jpg|thumb|A [[Logitech]] steering wheel for the [[PlayStation 3]]]]\n{{Main article|Racing wheel}}\n:A [[Racing wheel]], essentially a larger version of a paddle, is used in most [[racing video game|racing]] [[arcade game]]s as well as more recent [[Sim racing|racing simulators]] such as ''[[Live for Speed]]'', ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'', ''[[GTR 2 \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR2]]'', and ''[[Richard Burns Rally]]''. While most [[Arcade racer|arcade racing]] games have been using steering wheels since ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'' in 1974,<ref name=\"Kohler-16\">{{citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-up: how Japanese video games gave the world an extra life|page=16|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> the first steering wheels for home systems appeared on [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth-generation consoles]] such as the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Nintendo 64]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Many are [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] (see [[Haptic technology|Force Feedback Wheel]]), designed to give the same feedback as would be experienced when driving a real car, but the realism of this depends on the game. They usually come with pedals to control the gas and brake. Shifting is taken care of in various ways including paddle shifting systems, simple stick shifters which are moved forward or back to change gears or more complex shifters which mimic those of real vehicles, which may also use a clutch. Most wheels turn only 200 to 270 degrees lock-to-lock but some models, such as the [[Logitech]] [[Driving Force Pro]], [[Logitech G25]] and [[Logitech G27]] can turn 900 degrees, or 2.5 turns, lock-to-lock. The [[Namco]] [[Jogcon]] paddle was available for the PlayStation game ''[[R4: Ridge Racer Type 4]]''. Unlike \"real\" video game steering wheels, the Jogcon was designed to fit in the player's hand. Its much smaller wheel (diameter roughly similar to a [[aluminum can|soda can]]'s) resembles the jog-and-shuttle control wheel used on some [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s. The [[Nintendo Wii]] game ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' is bundled with the [[Wii Wheel]]: a steering wheel-shaped shell that the [[Wii Remote]] is placed inside thus using the Wii Remote's motion sensing capabilities to control the [[Go-kart|kart]] during the game. Hori also has a steering wheel that is made for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''. When the steering wheel is placed on the back of the console, then it will have the same ability as in ''Mario Kart Wii'' by using the [[gyroscope]] in [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] mode.\n\n=== Yoke ===\n: A yoke is very similar to a steering wheel except that it resembles the control yoke found on many aircraft and has two axes of movement: not only rotational movement about the shaft of the yoke, but also a forward-and-backward axis equivalent to that of pitch control on the yoke of an aircraft. Some yokes have additional controls attached directly to the yoke for simulation of aircraft functions such as radio push-to-talk buttons. Some flight simulator sets that include yokes also come with various other aircraft controls such as throttle quadrants and pedals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.logitechg.com/en-roeu/products/flight/flight-simulator-yoke-system.html|title=Logitech G Flight Simulator Yoke System with Throttle Quadrant|website=www.logitechg.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref> These sets, including the yoke, are intended to be used in a [[flight simulator]].\n\n=== Pedals ===\n:[[File:LDFGT.JPG|thumb|Logitech Driving Force GT]]Pedals may be used for driving simulations or flight simulations and often ships with a steering-wheel-type input device.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals|last=Shelly|first=Gary|last2=Vermaat|first2=Misty|publisher=Course Technology Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=9781423927020|location=Boston, MA|pages=172}}</ref> In the former case, an asymmetric set of pedals can simulate accelerator, brake, and clutch pedals in a real automobile. In the latter case, a symmetric set of pedals simulates rudder controls and toe brakes in an aircraft. As mentioned, most steering wheel controllers come with a set of pedals. There are also variations of the pedal controller such as the proposed rotating pedal device for a cycling game, which relies on an ergometer to generate user inputs such as pedal rpm and pedal resistance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals|last=Chorianopoulos|first=Konstantinos|last2=Divitini|first2=Monica|last3=Hauge|first3=Jannicke|last4=Jaccheri|first4=Letizia|last5=Malaka|first5=Rainer|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783319245881|location=Heidelberg|pages=158}}</ref> A variation of this concept surfaced in 2016 when a startup called VirZoom debuted a set of sensors that can be installed in the pedal and handlebars, turning a physical bike into one controller for games on the [[HTC Vive]] and [[Oculus Rift]] [[Virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]] platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/virzoom-vr-game-controller,news-22601.html|title=This Bike Lets You Pedal Through Virtual Reality|last=Michaels|first=Philip|date=2016-04-28|work=Tom's Guide|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}</ref> The same concept is behind a product called Cyber ExerCycle,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyberbiking.com/|title=Cyber ExerCycle: Interactive Exercise Bike Kit|last=Ltd.|first=Universal Timer|website=www.cyberbiking.com|access-date=2018-08-21}}</ref> which is a set of sensors attached to the pedal and connected to the PC via [[USB]] for bicycle simulation games such as NetAthlon and [[Fuel (video game)|Fuel]].\n\n[[File:W-A-S-D.jpg|thumb|The [[Arrow keys#WASD keys|WASD]] KEYBOARD setup is used widely, but by no means universally.]]\n\n=== Mouse and keyboard ===\n: A [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] and [[computer keyboard]] are typical [[input device]]s for a [[personal computer]] and are currently the main game controllers for [[Video game|computer game]]s. The mouse is often used with a [[mousepad]] to achieve greater speed, comfort, accuracy and smoother movement for the gamer. Some video game consoles also have the ability to function with a keyboard and a mouse. The computer keyboard is modelled after the [[typewriter keyboard]] and was designed for the input of written text. A mouse is a handheld [[pointing device]] used in addition to the keyboard. For games, the keyboard typically controls movement of the character while the mouse is used to control the game camera or used for aiming. While originally designed for general computer input, there are several keyboard and mouse peripherals available which are designed specifically for gaming, often with gaming-specific functions built-in. Examples include peripherals by [[Razer USA|Razer]], the \"Zboard\" range of keyboards and [[Logitech]]'s 'G' series. The numeric [[Keyboard technology|keypad]] found on the keyboard is also used as a game controller and can be found on a number of separate devices, most notably early consoles, usually attached to a joystick or a paddle. The keypad is a small grid of keys with at least the digits 0-9. A [[Gaming keypad]] is a specialized controller used for [[first-person shooter|FPSs]], [[Real-time strategy|RTSs]] and some arcade type games. These controllers can be programmed to allow the emulation of keys, and macros in some cases. These generally resemble a small part of a keyboard but may also feature other inputs such as [[analog stick]]s. They were developed because some of these games require a keyboard to play, and some players find this to be awkward for such a task.\n\n=== Touchscreen ===\n:[[File:Nintendo-DS-Lite-w-stylus.png|thumb|240px|Nintendo DS touchscreen (bottom) with [[stylus]].]]A [[touchscreen]] is an input device that allows the user to interact with the computer by touching the display screen. The first attempt at a [[handheld game console]] with touchscreen controls was Sega's intended successor to the [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]], though the device was ultimately shelved and never released due to the high cost of touchscreen technology in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p7.html|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA|page=7|website=IGN|first=Travis|last=Fahs|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref> The first released console to use a touchscreen was the [[Tiger Electronics|Tiger]] [[game.com]] in 1997. Nintendo popularized it for use in video games with the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]]; other systems including the [[Tapwave Zodiac]] as well as [[Smartphone]]s and the vast majority of [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] have also included this feature. The primary controller for Nintendo's [[Wii U]] console, the [[Wii U GamePad]], features an embedded touchscreen. Modern touch screens use a thin, durable, transparent plastic sheet overlaid onto a glass screen. The location of a touch is calculated from the [[capacitance]] for the X and Y [[Coordinate system|axes]], which varies based upon where the sheet is touched. One console that is touchscreen, but is not manufactured by Nintendo is Sony's PlayStation Vita which has a 5 inch OLED touchscreen. The [[Nintendo Switch]] features a 6.2 inch touchscreen.\n\n=== Breathing controllers ===\n: Breathing controllers help their users improve breathing through video games. All controllers have sensors that sense users breath, with which user controls video game on computer, tablet or on smartphone. Alvio is a breathing trainer, symptom tracker and mobile game controller.<ref name=\"Crain's\">{{cite web |title=Gadget gurus proliferate in NY's tech scene |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20141021/SMALLBIZ/310199994/gadget-gurus-proliferate-in-nys-tech-scene# |work=Crain's New York Business |accessdate=2015-05-21 |last=Field |first=Anne |date=2014-04-21}}</ref> Zenytime promotes deep, rhythmic breathing to trigger short-term rewards of controlled breathing (relaxation, improved oxygenation...).<ref name=\"Gizmag\">{{cite web |title=Zenytime games are controlled by your breathing to improve wellbeing |url=http://www.gizmag.com/zenytime/33802/ |work=Gizmag |accessdate=2015-05-21 |last=Roberts |first=Stu |date=2014-09-15}}</ref> Breathing games by Breathing Labs are based on [[Pursed lip breathing]] and are used on [[iPhone]] / [[iPad]], [[Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"MEi\">{{cite web |title=Breathing through pursed lips aids in reducing stress anxiety |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/meicogsci/php/ocs/index.php/meicog/meicog2012/paper/view/366 |work= MEi |accessdate=2015-05-21 |last=Miku\u0161 |first=Nace |last2=Leskov\u0161ek |first2=Matev\u017e |date=2012-06-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Motion sensing ===\n[[File:Wii Remote Image.jpg|thumb|Wii Remote.]]\n: [[Motion controller]]s include the [[Sega Activator]], released in 1993 for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] (Genesis). Based on the Light Harp invented by Assaf Gurner,<ref>{{cite video |title=Light Harp at CES 1993  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoxsnCiX05k |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2010-07-06}}</ref> it could read the player's physical movements and was the first controller to allow full-body motion sensing.

The [[Sixaxis]], [[DualShock 3]], and [[PlayStation Move]] controllers for Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] system have similar motion sensing capabilities. In 2010, Microsoft released the [[Kinect]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. This motion sensing controller uses cameras to track a players movement. Microsoft released a revised version of the Kinect with the launch of the [[Xbox One]]. This controller was bundled with the console on launch, and was removed from the default bundle in June 2014. Sony's [[EyeToy]] similarly uses cameras to detect the player's motions and translate them into inputs for the game.\n\n=== Light gun ===\n[[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Lightgun-FL.jpg|thumb|The Dreamcast light gun]]\n{{Main article|Light gun}}\n: A [[light gun]] is a peripheral used to \"shoot\" targets on a screen. They usually roughly resemble firearms or ray guns. Their use is normally limited to [[rail shooter]]s, or [[Shooter game#Shooting gallery|shooting gallery]] games like [[Duck Hunt]] and those which came with the ''[[Shooting Gallery (game accessory)|Shooting Gallery]]'' light gun. A rare example of a non-rail first person shooter game is [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s 1992 [[video game]] ''Gun Buster'', a [[first-person shooter]] that used a [[joystick]] to move and a light gun to [[Free look|aim]].<ref>{{KLOV game|8036|Gun Buster}}</ref> Though light guns have been used in earlier [[arcade game]]s such as [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sega Periscope|Periscope]]'' in 1966<ref>Ashcraft, Brian (2008), ''Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers'', p. 133, Kodansha International</ref> and ''Missile'' in 1969,<ref>{{KLOV game|10600|Missile}}</ref> the first home console light gun was released for the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] in 1972; later on, [[Nintendo]] would include one standard on their Famicom and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], called the [[NES Zapper]]. Nintendo has also released a \"shell\" in the style of a light gun for the more recent [[Wii Remote]] called the [[Wii Zapper]] which comes bundled with the game ''[[Link's Crossbow Training]]''.\n\n=== Rhythm game controllers ===\n\n[[File:Guitar Hero series controllers.jpg|thumb|Guitar controllers.]]\n: A [[Rhythm game accessories]] used for [[rhythm games]] can resemble musical instruments, such as [[guitar]]s (from 5-button guitars in ''[[Guitar Freaks]]'', the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' series, the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series to real guitars in ''[[Rock Band 3]]'' and ''[[Rocksmith]]''), [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s (''Rock Band 3''), [[drum]]s (''[[Donkey Konga]]'', ''[[Drum Mania]]'', the ''Rock Band'' series and the ''Guitar Hero'' series), or [[maraca]]s (''[[Samba de Amigo]]'') have also seen some success in arcades and home consoles. Other rhythm games are based around the art of Djing or [[turntablism]] (''[[DJ Hero]]''), or playing a [[synthesizer]] (''[[IIDX]]'')  using a [[Turntablism|turntable]] shaped peripheral with buttons.\n\n=== Wireless ===\n: [[Wireless]] versions of many popular controller types (joypads, mice, keyboards) exist, and wireless motion controls are an emerging class for virtual reality.\n\n=== Others ===\n* Pinball controllers and multi-button consoles for strategy games were released in the past, but their popularity was limited to hardcore fans of the genre.\n* [[Dance pad]]s, essentially a grid of flat pressure-sensitive gamepad buttons set on a mat meant to be stepped on, have seen niche success with the popularity of rhythm games like ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' and ''[[Pump It Up (video game)|Pump It Up]]''. The dance pad was first introduced by Bandai on the Famicom in 1986 as a part of their \"Family Fun Fitness\" set, then Exus released the \"Foot Craz\" pad for the Atari 2600 in 1987. Nintendo purchased the technology from Bandai in 1988 and used it on their \"Power Pad\", for the Famicom and NES.\n* [[Balance board]]: The [[Wii Balance Board]] comes with the game ''[[Wii Fit]]''. Several other game are in development which will be compatible with the balance board. This was preceded by decades by the ''[[Joyboard]]'', made to plug into an Atari 2600, to play skiing and surfing games.\n* Buzzers: A recent example of specialized, while very simple, game controllers, is the four large \"buzzers\" (round buttons) supplied with the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 [[Game show|quiz show]] game series ''[[Buzz!]]'' (2005\u2013present); both game and controllers clearly being inspired by the television show genre.\n* [[NeGcon]]: is a unique controller for racing games on the PlayStation. Physically it resembles a gamepad, but its left and right halves twist relative to each other, making it a variation of the paddle controller.\n* [[Microphone]]: A few games have made successes in using a headset or microphone as a secondary controller, such as ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'', the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series, the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]], the ''[[SingStar]]'' series, ''[[Tom Clancy's Endwar]]'', the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, and the ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' series. The use of these microphones allowed players to issue commands to the game, controlling teammates (as in ''SOCOM'') and other AI characters (e.g., Pikachu). The [[Nintendo DS]] features a microphone that is built into the system. It has been used for a variety of purposes, including [[speech recognition]] (''[[Nintendogs]]'', ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!]]''), chatting online between and during gameplay sessions ([[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]), and minigames that require the player to blow or shout into the microphone (''[[Feel the Magic: XY/XX]]'', ''[[WarioWare: Touched!]]'', ''[[Mario Party DS]]'').\n* ''[[Steel Battalion]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] was bundled with a full dashboard, with 2 joysticks and over 30 buttons, in an attempt to make it feel like an actual mecha simulator.\n* [[Fishing rod]]: the first fishing rod controller appeared as an accessory for the [[Dreamcast]] video console for playing ''[[Sega Marine Fishing]]''. Later other games for PlayStation console use also a similar controllers.\n* [[Fog display|Floating Interactive Display]]: at least two commercial systems ([[Heliodisplay]] and [http://fogscreen.com/ FogScreen]) offer interactive \"floating interfaces\" which display an image projected in mid-air but can be interacted with by finger similar to a touch screen.\n* [[Brain\u2013computer interface|Mind-controlled]] headset: As of March 24, 2007 a United States/Australian company called [[Emotiv Systems]] began launching a mind-controlled device for [[video game]]s based on [[electroencephalography]]. It was reported by [[The Wall Street Journal]]'s Don Clark on [[MSNBC]].<ref name=\"MSNBC report\">{{cite web|url=http://video.msn.com/?mkt=en-us&brand=msnbc&tab=m5&rf=&from=00&vid=09e9f856-63f3-40cd-83e6-eb6f2910a31c| publisher=MSNBC|title=Video Game Mind Control|accessdate=2007-03-25|year=2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n* [[PCGamerBike]] similar to a pair of pedals removed from an exercise bike, then set down in front of a chair & used to precisely control game characters instead.\n* [[Optical motion tracking]] systems such as [[TrackIR]] and [[FreeTrack]] use a video camera to track an infrared illuminated or emissive headpiece. Small head movements are tracked and then translated into much larger virtual in-game movements, allowing hands-free view control and improved immersiveness.\n* Mechanical motion tracking systems like [[Gametrak]] use cables attached to gloves for tracking position of physical elements in [[three-dimensional space]] in [[wiktionary:real time|real time]]. The Gametrak mechanism contains a retracting cable reel and a small tubular guide arm from which the cable passes out. The guide arm is articulated in a [[ball joint]] such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism. The distance of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure the rotation of the spool drum for the retracting cable reel, and calculating how far the cable is extended.\n* Exoskeleton controllers use exoskeleton technology to provide the player with different responses based on the player's body position, speed of movement, and other sensed data. In addition to audio and visual responses, an exoskeleton controller may provide a controlled resistance to movement and other stimuli to provide realism to the action. This not only lets players feel as if they are actually performing the function, but also helps reinforce the correct muscle pattern for the activity being simulated. The Forcetek XIO is an example of an exoskeleton video game controller.\n* [[Flight instruments|Instrument panels]] are simulated aircraft instrument panels, either generic or specific to a real aircraft, that are used in place of the keyboard to send commands to a flight simulation program. Some of these are far more expensive than all the rest of a computer system combined. The panels usually only simulate switches, buttons, and controls, rather than output instrument displays.\n** Train controls: Other instrument panel like hardware such as train controls have been produced. The \"[[RailDriver]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raildriver.com/products/raildriver.php|title=RailDriver&nbsp;\u2013 Desktop Train Cab Controller|publisher = www.raildriver.com|accessdate=2009-01-24|last = |first = }}</ref> for example is designed to work with ''[[Trainz]]'', ''[[Microsoft Train Simulator]]'' and ''[[Rail Simulator|Kuju Rail Simulator]]''. (as of January 2009) it is limited in ease of use by the lack of a Windows API for some of the software it is designed to work with. A train controller for a [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] bullet train sim has also been made for the [[Wii]] console.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamersquad.com/category/Nintendo-Wii/Wii-train-sim-controller-is-sweeeet/| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071219000000/http://www.gamersquad.com/category/Nintendo-Wii/Wii-train-sim-controller-is-sweeeet/|archivedate=2007-12-19|title=Wii train sim controller \u2013 Bullet Train Controller Wii: GamerSquad discusses the Bullet Train Controller for Nintendo Wii|publisher=www.gamersquad.com|accessdate=2009-01-24|last=|first=}}</ref>\n* [[R.O.B.]] (Robotic Operating Buddy) is an accessory for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES), which allowed players to interact with NES games by controlling the robot. Known in Japan as the ''Famicom Robot'', this short-lived accessory jumpstarted [[Nintendo]]'s involvement in the western market, though only used for ''[[Stack-Up]]'' and ''[[Gyromite]]''. It has been considered a \"Trojan horse\" for getting NESs into stores during the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game market crash of 1983]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} and the accessory was called by GameSpy the fifth greatest video game marketing move within twenty-five.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} As a character, R.O.B. appeared in later Nintendo games such as ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros.

During his reign, he increasingly regarded the Christian missionaries and the European colonial powers, notably the British, as threats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awdflibrary.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/361/13%20Tamale_OutoftheCloset_FemAfrica.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|title=Out of the Closet: Unveiling Sexuality Discourses in Uganda}}</ref>\n\nMwanga II took a more aggressive approach than other African leaders, choosing to expel all missionaries and insist that Christian and Muslim converts abandon their faith or [[Uganda Martyrs|face death]]. The [[Luganda]] term {{lang|lg|abasiyazi}} refers to homosexuals, though usage nowadays is commonly pejorative. The Baganda were not the only ethnic group known to engage in homosexual acts. Among the [[Lango people]], ''[[mudoko dako]]'' individuals were believed to form a \"[[third gender]]\" alongside male and female. The {{lang|laj|mudoko dako}} were effeminate men, mostly treated by Langi society as women and could marry other men without social sanctions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awdflibrary.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/361/13%20Tamale_OutoftheCloset_FemAfrica.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|title=Out of the Closet: Unveiling Sexuality Discourses in Uganda}}</ref> Homosexuality was also acknowledged among the [[Teso people|Teso]], Bahima, [[Bunyoro|Banyoro]], and [[Karamojong people]]s.<ref>[https://www.galck.org/are-you-happy-or-are-you-gay/ Are You Happy Or Are You Gay?]</ref> Societal acceptance disappeared after the arrival of the British and the creation of the [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref name=\"queer2012\">{{Cite web|url=http://queerstoryfiles.blogspot.com/2012/10/gay-in-great-lakes-of-africa.html|title=The Queerstory Files: Gay in the Great Lakes of Africa|first=Tony|last=Scupham-bilton|date=8 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nPresently, there is widespread denial that homosexuality was practised before colonisation. Furthermore, the false belief that homosexuality is \"un-African\" or \"Western\" is quite prevalent in Ugandan society.<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nThe term {{lang|sw|kuchu}}, of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] origin, is increasingly used by the Ugandan LGBT community. A documentary film, ''[[Call Me Kuchu]]'' was released in 2012, focusing in part on the 2011 murder of LGBT activist [[David Kato]].\n\n===Statutes===\nLaws prohibiting same-sex sexual acts were first put in place under British colonial rule in the 19th century. Those laws were enshrined in the ''Penal Code Act 1950'' and retained following independence. The following sections of that Act are relevant:\n\n<blockquote>'''Section 145. Unnatural offences.''' Any person who\u2014\n:(a) has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature; [or]\n:(b) has carnal knowledge of an animal; or\n:(c) permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him or her against the order of nature,\ncommits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.<ref name=\"PCA\">[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ug/ug008en.pdf Penal Code Act 1950, World Intellectual Property Organization]</ref><ref name=\"PCA2\">[http://www.upf.go.ug/download/resources/Penal_Code_Act_1950.pdf Penal Code Act 1950, Uganda Police Force]</ref>\n\n'''Section 146. Attempt to commit unnatural offences.''' Any person who attempts to commit any of the offences specified in section 145 commits a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n'''Section 148. Indecent practices.''' Any person who, whether in public or in private, commits any act of gross indecency with another person or procures another person to commit any act of gross indecency with him or her or attempts to procure the commission of any such act by any person with himself or herself or with another person, whether in public or in private, commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/></blockquote>\n\nBefore the ''Penal Code Amendment (Gender References) Act 2000'' was enacted, only same-sex acts between men were criminalized. In 2000, that Act was passed and changed references to \"any male\" to \"any person\" so that grossly indecent acts between women were criminalized as well, and are now punishable by up to 7 years imprisonment. The Act also extended this criminalizing such acts to both homosexuals and heterosexuals. This effectively outlawed both [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], regardless of sexual orientation, under the Penal Code.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n====Anti-Homosexuality Act====\n{{Main|Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill}}\nOn 13 October 2009, Member of Parliament [[David Bahati]] introduced the ''[[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill|Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2009]]'', which would broaden the criminalization of same-sex relationships in [Uganda and introduce the death penalty for serial offenders, HIV-positive people who engage in sexual activity with people of the same sex, and persons who engage in same-sex sexual acts with people under 18 years of age. Individuals or companies that promote LGBT rights would be fined or imprisoned, or both. Persons \"in authority\" would be required to report any offence under the Act within 24 hours or face up to three years' imprisonment.\n\nIn November 2012, Parliament Speaker [[Rebecca Kadaga]] promised to pass a revised anti-homosexuality law in December 2012. \"Ugandans want that law as a Christmas gift.

On July 15, [2011,] a court in [[Entebbe]] charged him with \"indecent practices\" and released him on bail. Hearing of the case was pending at year's end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>LGBT persons were subject to societal harassment, discrimination, intimidation, and threats to their well-being [in 2011] and were denied access to health services.

[[Simon Lokodo]], Minister for Ethics and Integrity, is known by Ugandan LGBT activists as \"the country's main homophobe\", has suggested that rape is more morally acceptable than consensual sex between people of the same sex, has accompanied violent police raids on LGBT events and actively suppresses freedom of speech and of assembly for LGBT people.<ref name=\"mamba\"/>\n\nUganda's main [[LGBT rights]] organization is [[Sexual Minorities Uganda]], founded in 2004 by [[Victor Mukasa]] and has been allowed to conduct its activities without much government interference.

Under the Penal Code, \"carnal knowledge against the order of nature\" between two males carries a potential penalty of life imprisonment. The ''[[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014]]'' was passed on 17 December 2013 with a punishment of [[life in prison]] for \"aggravated homosexuality\".<ref name=\"prison\"/> The law brought [[Uganda]] into international spotlight, and caused international outrage, with many governments refusing to provide aid to Uganda anymore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/will-lgbt-ugandans-ever-be-free-inside-fight-queer-country|title=Will LGBT Ugandans Ever Be Free?

LGBT people continue to face major discrimination in Uganda, actively encouraged by political and religious leaders. Violent and brutal attacks against LGBT people are common, often performed by state officials. Households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples. Same-sex marriage has been constitutionally banned since 2005.\n\nHomosexual relations were accepted and commonplace in pre-colonial Ugandan society.<ref name=\"guardian\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ilga.org/ugandan-documentary-on-gay-love-in-pre-colonial-africa|title=UGANDAN DOCUMENTARY ON GAY LOVE IN PRE-COLONIAL AFRICA|work=ilga.org|date=8 June 2012}}</ref> The [[British Empire]] introduced laws punishing homosexuality when Uganda became a [[British Empire|British]] colony.

Among the [[Baganda]], Uganda's largest ethnic group, homosexuality was usually treated with indifference. [[Kabaka of Buganda|King]] [[Mwanga II of Buganda]] was famously bisexual, known to have regular sexual relations with women, having had a total of 16 wives, as well as his male subjects. During his reign, he increasingly regarded the Christian missionaries and the European colonial powers, notably the British, as threats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awdflibrary.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/361/13%20Tamale_OutoftheCloset_FemAfrica.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|title=Out of the Closet: Unveiling Sexuality Discourses in Uganda}}</ref>\n\nMwanga II took a more aggressive approach than other African leaders, choosing to expel all missionaries and insist that Christian and Muslim converts abandon their faith or [[Uganda Martyrs|face death]]. The [[Luganda]] term {{lang|lg|abasiyazi}} refers to homosexuals, though usage nowadays is commonly pejorative. The Baganda were not the only ethnic group known to engage in homosexual acts. Among the [[Lango people]], ''[[mudoko dako]]'' individuals were believed to form a \"[[third gender]]\" alongside male and female. The {{lang|laj|mudoko dako}} were effeminate men, mostly treated by Langi society as women and could marry other men without social sanctions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awdflibrary.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/361/13%20Tamale_OutoftheCloset_FemAfrica.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|title=Out of the Closet: Unveiling Sexuality Discourses in Uganda}}</ref> Homosexuality was also acknowledged among the [[Teso people|Teso]], Bahima, [[Bunyoro|Banyoro]], and [[Karamojong people]]s.<ref>[https://www.galck.org/are-you-happy-or-are-you-gay/ Are You Happy Or Are You Gay?]</ref> Societal acceptance disappeared after the arrival of the British and the creation of the [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref name=\"queer2012\">{{Cite web|url=http://queerstoryfiles.blogspot.com/2012/10/gay-in-great-lakes-of-africa.html|title=The Queerstory Files: Gay in the Great Lakes of Africa|first=Tony|last=Scupham-bilton|date=8 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nPresently, there is widespread denial that homosexuality was practised before colonisation. Furthermore, the false belief that homosexuality is \"un-African\" or \"Western\" is quite prevalent in Ugandan society.<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nThe term {{lang|sw|kuchu}}, of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] origin, is increasingly used by the Ugandan LGBT community. A documentary film, ''[[Call Me Kuchu]]'' was released in 2012, focusing in part on the 2011 murder of LGBT activist [[David Kato]].\n\n===Statutes===\nLaws prohibiting same-sex sexual acts were first put in place under British colonial rule in the 19th century. Those laws were enshrined in the ''Penal Code Act 1950'' and retained following independence. The following sections of that Act are relevant:\n\n<blockquote>'''Section 145. Unnatural offences.''' Any person who\u2014\n:(a) has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature; [or]\n:(b) has carnal knowledge of an animal; or\n:(c) permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him or her against the order of nature,\ncommits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.<ref name=\"PCA\">[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ug/ug008en.pdf Penal Code Act 1950, World Intellectual Property Organization]</ref><ref name=\"PCA2\">[http://www.upf.go.ug/download/resources/Penal_Code_Act_1950.pdf Penal Code Act 1950, Uganda Police Force]</ref>\n\n'''Section 146. Attempt to commit unnatural offences.''' Any person who attempts to commit any of the offences specified in section 145 commits a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n'''Section 148. Indecent practices.''' Any person who, whether in public or in private, commits any act of gross indecency with another person or procures another person to commit any act of gross indecency with him or her or attempts to procure the commission of any such act by any person with himself or herself or with another person, whether in public or in private, commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/></blockquote>\n\nBefore the ''Penal Code Amendment (Gender References) Act 2000'' was enacted, only same-sex acts between men were criminalized. In 2000, that Act was passed and changed references to \"any male\" to \"any person\" so that grossly indecent acts between women were criminalized as well, and are now punishable by up to 7 years imprisonment. The Act also extended this criminalizing such acts to both homosexuals and heterosexuals. This effectively outlawed both [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], regardless of sexual orientation, under the Penal Code.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n====Anti-Homosexuality Act====\n{{Main|Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill}}\nOn 13 October 2009, Member of Parliament [[David Bahati]] introduced the ''[[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill|Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2009]]'', which would broaden the criminalization of same-sex relationships in [Uganda and introduce the death penalty for serial offenders, HIV-positive people who engage in sexual activity with people of the same sex, and persons who engage in same-sex sexual acts with people under 18 years of age. Individuals or companies that promote LGBT rights would be fined or imprisoned, or both. Persons \"in authority\" would be required to report any offence under the Act within 24 hours or face up to three years' imprisonment.\n\nIn November 2012, Parliament Speaker [[Rebecca Kadaga]] promised to pass a revised anti-homosexuality law in December 2012. \"Ugandans want that law as a Christmas gift.

It is illegal to engage in homosexual acts.... While no persons were convicted under the law [in 2011], the government arrested persons for related offenses. For example, in July police arrested an individual for \"attempting\" to engage in homosexual activities. On July 15, [2011,] a court in [[Entebbe]] charged him with \"indecent practices\" and released him on bail. Hearing of the case was pending at year's end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>LGBT persons were subject to societal harassment, discrimination, intimidation, and threats to their well-being [in 2011] and were denied access to health services.

[[Simon Lokodo]], Minister for Ethics and Integrity, is known by Ugandan LGBT activists as \"the country's main homophobe\", has suggested that rape is more morally acceptable than consensual sex between people of the same sex, has accompanied violent police raids on LGBT events and actively suppresses freedom of speech and of assembly for LGBT people.<ref name=\"mamba\"/>\n\nUganda's main [[LGBT rights]] organization is [[Sexual Minorities Uganda]], founded in 2004 by [[Victor Mukasa]] and has been allowed to conduct its activities without much government interference.

According to the biblical narrative, the tribe had originally tried to settle in the central coastal area of [[Canaan]], but due to enmity with the Philistines who had already settled there, were only able to camp in the hill country overlooking the [[Sorek Valley]]. The camp location became known as Mahaneh Dan (\"Camps of Dan\"). The region they attempted to settle included the area as far north as [[Jaffa|Joppa]] and as far south as [[Shephelah]] in the area of [[Timnah]]. As a result of the pressure from the Philistines, the tribe abandoned hopes of settling near the central coast, instead migrating to the north of the country.  After conquering Laish, the tribe refounded it as their capital and renamed it [[Tel Dan|Dan]]. In remembrance of the original territory assignments, this coastal region is referred to as Gush Dan.\n\nThe modern city of [[Tel Aviv]] was founded in 1909 as a suburb of the Arab majority coastal city of [[Jaffa]].<ref name=\"tel-aviv.gov.il\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/english/StatisticalOverview.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913132730/http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/english/StatisticalOverview.htm |archivedate=2014-09-13 }}</ref> The city grew rapidly in the ensuing decades thanks to Jewish immigration from Europe, with the population reaching 150,000 in 1934, and 230,000 14 years later when Israel gained its independence. Before the establishment of the state, other towns in the Gush Dan were founded as well, such as [[Petah Tikva]] in 1878, [[Rishon LeZion]] in 1882, [[Ness Ziona]] in 1883, [[Rehovot]] in 1890, and the majority of other Gush Dan cities were established before 1948.\n\nIn 1947, the Jewish population of the Gush Dan was nearly 400,000, comprising the majority of the Jewish population of Mandate Palestine. As such almost all of it was included in the Jewish state proposed by the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the Arab population of the region, which had been nearly 150,000 before the war,<ref name=\"tel-aviv.gov.il\"/> was reduced to around 10,000. They were quickly replaced by a larger number of Jews fleeing from postwar Europe and persecution in Arab countries. However, at this time many new immigrants did not come to Tel Aviv. In the 1950s towns were built on the edges of the Gush Dan, including [[Ashdod]], [[Rosh HaAyin]] and [[Yavne]]. The nation's sole port at the time was located in the northern city of Haifa and its evolving metropolitan area making that city at least as important as Tel Aviv. At the same time the new government was trying to disperse the nation's population to the periphery, discouraging settlement in the already populated Gush Dan. This slowed the growth of the Gush Dan, but the area still more than doubled in population within 20 years of the establishment of the state. The opening of the Port of Ashdod in the southern Gush Dan also increased the area's importance, with Haifa's importance diminishing, and Tel Aviv's increasing due to its proximity to the Port of Ashdod. Tel Aviv itself witnessed population decreases in the 1970s, and 80s with outer regions of the Gush Dan with lower costs of living absorbing many people who left Tel Aviv. Only in the 1990s with the immigration of more than 1 million Jews from former Soviet Republics, 40,000 [[Ethiopian Jews]], and many others to Israel, as well as a boom in the religious population, did Tel Aviv begin to grow again. The demand for housing increased dramatically, with new cities such as [[Modiin]], [[El'ad]] being built, and cities like [[Ashdod]] more than doubling in population, from 83,000 in 1990, to 175,000 in 2000. In the 2000s the area continued to grow, attracting many immigrants from the [[Haifa metropolitan area]]. In 2010 the Gush Dan is home to 3,200,000 people and is the commercial, economical, cultural, and industrial center of [[Israel]].

According to the biblical narrative, the tribe had originally tried to settle in the central coastal area of [[Canaan]], but due to enmity with the Philistines who had already settled there, were only able to camp in the hill country overlooking the [[Sorek Valley]]. The camp location became known as Mahaneh Dan (\"Camps of Dan\"). The region they attempted to settle included the area as far north as [[Jaffa|Joppa]] and as far south as [[Shephelah]] in the area of [[Timnah]]. As a result of the pressure from the Philistines, the tribe abandoned hopes of settling near the central coast, instead migrating to the north of the country.  After conquering Laish, the tribe refounded it as their capital and renamed it [[Tel Dan|Dan]]. In remembrance of the original territory assignments, this coastal region is referred to as Gush Dan.\n\nThe modern city of [[Tel Aviv]] was founded in 1909 as a suburb of the Arab majority coastal city of [[Jaffa]].<ref name=\"tel-aviv.gov.il\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/english/StatisticalOverview.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913132730/http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/english/StatisticalOverview.htm |archivedate=2014-09-13 }}</ref> The city grew rapidly in the ensuing decades thanks to Jewish immigration from Europe, with the population reaching 150,000 in 1934, and 230,000 14 years later when Israel gained its independence. Before the establishment of the state, other towns in the Gush Dan were founded as well, such as [[Petah Tikva]] in 1878, [[Rishon LeZion]] in 1882, [[Ness Ziona]] in 1883, [[Rehovot]] in 1890, and the majority of other Gush Dan cities were established before 1948.\n\nIn 1947, the Jewish population of the Gush Dan was nearly 400,000, comprising the majority of the Jewish population of Mandate Palestine. As such almost all of it was included in the Jewish state proposed by the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the Arab population of the region, which had been nearly 150,000 before the war,<ref name=\"tel-aviv.gov.il\"/> was reduced to around 10,000. They were quickly replaced by a larger number of Jews fleeing from postwar Europe and persecution in Arab countries. However, at this time many new immigrants did not come to Tel Aviv. In the 1950s towns were built on the edges of the Gush Dan, including [[Ashdod]], [[Rosh HaAyin]] and [[Yavne]]. The nation's sole port at the time was located in the northern city of Haifa and its evolving metropolitan area making that city at least as important as Tel Aviv. At the same time the new government was trying to disperse the nation's population to the periphery, discouraging settlement in the already populated Gush Dan. This slowed the growth of the Gush Dan, but the area still more than doubled in population within 20 years of the establishment of the state. The opening of the Port of Ashdod in the southern Gush Dan also increased the area's importance, with Haifa's importance diminishing, and Tel Aviv's increasing due to its proximity to the Port of Ashdod. Tel Aviv itself witnessed population decreases in the 1970s, and 80s with outer regions of the Gush Dan with lower costs of living absorbing many people who left Tel Aviv. Only in the 1990s with the immigration of more than 1 million Jews from former Soviet Republics, 40,000 [[Ethiopian Jews]], and many others to Israel, as well as a boom in the religious population, did Tel Aviv begin to grow again. The demand for housing increased dramatically, with new cities such as [[Modiin]], [[El'ad]] being built, and cities like [[Ashdod]] more than doubling in population, from 83,000 in 1990, to 175,000 in 2000. In the 2000s the area continued to grow, attracting many immigrants from the [[Haifa metropolitan area]]. In 2010 the Gush Dan is home to 3,200,000 people and is the commercial, economical, cultural, and industrial center of [[Israel]]. Despite some successes in ongoing attempts by the Israeli government to encourage migration to the [[Galilee]] and the [[Negev]], the Gush Dan retains its position as the heart of the State of Israel.\n\n==Economy==\nThe Gush Dan is the economic center of the state of Israel.
