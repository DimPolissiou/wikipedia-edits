Derived from the [[G-2 Galeb]] advanced jet trainer and light attack aircraft, it was designed in single-seat ground-attack and two-seat advanced flying / weapon training versions.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe J-21 Jastreb was developed as a replacement for the [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet]], which had been the most commonly used turbojet fighter-bomber aircraft of the Yugoslav Air Force until 1967. On the basis of the G-2 Galeb, the J-21 Jastreb was developed as a single seat ground attack variant, flying for the first time on 19 July 1965.\n\nPilots sit on licence-built [[Folland Aircraft|Folland]] Type 1-B ejection seats under individual canopies hinged on the starboard side in un-pressurised cockpits. Instruments and controls are entirely conventional with manually operated flying controls and standard flight instruments.\n\nPowered by a single BWB licence-built [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper|Rolls-Royce Viper Mk531]] the Jastreb has a conventional Aluminium Alloy stressed skin structure with few or no special features. The relatively thick aerofoil section, though limiting performance, provides room for fuel cells and the retracted main undercarriage which retracts inwards, giving the Jastreb a wide track and imbuing it with excellent ground handling characteristics. The levered undercarriage legs and relatively low pressure tyres allow the Jastreb to operate from un-prepared strips or rough surfaced airfields.\n\nCompared to the Galeb, the Jastreb has a strengthened structure, allowing more weapons to be carried, including three {{convert|0.5|in|mm|abbr=on|1|order=flip}} [[M2 Browning|Browning AN/M3]] machine guns with 135 rpg, mounted in the nose of the aircraft. As well as the nose-mounted guns, the Jastreb is able to carry up to {{convert|800|kg|lb|abbr=on}} on under-wing pylons, two inner pylons having a capacity of {{convert|250|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for bombs, rocket launchers and additional tanks, while the six outer pylons can carry [[VRZ-157]] {{convert|127|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} rockets.\n\n==Operational history==\nThe J-21 entered service with the JRV (Yugoslavian Air Force) on 31 December 1968, with very few, if any, remaining in service.\n\n===First Congo War===\n{{Further|First Congo War}}\n[[File:Zaire Jastreb.svg|thumb|left|A Zairean Air Force Jastreb which was flown by Serbian mercenaries, sporting the camouflage of new-defunct [[Air Force of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Air Force]], without any insignia to avoid confusion.]]\nAccording to some reports, [[France]] and Yugoslavia supported [[Mobutu]]'s government during the First Congo War.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Namely, Yugoslavia agreed to deliver three J-21 and a single [[Soko G-2 Galeb|G-2]] aircraft, as well as four [[MiG-21]]PFMs, while three [[Mi-24]]s were purchased from [[Ukraine]].

The USAF claimed 4 J-21s as being shot down by F-16s, while the Serbs claimed 5 Jastrebs as lost. The discrepancy likely stems from a damaged Jastreb crashing near the airfield after the F-16s had departed.\n\nOn November 15, during the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels, at 9:28&nbsp;a.m. three Yugoslav Air Force J-21 Jastrebs flew low over Bra\u010d and \u0160olta; minutes later, two were reportedly shot down by anti-aircraft artillery.

Set in 1941, the story tells that due to her mannerisms and dark skin, she is consistently regarded as \"ugly\". As a result, she develops an [[inferiority complex]], which fuels her desire for the blue eyes she equates with [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|\"whiteness\".]]\n\nThe point of view of the novel switches between various perspectives of Claudia MacTeer, the daughter of Pecola's foster parents, at different stages in her life. In addition, there is an omniscient [[narrative mode#Third-person view|third-person]] narrative which includes inset narratives in the first person.\n\nIts controversial topics of racism, [[incest]], and [[Child sexual abuse|child molestation]] have led to numerous attempts to [[Book censorship|ban the novel]] from schools and libraries.<ref>{{cite journal|author=TIME Staff|date=October 2, 2007|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2007/10/02/top-10-book-controversies/slide/the-bluest-eye-by-toni-morrison/|title=Top 10 Book Controversies, The Bluest Eye|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn [[Lorain, Ohio]], nine-year-old Claudia MacTeer and her 10-year-old sister Frieda live with their parents, a tenant named Mr. Henry, and Pecola Breedlove, a temporary [[foster child]] whose house was burned down by her unstable, alcoholic, and sexually abusive father. Pecola is a quiet, passive young girl who grows up with little money and whose parents are constantly fighting, both verbally and physically. Pecola is continually reminded of what an \"ugly\" girl she is by members of her neighborhood and school community. In an attempt to beautify herself, Pecola wishes for blue eyes. Additionally, most chapters' titles are extracts from the ''[[Dick and Jane]]'' paragraph in the novel's prologue, presenting a white family that may be contrasted with Pecola's. The chapter titles contain sudden repetition of words or phrases, many cut-off words, and no [[Word divider|interword separation]]s.\n\nThe novel, through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, explores the younger years of both of Pecola's parents, Cholly and Pauline, and their struggles as African Americans in a largely [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] community. Pauline now works as a servant for a wealthier white family. One day in the novel's present time, while Pecola is doing dishes, drunk Cholly rapes her. His motives are largely confusing, seemingly a combination of both love and hate. After raping her a second time, he flees, leaving her pregnant.\n\nClaudia and Frieda are the only two in the community that hope for Pecola's child to survive in the coming months. Consequently, they give up the money they had been saving to buy a bicycle, instead planting marigold seeds with the superstitious belief that if the flowers bloom, Pecola's baby will survive. The marigolds never bloom, and Pecola's child, who is born prematurely, dies. In the aftermath, a dialogue is presented between two sides of Pecola's own deluded imagination, in which she indicates conflicting feelings about her rape by her father. In this internal conversation, Pecola speaks as though her wish for blue eyes has been granted, and believes that the changed behavior of those around her is due to her new eyes, rather than the news of her rape or her increasingly strange behavior.\n\nClaudia, as narrator a final time, describes the recent phenomenon of Pecola's insanity and suggests that Cholly (who has since died) may have shown Pecola the only love he could by raping her. Claudia laments on her belief that the whole community, herself included, have used Pecola as a scapegoat to make themselves feel prettier and happier.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Pecola Breedlove''':  Her insanity at the end of the novel is her only way to escape the world where she cannot be beautiful and to get the blue eyes she desires from the beginning of the novel.  \n* '''Claudia MacTeer''': Narrates the majority of the novel and is also a young black girl. She is the child of Pecola's foster parents and is Frieda's sister. She is not only Pecola's fostering sister but she is also considered to be her friend. She is an independent, mature and passionate nine-year-old. Despite her relative naivete, she is one of few, if any, characters that feel sympathy for Pecola. Claudia is the polar opposite of Pecola. In the first chapter she destroys her white dolls out of hatred of white people. By contrast, Pecola consistently acts on her desire to achieve white beauty standards. Claudia is raised in a stable home, always assured of her self-worth and surrounded by a strong network of family.\n* '''Frieda MacTeer''': Claudia's 10-year-old sister. Frieda is more enlightened to the world in comparison to her younger sister and Pecola. Frieda is courageous and unwavering. She is seen to defend both Claudia and Pecola within the novel. Frieda can be classified as determined, independent and stubborn at times.\n* '''Cholly Breedlove''': Cholly is Pecola's father. Abusive and an alcoholic, Cholly's violent and aggressive behavior reflects his troublesome upbringing. In addition to being rejected by his father and discarded by his mother as a four-day-old baby, Cholly's first sexual encounter is ruined when it is interrupted by two white men, who force Cholly to continue while they watch and sneer. Traumatic events like these influence Cholly to become a violent husband and father who beats his wife and eventually rapes his daughter. These gestures of madness are said to be mingled with affection, as they are his way of showing love. \n* '''Pauline \"Polly\" Breedlove''': Pecola's mother, Mrs. Breedlove is married to Cholly and lives the self-righteous life of a [[martyr]], enduring her drunk husband and raising her two awkward children as best as she can. Mrs. Breedlove is a bit of an outcast herself with her shriveled foot and Southern background. She lives the life of a lonely and isolated character who escapes into a world of dreams, hopes and fantasy that turns into the movies she enjoys viewing. After a traumatic event with a foul tooth, however, she relinquishes those dreams and escapes into her life as a housekeeper for a rich white family who give her the beloved nickname \"Polly.\"\n* '''Sam Breedlove''': Pecola's older brother. Sammy, as he is more often referred to in the novel, is Cholly and Mrs. Breedlove's only son. Sam's part in this novel is minimal. Like his sister Pecola, he is affected by the disharmony in their home and deals with his anger by running away.\n* '''Auntie Jimmy''': Cholly's great aunt, who takes him in to raise after his parents abandon him. She is friends with a Miss Alice and is briefly ill, tended to by the medicine woman whom the locals call \"M'Dear.\" Aunt Jimmy dies suddenly when Cholly is still a young boy during a meal of peach cobbler that was made by a friend, Esse Foster.\n* '''Samson Fuller''': Cholly Breedlove's father who abandoned Cholly before he was born. After Aunt Jimmy dies, Cholly runs off in search of Samson in Macon, Georgia where he is left distraught and disappointed with his discovery.\n* '''The Fishers''': The rich, white couple who employ Pauline as their servant and as the caretaker of their young daughter.\n* '''Geraldine''': A socially conscious upperclass black woman in the community who exaggerates the fact that she is above traditional black stereotypes and is more \"civilized\" than other black families in Lorain, Ohio. When she feels that her husband isn't fulfilling her need for love, she finds a cat and pours her affections into it. Her lack of attention to anything but the cat causes unintended hatred for the cat from her son, whom she neglects often.\n* '''Louis Junior''': Geraldine's son, who bullies Pecola and blames her for accidentally killing his mother's beloved cat.\n* '''Maginot Line (Marie)''': A prostitute who lives with two other prostitutes named China and Poland in an apartment above the one Pecola lives in. These ladies are ostracized by society, but teach Pecola a lot about being a social outcast, and offer her the support that few others do.\n* '''Rosemary Villanucci''': The MacTeers' next-door neighbor who constantly tries to get Claudia and Frieda in trouble.\n* '''Mr. Yacobowski''': The discriminatory white immigrant, owner of the grocery store where Pecola goes to buy [[Mary Jane (candy)|Mary Janes]].\n* '''Maureen Peal''': A light-skinned, green-eyed [[mulatto|half-blood]] African-American girl Pecola's age who is described in the book as a \"high yellow dream child\" with long brown hair and green eyes. Maureen considers herself to be above dark-skinned African-American people. Frieda and Claudia mock Maureen, calling her \"Meringue Pie\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Lewis|title=Existence in Black: An Anthology of Black Existential Philosophy|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=120}}</ref>\n* '''Soaphead Church''': Born Elihue Micah Whitcomb, he received his nickname, \"Soaphead Church\", for his hair and profession, and has proclaimed himself to be \"Reader, Adviser, and Interpreter of Dreams.\" He is a \"light-skinned\" West Indian failed preacher who hates all kinds of human touch. He considers himself to be a \"[[misanthrope]]\". He refuses to confront his own homosexuality and therefore, the touch of little girls whom he views as innocent and \"seductive\" are the cleanest form of human touch that he pursues. He is also a religious hypocrite as a past preacher. Although someone who hates humans, he as a \"Reader, Adviser, and Interpreter of Dreams\" takes on the trouble of others, and works closely with them to help solve their problems. When Pecola approaches him asking for blue eyes, he tells her to give meat to his landlord's dog, and that her wish will be granted if the dog has a reaction.

[She] was deeply concerned about the feelings of ugliness.\"<ref name=\":16\" /> As seen throughout ''The Bluest Eye'', this idea of \"ugliness\" is conveyed through a variety of characters. For example, Pecola, the main character, wishes for blue eyes as a way to escape the oppression that results from her having dark skin. Through Pecola's characterization, Morrison seeks to demonstrate the negative impact racism can have on one's self-confidence and worth. As she concluded in her interview, she \"wanted people to understand what it was like to be treated that way.\"<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nMorrison commented on her motivations to write the novel, saying, \"I felt compelled to write this mostly because in the 1960s, black male authors published powerful, aggressive, revolutionary fiction or nonfiction, and they had positive racially uplifting rhetoric with them that were stimulating and I thought they would skip over something and thought no one would remember that it wasn't always beautiful.\"<ref name=\"YouTube\">{{cite video|title=Toni Morrison Talks About Her Motivation For Writing|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8Zgu2hrs2k|work=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n== Analysis ==\n=== Black girlhood ===\n\nMorrison's writing of the book began because she was \"interested in talking about black girlhood.\"<ref name=\":29\">{{cite book|title=Toni Morrison's fiction|last=Jan.|first=Furman|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=1996|isbn=9781611173673|edition= Revised and expanded |location=Columbia, South Carolina|pages=12\u201333|oclc=880959117}}</ref> Dr. Jan Furman, professor of English at the [[University of Michigan]], notes that the book allows the reader to analyze the \"imprinting\"<ref name=\":29\" /> factors that shape the identity of the self during the process of maturing in young black girls. She references parts in the book where the main characters are taught to feel less than human, specifically when the shopkeeper avoids touching Pecola's hand when giving her candy.\n\nSusmita Roye, an associate professor of English at [[Delaware State University]], notes that the novel emphasizes that living in a world defined by Euro-centric beauty standards creates a longing for whiteness, such as Pecola's desire for blue eyes, which attacks young black girls' confidence and perceived beauty.<ref>Roye, Susmita. \"TONI MORRISON'S DISRUPTED GIRLS AND THEIR DISTURBED GIRLHOODS: The Bluest Eye and A Mercy.\" ''Callaloo'' 35.1 (2012): 227, 309.

Web.</ref> References to [[Shirley Temple]] and Dick and Jane serve similarly.\n\n=== White lifestyle standards ===\nDick and Jane novels were popular in the mid-20th century, and Morrison includes references to their titles in ''The Bluest Eye''. They promoted the importance of the nuclear family and helped to foster literacy in young children as well. Morrison presents a more critical view of the novel's family standards. Morrison's graphic storytelling within ''The Bluest Eye'' challenged existing attitudes about keeping children's literature free of sex and violence. The lifestyle standards found in Dick and Jane were not achievable for many children who shared backgrounds similar to Pecola.\n\nDebra Werrlein, professor at [[George Mason University]], contends that the excerpts of \"Dick and Jane\" throughout the book project an image of an ideal family that contrasts with the family structures of the main characters.<ref name=\":30\">Werrlein, Debra T. \"Not so Fast, Dick and Jane: Reimagining Childhood and Nation in the Bluest Eye.\" ''MELUS'' 30.4 (2005): 72, 194. ''ProQuest Central, Research Library.'' Web.</ref> She argues that because the novel takes place in a time of post-[[World War II]] social sentiments, the \"Dick and Jane\" primer emphasizes an importance of raising children a certain way to mold the future of the United States. However, as Werrlein points out, the whiteness of these characters stood to represent the ideal American family. In addition, the string of letters describing Dick and Jane's perfect parents as strong and kind are used to contrast Pecola's parents in the novel. Pecola's father is thus emasculated, Werrlein argues, because his behavior deviates from this standard for American family life.<ref name=\":30\" /> Finally, Werrlein claims that the black parents have experienced oppression throughout their lives, and that same oppression has negatively influenced their familial structure. Thus, racism is a prevalent factor in their broken homes.\n\n=== Internalized racism ===\nIn the article \"Racism and Appearance in The Bluest Eye: A Template for an Ethical Emotive Criticism\",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bump|first=Jerome|date=2010|title=Racism and Appearance in The Bluest Eye: A Template for an Ethical Emotive Criticism|journal=College Literature|volume=37|issue=2|pages=147\u2013170|jstor=20749587|doi=10.1353/lit.0.0108|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e56b806b2e2687f9494f320b8e6139818e9ce6c0}}</ref> Jerome Bump explains how the novel suggests that physical beauty is a virtue embedded in society.

This belief compromises people's judgement and they act upon internal bias.<ref name=\":20\" /> These biases are displayed throughout the novel, especially through the mistreatment of Pecola by family, friends and community.\n\nLiterary critic Lynn Scott argues that the constant images of whiteness in ''The Bluest Eye'' serve to represent society's perception of beauty, which ultimately proves to have destructive consequences for many of the characters in the novel.<ref name=\":62\">{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Lynn|year=1996|title=Beauty, Virtue and Disciplinary Power: A Foucauldian Reading of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=MultiTab&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CH1100049815&docType=Critical+essay&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=LitRC&contentSet=GALE%7CH1100049815&searchId=R2&userGroupName=wash43584&inPS=true|journal=Midwestern Miscellany|volume=24|pages=9\u201323|via=Literature Resource Center}}</ref> Scott explains that in the novel, superiority, power, and virtue are associated with beauty, which is inherent in whiteness.<ref name=\":62\" /> She further asserts that white beauty standards are perpetuated by visual images in the media as well as the attitude of Pecola's family.<ref name=\":62\" /> When Pauline first arrives in Lorain, she feels pressure to conform and begins to develop a construct of femininity based on the actresses such as [[Jean Harlow]].<ref name=\":31\">{{cite book|title=The Bluest Eye|last=Morrison|first=Toni|publisher=Vintage International|year=2007|isbn=978-0-375-41155-7|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/bluesteye00morr_1}}</ref> Pecola is also surrounded by constant images that perpetuate white beauty standards, including references to [[Shirley Temple]] and an image of [[Mary Jane (candy)|Mary Jane]] that appears on her candy wrappers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Scott believes that Pecola attempts to seek the power associated with whiteness, and in her attempt to conform, she develops a destructive desire for blue eyes.<ref name=\":62\" />\n\nHarihar Kulkarni, an author of a book on African-American feminist fiction literature, recognizes that these Euro-centric ideals of family and beauty present in ''The Bluest Eye'' are shown to be transferred generationally, often between female relationships.<ref name=\":122\">{{cite journal|last=Kulkarni|first=Harihar|year=1993|title=Mirrors, Reflections, and Images: Malady of Generational Relationship and Girlhood in Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=MultiTab&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CH1100049811&docType=Critical+essay&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=LitRC&contentSet=GALE%7CH1100049811&searchId=R1&userGroupName=wash43584&inPS=true&authCount=1|journal=Indian Journal of American Studies|volume=23|issue=2|pages=1\u20136}}</ref> In addition to living in a white-dominant society, this intergenerational oppression manifests itself into shame and self-hatred as demonstrated through Pecola's character development.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nCritic Allen Alexander argues that religion is an important theme in ''The Bluest Eye'', since Morrison's work possesses a \"fourth face\" outside of the Christian [[Trinity]], which represents \"the existence of evil, the suffering of the innocent.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Allen|date=1998|title=The Fourth Face: The Image of God in Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye|journal=African American Review|volume=32|issue=2|pages=293\u2013303|doi=10.2307/3042126|jstor=3042126}}</ref> Alexander claims Pecola's suffering stems from her attempts to rationalize her misfortune with the notion of an omnipotent God. He further argues that much of Pecola's story suggests the insufficiency of Christian beliefs for minorities who exist in a predominantly white society.<ref name=\":2\" /> This ideology damages Pecola and her mother, Pauline, who fully accepts Christianity and spends her time caring for a white family as opposed to her own.

Kochar argues that to comprehend the complex violence inflicted on Pecola, one must analyze the novel through the Marxist and Feminist lens in addition to the psychoanalytical lens.<ref name=\":23\" />\nJ. Brooks Bouson, English professor at [[Loyola University Chicago]], claims that ''The Bluest Eye'' is a \"shame drama and trauma narrative,\" that uses Pecola and its other characters to examine how people respond to shame.<ref name=\":17\">Bouson, J.

However, most characters in the novel pass on their shame to someone below them on the social and racial ladder.<ref name=\":17\" /> For example, Soaphead Church comes from a family obsessed with lightening their skin tone, and passes on the shame of his African-American heritage by molesting young girls. Bouson suggests that all of the African-American characters in ''The Bluest Eye'' exhibit shame, and eventually much of this shame is passed onto Pecola, who is at the bottom of the racial and social ladder.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Breakage and separation ===\n\nIn the article \"Probing Racial Dilemmas in the Bluest Eye with the Spyglass of Psychology\", Anna Zebialowicz and Marek Palasinski discuss the racial climate of the society set forth in the novel.<ref name=\":24\">Zebialowicz, Anna, and Marek Palasinski. \"Probing Racial Dilemmas in 'the Bluest Eye' with the Spyglass of Psychology.\" ''Journal of African American Studies'', vol. 14, no. 2, 2010, pp. 220\u2013233.

Morrison's novel confronts self-hatred and destructive behaviors black women participate in to fit into the hegemonic image of beauty and whiteness.<ref name=\":24\" />\n\nAuthor Phillip Page focuses on the importance of duality in ''The Bluest Eye''. He claims that Morrison presents an \"inverted world,\" entirely opposite from the Dick and Jane story that is at the beginning of the novel.<ref name=\":52\">{{cite journal|last=Page|first=Phillip|year=1995|title=The Break Was a Bad One: The Split World of The Bluest Eye|url=|journal=Children's Literature Review|volume=190|pages=37\u201359|via=Literature Resource Center}}</ref> The idea of breaks and splitting is common, as seen in the context of the war occurring in the time period of the story, the split nature of Pecola's family, and the watermelon that Cholly observes break open during a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].<ref name=\":52\" /> Page argues that breaks symbolize the challenges of African-American life, as seen in the rip in the Breedloves' couch that symbolizes poverty, or the break in Pauline's tooth that ruins her marriage and family. He goes on to identify how each of the characters are broken personally, since Cholly's former and present life is described as chaotic and jumbled, and Pauline both is responsible for her biological family as well as the white family she works for. The epitome of this, Page argues, is seen in Pecola at the end of the novel. The events of her life, having broken parents in a broken family, have resulted in a totally fractured personality which drives Pecola into madness.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\n== Genre/Style ==\n{{essay-like|section|date=October 2019}}\nToni Morrison's work ''The Bluest Eye'' breaks the long tradition of narratives that discuss the hardships of war and depression in the 1940s, as she brings forth a unique and untold point of view in American historical fiction.<ref name=\":18\" /> Morrison purposefully writes stories that defy the \u201cAmerican mainstream ideology\u201d by focusing in on the realities of African-American life at the time.<ref name=\":18\" /> Thus, ''The Bluest Eye'' serves as a counter narrative, a method of the telling the accounts of people whose stories are rarely told and deliberately hidden.<ref name=\":20\">{{cite journal|last=Khayati|first=Abdellatif|date=1999|title=Representation, Race, and the \"Language\" of the Ineffable in Toni Morrison's Narrative|journal=African American Review|volume=33|issue=2|pages=313\u2013324|doi=10.2307/2901281|issn=1062-4783|jstor=2901281}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hughes-Hassell|first=Sandra|date=July 2013|title=Multicultural Young Adult Literature as a Form of Counter-Storytelling|journal=The Library Quarterly|volume=83|issue=3|pages=212\u2013228|doi=10.1086/670696|issn=0024-2519}}</ref> As Morrison once stated, \u201cmy job becomes how to rip that veil drawn over proceedings too terrible to relate.

[[University of Oxford]] professor Tessa Roynon, who studies African-American literature, states that \u201cthe racial theories of [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], and others, derived from innovations in classificatory systems by scientists such as [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], have been collected in useful readers such as [[Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze]]'s anthology Race and the Enlightenment (1997). The well-read, race-obsessed Soaphead Church in The Bluest Eye is the inevitable product of these theories.\"<ref name=\":18\" /> These perpetual racist beliefs shape Pecola's self destructiveness, she is suspicious of even her own blackness, and desires the characteristics of a white person, like those in the Dick and Jane primers.<ref name=\":20\" /> As Abdellatif Khayati, professor at the Moroccan Cultural Studies Center, articulates, ''The Bluest Eye'' shows how the historic white narrative creates an \u201cepistemic violence of the Other [which] operates through the internalization of the self-as-other. Pecola exists only in the image reflected by the Other.\u201d<ref name=\":20\" />  Just as Pecola's rape is concealed throughout the story, the novel exposes a history of failed pursuits of hiding the racist and sexist establishments that directly provoke each character's hardships.<ref name=\":23\" />\n\nWhile Morrison is a notable female writer, she is quick to deny her works being categorized as \u201cfeminist,\u201d as she believes the title denies the specific necessities of black women.<ref name=\":18\" /> Rather than depict strong female protagonists, Morrison creates characters who are actually defeated by the racism and sexism of the historic time period.<ref name=\":32\" /> Anne Salvatore, a professor of English at Rider University, interprets this failure of the \u201c[[antihero|anti heroine]]\u201d as a stark contrast to the typical bildungsroman, where a male character defeats obstacles and grows from experience.<ref name=\":32\" /> Instead, in ''The Bluest Eye,'' Pecola fails to develop an individual identity in the face of an oppressive society, and her self-hatred forces her to retreat from reality completely.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nThe point of views in the novel are also significant to its unique style. Morrison combines many narratives: two perspectives of Claudia at different times in her life, as well as an omniscient third person who connects the many tragedies of the characters.<ref name=\":18\" /> By the end of the novel, the jumbled words of the Dick and Jane primer, as well as the increasingly confusing narratives, hint at Pecola's descent into madness.<ref name=\":18\" /> This breakdown in the novel's structure also represents a destruction of the harmful ideologies which Morrison's stories seeks to debase.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\n== Reception ==\nThe novel received minimal critical attention when first published; however, it was placed on many university reading lists in black-studies departments, which promoted further recognition.<ref name=\":18\" /> Morrison was praised for her handling of difficult themes: critic Haskel Frankel said, \"Given a scene that demands a writer's best, Morrison responds with control and talent.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amerlit.com/novels/ANALYSIS%20Morrison,%20Toni%20The%20Bluest%20Eye%20(1970)%20analysis%20by%2025%20critics.pdf|title=ANALYSIS: The Bluest Eye|access-date=2016-11-28}}</ref> The first major sign that the book would succeed was an extremely positive review in ''The New York Times'' in November 1970.<ref name=\":0\" /> Morrison was also positively reviewed for her break from the status quo of usual novels from the time period, writing to a wider audience and focusing on black subculture in the 1940s, rather than the military culture of the time. African-American critic [[Ruby Dee]] wrote, \"Toni Morrison has not written a story really, but a series of painfully accurate impressions.\"<ref name=\":1\">Staggers, Leroy, \"The critical reception of Toni Morrison: 1970 to 1988\" (1989).

A common critique of her writing included her language in the novel, as it was often viewed as being made too simple for the reader.<ref name=\":1\" /> Early critics were also ambivalent about Morrison's portrayal of the black woman as an object in society rather than a person, only ever going so far as to bring this fact to light and rarely commenting past it.<ref name=\":1\" /> The most in-depth analysis of the novel began with feminist critique.<ref name=\":0\" /> There were also notable differences between African-American critics (who often identified more with the characters of the novel) and Euro-American critics (who often only focused on the actual writing of the novel).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWithin classrooms across the country, educators also disagreed over whether or not the novel was appropriate for children. One African-American educator, founder of the IFE Academy of Teaching & Technology Shekema Silveri, has stated: \"Teaching novels like ''The Bluest Eye'' helps us break down barriers with students.

Additionally, most chapters' titles are extracts from the ''[[Dick and Jane]]'' paragraph in the novel's prologue, presenting a white family that may be contrasted with Pecola's. The chapter titles contain sudden repetition of words or phrases, many cut-off words, and no [[Word divider|interword separation]]s.\n\nThe novel, through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, explores the younger years of both of Pecola's parents, Cholly and Pauline, and their struggles as African Americans in a largely [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] community. Pauline now works as a servant for a wealthier white family. One day in the novel's present time, while Pecola is doing dishes, drunk Cholly rapes her. His motives are largely confusing, seemingly a combination of both love and hate. After raping her a second time, he flees, leaving her pregnant.\n\nClaudia and Frieda are the only two in the community that hope for Pecola's child to survive in the coming months. Consequently, they give up the money they had been saving to buy a bicycle, instead planting marigold seeds with the superstitious belief that if the flowers bloom, Pecola's baby will survive. The marigolds never bloom, and Pecola's child, who is born prematurely, dies. In the aftermath, a dialogue is presented between two sides of Pecola's own deluded imagination, in which she indicates conflicting feelings about her rape by her father. In this internal conversation, Pecola speaks as though her wish for blue eyes has been granted, and believes that the changed behavior of those around her is due to her new eyes, rather than the news of her rape or her increasingly strange behavior.\n\nClaudia, as narrator a final time, describes the recent phenomenon of Pecola's insanity and suggests that Cholly (who has since died) may have shown Pecola the only love he could by raping her. Claudia laments on her belief that the whole community, herself included, have used Pecola as a scapegoat to make themselves feel prettier and happier.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Pecola Breedlove''':  Her insanity at the end of the novel is her only way to escape the world where she cannot be beautiful and to get the blue eyes she desires from the beginning of the novel.  \n* '''Claudia MacTeer''': Narrates the majority of the novel and is also a young black girl. She is the child of Pecola's foster parents and is Frieda's sister. She is not only Pecola's fostering sister but she is also considered to be her friend. She is an independent, mature and passionate nine-year-old. Despite her relative naivete, she is one of few, if any, characters that feel sympathy for Pecola. Claudia is the polar opposite of Pecola. In the first chapter she destroys her white dolls out of hatred of white people. By contrast, Pecola consistently acts on her desire to achieve white beauty standards. Claudia is raised in a stable home, always assured of her self-worth and surrounded by a strong network of family.\n* '''Frieda MacTeer''': Claudia's 10-year-old sister. Frieda is more enlightened to the world in comparison to her younger sister and Pecola. Frieda is courageous and unwavering. She is seen to defend both Claudia and Pecola within the novel. Frieda can be classified as determined, independent and stubborn at times.\n* '''Cholly Breedlove''': Cholly is Pecola's father. Abusive and an alcoholic, Cholly's violent and aggressive behavior reflects his troublesome upbringing. In addition to being rejected by his father and discarded by his mother as a four-day-old baby, Cholly's first sexual encounter is ruined when it is interrupted by two white men, who force Cholly to continue while they watch and sneer. Traumatic events like these influence Cholly to become a violent husband and father who beats his wife and eventually rapes his daughter. These gestures of madness are said to be mingled with affection, as they are his way of showing love. \n* '''Pauline \"Polly\" Breedlove''': Pecola's mother, Mrs. Breedlove is married to Cholly and lives the self-righteous life of a [[martyr]], enduring her drunk husband and raising her two awkward children as best as she can. Mrs. Breedlove is a bit of an outcast herself with her shriveled foot and Southern background. She lives the life of a lonely and isolated character who escapes into a world of dreams, hopes and fantasy that turns into the movies she enjoys viewing. After a traumatic event with a foul tooth, however, she relinquishes those dreams and escapes into her life as a housekeeper for a rich white family who give her the beloved nickname \"Polly.\"\n* '''Sam Breedlove''': Pecola's older brother. Sammy, as he is more often referred to in the novel, is Cholly and Mrs. Breedlove's only son. Sam's part in this novel is minimal. Like his sister Pecola, he is affected by the disharmony in their home and deals with his anger by running away.\n* '''Auntie Jimmy''': Cholly's great aunt, who takes him in to raise after his parents abandon him. She is friends with a Miss Alice and is briefly ill, tended to by the medicine woman whom the locals call \"M'Dear.\" Aunt Jimmy dies suddenly when Cholly is still a young boy during a meal of peach cobbler that was made by a friend, Esse Foster.\n* '''Samson Fuller''': Cholly Breedlove's father who abandoned Cholly before he was born. After Aunt Jimmy dies, Cholly runs off in search of Samson in Macon, Georgia where he is left distraught and disappointed with his discovery.\n* '''The Fishers''': The rich, white couple who employ Pauline as their servant and as the caretaker of their young daughter.\n* '''Geraldine''': A socially conscious upperclass black woman in the community who exaggerates the fact that she is above traditional black stereotypes and is more \"civilized\" than other black families in Lorain, Ohio. When she feels that her husband isn't fulfilling her need for love, she finds a cat and pours her affections into it. Her lack of attention to anything but the cat causes unintended hatred for the cat from her son, whom she neglects often.\n* '''Louis Junior''': Geraldine's son, who bullies Pecola and blames her for accidentally killing his mother's beloved cat.\n* '''Maginot Line (Marie)''': A prostitute who lives with two other prostitutes named China and Poland in an apartment above the one Pecola lives in. These ladies are ostracized by society, but teach Pecola a lot about being a social outcast, and offer her the support that few others do.\n* '''Rosemary Villanucci''': The MacTeers' next-door neighbor who constantly tries to get Claudia and Frieda in trouble.\n* '''Mr. Yacobowski''': The discriminatory white immigrant, owner of the grocery store where Pecola goes to buy [[Mary Jane (candy)|Mary Janes]].\n* '''Maureen Peal''': A light-skinned, green-eyed [[mulatto|half-blood]] African-American girl Pecola's age who is described in the book as a \"high yellow dream child\" with long brown hair and green eyes. Maureen considers herself to be above dark-skinned African-American people. Frieda and Claudia mock Maureen, calling her \"Meringue Pie\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Lewis|title=Existence in Black: An Anthology of Black Existential Philosophy|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=120}}</ref>\n* '''Soaphead Church''': Born Elihue Micah Whitcomb, he received his nickname, \"Soaphead Church\", for his hair and profession, and has proclaimed himself to be \"Reader, Adviser, and Interpreter of Dreams.\" He is a \"light-skinned\" West Indian failed preacher who hates all kinds of human touch. He considers himself to be a \"[[misanthrope]]\". He refuses to confront his own homosexuality and therefore, the touch of little girls whom he views as innocent and \"seductive\" are the cleanest form of human touch that he pursues. He is also a religious hypocrite as a past preacher. Although someone who hates humans, he as a \"Reader, Adviser, and Interpreter of Dreams\" takes on the trouble of others, and works closely with them to help solve their problems. When Pecola approaches him asking for blue eyes, he tells her to give meat to his landlord's dog, and that her wish will be granted if the dog has a reaction. However, he secretly poisons the meat, and the dog dies, contributing to Pecola's delusions that she has blue eyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bluesteye/characters.html|title=SparkNotes: The Bluest Eye: Character List|website=www.sparknotes.com|access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==Author's intentions==\nWhen asked about her motivations for writing ''The Bluest Eye'' in an interview, Morrison claimed that she wanted to remind readers \"how hurtful racism is\" and that people are \"apologetic about the fact that their skin [is] so dark.\"<ref name=\":16\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8Zgu2hrs2k&list=PLCwE4GdJdVRK12Fft8rw0wXQXxMqUJBsH|title=Toni Morrison Talks About Her Motivation For Writing|last=Morrison|first=Toni|date=2008|website=Youtube|publisher=National Visionary Leadership Project}}</ref> Reminiscing about her own experience, she recalled: \"When I was a kid, we called each other names but we didn't think it was serious, that you could take it in.\"<ref name=\":16\" /> Expanding on this point of self-esteem, Morrison elaborated that she \"wanted to speak on behalf of those who didn't catch that [they were beautiful] right away. [She] was deeply concerned about the feelings of ugliness.\"<ref name=\":16\" /> As seen throughout ''The Bluest Eye'', this idea of \"ugliness\" is conveyed through a variety of characters. For example, Pecola, the main character, wishes for blue eyes as a way to escape the oppression that results from her having dark skin. Through Pecola's characterization, Morrison seeks to demonstrate the negative impact racism can have on one's self-confidence and worth. As she concluded in her interview, she \"wanted people to understand what it was like to be treated that way.\"<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nMorrison commented on her motivations to write the novel, saying, \"I felt compelled to write this mostly because in the 1960s, black male authors published powerful, aggressive, revolutionary fiction or nonfiction, and they had positive racially uplifting rhetoric with them that were stimulating and I thought they would skip over something and thought no one would remember that it wasn't always beautiful.\"<ref name=\"YouTube\">{{cite video|title=Toni Morrison Talks About Her Motivation For Writing|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8Zgu2hrs2k|work=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n== Analysis ==\n=== Black girlhood ===\n\nMorrison's writing of the book began because she was \"interested in talking about black girlhood.\"<ref name=\":29\">{{cite book|title=Toni Morrison's fiction|last=Jan.|first=Furman|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=1996|isbn=9781611173673|edition= Revised and expanded |location=Columbia, South Carolina|pages=12\u201333|oclc=880959117}}</ref> Dr. Jan Furman, professor of English at the [[University of Michigan]], notes that the book allows the reader to analyze the \"imprinting\"<ref name=\":29\" /> factors that shape the identity of the self during the process of maturing in young black girls. She references parts in the book where the main characters are taught to feel less than human, specifically when the shopkeeper avoids touching Pecola's hand when giving her candy.\n\nSusmita Roye, an associate professor of English at [[Delaware State University]], notes that the novel emphasizes that living in a world defined by Euro-centric beauty standards creates a longing for whiteness, such as Pecola's desire for blue eyes, which attacks young black girls' confidence and perceived beauty.<ref>Roye, Susmita. \"TONI MORRISON'S DISRUPTED GIRLS AND THEIR DISTURBED GIRLHOODS: The Bluest Eye and A Mercy.\" ''Callaloo'' 35.1 (2012): 227, 309.

Web.</ref> References to [[Shirley Temple]] and Dick and Jane serve similarly.\n\n=== White lifestyle standards ===\nDick and Jane novels were popular in the mid-20th century, and Morrison includes references to their titles in ''The Bluest Eye''. They promoted the importance of the nuclear family and helped to foster literacy in young children as well. Morrison presents a more critical view of the novel's family standards. Morrison's graphic storytelling within ''The Bluest Eye'' challenged existing attitudes about keeping children's literature free of sex and violence. The lifestyle standards found in Dick and Jane were not achievable for many children who shared backgrounds similar to Pecola.\n\nDebra Werrlein, professor at [[George Mason University]], contends that the excerpts of \"Dick and Jane\" throughout the book project an image of an ideal family that contrasts with the family structures of the main characters.<ref name=\":30\">Werrlein, Debra T. \"Not so Fast, Dick and Jane: Reimagining Childhood and Nation in the Bluest Eye.\" ''MELUS'' 30.4 (2005): 72, 194. ''ProQuest Central, Research Library.'' Web.</ref> She argues that because the novel takes place in a time of post-[[World War II]] social sentiments, the \"Dick and Jane\" primer emphasizes an importance of raising children a certain way to mold the future of the United States. However, as Werrlein points out, the whiteness of these characters stood to represent the ideal American family. In addition, the string of letters describing Dick and Jane's perfect parents as strong and kind are used to contrast Pecola's parents in the novel. Pecola's father is thus emasculated, Werrlein argues, because his behavior deviates from this standard for American family life.<ref name=\":30\" /> Finally, Werrlein claims that the black parents have experienced oppression throughout their lives, and that same oppression has negatively influenced their familial structure. Thus, racism is a prevalent factor in their broken homes.\n\n=== Internalized racism ===\nIn the article \"Racism and Appearance in The Bluest Eye: A Template for an Ethical Emotive Criticism\",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bump|first=Jerome|date=2010|title=Racism and Appearance in The Bluest Eye: A Template for an Ethical Emotive Criticism|journal=College Literature|volume=37|issue=2|pages=147\u2013170|jstor=20749587|doi=10.1353/lit.0.0108|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e56b806b2e2687f9494f320b8e6139818e9ce6c0}}</ref> Jerome Bump explains how the novel suggests that physical beauty is a virtue embedded in society. Bump asserts that the novel reveals the belief that the outside of people ultimately reflects their character and personality. This belief compromises people's judgement and they act upon internal bias.<ref name=\":20\" /> These biases are displayed throughout the novel, especially through the mistreatment of Pecola by family, friends and community.\n\nLiterary critic Lynn Scott argues that the constant images of whiteness in ''The Bluest Eye'' serve to represent society's perception of beauty, which ultimately proves to have destructive consequences for many of the characters in the novel.<ref name=\":62\">{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Lynn|year=1996|title=Beauty, Virtue and Disciplinary Power: A Foucauldian Reading of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=MultiTab&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CH1100049815&docType=Critical+essay&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=LitRC&contentSet=GALE%7CH1100049815&searchId=R2&userGroupName=wash43584&inPS=true|journal=Midwestern Miscellany|volume=24|pages=9\u201323|via=Literature Resource Center}}</ref> Scott explains that in the novel, superiority, power, and virtue are associated with beauty, which is inherent in whiteness.<ref name=\":62\" /> She further asserts that white beauty standards are perpetuated by visual images in the media as well as the attitude of Pecola's family.<ref name=\":62\" /> When Pauline first arrives in Lorain, she feels pressure to conform and begins to develop a construct of femininity based on the actresses such as [[Jean Harlow]].<ref name=\":31\">{{cite book|title=The Bluest Eye|last=Morrison|first=Toni|publisher=Vintage International|year=2007|isbn=978-0-375-41155-7|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/bluesteye00morr_1}}</ref> Pecola is also surrounded by constant images that perpetuate white beauty standards, including references to [[Shirley Temple]] and an image of [[Mary Jane (candy)|Mary Jane]] that appears on her candy wrappers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Scott believes that Pecola attempts to seek the power associated with whiteness, and in her attempt to conform, she develops a destructive desire for blue eyes.<ref name=\":62\" />\n\nHarihar Kulkarni, an author of a book on African-American feminist fiction literature, recognizes that these Euro-centric ideals of family and beauty present in ''The Bluest Eye'' are shown to be transferred generationally, often between female relationships.<ref name=\":122\">{{cite journal|last=Kulkarni|first=Harihar|year=1993|title=Mirrors, Reflections, and Images: Malady of Generational Relationship and Girlhood in Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=MultiTab&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CH1100049811&docType=Critical+essay&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=LitRC&contentSet=GALE%7CH1100049811&searchId=R1&userGroupName=wash43584&inPS=true&authCount=1|journal=Indian Journal of American Studies|volume=23|issue=2|pages=1\u20136}}</ref> In addition to living in a white-dominant society, this intergenerational oppression manifests itself into shame and self-hatred as demonstrated through Pecola's character development.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nCritic Allen Alexander argues that religion is an important theme in ''The Bluest Eye'', since Morrison's work possesses a \"fourth face\" outside of the Christian [[Trinity]], which represents \"the existence of evil, the suffering of the innocent.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Allen|date=1998|title=The Fourth Face: The Image of God in Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye|journal=African American Review|volume=32|issue=2|pages=293\u2013303|doi=10.2307/3042126|jstor=3042126}}</ref> Alexander claims Pecola's suffering stems from her attempts to rationalize her misfortune with the notion of an omnipotent God. He further argues that much of Pecola's story suggests the insufficiency of Christian beliefs for minorities who exist in a predominantly white society.<ref name=\":2\" /> This ideology damages Pecola and her mother, Pauline, who fully accepts Christianity and spends her time caring for a white family as opposed to her own.

However, most characters in the novel pass on their shame to someone below them on the social and racial ladder.<ref name=\":17\" /> For example, Soaphead Church comes from a family obsessed with lightening their skin tone, and passes on the shame of his African-American heritage by molesting young girls. Bouson suggests that all of the African-American characters in ''The Bluest Eye'' exhibit shame, and eventually much of this shame is passed onto Pecola, who is at the bottom of the racial and social ladder.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Breakage and separation ===\n\nIn the article \"Probing Racial Dilemmas in the Bluest Eye with the Spyglass of Psychology\", Anna Zebialowicz and Marek Palasinski discuss the racial climate of the society set forth in the novel.<ref name=\":24\">Zebialowicz, Anna, and Marek Palasinski. \"Probing Racial Dilemmas in 'the Bluest Eye' with the Spyglass of Psychology.\" ''Journal of African American Studies'', vol. 14, no. 2, 2010, pp. 220\u2013233.

Morrison's novel confronts self-hatred and destructive behaviors black women participate in to fit into the hegemonic image of beauty and whiteness.<ref name=\":24\" />\n\nAuthor Phillip Page focuses on the importance of duality in ''The Bluest Eye''. He claims that Morrison presents an \"inverted world,\" entirely opposite from the Dick and Jane story that is at the beginning of the novel.<ref name=\":52\">{{cite journal|last=Page|first=Phillip|year=1995|title=The Break Was a Bad One: The Split World of The Bluest Eye|url=|journal=Children's Literature Review|volume=190|pages=37\u201359|via=Literature Resource Center}}</ref> The idea of breaks and splitting is common, as seen in the context of the war occurring in the time period of the story, the split nature of Pecola's family, and the watermelon that Cholly observes break open during a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].<ref name=\":52\" /> Page argues that breaks symbolize the challenges of African-American life, as seen in the rip in the Breedloves' couch that symbolizes poverty, or the break in Pauline's tooth that ruins her marriage and family. He goes on to identify how each of the characters are broken personally, since Cholly's former and present life is described as chaotic and jumbled, and Pauline both is responsible for her biological family as well as the white family she works for. The epitome of this, Page argues, is seen in Pecola at the end of the novel.

[[University of Oxford]] professor Tessa Roynon, who studies African-American literature, states that \u201cthe racial theories of [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], and others, derived from innovations in classificatory systems by scientists such as [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], have been collected in useful readers such as [[Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze]]'s anthology Race and the Enlightenment (1997). The well-read, race-obsessed Soaphead Church in The Bluest Eye is the inevitable product of these theories.\"<ref name=\":18\" /> These perpetual racist beliefs shape Pecola's self destructiveness, she is suspicious of even her own blackness, and desires the characteristics of a white person, like those in the Dick and Jane primers.<ref name=\":20\" /> As Abdellatif Khayati, professor at the Moroccan Cultural Studies Center, articulates, ''The Bluest Eye'' shows how the historic white narrative creates an \u201cepistemic violence of the Other [which] operates through the internalization of the self-as-other. Pecola exists only in the image reflected by the Other.\u201d<ref name=\":20\" />  Just as Pecola's rape is concealed throughout the story, the novel exposes a history of failed pursuits of hiding the racist and sexist establishments that directly provoke each character's hardships.<ref name=\":23\" />\n\nWhile Morrison is a notable female writer, she is quick to deny her works being categorized as \u201cfeminist,\u201d as she believes the title denies the specific necessities of black women.<ref name=\":18\" /> Rather than depict strong female protagonists, Morrison creates characters who are actually defeated by the racism and sexism of the historic time period.<ref name=\":32\" /> Anne Salvatore, a professor of English at Rider University, interprets this failure of the \u201c[[antihero|anti heroine]]\u201d as a stark contrast to the typical bildungsroman, where a male character defeats obstacles and grows from experience.<ref name=\":32\" /> Instead, in ''The Bluest Eye,'' Pecola fails to develop an individual identity in the face of an oppressive society, and her self-hatred forces her to retreat from reality completely.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nThe point of views in the novel are also significant to its unique style. Morrison combines many narratives: two perspectives of Claudia at different times in her life, as well as an omniscient third person who connects the many tragedies of the characters.<ref name=\":18\" /> By the end of the novel, the jumbled words of the Dick and Jane primer, as well as the increasingly confusing narratives, hint at Pecola's descent into madness.<ref name=\":18\" /> This breakdown in the novel's structure also represents a destruction of the harmful ideologies which Morrison's stories seeks to debase.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\n== Reception ==\nThe novel received minimal critical attention when first published; however, it was placed on many university reading lists in black-studies departments, which promoted further recognition.<ref name=\":18\" /> Morrison was praised for her handling of difficult themes: critic Haskel Frankel said, \"Given a scene that demands a writer's best, Morrison responds with control and talent.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amerlit.com/novels/ANALYSIS%20Morrison,%20Toni%20The%20Bluest%20Eye%20(1970)%20analysis%20by%2025%20critics.pdf|title=ANALYSIS: The Bluest Eye|access-date=2016-11-28}}</ref> The first major sign that the book would succeed was an extremely positive review in ''The New York Times'' in November 1970.<ref name=\":0\" /> Morrison was also positively reviewed for her break from the status quo of usual novels from the time period, writing to a wider audience and focusing on black subculture in the 1940s, rather than the military culture of the time. African-American critic [[Ruby Dee]] wrote, \"Toni Morrison has not written a story really, but a series of painfully accurate impressions.\"<ref name=\":1\">Staggers, Leroy, \"The critical reception of Toni Morrison: 1970 to 1988\" (1989).

A common critique of her writing included her language in the novel, as it was often viewed as being made too simple for the reader.<ref name=\":1\" /> Early critics were also ambivalent about Morrison's portrayal of the black woman as an object in society rather than a person, only ever going so far as to bring this fact to light and rarely commenting past it.<ref name=\":1\" /> The most in-depth analysis of the novel began with feminist critique.<ref name=\":0\" /> There were also notable differences between African-American critics (who often identified more with the characters of the novel) and Euro-American critics (who often only focused on the actual writing of the novel).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWithin classrooms across the country, educators also disagreed over whether or not the novel was appropriate for children. One African-American educator, founder of the IFE Academy of Teaching & Technology Shekema Silveri, has stated: \"Teaching novels like ''The Bluest Eye'' helps us break down barriers with students. After reading the book, I had a student who said that she is the product of incest. And I\u2019ve had a student who said that she was molested by her uncle.

The ban was enacted in response to a complaint received by a parent of a ninth-grader student who was on the board and who took issue with the novel's sexual content, specifically the scene of Pecola's rape. Students protested the ban by reading passages from the book in their school libraries.

On the way, she meets Madeline, another mother with a daughter of the same age. Madeline's friend Celeste is also sending her twin sons, Max and Josh, to school. The two strike up a friendship with Jane. All three of them have their own problems: Madeline is resentful that her daughter from her previous marriage is growing close to her ex-husband's new wife, Bonnie; Celeste is physically abused by her rich banker husband, Perry; and Jane was raped and left to raise her son Ziggy on her own. To make matters worse for her, Ziggy is accused of bullying Amabella, his future classmate, during orientation. \n\nAs months pass, the three become close and Jane shares her experience with the other women. Jane tells the two other women that Ziggy is in fact the result of a rape by a man named \u201cSaxon Banks\u201d when Jane was 19.  With the information Jane gives, Celeste and Madeline realize that the father is Perry's cousin, Saxon Banks, but decide to keep it from Jane for the time being. Meanwhile, Celeste's marriage becomes even more violent and she starts meeting a counselor and rents an apartment for herself, without Perry's knowledge. Ziggy is once again accused of bullying Amabella, though he denies it. Jane finds out that Ziggy is keeping a secret about who is hurting Amabella and persuades him to write down the name of the child, and it turns out to be Max, one of Celeste's twins, but she isn't sure how to broach the subject with Celeste.\n\nOn the night of Pirriwee Public's Trivia Night, Josh tells Celeste that it is Max, not Ziggy, who is bullying the other children. She realizes that Max is emulating Perry and finally decides to leave him. Perry finds out about Celeste's apartment, and despite a heated argument, the couple still goes to the Trivia Night.\n\nOnce they reach the school, Jane sees Perry and realizes that he is, in fact, \"Saxon Banks\" and confronts him in front of Madeline and Celeste. Celeste recalls Perry's childhood stories where he used his cousin's name to avoid trouble for himself. Perry admits to raping Jane but shows no remorse. In the ensuing argument between them, Perry hits Celeste. Enraged by what she has witnessed, Bonnie pushes him, and he falls from the balcony to his death.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fall, Madeline finds out that Bonnie's father was abusive and seeing Perry's violence brought back memories of witnessing her father beat her mother. Everybody on the balcony decides to lie to protect Bonnie, but she turns herself in. She is convicted of accidental manslaughter and sentenced to 200 hours of community service. A year after Perry's death, Celeste works in a family law firm and sets up a trust fund for Ziggy. She speaks publicly about her abusive relationship, starting her speech with: \"This can happen to anyone.\"\n\n==Writing==\nMoriarty's main inspiration for the story came from a radio interview she heard in which a woman recounted her parents' abusive relationship.<ref name=guardian/> The woman narrated how, even as an adult, she hid under her bed to escape her parents' fighting, an experience Moriarty ended up using as a scene in the book.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|last1=Patrick|first1=Bethanne|title=Liane Moriarty: 'We're all capable of things that are breathtakingly cruel'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/22/liane-moriarty-little-big-lies-books|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=July 22, 2014}}</ref> Initially, the book was a first-person narrative from each of the three main characters, but Moriarty soon decided against it, instead interjecting minor characters' statements between portions of the story.<ref name=stevens>{{cite web|last1=Stevens|first1=Reagan|title=Interview with Liane Moriarty|url=http://www.goodreads.com/interviews/show/994.Liane_Moriarty|publisher=[[Goodreads]]|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Big Little Lies'' has generally been well received by critics, who praised the book's balance of humour with more serious issues like domestic abuse.

On [[November 2]], [[1885]], King [[Milan I of Serbia|Milan I]] declared war on the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] and the same day, the Royal Serbian Army started an attack on the Bulgarian Army, in an attempt to quickly reach [[Sofia]] and capture Bulgaria. The King thought Bulgaria would be too busy preparing war with the [[Ottoman Empire]], and that its Western borders would be largely undefended. Before the attack, the Danube Division of Ni\u0161 Army was taking positions around [[Pirot]] and preparing the action towards [[Caribrod]].\n[[File:Bulgarian unification and Serbo-Bulgarian War.png|thumb|Map of the Serbo-Bulgarian War]]\n== Battle ==\nThe Serbian attack started on November 2, when the Royal Serbian Army launched an attack with 3-4 hours of late in for directions towards Sofia and on every direction, there was a single division. The Danube Division was tasked to enter Bulgarian territory, capture Caribrod, come to line [[Kalotina]] \u2013 [[Vishan, Sofia Province|Vishan]] and to take the [[Dragoman]] pass. In that way the [[Danube]] Division will be able to support the [[\u0160umadija]] Division on right side.\n\nEntering into Bulgarian territory Serbian units had great fire resistance from Bulgarian side. Forces of the Danube Division were divided in two columns. Division's right column was composed of [[Serbian Hussar Regiment|7th Serbian Infantry Regiment]] that attacked from [[Sre\u0107kovac]] to [[\u017delju\u0161a]] and continuing to Caribrod. Cavalry Brigade (composed of three battalions of 9th Serbian Infantry Regiment) and 19th Guard Battalion with one artillery battery, composing division's left column, passed state border, reached villages [[Viso\u010dki Odorovci|Odorovci]] and [[\u010ciniglavci]], passed Caribrod and attack finished on line [[Stanyantsi]] \u2013 [[Berende Izvor|Izvor]]. Drina Division was left in reserve until the success on [[Sukovo]] Bridge.  \n\nAll Serbian divisions very soon after the start of attack made contact with Bulgarians. Morava Division was stopped about two hours by [[Opalchentsi]] detachment with 60 fighters after passing the border near [[Daschen pass|Daschen]] pass. Later division stayed on [[Ruj Mountain]] where stayed during night because of fog without any greater success. \u0160umadija Division was stopped by small battalion of captain Andrei Bukureshtliev (4th Plevne Infantry Regiment) on road between [[Planinica|Planinci]] and [[Banjski Dol]]. Danube Division only had approximate success to the planned one. Caribrod Detachment resisted to Danube Division near Caribrod for a bit of time and at 16:30 Serbs captured Caribrod but they couldn't continue to the planned line [[Kalotina]]\u2013[[Vishan]]. Right column stopped its attack in [[Lukavica]] village where forces stayed during the night. Cavalry Brigade awaited the 19th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery to be sent to their positions. Cavalry Brigade launched attack on 14:00 and on night came to the [[Smilovci]] village where it was waited by bad fortified detachment of Bahchevanov (one infantry battalion, one cavalry squadron and 4 cannons). In the night that detachment together with Caribrod Detachment retreated to Stanyantsi village.\n\nThe battle was concluded without any major Bulgarian casualties and also without great territorial success as the Royal Serbian Army was only able to advance 5 kilometres into Bulgarian territory.\n\n== Sources ==\n* [http://www.slovo.bg/showwork.php3?AuID=101&WorkID=4482&Level=3 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, \u0442\u043e\u043c 1, \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u2013 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u044a\u0442, I. \u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044a\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435]\n\n[[Category:Serbo-Bulgarian War]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|text=the [[2nd Battle of Caribrod]] fought on November 24 1885}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict          = 1st Battle of Caribrod\n| width             = \n| partof            = [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]]\n| image             = \n| image_size        = \n| alt               = \n| caption           = \n| date              = November 14, 1885;<br/> ''November 2, 1885'' ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]])\n| place             = [[Dimitrovgrad, Serbia|Caribrod]],{{flagdeco|Bulgaria}} [[Principality of Bulgaria]]; today [[Serbia]]\n| coordinates       = <!--Use the {{coord}} template -->\n| map_type          = \n| map_relief        = \n| map_size          = \n| map_marksize      = \n| map_caption       = \n| map_label         = \n| territory         = Captured Caribrod, first Bulgarian territories occupied\n| result            = [[Royal Serbian Army|Serbian]] victory\n| status            = \n| combatants_header = Belligerents\n| combatant1        = {{flagcountry|Kingdom of Serbia}}\n| combatant2        = {{flagdeco|Bulgaria}} [[Principality of Bulgaria]]\n| combatant3        = \n| commander1        = General Milutin Jovanovi\u0107\n| commander2        = Captain Popov\n| commander3        = \n| units1            = {{flagdeco|Kingdom of Serbia}} Danube Division\n| units2            = {{flagdeco|Bulgaria}} Caribrod detachment\n| units3            = \n| strength1         = \n| strength2         = \n| strength3         = \n| casualties1       = \n| casualties2       = \n| casualties3       = \n| notes             = \n| campaignbox       = \n}}\nThe '''1st Battle of Caribrod''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: ''\u0411\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0434'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''\u0411\u0438\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0434 \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430'') was a battle during the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] fought on November 2, 1885 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) between [[Royal Serbian Army]] and [[Bulgarian Army]] around Caribrod, today [[Dimitrovgrad, Serbia|Dimitrovgrad]], [[Serbia]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Bulgarian unification|Unification of Bulgaria]] wasn't [https://www.dictionary.com/browse/accepted accepted] well in [[Balkan Peninsula|Balkan]] states.

It is the [[quantum]] of the [[electromagnetic field]] including [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[light]] and [[radio wave]]s, and the [[force carrier]] for the [[electromagnetic force]] (even when [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|static]] via [[virtual particle]]s). The [[invariant mass]] of the photon is zero; in [[vacuum]] it always moves at 299,792,458 m/s, the [[speed of light|speed of light in vacuum]].\n\nLike all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by [[quantum mechanics]] and exhibit [[wave\u2013particle duality]], exhibiting properties of both [[wave]]s and [[wikt:particle|particles]]. For example, a single photon may be [[refraction|refracted]] by a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and exhibit [[Interference (wave propagation)|wave interference]] with itself, and it can behave as a particle with definite and finite measurable position or [[momentum]], though not both at the same time as per [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]].

The quanta in a light wave are not spatially localized.\n\nThe modern concept of the photon was developed gradually by [[Albert Einstein]] in the early 20th century to explain experimental observations that did not fit the classical [[electromagnetic wave equation|wave model]] of light. The benefit of the photon model is that it accounts for the frequency dependence of light's energy, and explains the ability of [[matter]] and electromagnetic radiation to be in [[thermal equilibrium]]. The photon model accounts for anomalous observations, including the properties of [[black-body radiation]], that others (notably [[Max Planck]]) had tried to explain using ''semiclassical models''. In that model, light is described by [[Maxwell's equations]], but material objects emit and absorb light in ''quantized'' amounts (i.e., they change energy only by certain particular discrete amounts).

In 1900, the German physicist [[Max Planck]] was studying black-body radiation, and specifically the [[Ultraviolet Catastrophe]]: he suggested that the experimental observations would be explained if the energy carried by electromagnetic [[wave]]s could only be released in \"packets\" of energy. In his 1901 article <ref name=\"Planck1901\"/> in ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'' he called these packets \"energy elements\". In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published a paper in which he proposed that many light-related phenomena\u2014including black-body radiation and the [[photoelectric effect]]\u2014would be better explained by modelling electromagnetic waves as consisting of spatially localized, discrete wave-packets.<ref name=\"Einstein1905\">{{cite journal |last=Einstein |first=A. |authorlink=Albert Einstein |year=1905 |title=\u00dcber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |volume=17 |pages=132\u2013148 |doi=10.1002/andp.19053220607 |bibcode=1905AnP...322..132E |issue=6 |language=de}}.

He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], and the [[photoelectric effect]]. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.<ref>''Einstein and the Quantum: The Quest of the Valiant Swabian'', A.

Nevertheless, ''all'' semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments.{{efn|These experiments produce results that cannot be explained by any classical theory of light, since they involve anticorrelations that result from the [[measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement process]].

The condition follows from the assumption that functions of the emission and absorption of radiation by the atoms are independent of each other, and that thermal equilibrium is made by way of the radiation's interaction with the atoms. Consider a cavity in [[thermal equilibrium]] with all parts of itself and filled with [[electromagnetic radiation]] and that the atoms can emit and absorb that radiation. Thermal equilibrium requires that the energy density <math>\\rho(\\nu)</math> of photons with frequency <math>\\nu</math> (which is proportional to their [[number density]]) is, on average, constant in time; hence, the rate at which photons of any particular frequency are ''emitted'' must equal the rate at which they are ''absorbed''.<ref name=\"Einstein1916a\">{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A.|authorlink=Albert Einstein|year=1916|title=Strahlungs-emission und -absorption nach der Quantentheorie|journal=[[Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft]]|volume=18|pages=318\u2013323|bibcode=1916DPhyG..18..318E|language=de}}</ref>\n\nEinstein began by postulating simple proportionality relations for the different reaction rates involved. In his model, the rate <math>R_{ji}</math> for a system to ''absorb'' a photon of frequency <math>\\nu</math> and transition from a lower energy <math>E_{j}</math> to a higher energy <math>E_{i}</math> is proportional to the number <math>N_{j}</math> of atoms with energy <math>E_{j}</math> and to the energy density <math>\\rho(\\nu)</math> of ambient photons of that frequency,\n\n:<math>\nR_{ji}=N_{j} B_{ji} \\rho(\\nu) \\!\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>B_{ji}</math> is the [[rate constant]] for absorption. For the reverse process, there are two possibilities: spontaneous emission of a photon, or the emission of a photon initiated by the interaction of the atom with a passing photon and the return of the atom to the lower-energy state. Following Einstein's approach, the corresponding rate <math>R_{ij}</math> for the emission of photons of frequency <math>\\nu</math> and transition from a higher energy <math>E_{i}</math> to a lower energy <math>E_{j}</math> is\n\n:<math>\nR_{ij}=N_{i} A_{ij} + N_{i} B_{ij} \\rho(\\nu) \\!\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>A_{ij}</math> is the rate constant for [[spontaneous emission|emitting a photon spontaneously]], and <math>B_{ij}</math> is the rate constant for emissions in response to ambient photons ([[stimulated emission|induced or stimulated emission]]). In thermodynamic equilibrium, the number of atoms in state i and those in state j must, on average, be constant; hence, the rates <math>R_{ji}</math> and <math>R_{ij}</math> must be equal. Also, by arguments analogous to the derivation of [[Boltzmann statistics]], the ratio of <math>N_{i}</math> and <math>N_{j}</math> is <math>g_i/g_j\\exp{(E_j-E_i)/(kT)},</math> where <math>g_{i,j}</math> are the [[degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] of the state i and that of j, respectively, <math>E_{i,j}</math> their energies, k the [[Boltzmann constant]] and T the system's [[temperature]].

The factor by which the speed is decreased is called the [[refractive index]] of the material. In a classical wave picture, the slowing can be explained by the light inducing [[electric polarization]] in the matter, the polarized matter radiating new light, and that new light interfering with the original light wave to form a delayed wave. In a particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the photon with quantum excitations of the matter to produce [[quasi-particle]]s known as [[polariton]] (other quasi-particles are [[phonon]]s and [[exciton]]s); this polariton has a nonzero [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]], which means that it cannot travel at ''c''. Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at [[variable speed of light|different speeds]]; this is called [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (not to be confused with scattering). In some cases, it can result in [[slow light|extremely slow speeds of light]] in matter. The effects of photon interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in [[Raman scattering]] and [[Brillouin scattering]].<ref>Polaritons section 10.10.1, Raman and Brillouin scattering section 10.11.3 in {{Cite book | last = Patterson | first=J.D. | last2 = Bailey | first2=B.C.| title = Solid-State Physics: Introduction to the Theory| publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| year=2007| isbn=978-3-540-24115-7}}</ref>\n\nPhotons can be scattered by matter.

These examples are chosen to illustrate applications of photons ''per se'', rather than general optical devices such as lenses, etc. that could operate under a classical theory of light. The laser is an extremely important application and is discussed above under [[stimulated emission]].\n\nIndividual photons can be detected by several methods. The classic [[photomultiplier]] tube exploits the [[photoelectric effect]]: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. [[Semiconductor]] [[charge-coupled device]] chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic [[capacitor]] that can be detected. Other detectors such as [[Geiger counter]]s use the ability of photons to [[ionize]] gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of the gas.<ref>Photomultiplier section 1.1.10, CCDs section 1.1.8, Geiger counters section 1.3.2.1 in {{cite book|first=C.R.|last=Kitchin|title=Astrophysical Techniques|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4200-8243-2}}</ref>\n\nPlanck's energy formula <math>E=h\\nu</math> is often used by engineers and chemists in design, both to compute the change in energy resulting from a photon absorption and to determine the frequency of the light emitted from a given photon emission.

This allows for higher resolution microscopy, because the sample absorbs energy only in the spectrum  where two beams of different colors overlap significantly, which can be made much smaller than the excitation volume of a single beam (see [[two-photon excitation microscopy]]).

It is the [[quantum]] of the [[electromagnetic field]] including [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[light]] and [[radio wave]]s, and the [[force carrier]] for the [[electromagnetic force]] (even when [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|static]] via [[virtual particle]]s). The [[invariant mass]] of the photon is zero; in [[vacuum]] it always moves at 299,792,458 m/s, the [[speed of light|speed of light in vacuum]].\n\nLike all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by [[quantum mechanics]] and exhibit [[wave\u2013particle duality]], exhibiting properties of both [[wave]]s and [[wikt:particle|particles]]. For example, a single photon may be [[refraction|refracted]] by a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and exhibit [[Interference (wave propagation)|wave interference]] with itself, and it can behave as a particle with definite and finite measurable position or [[momentum]], though not both at the same time as per [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]].  The photon's wave and quantum qualities are two observable aspects of a single phenomenon\u2014they cannot be described by any mechanical model;<ref>{{cite book  |last1=Joos |first1=George  |date=1951  |title=Theoretical Physics  |page=679  |publisher=Blackie and Son Limited  |location=London and Glasgow }}</ref> a representation of this dual property of light that assumes certain points on the wavefront to be the seat of the energy, is not possible. The quanta in a light wave are not spatially localized.\n\nThe modern concept of the photon was developed gradually by [[Albert Einstein]] in the early 20th century to explain experimental observations that did not fit the classical [[electromagnetic wave equation|wave model]] of light. The benefit of the photon model is that it accounts for the frequency dependence of light's energy, and explains the ability of [[matter]] and electromagnetic radiation to be in [[thermal equilibrium]]. The photon model accounts for anomalous observations, including the properties of [[black-body radiation]], that others (notably [[Max Planck]]) had tried to explain using ''semiclassical models''. In that model, light is described by [[Maxwell's equations]], but material objects emit and absorb light in ''quantized'' amounts (i.e., they change energy only by certain particular discrete amounts).

The intrinsic properties of particles, such as [[electric charge|charge]], [[invariant mass|mass]], and [[spin (physics)|spin]], are determined by this [[gauge theory|gauge symmetry]].  The photon concept has led to momentous advances in experimental and theoretical physics, including [[laser]]s, [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensation]], [[quantum field theory]], and the [[probability amplitude|probabilistic interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. It has been applied to [[photochemistry]], [[two-photon excitation microscopy|high-resolution microscopy]], and [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer|measurements of molecular distances]].

In 1900, the German physicist [[Max Planck]] was studying black-body radiation, and specifically the [[Ultraviolet Catastrophe]]: he suggested that the experimental observations would be explained if the energy carried by electromagnetic [[wave]]s could only be released in \"packets\" of energy. In his 1901 article <ref name=\"Planck1901\"/> in ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'' he called these packets \"energy elements\". In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published a paper in which he proposed that many light-related phenomena\u2014including black-body radiation and the [[photoelectric effect]]\u2014would be better explained by modelling electromagnetic waves as consisting of spatially localized, discrete wave-packets.<ref name=\"Einstein1905\">{{cite journal |last=Einstein |first=A. |authorlink=Albert Einstein |year=1905 |title=\u00dcber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |volume=17 |pages=132\u2013148 |doi=10.1002/andp.19053220607 |bibcode=1905AnP...322..132E |issue=6 |language=de}}.

In the [[center of momentum frame]], the colliding antiparticles have no net momentum, whereas a single photon always has momentum (since, as we have seen, it is determined by the photon's frequency or wavelength, which cannot be zero). Hence, [[momentum|conservation of momentum]] (or equivalently, [[translational invariance]]) requires that at least two photons are created, with zero net momentum. (However, it is possible if the system interacts with another particle or field for the annihilation to produce one photon, as when a positron annihilates with a bound atomic electron, it is possible for only one photon to be emitted, as the nuclear Coulomb field breaks translational symmetry.)<ref name=Griffiths2008>{{citation| author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Elementary Particles|edition=2nd revised| publisher=WILEY-VCH |year=2008|isbn= 978-3-527-40601-2}}</ref>{{rp|64\u201365}} The energy of the two photons, or, equivalently, their frequency, may be determined from [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation of four-momentum]].\n\n{{anchor |antiphoton}}\nSeen another way, the photon can be considered as [[Truly neutral particle|its own antiparticle]] (thus an \"antiphoton\" is simply a normal photon).

Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments for the existence of photons was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as ''absolutely'' definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, ''all'' semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments.{{efn|These experiments produce results that cannot be explained by any classical theory of light, since they involve anticorrelations that result from the [[measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement process]].

In 1977, Kimble ''et al.'' demonstrated an analogous anti-bunching effect of photons interacting with a beam splitter; this approach was simplified and sources of error eliminated in the photon-anticorrelation experiment of Grangier ''et al.'' (1986). This work is reviewed and simplified further in Thorn ''et al.'' (2004).

The condition follows from the assumption that functions of the emission and absorption of radiation by the atoms are independent of each other, and that thermal equilibrium is made by way of the radiation's interaction with the atoms. Consider a cavity in [[thermal equilibrium]] with all parts of itself and filled with [[electromagnetic radiation]] and that the atoms can emit and absorb that radiation. Thermal equilibrium requires that the energy density <math>\\rho(\\nu)</math> of photons with frequency <math>\\nu</math> (which is proportional to their [[number density]]) is, on average, constant in time; hence, the rate at which photons of any particular frequency are ''emitted'' must equal the rate at which they are ''absorbed''.<ref name=\"Einstein1916a\">{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A.|authorlink=Albert Einstein|year=1916|title=Strahlungs-emission und -absorption nach der Quantentheorie|journal=[[Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft]]|volume=18|pages=318\u2013323|bibcode=1916DPhyG..18..318E|language=de}}</ref>\n\nEinstein began by postulating simple proportionality relations for the different reaction rates involved. In his model, the rate <math>R_{ji}</math> for a system to ''absorb'' a photon of frequency <math>\\nu</math> and transition from a lower energy <math>E_{j}</math> to a higher energy <math>E_{i}</math> is proportional to the number <math>N_{j}</math> of atoms with energy <math>E_{j}</math> and to the energy density <math>\\rho(\\nu)</math> of ambient photons of that frequency,\n\n:<math>\nR_{ji}=N_{j} B_{ji} \\rho(\\nu) \\!\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>B_{ji}</math> is the [[rate constant]] for absorption. For the reverse process, there are two possibilities: spontaneous emission of a photon, or the emission of a photon initiated by the interaction of the atom with a passing photon and the return of the atom to the lower-energy state. Following Einstein's approach, the corresponding rate <math>R_{ij}</math> for the emission of photons of frequency <math>\\nu</math> and transition from a higher energy <math>E_{i}</math> to a lower energy <math>E_{j}</math> is\n\n:<math>\nR_{ij}=N_{i} A_{ij} + N_{i} B_{ij} \\rho(\\nu) \\!\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>A_{ij}</math> is the rate constant for [[spontaneous emission|emitting a photon spontaneously]], and <math>B_{ij}</math> is the rate constant for emissions in response to ambient photons ([[stimulated emission|induced or stimulated emission]]).

In a particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the photon with quantum excitations of the matter to produce [[quasi-particle]]s known as [[polariton]] (other quasi-particles are [[phonon]]s and [[exciton]]s); this polariton has a nonzero [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]], which means that it cannot travel at ''c''.

Moreover, these photons cause less damage to the sample, since they are of lower energy.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Denk, W. |author2=Svoboda, K. |title=Photon upmanship: Why multiphoton imaging is more than a gimmick|journal=[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]|volume=18|issue=3|pages=351\u2013357|year=1997|pmid=9115730|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)81237-4}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, two energy transitions can be coupled so that, as one system absorbs a photon, another nearby system \"steals\" its energy and re-emits a photon of a different frequency.

Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast [[quantum computer]], and the [[quantum entanglement]] of photons is a focus of research. [[Nonlinear optics|Nonlinear optical processes]] are another active research area, with topics such as [[two-photon absorption]], [[self-phase modulation]], [[modulational instability]] and [[optical parametric oscillator]]s. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons ''per se''; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of [[spontaneous parametric down conversion]] is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of [[optical communication]], especially for [[quantum cryptography]].{{efn|Introductory-level material on the various sub-fields of quantum optics can be found in {{Cite book\n|last=Fox|first=M.\n|title=Quantum Optics: An Introduction\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|year=2006|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Q-4dIthPuL4C}}\n|isbn=978-0-19-856673-1\n}}}}\n\n[[Two-photon physics]] studies interactions between photons, which are rare.

Set in three time periods, 1935 England, [[World War II|Second World War]] England and France, and present-day England, it covers an upper-class girl's half-innocent mistake that ruins lives, her adulthood in the shadow of that mistake, and a reflection on the nature of writing.\n\nWidely regarded as one of McEwan's best works, it was shortlisted for the 2001 [[Booker Prize]] for fiction.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/69 |title=Atonement |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516205530/http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/69 |archivedate=16 May 2008 |accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref>  In 2010, ''[[TIME Magazine|TIME]]'' magazine named ''Atonement'' in its list of the 100 greatest English-language novels since 1923.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1951793,00.html | work=Time | title=All Time 100 Novels | date=16 October 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the book was adapted into a [[BAFTA Award|BAFTA]] and [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Atonement (film)|film of the same title]], starring [[Saoirse Ronan]], [[James McAvoy]], and [[Keira Knightley]], and directed by [[Joe Wright]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n===Part one===\nBriony Tallis, a 13-year-old English girl with a talent for writing, lives at her family's [[country estate]] with her parents Jack and Emily Tallis. Her older sister Cecilia has recently graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] with Robbie Turner, the Tallis family housekeeper's son and Cecilia's childhood friend (Robbie received a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first]] in English while Cecilia received a \"humiliating third\"), with whom she eventually develops a relationship.\n\nIn the summer of 1935, Briony's maternal cousins, Lola and her twin brothers Jackson and Pierrot, visit the family after their parents are going through a bitter divorce. Briony's immaturity, and her inability to grasp certain situations which are beyond her understanding, lead her to misinterpret a scene she witnesses of a struggle between Robbie and Cecilia. What she believes to be a moment of sexual tension between Cecilia and Robbie is far from the reality of the situation and is the spark that begins Briony's fantasies. Briony misconstrues this situation and concludes that Robbie is acting aggressively toward Cecilia, due to their differences in gender and Briony's idea of male dominance over women.\n\nRobbie, meanwhile, begins to realise he has developed an attraction towards Cecilia, whom he has not seen in some time, and writes several drafts of a love letter to her expressing the feelings he has for her. He decides to give the letter to Briony to deliver to Cecilia for him; however, he inadvertently gives her a version he had meant to discard, which contains lewd and vulgar references (\"[[cunt]]\"). It becomes too late for Robbie to rectify his mistake and despite his instructions to Briony not to open the letter she disobeys him and reads what he had initially written to Cecilia. Being a child, she most certainly had not seen such language written and interprets it as being a threat from Robbie to her sister Cecilia.\n\nLater on that same evening, she walks in on Robbie and Cecilia making love in the library. Again Briony misinterprets the sexual act as rape and believes Robbie is a \"maniac\". What Briony fails to understand is that upon her entrance into the library, she has crushed Robbie and Cecilia's only moment of love and labels Robbie as a rapist, which again is far from the truth. Her interpretation of their love leads her to believe that she needs to protect her sister from Robbie.\n\nLater, there is a family dinner party attended by Briony's brother Leon and his friend Paul Marshall, who appears to have a lengthy scratch on his face. Moments later it is discovered that the twins have run away. The dinner party breaks into teams to search for them.\n\nIn the darkness, whilst everyone is searching for the twins, Briony discovers her cousin Lola being raped by an assailant she cannot clearly see. Lola is unable or perhaps unwilling to identify the attacker \u2014 strongly hinted to be Marshall \u2014 but Briony decides to accuse Robbie and identifies him to the police as the rapist, claiming she has seen Robbie's face in the dark. Her previous misinterpretations of seeing Robbie and Cecilia's struggle at the fountain, the letter, and the scene she witnesses in the library, lead Briony to accuse Robbie of raping Lola, despite having no solid proof that he was responsible. Robbie is taken away to prison, with only Cecilia and his mother believing his protestations of innocence. Briony perceives her actions to be heroic, fulfilling her fantasies of the criminal being locked up, yet she is unaware of the impact her implications had. As a result of this, Cecilia cuts off her family and refuses to speak to them again.\n\n===Part two===\nBy the time [[World War II|Second World War]] has started, Robbie has spent several years in prison. He is released on the condition he enlists in the army.\n\nCecilia has trained and become a nurse. She has cut off all contact with her family because of the part they took in sending Robbie to jail.\n\nRobbie and Cecilia have only been in contact by letter, since she was not allowed to visit him in prison. Before Robbie has to go to war in France, they meet once for half an hour, during Cecilia's lunch break. Their reunion starts awkwardly, but they share a kiss before leaving each other.\n\nIn France, the war is going badly, and the army is [[Dunkirk evacuation|retreating]] to [[Dunkirk]]. As the injured Robbie goes to that safe haven, he thinks about Cecilia and past events like teaching Briony how to swim, reflecting on Briony's possible reasons for accusing him.\n\nHis single meeting with Cecilia is the memory that keeps him walking; his only aim is seeing her again. His condition deteriorates over the course of the section: He weakens and becomes delirious, and the text strongly implies that he is dying of his wound. At the end of part two, Robbie falls asleep in Dunkirk, one day before the [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation]] begins.\n\n===Part three===\nRemorseful Briony has refused her place at Cambridge and instead is a trainee nurse in London. She has realised the full extent of her mistake and decides it was Paul Marshall, Leon's friend, whom she saw raping Lola. Briony still writes, although she does not pursue it with the same recklessness as she did as a child.\n\nBriony is called to the bedside of Luc, a young, fatally wounded French soldier. She consoles him in his last moments by speaking with him in her school French, and he mistakes her for an English girl whom his mother wanted him to marry.\n\nJust before his death, Luc asks, \"Do you love me?\" Briony replies, \"Yes,\" not only because \"no other answer was possible\" but also because \"for the moment, she did. He was a lovely boy far away from his family and about to die.\" Afterward, Briony daydreams about the life she might have had if she had married Luc and gone to live with him and his family.\n\nBriony attends the wedding of Paul Marshall and her cousin Lola \u2014  who has decided to \"marry her rapist\" \u2014 before finally visiting Cecilia. Robbie is on leave from the army, and Briony meets him unexpectedly at her sister's.\n\nCecilia and Robbie both refuse to forgive Briony, who nonetheless tells them she will try to put things right. She promises to begin the legal procedures needed to exonerate Robbie, even though Paul Marshall will never be held responsible for his crime because of his marriage to Lola, the victim.\n\n===Postscript===\nThe final section, titled \"London 1999,\" is narrated by Briony herself in the form of a diary entry. Now 77, she is a successful novelist who has recently been diagnosed with [[Multi-infarct dementia|vascular dementia]], so she is facing rapid mental decline and death.\n\nThe reader learns that Briony is the author of the preceding sections of the novel. On the penultimate page, Briony reveals that Robbie Turner died of [[septicaemia]] \u2014 caused by his injury \u2014 on the beaches of Dunkirk, that Cecilia was killed by the bomb that destroyed [[Balham station#Second World War|Balham Underground station]], and Briony never saw them in 1940. Briony did attend Lola's wedding to Marshall, but confesses she was too \"cowardly\" to visit the \"recently bereaved\" Cecilia to make amends. The novel \u2014 which she says is factually true apart from Robbie and Cecilia being reunited \u2014 is her lifelong attempt at \"atonement\" for what she did to them.\n\nBriony justifies her invented happy ending by saying she does not see what purpose it would serve to give readers a \"pitiless\" story. She writes, \"I like to think that it isn't weakness or evasion, but a final act of kindness, a stand against oblivion and despair, to let my lovers live and to unite them at the end.\"\n\n==Main characters==\n* '''Briony Tallis''' \u2013 The younger sister of Leon and Cecilia Tallis, Briony is an aspiring writer. She is a thirteen-year-old at the beginning of the novel and takes part in sending Robbie Turner to jail when she falsely claims that he assaulted Lola. Briony is part narrator, part character and we see her transformation from child to woman as the novel progresses. At the end of the novel, Briony has realised her wrongdoing as a \"child\" and decides to write the novel to find atonement.\n* '''Cecilia Tallis''' \u2013 The middle child in the Tallis family, Cecilia has fallen in love with her childhood companion, Robbie Turner. After a tense encounter by the fountain, she and Robbie don't speak again until they meet before a formal dinner. When Robbie is falsely accused of rape shortly after, Cecilia loses her love to jail and war, and chooses not to contact any members of her family again.\n* '''Leon Tallis''' \u2013 The eldest child in the Tallis family, Leon returns home to visit. He brings his friend Paul Marshall along with him on his trip home.\n* '''Emily Tallis''' \u2013 Emily is the mother of Briony, Cecilia, and Leon. Emily is ill in bed for most of the novel, suffering from severe migraines.\n* '''Jack Tallis''' \u2013 Jack is the father of Briony, Cecilia, and Leon. Jack often works late nights and it is alluded to in the novel that he is having an affair.\n* '''Robbie Turner''' \u2013 Robbie is the son of Grace Turner, who lives on the grounds of the Tallis home. Having grown up with Leon, Briony and Cecilia, he knows the family well. He attended Cambridge University with Cecilia and when they come home on break, they fall in love. Robbie is sent to jail when Briony falsely accuses him of raping Lola.\n* '''Grace Turner''' \u2013 The mother of Robbie Turner, she was given permission from Jack Tallis to live on the grounds. She has become the family's maid and does laundry for the Tallises. When her son is falsely accused of raping Lola, only she and Cecilia believe he is innocent, and Grace chooses to leave the Tallis family.\n* '''Dolores \u2018Lola\u2019 Quincey''' \u2013 A 15-year-old girl who is Briony, Cecilia, and Leon's cousin. She comes, along with her twin brothers, to stay with the Tallises after her parents' divorce. Lola was supposed to assume the main role in Briony's play, until it was cancelled. She is also subject to rape while staying at the Tallis household. Lola appears later in the novel as a mature woman, married to Paul Marshall. She is red-headed and fair-skinned with freckles.\n* '''Jackson and Pierrot Quincey''' \u2013 Lola's younger twin brothers and Briony, Cecilia, and Leon's cousin. They come, along with their sister, to stay with the Tallises after their parents' divorce. Briony wants the twins to take a role in her play, but disputes mean the play is cancelled, upsetting them both. Pierrot appears later in the novel as an old man while his brother has died.\n* '''Danny Hardman''' \u2013 The handyman for the Tallis family. Robbie and Cecilia suspect he is responsible for Lola's rape until Briony tells them otherwise, prompting Robbie to say they owe him an apology.\n* '''Paul Marshall''' \u2013 A friend of Leon. He rapes Lola outside the Tallis household after dark; Briony, however, accuses Robbie of Lola's rape, and many years later Lola and Paul marry. Paul Marshall also owns a chocolate factory that manufactures 'Amo' bars \u2013 fake chocolate energy bars supplied to army troops, which earn him a considerable fortune.\n* '''Corporal Nettle''' \u2013 Nettle is one of Robbie's two companions during the Dunkirk evacuation. In the fourth and final section of the novel, an elderly Briony alludes to an \"old Mr. Nettle\" from whom she received a \"dozen long letters\" but whether this is the same person isn't made exactly clear.\n* '''Corporal Mace''' \u2013 Mace is the second of Robbie's two companions during the Dunkirk evacuation. He is last seen presumably rescuing an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] man from a possible [[lynching]] by some infantrymen under the guise of wanting to do harm by drowning him in the \"bloody sea.\"\n* '''Betty''' \u2013 The Tallis family's servant, described as \"wretched\" in personality.\n\n==References to other literary works==\n''Atonement'' contains [[Intertextuality|intertextual references]] to a number of other literary works, including ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[The Waves]]'', [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'', [[Henry James]]' ''[[The Golden Bowl]]'', [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'', [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Clarissa]]'', [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Lolita]]'', [[Rosamond Lehmann]]'s ''[[Dusty Answer]]'',<ref>The Modernism of Ian McEwan's Atonement\nMFS Modern Fiction Studies \u2013 Volume 56, Number 3, Fall 2010, pp. 473\u2013495</ref> and [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[Hamlet]],'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]''.

Set in three time periods, 1935 England, [[World War II|Second World War]] England and France, and present-day England, it covers an upper-class girl's half-innocent mistake that ruins lives, her adulthood in the shadow of that mistake, and a reflection on the nature of writing.\n\nWidely regarded as one of McEwan's best works, it was shortlisted for the 2001 [[Booker Prize]] for fiction.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/69 |title=Atonement |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516205530/http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/69 |archivedate=16 May 2008 |accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref>  In 2010, ''[[TIME Magazine|TIME]]'' magazine named ''Atonement'' in its list of the 100 greatest English-language novels since 1923.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1951793,00.html | work=Time | title=All Time 100 Novels | date=16 October 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the book was adapted into a [[BAFTA Award|BAFTA]] and [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Atonement (film)|film of the same title]], starring [[Saoirse Ronan]], [[James McAvoy]], and [[Keira Knightley]], and directed by [[Joe Wright]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n===Part one===\nBriony Tallis, a 13-year-old English girl with a talent for writing, lives at her family's [[country estate]] with her parents Jack and Emily Tallis. Her older sister Cecilia has recently graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] with Robbie Turner, the Tallis family housekeeper's son and Cecilia's childhood friend (Robbie received a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first]] in English while Cecilia received a \"humiliating third\"), with whom she eventually develops a relationship.\n\nIn the summer of 1935, Briony's maternal cousins, Lola and her twin brothers Jackson and Pierrot, visit the family after their parents are going through a bitter divorce. Briony's immaturity, and her inability to grasp certain situations which are beyond her understanding, lead her to misinterpret a scene she witnesses of a struggle between Robbie and Cecilia. What she believes to be a moment of sexual tension between Cecilia and Robbie is far from the reality of the situation and is the spark that begins Briony's fantasies. Briony misconstrues this situation and concludes that Robbie is acting aggressively toward Cecilia, due to their differences in gender and Briony's idea of male dominance over women.\n\nRobbie, meanwhile, begins to realise he has developed an attraction towards Cecilia, whom he has not seen in some time, and writes several drafts of a love letter to her expressing the feelings he has for her. He decides to give the letter to Briony to deliver to Cecilia for him; however, he inadvertently gives her a version he had meant to discard, which contains lewd and vulgar references (\"[[cunt]]\"). It becomes too late for Robbie to rectify his mistake and despite his instructions to Briony not to open the letter she disobeys him and reads what he had initially written to Cecilia. Being a child, she most certainly had not seen such language written and interprets it as being a threat from Robbie to her sister Cecilia.\n\nLater on that same evening, she walks in on Robbie and Cecilia making love in the library. Again Briony misinterprets the sexual act as rape and believes Robbie is a \"maniac\". What Briony fails to understand is that upon her entrance into the library, she has crushed Robbie and Cecilia's only moment of love and labels Robbie as a rapist, which again is far from the truth. Her interpretation of their love leads her to believe that she needs to protect her sister from Robbie.\n\nLater, there is a family dinner party attended by Briony's brother Leon and his friend Paul Marshall, who appears to have a lengthy scratch on his face. Moments later it is discovered that the twins have run away. The dinner party breaks into teams to search for them.\n\nIn the darkness, whilst everyone is searching for the twins, Briony discovers her cousin Lola being raped by an assailant she cannot clearly see. Lola is unable or perhaps unwilling to identify the attacker \u2014 strongly hinted to be Marshall \u2014 but Briony decides to accuse Robbie and identifies him to the police as the rapist, claiming she has seen Robbie's face in the dark. Her previous misinterpretations of seeing Robbie and Cecilia's struggle at the fountain, the letter, and the scene she witnesses in the library, lead Briony to accuse Robbie of raping Lola, despite having no solid proof that he was responsible. Robbie is taken away to prison, with only Cecilia and his mother believing his protestations of innocence. Briony perceives her actions to be heroic, fulfilling her fantasies of the criminal being locked up, yet she is unaware of the impact her implications had. As a result of this, Cecilia cuts off her family and refuses to speak to them again.\n\n===Part two===\nBy the time [[World War II|Second World War]] has started, Robbie has spent several years in prison. He is released on the condition he enlists in the army.\n\nCecilia has trained and become a nurse. She has cut off all contact with her family because of the part they took in sending Robbie to jail.\n\nRobbie and Cecilia have only been in contact by letter, since she was not allowed to visit him in prison. Before Robbie has to go to war in France, they meet once for half an hour, during Cecilia's lunch break. Their reunion starts awkwardly, but they share a kiss before leaving each other.\n\nIn France, the war is going badly, and the army is [[Dunkirk evacuation|retreating]] to [[Dunkirk]]. As the injured Robbie goes to that safe haven, he thinks about Cecilia and past events like teaching Briony how to swim, reflecting on Briony's possible reasons for accusing him.\n\nHis single meeting with Cecilia is the memory that keeps him walking; his only aim is seeing her again. His condition deteriorates over the course of the section: He weakens and becomes delirious, and the text strongly implies that he is dying of his wound. At the end of part two, Robbie falls asleep in Dunkirk, one day before the [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation]] begins.\n\n===Part three===\nRemorseful Briony has refused her place at Cambridge and instead is a trainee nurse in London. She has realised the full extent of her mistake and decides it was Paul Marshall, Leon's friend, whom she saw raping Lola. Briony still writes, although she does not pursue it with the same recklessness as she did as a child.\n\nBriony is called to the bedside of Luc, a young, fatally wounded French soldier. She consoles him in his last moments by speaking with him in her school French, and he mistakes her for an English girl whom his mother wanted him to marry.\n\nJust before his death, Luc asks, \"Do you love me?\" Briony replies, \"Yes,\" not only because \"no other answer was possible\" but also because \"for the moment, she did. He was a lovely boy far away from his family and about to die.\" Afterward, Briony daydreams about the life she might have had if she had married Luc and gone to live with him and his family.\n\nBriony attends the wedding of Paul Marshall and her cousin Lola \u2014  who has decided to \"marry her rapist\" \u2014 before finally visiting Cecilia. Robbie is on leave from the army, and Briony meets him unexpectedly at her sister's.\n\nCecilia and Robbie both refuse to forgive Briony, who nonetheless tells them she will try to put things right. She promises to begin the legal procedures needed to exonerate Robbie, even though Paul Marshall will never be held responsible for his crime because of his marriage to Lola, the victim.\n\n===Postscript===\nThe final section, titled \"London 1999,\" is narrated by Briony herself in the form of a diary entry. Now 77, she is a successful novelist who has recently been diagnosed with [[Multi-infarct dementia|vascular dementia]], so she is facing rapid mental decline and death.\n\nThe reader learns that Briony is the author of the preceding sections of the novel. On the penultimate page, Briony reveals that Robbie Turner died of [[septicaemia]] \u2014 caused by his injury \u2014 on the beaches of Dunkirk, that Cecilia was killed by the bomb that destroyed [[Balham station#Second World War|Balham Underground station]], and Briony never saw them in 1940. Briony did attend Lola's wedding to Marshall, but confesses she was too \"cowardly\" to visit the \"recently bereaved\" Cecilia to make amends. The novel \u2014 which she says is factually true apart from Robbie and Cecilia being reunited \u2014 is her lifelong attempt at \"atonement\" for what she did to them.\n\nBriony justifies her invented happy ending by saying she does not see what purpose it would serve to give readers a \"pitiless\" story. She writes, \"I like to think that it isn't weakness or evasion, but a final act of kindness, a stand against oblivion and despair, to let my lovers live and to unite them at the end.\"\n\n==Main characters==\n* '''Briony Tallis''' \u2013 The younger sister of Leon and Cecilia Tallis, Briony is an aspiring writer. She is a thirteen-year-old at the beginning of the novel and takes part in sending Robbie Turner to jail when she falsely claims that he assaulted Lola. Briony is part narrator, part character and we see her transformation from child to woman as the novel progresses. At the end of the novel, Briony has realised her wrongdoing as a \"child\" and decides to write the novel to find atonement.\n* '''Cecilia Tallis''' \u2013 The middle child in the Tallis family, Cecilia has fallen in love with her childhood companion, Robbie Turner. After a tense encounter by the fountain, she and Robbie don't speak again until they meet before a formal dinner. When Robbie is falsely accused of rape shortly after, Cecilia loses her love to jail and war, and chooses not to contact any members of her family again.\n* '''Leon Tallis''' \u2013 The eldest child in the Tallis family, Leon returns home to visit. He brings his friend Paul Marshall along with him on his trip home.\n* '''Emily Tallis''' \u2013 Emily is the mother of Briony, Cecilia, and Leon. Emily is ill in bed for most of the novel, suffering from severe migraines.\n* '''Jack Tallis''' \u2013 Jack is the father of Briony, Cecilia, and Leon. Jack often works late nights and it is alluded to in the novel that he is having an affair.\n* '''Robbie Turner''' \u2013 Robbie is the son of Grace Turner, who lives on the grounds of the Tallis home. Having grown up with Leon, Briony and Cecilia, he knows the family well. He attended Cambridge University with Cecilia and when they come home on break, they fall in love. Robbie is sent to jail when Briony falsely accuses him of raping Lola.\n* '''Grace Turner''' \u2013 The mother of Robbie Turner, she was given permission from Jack Tallis to live on the grounds. She has become the family's maid and does laundry for the Tallises. When her son is falsely accused of raping Lola, only she and Cecilia believe he is innocent, and Grace chooses to leave the Tallis family.\n* '''Dolores \u2018Lola\u2019 Quincey''' \u2013 A 15-year-old girl who is Briony, Cecilia, and Leon's cousin. She comes, along with her twin brothers, to stay with the Tallises after her parents' divorce. Lola was supposed to assume the main role in Briony's play, until it was cancelled. She is also subject to rape while staying at the Tallis household. Lola appears later in the novel as a mature woman, married to Paul Marshall. She is red-headed and fair-skinned with freckles.\n* '''Jackson and Pierrot Quincey''' \u2013 Lola's younger twin brothers and Briony, Cecilia, and Leon's cousin. They come, along with their sister, to stay with the Tallises after their parents' divorce. Briony wants the twins to take a role in her play, but disputes mean the play is cancelled, upsetting them both. Pierrot appears later in the novel as an old man while his brother has died.\n* '''Danny Hardman''' \u2013 The handyman for the Tallis family. Robbie and Cecilia suspect he is responsible for Lola's rape until Briony tells them otherwise, prompting Robbie to say they owe him an apology.\n* '''Paul Marshall''' \u2013 A friend of Leon. He rapes Lola outside the Tallis household after dark; Briony, however, accuses Robbie of Lola's rape, and many years later Lola and Paul marry. Paul Marshall also owns a chocolate factory that manufactures 'Amo' bars \u2013 fake chocolate energy bars supplied to army troops, which earn him a considerable fortune.\n* '''Corporal Nettle''' \u2013 Nettle is one of Robbie's two companions during the Dunkirk evacuation. In the fourth and final section of the novel, an elderly Briony alludes to an \"old Mr. Nettle\" from whom she received a \"dozen long letters\" but whether this is the same person isn't made exactly clear.\n* '''Corporal Mace''' \u2013 Mace is the second of Robbie's two companions during the Dunkirk evacuation. He is last seen presumably rescuing an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] man from a possible [[lynching]] by some infantrymen under the guise of wanting to do harm by drowning him in the \"bloody sea.\"\n* '''Betty''' \u2013 The Tallis family's servant, described as \"wretched\" in personality.\n\n==References to other literary works==\n''Atonement'' contains [[Intertextuality|intertextual references]] to a number of other literary works, including ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[The Waves]]'', [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'', [[Henry James]]' ''[[The Golden Bowl]]'', [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'', [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Clarissa]]'', [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Lolita]]'', [[Rosamond Lehmann]]'s ''[[Dusty Answer]]'',<ref>The Modernism of Ian McEwan's Atonement\nMFS Modern Fiction Studies \u2013 Volume 56, Number 3, Fall 2010, pp. 473\u2013495</ref> and [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[Hamlet]],'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]''.

As [[Duke of Calabria]] he was a patron of Renaissance poets and builders during his tenure as the heir to the throne of Naples.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Naples, Italy|Naples]], Alfonso was the eldest child of [[Ferdinand I of Naples]] by his first wife, [[Isabella of Clermont]]. She was the daughter of [[Tristan de Clermont|Tristan]], Count of [[Copertino]] and [[Catherine of Taranto, Countess of Copertino|Caterina Del Balzo Orsini]]. Alfonso was the cousin of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], king of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and husband of [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella of Castile]]. Alfonso's teacher was the humanist [[Giovanni Pontano]], whose ''De splendore'' describes the proper virtues and manner of life becoming to a prince.\n\nIn 1463, when Alfonso was fifteen, his great-uncle [[Giovanni Antonio del Balzo Orsini]], [[Principality of Taranto|Prince of Taranto]], died, and he obtained some lands from the inheritance. When his mother Isabella of Clermont died in 1465, he succeeded to her feudal claims, which included the [[John of Brienne|Brienne claim]] to the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nAs a [[Condottieri|condottiero]], Alfonso fought in the most important wars of the age, such the war following the [[Pazzi Conspiracy#The conspiracy|Pazzi Conspiracy]] (1478\u20131480) and the [[War of Ferrara]] (1482\u20131484). Alfonso had shown himself a skilled and determined soldier, helping his father in the suppression of the Conspiracy of the Barons (1485) and in the defense of the Kingdom's territory against the [[Papal States|Papal]] claims.\n\nWhen his father died, the kingdom's finances were exhausted and the invasion of King [[Charles VIII of France]] was imminent;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ub_XZK1F-8UC&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=Alfonso+II+of+Naples&source=bl&ots=ZRDxRAM2lX&sig=ACfU3U0mAhUOzFAohdNlYtXlHhYziGM6UA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJicmCkN_mAhUnUt8KHRo0AxI4KBDoATAMegQIChAB#v=onepage&q=Alfonso%20II%20of%20Naples&f=false Atlas, Allan W., ''Music at the Aragonese Court of Naples'', Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 5] {{ISBN|9780521088305}}</ref> Charles, (instigated by [[Lodovico Sforza]], who wished to stir up trouble to allow him to seize power in [[Milan]]), had decided to reassert the [[House of Valois-Anjou|Angevin]] claim to Naples and the accompanying title of [[King of Jerusalem]].\n\nCharles invaded Italy in September, 1494. Alfonso managed to regain the support of Pope [[Alexander VI]], who invited Charles to devote his effort against the Turks instead. Alfonso received the official Papal coronation as ''Rex Siciliae'' on May 8, 1494 from [[Juan de Borja Lanzol de Roman\u00ed, el mayor]], previously the [[papal legate]] to Alfonso II.\n\nHowever, the King of France did not relent; by early 1495 Charles was approaching [[Naples]], after having defeated Florence and the Neapolitan fleet under Alfonso's brother, [[Frederick IV of Naples|Frederick of Calabria]] at [[Porto Venere]].

He died in [[Messina]] later that year. It had been 237 days since his coronation.\n\n==Renaissance culture==\nAs Crown Prince, Alfonso had participated in the brilliant Renaissance culture that surrounded his father's court. His lasting contribution to European culture was the example set at his villas of ''La Duchesca'' and especially ''Poggio Reale'' just outside Naples, which so captivated [[Charles VIII of France]] during his brief sojourn at Naples during February\u2013June 1495, that he was inspired to emulation of the \"earthly paradise\" he encountered.<ref>Charles' letter to his brother-in-law, Pierre de Bourbon, noted in William Howard Adams, ''The French Garden 1500-1800'' 1979, p 10.</ref>\n\n[[Poggio Reale (villa)|Poggio Reale]], which [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] said was designed by [[Giuliano da Maiano]] and which was laid out in the 1480s, has utterly disappeared and no extensive description has survived. Decades later, Vasari reported, \"At Poggio Reale [Giuliano da Maiano] laid out the architecture of that palazzo, always considered a most beautiful thing; and to fresco it he brought there [[Pietro del Donzello]], a Florentine, and [[Ippolito del Donzello|Polito]] his brother who was considered in that time a good master, who painted the whole palazzo, inside and out, with the history of the said king.\"<ref>\"A Poggio Reale ordin\u00f2 l'architettura di quel palazzo, tenuta sempre cosa bellissima; et a dipignerlo vi condusse Piero del Donzello fiorentino e Polito suo fratello che in quel tempo era tenuto buon maestro, il quale dipinse tutto il palazzo di dentro e di fuori con storie di detto re.\" (Giorgio Vasari, Le vie de' pi\u00f9 eccelenti architetti, piiori...'').</ref> There are no archives to connect Giuliano or his brother Benedetto with the project; for documentation only a section and plan, reproduced with apologies for its inaccuracy, by [[Sebastiano Serlio]].

Decades later, Vasari reported, \"At Poggio Reale [Giuliano da Maiano] laid out the architecture of that palazzo, always considered a most beautiful thing; and to fresco it he brought there [[Pietro del Donzello]], a Florentine, and [[Ippolito del Donzello|Polito]] his brother who was considered in that time a good master, who painted the whole palazzo, inside and out, with the history of the said king.\"<ref>\"A Poggio Reale ordin\u00f2 l'architettura di quel palazzo, tenuta sempre cosa bellissima; et a dipignerlo vi condusse Piero del Donzello fiorentino e Polito suo fratello che in quel tempo era tenuto buon maestro, il quale dipinse tutto il palazzo di dentro e di fuori con storie di detto re.\" (Giorgio Vasari, Le vie de' pi\u00f9 eccelenti architetti, piiori...'').</ref> There are no archives to connect Giuliano or his brother Benedetto with the project; for documentation only a section and plan, reproduced with apologies for its inaccuracy, by [[Sebastiano Serlio]].

His first wife was [[Ippolita Maria Sforza]], whom he married on 10 October 1465 in [[Milan]].{{sfn|Fallows|2010|p=39}} His mistress, by whom he also had children, was Trogia Gazzela.\n\nHe had three children with Ippolita:\n* King [[Ferdinand II of Naples]] (26 August 1469 \u2013 October 1496), married [[Joanna of Naples (1478-1518)|Joanna of Naples]] \n* [[Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan|Isabella of Aragon]], Duchess of Milan and of Bari, Princess of Rossano (2&nbsp;October 1470 \u2013 11&nbsp;February 1524), married her first cousin [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]], Duke of Milan, January 1490.{{sfn|Black|2009|p=83}}\n* Piero, Prince of Rossano (31&nbsp;March 1472 \u2013 17&nbsp;February 1491), Lieutenant General of Apulia, died of an infection following leg surgery.\nAnd two with Trogia :\n* [[Sancia of Aragon]] (born 1478 in [[Gaeta]])\n* [[Alfonso of Aragon (1481\u20131500)|Alfonso]], Duke of Bisceglie and Prince of [[Salerno]] (born 1481, in Naples)\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Some have claimed that such themes have indeed recurred in 'Bella and the Bulldogs', ranging from the romantic relationship between the two main characters \"Bella\" and \"Troy\" consisting of a black male and white female, to the symbolism and terms used throughout the Nickelodeon show having overlap with terms used in the cuckolding fetish, like \"bull\" (symbolizing the man who performs the sex act), and practices like blindfolding<ref>https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6tjm2l</ref> and the usage of keys (both also extensively used in Butler's previous work<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPSNfKnJnSQ</ref>).<ref>http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--eohvCJXA--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1332345218058172820.jpg</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|3596178}}\n\n{{Former Nickelodeon original series}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2010s Nickelodeon shows]]\n[[Category:2015 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2016 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American sports television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Texas]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| image                = Bellaandthebulldogslogo.png\n| genre                = [[Comedy]]\n| creator              = Jonathan Butler & Gabriel Garza\n| starring             = {{plainlist |\n* [[Brec Bassinger]]\n* [[Coy Stewart]]\n* Jackie Radinsky\n* [[Buddy Handleson]]\n* [[Lilimar]]\n* [[Haley Tju]]\n* [[Rio Mangini]]\n}}\n| composer             = [[Ron Wasserman]]\n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| num_seasons          = 2\n| num_episodes         = 39\n| list_episodes        = List of Bella and the Bulldogs episodes\n| executive_producer   = [[Jeff Bushell]]\n| producer             = Chris Phillips\n| camera               = [[Multi-camera]]\n| runtime              = 22 minutes\n| company              = [[Nickelodeon Productions]]\n| network              = [[Nickelodeon]]\n| picture_format       = [[HDTV]] [[720p]]\n| audio_format         = [[5.1 surround sound]]\n| first_aired          = {{Start date|2015|1|17}}\n| last_aired           = {{End date|2016|6|25}}\n| website              = \n}}\n\n'''''Bella and the Bulldogs''''' is an American [[comedy]] television series created by Jonathan Butler and Gabriel Garza that aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from January 17, 2015 to June 25, 2016.
