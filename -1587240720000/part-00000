Its route is {{Convert|1.5|mi|km}} in length and encircles most of the park, with [[train station]]s in three different park areas. The rail line, constructed by [[Walt Disney Imagineering|WED Enterprises]], operates with four historic steam locomotives originally built by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the WDWRR's [[main line (railway)|main line]] loop. On a typical day, the railroad has two trains in operation; on busy days, it has three trains.\n\nThe WDWRR's development was led by [[Roger E. Broggie]], who also oversaw the construction of the [[Disneyland Railroad]] in [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. The attraction's locomotives were acquired from the [[Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucat\u00e1n]], a narrow-gauge railroad system in Mexico. After being shipped to the United States, they were altered to resemble locomotives built in the 1880s and restored to operating condition. Each locomotive was also given a set of passenger cars, which were built from scratch.\n\nThe WDWRR opened to the public for the first time on October 1, 1971, the same day that the Magic Kingdom park opened. Since then, the WDWRR has become one of the world's most popular steam-powered railroads, with about 3.7 million passengers each year. The WDWRR closed temporarily on December 3, 2018, due to the construction of the [[Tron Lightcycle Power Run|Tron Lightcycle Run]] [[roller coaster]] attraction near the [[Tomorrowland#Magic Kingdom|Tomorrowland]] section.\n\n==History==\n===Discovery in Mexico===\n[[File:F.C.

Best]] who informed him that locomotives could be obtained at a railroad boneyard in [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n]], Mexico, owned by the Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucat\u00e1n.<ref

[[Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works]], which was in front of the railroad company's headquarters.<ref name=\"Broggie2014pp320\u2013323\"/>\n\nBroggie paid a total of [[United States

Its route is {{Convert|1.5|mi|km}} in length and encircles most of the park, with [[train station]]s in three different park areas. The rail line, constructed by [[Walt Disney Imagineering|WED Enterprises]], operates with four historic steam locomotives originally built by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the WDWRR's [[main line (railway)|main line]] loop. On a typical day, the railroad has two trains in operation; on busy days, it has three trains.\n\nThe WDWRR's development was led by [[Roger E. Broggie]], who also oversaw the construction of the [[Disneyland Railroad]] in [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. The attraction's locomotives were acquired from the [[Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucat\u00e1n]], a narrow-gauge railroad system in Mexico. After being shipped to the United States, they were altered to resemble locomotives built in the 1880s and restored to operating condition. Each locomotive was also given a set of passenger cars, which were built from scratch.\n\nThe WDWRR opened to the public for the first time on October 1, 1971, the same day that the Magic Kingdom park opened. Since then, the WDWRR has become one of the world's most popular steam-powered railroads, with about 3.7 million passengers each year. The WDWRR closed temporarily on December 3, 2018, due to the construction of the [[Tron Lightcycle Power Run|Tron Lightcycle Run]] [[roller coaster]] attraction near the [[Tomorrowland#Magic Kingdom|Tomorrowland]] section.\n\n==History==\n===Discovery in Mexico===\n[[File:F.C.

[[Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works]], which was in front of the railroad company's headquarters.<ref name=\"Broggie2014pp320\u2013323\"/>\n\nBroggie paid a total of [[United States

the locomotives appear as if they were built in the 1880s.<ref name=\"Leaphart2016pp104\u2013106\"/> The original, dilapidated [[fire-tube boiler#Locomotive boiler|boilers]] of the four locomotives

A CRELP or CRECD with the same number refers to the same album, even though not all albums have releases in both formats, leading to apparent gaps in the series, as opposed to the actual gaps where

It is also known as '''Lower Canal''', '''Boothtown Aqueduct''', '''Inverted Syphon''', '''Aqueduct Valve House No 1 & 2 and Culvert''', '''Covered Way''', '''Smithfield Tanks''' and '''Sedimentation Channel'''. The property is [[Crown land]] and is administered by the [[New South Wales Department of Industry, Skills and Regional Infrastructure Development|Department of Industry, Skills and Regional Infrastructure Development]], a [[government department|department]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 30 June 2015.<ref name=nswshr-1945>{{cite NSW SHR|5055898|Lower Prospect Canal Reserve|hr=01945|fn=EF14/11245; H98/74-003|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the 1860s following droughts and population expansion, the need for a larger and more reliable water source was required for Sydney. A Special Commission, in 1869, recommended construction of the [[Upper Nepean Scheme]]. The proposal was approved in 1877 and work commenced in 1880. The canal was originally a dry-stone [[masonry]] construction in 1888. From 1902\u201312 it was largely reconstructed and relined to decrease outflow and increase capacity and stability. A part of the canal known as the ''Covered Way'', located at the base of [[Prospect Hill (New South Wales)|Prospect Hill]] near Hyland Road Greystanes, collapsed in 1904 and was reconstructed in 1905. The ''Covered Way'' is a basined component of the canal that protected the [[water supply]] from [[water contamination|contamination]] that may have entered the canal due to the steepness and proximity of Prospect Hill.<ref name=envbtown/>\n\nBy the late 1980s, the Lower Canal was incapable of keeping up with the growing need for water from Sydney's large population. At its peak capacity, following alterations, it could still carry only 100 million gallons per day. In addition to that, increasing standards of [[water quality]] and security of supply were rising up against the urban development that was encroaching on the setting of the open water Lower Canal.\n\nThe Upper Nepean Scheme saw water from the Upper Nepean, Avon, Cordeaux and Cataract Rivers channelled via tunnel, pipes and open canal to Prospect Reservoir. From Prospect Reservoir the water supply moved through an open canal known as the Lower Prospect Canal along the corridor now known as the Lower Prospect Canal Reserve. That use came to an end in May 1995, when the Lower Canal was [[Drainage|drained]] and replaced by an underground [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] from Prospect Reservoir to Pipehead, thus leaving the community with the chance to gain a spectacular parcel of land for recreational purposes. The pipeline increased the dependability, water quality and amount of water flow from Prospect to Pipehead.\n\nThe Lower Canal was made into a public reserve in 1998 which follows the course of the former canal. The reserve has survived the intense urban development that surrounds it, due to its use, for over 100 years, as part of the water supply system for Sydney. August 2003 saw the reserve opened to the community with a [[cycleway]]\u2013walkway running its full length and connecting with other cycleways that extend across a great part of the Sydney metropolitan area.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lowerprospect.jpg|thumb|230px|The pedestrian cycleway.]]\nThe reserve is just over 6.6&nbsp;km long, starting from Reconciliation Road, [[Pemulwuy, New South Wales|Pemulwuy]], passing through the suburbs of Greystanes, [[Smithfield, New South Wales|Smithfield]], [[Merrylands, New South Wales|Merrylands]] and [[Woodpark, New South Wales|Woodpark]], to its endpoint at Pipehead, Guildford. The Lower Canal snakes its way on the edge of a natural ridge from the western part slowly falling to an artificial constructed [[Embankment dam|embankment]] at the eastern end.\n\nThe elevation of the western end of the canal is approximately 60-70m above sea level, falling to 40m. Three roads with bridges transverse over the Lower Canal: Gipps Road, [[Cumberland Highway]] and Sherwood Road. [[Medium-density housing]] borders the reserve to the north and south with light industry located to the south near Smithfield. The canal is now surrounded on both sides by managed [[nature reserve]]s.\n\n''Canal Road Park'', located on the western outskirts of Greystanes, near [[Merrylands West]], is on an elevated ridge, which provides panoramic views of southwestern Sydney. It also features a children's [[playground]], [[BBQ]] area and [[picnic shelter]]s.<ref>Lower Canal\u2014Prospect. Proposed Transitway Intersection, Godden Mackay Logan, 2002</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Boothtownwaterbridge.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Boothtown Aqueduct]], which was used to transport water through the canal from 1888 to 1907.]]\nThe canal was an open [[gravity]] flow with a gradient of approximately {{convert|10|cm}} per km over its length. The upper width varied between {{convert|5.8|and|7.25|m}} and its depth between 2.4 and 3m. About {{convert|1|km|spell=on}} east of the start of the canal, at Prospect Reservoir, the Lower Canal was diverted underground for {{convert|288|m}}. This was designed so to protect the canal water from contamination by the slope of [[Prospect Hill (New South Wales)|Prospect Hill]] through which it was cut. The [[valve]] house at the head of the canal at Prospect Reservoir have inlet pipes, which allowed water to pass from the reservoir into the canal to start its journey to Pipehead. The inlet pipe flow was controlled by a set of valves housed within the valve house adjacent to the receiving basin.\n\nInlet pipes in the base of the receiving basin allowed water to pass from the reservoir into the canal to start its journey to Pipehead. The inlet pipe flow was controlled by a set of valves housed within the valve house adjacent to the receiving basin. At the farthest point of the canal, prior to it entering Pipehead, there are two [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] chambers and a central bypass which were used to trap sediment from the water before it entered the Pipehead pumphouse. On the south side of the canal, adjacent to Percival Road, there are two in-ground tanks, the first built in 1895, that were used to supply [[Smithfield, New South Wales|Smithfield]] with water. Today, these tanks have been unheeded and are hard to situate due to overgrowth. The upper {{convert|150|mm}} of canal wall was left open so visitors can observe the canal's path and to stipulate a clear view between the bushland and the retained sod that is used between the concrete cycleway and the canal walls.<ref>Archival Record & SOHI, Lower Canal, Prospect to Pipehad (Part of Upper Nepean Scheme) Vol 1 History, Description & Statement of Significance, Edward Higginbotham, 2000</ref>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe following modifications were made to the structure:<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n*1895{{spaced endash}}Smithfield Tanks (reservoir) constructed for water supply for Smithfield\n*1902\u201312{{spaced endash}}Relining of the canal with Monier plates or concrete to increase the capacity of the Lower Canal by around 75%; walls of Smithfield Tank raised\n*1903{{spaced endash}}Sedimentation Chambers constructed west of Pipehead\n*1905{{spaced endash}}Rebuilding of the Covered Way in concrete following its collapse\n*1907{{spaced endash}}Boothtown Aqueduct ceases operation.

The Lower Canal is state significant for its reuse, through reversible infilling along its entire length, that has retained the legibility in the landscape of its original water supply function which is capable of further enhancement through interpretation. Large sections of the Lower Prospect Canal Reserve are identified within the biodiversity map of Holroyd Local Environmental Plan (LEP) 2013 as containing \"Remnant Native Vegetation\". The biodiversity map was created using data from the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|National Parks and Wildlife Service]] mapping of \"Vegetation of the [[Cumberland Plain]]\".

The NSW Board of Water Supply and Sewerage was constituted to be the managing authority of the Upper Nepean Scheme and was responsible for the design and construction of the Lower Canal. The Lower Canal is of state significance for its association with Edward Orpen Moriarty, Engineer in Chief for Harbours and River Navigation, NSW Department of Public Works as the designer and overseer of the Upper Nepean Scheme. Moriarty is a state significant person in the provision of water supply in NSW. He had previously controlled the building of water supply schemes for [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Wollongong]], [[Albury]], [[Wagga Wagga]] and Hunter Valley towns and served as a Commissioner on the 1867 Royal Commission into Sydney's water supply.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Lower Canal has state significance for its technical values. It has the capacity to demonstrate techniques of canal building (often at extremely small grades); engineering practices (especially in the period 1888\u20131912) and land surveying, all largely within an era of horse and manpower. It is an excellent example of the techniques of 19th century hydraulic engineering, particularly the use of gravity directed water flow to supply a large area of Sydney with water. Hydraulic canal building largely ceased world-wide in the 20th century, in favour of pressure pipeline technologies. It is one of the earliest examples in NSW of the large-scale application of precast reinforced concrete construction.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\nThe Lower Canal contains a wide range of individual features including an infilled open canal, an aqueduct, an inverted syphon, reservoirs, bridges, sedimentation chambers, pre-cast reinforced concrete panels; culverts, flumes, scour valves and other elements which individually and collectively demonstrate the technologies and engineering approaches in use in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in NSW. All infrastructure associated with the Lower Canal has been identified and assessed in the Heritage Study of the Upper Canal, Prospect Reservoir & Lower Canal (Upper Nepean Scheme) 1992. This study found a majority of components were of potential state significance. The Lower Canal is state significant for its landmark qualities and reuse (through reversible infilling along its entire length) that retains its capacity to demonstrate its original water supply function. Retention of the Lower Canal's concrete edges along its entire length, together with large sections of only partially filled canal and the associated canal infrastructure, has enabled retention of the Lower Canal's capacity to demonstrate its original water supply function, and its part in the Upper Nepean System as an entity.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe item is not considered to be of state significance under this criterion.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Lower Canal has research potential at state level for the detailed and varied evidence of its various engineering construction techniques. These include its original masonry construction retained beneath its concrete lining upgrade; some of the earliest large-scale applications of pre-cast reinforced concrete construction, and late 19th century hydraulic construction techniques typical of state of the art technology of the time. Retention of the associated structures (Sedimentation Chambers, Smithfield Tank, Inverted Syphon and Covered Way) through reversible infilling provides research potential for further investigation of the construction techniques of these structures.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Lower Canal has state significance as a key component of a rare and extensive water supply system in NSW. It was one of only two such open water supply canals in Australia; the other being the Upper Canal within the same Upper Nepean Scheme. As the only component of that scheme that is currently decommissioned in its entirety, coupled with its urban location and public accessibility, the Lower Canal has a rare interpretative capacity for its role as an element in the overall Upper Nepean Scheme.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Lower Canal has state significance for its representative values of the principal characteristics of an extensive, engineered and enduring urban water supply system with the capacity for modification over time.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Water}}}}\n*[[Prospect Hill (New South Wales)|Prospect Hill]]\n* [[Upper Nepean Scheme]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|last=Powell|first=Alan|date=1974|title=Moriarty, Edward Orpen (1825\u20131896)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/moriarty-edward-orpen-4437}}\n* {{cite book|author=Alison Mills, in \"The Parramatta Sun\"|date=2009|title=Bridge 'needed now'}}\n* {{cite book|author=E Higginbotham, T Kass, V Murphy, J Collocott, T Fiander, S Lavelle|date=1992|title=Heritage Study Upper Canal, Prospect Reservoir, Lower Canal (Upper Nepean Scheme) Vols 1, 2 & 3}}\n* {{cite book|last=Higginbotham|first=Edward|date=2000|title=Archival Record & SOHI, Lower Canal, Prospect to Pipehad (Part of Upper Nepean Scheme) Vol 1 History, Description & Statement of Significance}}\n* {{cite book|author=Environmental Resources Management|date=2008|title=Lower Prospect canal s60 excavation : archaeological excavation report}}\n* {{cite book|author=Futurepast Heritage Consulting|date=2012|title=Lower Canal at Pipehead: Conservation Management Strategy}}\n* {{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan|date=2002|title=Lower Canal\u2014Prospect.

It is also known as '''Lower Canal''', '''Boothtown Aqueduct''', '''Inverted Syphon''', '''Aqueduct Valve House No 1 & 2 and Culvert''', '''Covered Way''', '''Smithfield Tanks''' and '''Sedimentation Channel'''. The property is [[Crown land]] and is administered by the [[New South Wales Department of Industry, Skills and Regional Infrastructure Development|Department of Industry, Skills and Regional Infrastructure Development]], a [[government department|department]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 30 June 2015.<ref name=nswshr-1945>{{cite NSW SHR|5055898|Lower Prospect Canal Reserve|hr=01945|fn=EF14/11245; H98/74-003|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the 1860s following droughts and population expansion, the need for a larger and more reliable water source was required for Sydney. A Special Commission, in 1869, recommended construction of the [[Upper Nepean Scheme]]. The proposal was approved in 1877 and work commenced in 1880. The canal was originally a dry-stone [[masonry]] construction in 1888. From 1902-12 it was largely reconstructed and relined to decrease outflow and increase capacity and stability. A part of the canal known as the ''Covered Way'', located at the base of [[Prospect Hill (New South Wales)|Prospect Hill]] near Hyland Road Greystanes, collapsed in 1904 and was reconstructed in 1905. The ''Covered Way'' is a basined component of the canal that protected the [[water supply]] from [[water contamination|contamination]] that may have entered the canal due to the steepness and proximity of Prospect Hill.<ref name=envbtown/>\n\nBy the late 1980s, the Lower Canal was incapable of keeping up with the growing need for water from Sydney's large population. At its peak capacity, following alterations, it could still carry only 100 million gallons per day. In addition to that, increasing standards of [[water quality]] and security of supply were rising up against the urban development that was encroaching on the setting of the open water Lower Canal.\n\nThe Upper Nepean Scheme saw water from the Upper Nepean, Avon, Cordeaux and Cataract Rivers channelled via tunnel, pipes and open canal to Prospect Reservoir. From Prospect Reservoir the water supply moved through an open canal known as the Lower Prospect Canal along the corridor now known as the Lower Prospect Canal Reserve. That use came to an end in May 1995, when the Lower Canal was [[Drainage|drained]] and replaced by an underground [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] from Prospect Reservoir to Pipehead, thus leaving the community with the chance to gain a spectacular parcel of land for recreational purposes. The pipeline increased the dependability, water quality and amount of water flow from Prospect to Pipehead.\n\nThe Lower Canal was made into a public reserve in 1998 which follows the course of the former canal. The reserve has survived the intense urban development that surrounds it, due to its use, for over 100 years, as part of the water supply system for Sydney. August 2003 saw the reserve opened to the community with a [[cycleway]]\u2013walkway running its full length and connecting with other cycleways that extend across a great part of the Sydney metropolitan area.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lowerprospect.jpg|thumb|230px|The pedestrian cycleway.]]\nThe reserve is just over 6.6&nbsp;km long, starting from Reconciliation Road, [[Pemulwuy, New South Wales|Pemulwuy]], passing through the suburbs of Greystanes, [[Smithfield, New South Wales|Smithfield]], [[Merrylands, New South Wales|Merrylands]] and [[Woodpark, New South Wales|Woodpark]], to its endpoint at Pipehead, Guildford. The Lower Canal snakes its way on the edge of a natural ridge from the western part slowly falling to an artificial constructed [[Embankment dam|embankment]] at the eastern end.\n\nThe elevation of the western end of the canal is approximately 60-70m above sea level, falling to 40m. Three roads with bridges transverse over the Lower Canal: Gipps Road, [[Cumberland Highway]] and Sherwood Road. [[Medium-density housing]] borders the reserve to the north and south with light industry located to the south near Smithfield. The canal is now surrounded on both sides by managed [[nature reserve]]s.\n\n''Canal Road Park'', located on the western outskirts of Greystanes, near [[Merrylands West]], is on an elevated ridge, which provides panoramic views of southwestern Sydney. It also features a children's [[playground]], [[BBQ]] area and [[picnic shelter]]s.<ref>Lower Canal--Prospect. Proposed Transitway Intersection, Godden Mackay Logan, 2002</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Boothtownwaterbridge.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Boothtown Aqueduct]], which was used to transport water through the canal from 1888 to 1907.]]\nThe canal was an open [[gravity]] flow with a gradient of approximately {{convert|10|cm}} per km over its length. The upper width varied between {{convert|5.8|and|7.25|m}} and its depth between 2.4 and 3m. About {{convert|1|km|spell=on}} east of the start of the canal, at Prospect Reservoir, the Lower Canal was diverted underground for {{convert|288|m}}. This was designed so to protect the canal water from contamination by the slope of [[Prospect Hill (New South Wales)|Prospect Hill]] through which it was cut. The [[valve]] house at the head of the canal at Prospect Reservoir have inlet pipes, which allowed water to pass from the reservoir into the canal to start its journey to Pipehead. The inlet pipe flow was controlled by a set of valves housed within the valve house adjacent to the receiving basin.\n\nInlet pipes in the base of the receiving basin allowed water to pass from the reservoir into the canal to start its journey to Pipehead. The inlet pipe flow was controlled by a set of valves housed within the valve house adjacent to the receiving basin. At the farthest point of the canal, prior to it entering Pipehead, there are two [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] chambers and a central bypass which were used to trap sediment from the water before it entered the Pipehead pumphouse. On the south side of the canal, adjacent to Percival Road, there are two in-ground tanks, the first built in 1895, that were used to supply [[Smithfield, New South Wales|Smithfield]] with water. Today, these tanks have been unheeded and are hard to situate due to overgrowth. The upper {{convert|150|mm}} of canal wall was left open so visitors can observe the canal's path and to stipulate a clear view between the bushland and the retained sod that is used between the concrete cycleway and the canal walls.<ref>Archival Record & SOHI, Lower Canal, Prospect to Pipehad (Part of Upper Nepean Scheme) Vol 1 History, Description & Statement of Significance, Edward Higginbotham, 2000</ref>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe following modifications were made to the structure:<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n*1895{{spaced endash}}Smithfield Tanks (reservoir) constructed for water supply for Smithfield\n*1902\u201312{{spaced endash}}Relining of the canal with Monier plates or concrete to increase the capacity of the Lower Canal by around 75%; walls of Smithfield Tank raised\n*1903{{spaced endash}}Sedimentation Chambers constructed west of Pipehead\n*1905{{spaced endash}}Rebuilding of the Covered Way in concrete following its collapse\n*1907{{spaced endash}}Boothtown Aqueduct ceases operation.

The NSW Board of Water Supply and Sewerage was constituted to be the managing authority of the Upper Nepean Scheme and was responsible for the design and construction of the Lower Canal. The Lower Canal is of state significance for its association with Edward Orpen Moriarty, Engineer in Chief for Harbours and River Navigation, NSW Department of Public Works as the designer and overseer of the Upper Nepean Scheme. Moriarty is a state significant person in the provision of water supply in NSW. He had previously controlled the building of water supply schemes for [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Wollongong]], [[Albury]], [[Wagga Wagga]] and Hunter Valley towns and served as a Commissioner on the 1867 Royal Commission into Sydney's water supply.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Lower Canal has state significance for its technical values. It has the capacity to demonstrate techniques of canal building (often at extremely small grades); engineering practices (especially in the period 1888-1912) and land surveying, all largely within an era of horse and manpower. It is an excellent example of the techniques of 19th century hydraulic engineering, particularly the use of gravity directed water flow to supply a large area of Sydney with water. Hydraulic canal building largely ceased world-wide in the 20th century, in favour of pressure pipeline technologies. It is one of the earliest examples in NSW of the large-scale application of precast reinforced concrete construction.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\nThe Lower Canal contains a wide range of individual features including an infilled open canal, an aqueduct, an inverted syphon, reservoirs, bridges, sedimentation chambers, pre-cast reinforced concrete panels; culverts, flumes, scour valves and other elements which individually and collectively demonstrate the technologies and engineering approaches in use in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in NSW. All infrastructure associated with the Lower Canal has been identified and assessed in the Heritage Study of the Upper Canal, Prospect Reservoir & Lower Canal (Upper Nepean Scheme) 1992. This study found a majority of components were of potential state significance. The Lower Canal is state significant for its landmark qualities and reuse (through reversible infilling along its entire length) that retains its capacity to demonstrate its original water supply function. Retention of the Lower Canal's concrete edges along its entire length, together with large sections of only partially filled canal and the associated canal infrastructure, has enabled retention of the Lower Canal's capacity to demonstrate its original water supply function, and its part in the Upper Nepean System as an entity.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe item is not considered to be of state significance under this criterion.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Lower Canal has research potential at state level for the detailed and varied evidence of its various engineering construction techniques. These include its original masonry construction retained beneath its concrete lining upgrade; some of the earliest large-scale applications of pre-cast reinforced concrete construction, and late 19th century hydraulic construction techniques typical of state of the art technology of the time. Retention of the associated structures (Sedimentation Chambers, Smithfield Tank, Inverted Syphon and Covered Way) through reversible infilling provides research potential for further investigation of the construction techniques of these structures.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Lower Canal has state significance as a key component of a rare and extensive water supply system in NSW. It was one of only two such open water supply canals in Australia; the other being the Upper Canal within the same Upper Nepean Scheme. As the only component of that scheme that is currently decommissioned in its entirety, coupled with its urban location and public accessibility, the Lower Canal has a rare interpretative capacity for its role as an element in the overall Upper Nepean Scheme.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Lower Canal has state significance for its representative values of the principal characteristics of an extensive, engineered and enduring urban water supply system with the capacity for modification over time.<ref name=nswshr-1945/>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Water}}}}\n*[[Prospect Hill (New South Wales)|Prospect Hill]]\n* [[Upper Nepean Scheme]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|last=Powell|first=Alan|date=1974|title=Moriarty, Edward Orpen (1825\u20131896)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/moriarty-edward-orpen-4437}}\n* {{cite book|author=Alison Mills, in \"The Parramatta Sun\"|date=2009|title=Bridge 'needed now'}}\n* {{cite book|author=E Higginbotham, T Kass, V Murphy, J Collocott, T Fiander, S Lavelle|date=1992|title=Heritage Study Upper Canal, Prospect Reservoir, Lower Canal (Upper Nepean Scheme) Vols 1, 2 & 3}}\n* {{cite book|last=Higginbotham|first=Edward|date=2000|title=Archival Record & SOHI, Lower Canal, Prospect to Pipehad (Part of Upper Nepean Scheme) Vol 1 History, Description & Statement of Significance}}\n* {{cite book|author=Environmental Resources Management|date=2008|title=Lower Prospect canal s60 excavation : archaeological excavation report}}\n* {{cite book|author=Futurepast Heritage Consulting|date=2012|title=Lower Canal at Pipehead: Conservation Management Strategy}}\n* {{cite book|author=Godden Mackay Logan|date=2002|title=Lower Canal--Prospect.

She and her husbands [[Ned Lyons]] and Billy Burke were among the most sought-after career criminals in the U.S. and Canada, being wanted in several major cities including [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], [[Detroit]] and [[Montreal]] from the 1860s until the turn of the 20th century.\n\nShe and Lyons were prominent underworld figures in [[New York City]] during the post-[[American Civil War]] era as associates of [[Marm Mandelbaum]], Lyons being a member of Mandelbaum's \"inner circle\" during the 1860s and 1870s.<ref>[[Herbert Asbury|Asbury, Herbert]].

Her mother, [[Baltimore]] shoplifter Sophie Elkins,<ref>La Fountaine, George. ''The Scott-Dunlap Ring''. New York: Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1978. (pg. 113)</ref> was a \"keeper of a [[disorderly house]]\" on New York's [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]], and supposedly forced her out into the street to steal.

During her youth, she became known as a skilled pickpocket and confidence woman. She was considered a consummate actress who, even when caught by her victim, was able to \"counterfeit every shade of emotion\" to persuade them to release her.<ref name=\"Houdini\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/rightwaytodowro00conggoog |last=Houdini |first=Harry |author-link=Harry Houdini |title=The Right Way to Do Wrong: An Expos\u00e9 of Successful Criminals |location=Boston |publisher=Harry Houdini |year=1906 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rightwaytodowro00conggoog/page/n81 75]\u201376 |access-date=2020-03-12 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref> According to one incident in 1880, she was able to convince a store detective that she suffered from [[kleptomania]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDHADgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA264&pg=PA264 |last=Abelson |first=Elaine S. |title=When Ladies Go A-thieving: Middle-class Shoplifters in the Victorian Department Store |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1989 |page=264 |isbn=0-19-507142-5 |access-date=2020-03-12 |via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nLyons eventually married [[Ned Lyons]], known then as the \"King of the Bank Robbers\", and they had three children together. Two years after their marriage, Ned was able to purchase a villa on [[Long Island]] from his share in a major bank robbery. Although he tried to discourage Lyons from pickpocketing, she continued to do so and eventually both were imprisoned. Soon after Ned's escape from prison in 1872, he returned to New York to help Lyons escape from prison by using a disguise to infiltrate [[Sing Sing]] and break through the wall of her jail cell. They escaped to [[Paris]], where Lyons lived under the name Madame d'Varney and the two continued their criminal activities.<ref name=\"Houdini\"/>\n\n===Court battle with George Lyons===\nOn the afternoon of January 31, 1880, Lyons returned to the Essex Market police court where she brought her youngest son, 14-year-old George, before the [[magistrate]]. She claimed he refused to attend school, often left home at nights to sleep in the streets and \"was so generally unruly\" that she requested that he be put in a juvenile [[correctional facility]].\n\nAfter she had finished, George shouted, \"That woman is a thief and a shoplifter. I have seen her steal in [[Montreal]] and elsewhere.\" He denied his mother's charges, claiming she wanted to get rid of him, and that he had \"recommendations showing his good character\". He went on to make further criminal charges against his mother, continuing, \"Yes, you want to get rid of me, and you're my mother. How can I tell you are when you have two husbands with whom you go all over the country, stealing everywhere?\" These accusations caused a disturbance in the court room and the magistrate called for a [[Recess (break)|recess]] to listen to both mother and son in private.<ref name=\"Article\"/>\n\nLyons confessed to her criminal past and being the wife of Ned, however she maintained that she had spent considerable time and effort trying to keep her children from becoming criminals. She had sent George to three colleges in Canada, and her two daughters attended schools in Germany,<ref name=\"Houdini\"/> but George returned to New York and began frequenting underworld resorts, including [[Dan Kerrigan]]'s infamous [[6th Street (Manhattan)|Sixth Street]] saloon, where he performed as a singer and associated with known criminals. She also said that her son had obtained at least one of his recommendations by threatening a former employer by the name of Kate B. Woodward with a carving knife.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAfter hearing of this incident, Lyons invited George to her home on [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Montgomery Street]] and had him arrested by waiting police officers. George admitted that he had an argument with Woodward, who had withheld his [[pocket watch]], but denied intimidating her to obtaining his recommendation. He did admit to picking up a carving knife during the argument, but did not use it towards her or use threatening language. He was reportedly disruptive while his mother made her statement, making claims of [[child neglect]] and [[child abandonment|abandonment]]. The magistrate ruled that George would be held in custody until the claims of both parties could be investigated. George, being informed that he would not be released, had to be escorted from the court room by police and attempted to choke himself by swallowing a handkerchief.<ref name=\"Article\"/>\n\n===Last days in New York===\nLyons spent much of the 1890s in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] as a member of a burglary gang led by Billy Burke, whom she would later marry.

Lyons, then using the alias Mary Watson, was approached by [[store detective]] Mary Plunkett, who had recognized her, and who informed her she was wanted by local police. When Lyons dismissed her, Plunkett grabbed her arm, attempting to bring her in by force. A crowd began to gather as the argument escalated. Plunkett told the crowd that \"one of the most notorious pickpockets in the world\" was standing before them. At that point, Lyons got free of Plunkett and left the store with the detective in pursuit. Plunkett pursued Lyons onto a [[streetcar]], where she informed the driver that Lyons was wanted by police. The driver allowed Lyons onto the streetcar, replying to Plunkett that it was none of his business. As they reached [[18th Street (Manhattan)|Eighteenth Street]], Plunkett was able to call two patrolmen and had Lyons placed under arrest.\n\nLyons refused to be taken back to the dry goods store, insisting that she be searched to prove her innocence, but was instead arrested and taken to the [[Mercer Street (Manhattan)|Mercer Street]] police station. She was held at the precinct until her arraignment at the Jefferson Market police court on June 22. She was charged with the theft of a pocketbook from an unknown woman in [[New Jersey]], which contained $12 and a railroad ticket, and it was requested by the court that she be [[Remand (detention)|remanded]]. Her lawyer, Emanuel Friend, successfully argued for her release by pointing out the largely vague circumstances of the charges and the absence of the store detective. The magistrate agreed that the city had no evidence to prosecute Lyons and dismissed her case.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05E6D71338E233A25751C2A9609C94679ED7CF \"Sophie Lyons Again Arrested.; This Time There Was No Evidence Against the Woman\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 22, 1896</ref>\n\n===Retirement and later years===\nFollowing her \"retirement\" from crime in 1913, Lyons eventually settled in Detroit, where she wrote her memoir, ''Why Crime Does Not Pay'', and became a known philanthropist and prison reformer. She also owned 40 houses, not including vacant property, due to real estate and business investments worth $500,000<ref>\"Queen Of Crooks Reforms; Mrs. Lyons-Burke Will Devote Half-Million to Aiding Convicts\". ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 13, 1913</ref> (approximately $12.7 million in 2018). She publicly offered to provide rent-free homes for any criminals with families who were brought to Detroit by the Pathfinders' Club reform group. On February 2, 1916, she announced at the Pathfinders' annual dinner that she would be donating land worth $35,000 to establish a building for juvenile delinquents.\n\nThe Pathfinders' Club operated a similar \"character building\" facility at [[Lafayette Boulevard]] on Twenty-Fourth Street. Lyons specified that the gift was offered on the following condition: \"The home is to be devoted to the work of convincing children who have begun to be criminals that they have chosen the wrong path, and also to training them so that they will have the strength to go alright. A secondary purpose is to provide a place in which adults who have fallen into crime may get a new start in life.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70813F6355C13738DDDAA0894DA405B868DF1D3 \"Sophie Lyons Offers Gift.; Retired Thief Has Site for Criminals Home in Detroit\"]. ''[[The New York Times]], February 3, 1916</ref>\n\nIn July 1922, the 73-year-old Lyons discovered that her house had been robbed of between $6,000{{ndash}}7,000 in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and $13,000 in diamonds. She had returned home after a day trip to [[Put-in-Bay]] to find her house \"ransacked and the floor strewn with empty boxes, books and other articles\". She claimed the diamonds were a gift from her son, who had recently died in [[Seattle]]. She commented to reporters, \"I have no idea who did the 'job,' and I am unhappy to think that men would do such a thing to an old woman who devotes a large income to prison relief work.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17448997/sophie-lyons-detroit-home-robbed/ |title=Rob Ex-Confidence Woman; Burglars Sack Sophie L.

She and her husbands [[Ned Lyons]] and Billy Burke were among the most sought-after career criminals in the U.S. and Canada, being wanted in several major cities including New York City [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], Detroit [[Detroit]] and [[Montreal]] from the 1860s until the turn of the 20th century.\n\nShe and Lyons were prominent underworld figures in [[New York City]] during the post-[[American Civil War]] era as associates of [[Marm Mandelbaum]], Lyons being a member of Mandelbaum's \"inner circle\" during the 1860s and 1870s.<ref>[[Herbert Asbury|Asbury, Herbert]].

Her mother, [[Baltimore]] shoplifter Sophie Elkins,<ref>La Fountaine, George. ''The Scott-Dunlap Ring''. New York: Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1978. (pg. 113)</ref> was a \"keeper of a [[disorderly house]]\" on New York's [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]], and supposedly forced her out into the street to steal. Lyons claimed she had been first caught stealing at the age of three and was tried at the Essex Market police court,<ref name=\"Article\">\"Burglar Lyons's Family; The Depravity Of Its Youngest Member.

''[[The New York Times]]'', February 1, 1880</ref> and she was again arrested for shoplifting at 12.\n\nLyons married another pickpocket, Maury Harris, when she was 16, but the marriage ended when Harris was arrested and sentenced to New York State Prison for two years. During her youth, she became known as a skilled pickpocket and confidence woman. She was considered a consummate actress who, even when caught by her victim, was able to \"counterfeit every shade of emotion\" to persuade them to release her.<ref name=\"Houdini\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/rightwaytodowro00conggoog |last=Houdini |first=Harry |author-link=Harry Houdini |title=The Right Way to Do Wrong: An Expos\u00e9 of Successful Criminals |location=Boston |publisher=Harry Houdini |year=1906 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rightwaytodowro00conggoog/page/n81 75]\u201376 |access-date=2020-03-12 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref> According to one incident in 1880, she was able to convince a store detective that she suffered from [[kleptomania]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDHADgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA264&pg=PA264 |last=Abelson |first=Elaine S. |title=When Ladies Go A-thieving: Middle-class Shoplifters in the Victorian Department Store |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1989 |page=264 |isbn=0-19-507142-5 |access-date=2020-03-12 |via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nLyons eventually married [[Ned Lyons]], known then as the \"King of the Bank Robbers\", and they had three children together. Two years after their marriage, Ned was able to purchase a villa on [[Long Island]] from his share in a major bank robbery. Although he tried to discourage Lyons from pickpocketing, she continued to do so and eventually both were imprisoned. Soon after Ned's escape from prison in 1872, he returned to New York to help Lyons escape from prison by using a disguise to infiltrate [[Sing Sing]] and break through the wall of her jail cell. They escaped to [[Paris]], where Lyons lived under the name Madame d'Varney and the two continued their criminal activities.<ref name=\"Houdini\"/>\n\n===Court battle with George Lyons===\nOn the afternoon of January 31, 1880, Lyons returned to the Essex Market police court where she brought her youngest son, 14-year-old George, before the [[magistrate]]. She claimed he refused to attend school, often left home at nights to sleep in the streets and \"was so generally unruly\" that she requested that he be put in a juvenile [[correctional facility]].\n\nAfter she had finished, George shouted, \"That woman is a thief and a shoplifter. I have seen her steal in [[Montreal]] and elsewhere.\" He denied his mother's charges, claiming she wanted to get rid of him, and that he had \"recommendations showing his good character\". He went on to make further criminal charges against his mother, continuing, \"Yes, you want to get rid of me, and you're my mother. How can I tell you are when you have two husbands with whom you go all over the country, stealing everywhere?\" These accusations caused a disturbance in the court room and the magistrate called for a [[Recess (break)|recess]] to listen to both mother and son in private.<ref name=\"Article\"/>\n\nLyons confessed to her criminal past and being the wife of Ned, however she maintained that she had spent considerable time and effort trying to keep her children from becoming criminals. She had sent George to three colleges in Canada, and her two daughters attended schools in Germany,<ref name=\"Houdini\"/> but George returned to New York and began frequenting underworld resorts, including [[Dan Kerrigan]]'s infamous [[6th Street (Manhattan)|Sixth Street]] saloon, where he performed as a singer and associated with known criminals. She also said that her son had obtained at least one of his recommendations by threatening a former employer by the name of Kate B. Woodward with a carving knife.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAfter hearing of this incident, Lyons invited George to her home on [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Montgomery Street]] and had him arrested by waiting police officers. George admitted that he had an argument with Woodward, who had withheld his [[pocket watch]], but denied intimidating her to obtaining his recommendation. He did admit to picking up a carving knife during the argument, but did not use it towards her or use threatening language. He was reportedly disruptive while his mother made her statement, making claims of [[child neglect]] and [[child abandonment|abandonment]]. The magistrate ruled that George would be held in custody until the claims of both parties could be investigated. George, being informed that he would not be released, had to be escorted from the court room by police and attempted to choke himself by swallowing a handkerchief.<ref name=\"Article\"/>\n\n===Last days in New York===\nLyons spent much of the 1890s in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] as a member of a burglary gang led by Billy Burke, whom she would later marry. She returned to New York in 1895 and, after her arrest by police detective Stephen O'Brien,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46603156/detectives-in-new-jobs/ |title=Detectives In New Jobs; Important Changes Made in the Bureau at Headquarters.

Lyons, then using the alias Mary Watson, was approached by [[store detective]] Mary Plunkett, who had recognized her, and who informed her she was wanted by local police. When Lyons dismissed her, Plunkett grabbed her arm, attempting to bring her in by force. A crowd began to gather as the argument escalated. Plunkett told the crowd that \"one of the most notorious pickpockets in the world\" was standing before them. At that point, Lyons got free of Plunkett and left the store with the detective in pursuit. Plunkett pursued Lyons onto a [[streetcar]], where she informed the driver that Lyons was wanted by police. The driver allowed Lyons onto the streetcar, replying to Plunkett that it was none of his business. As they reached [[18th Street (Manhattan)|Eighteenth Street]], Plunkett was able to call two patrolmen and had Lyons placed under arrest.\n\nLyons refused to be taken back to the dry goods store, insisting that she be searched to prove her innocence, but was instead arrested and taken to the [[Mercer Street (Manhattan)|Mercer Street]] police station. She was held at the precinct until her arraignment at the Jefferson Market police court on June 22. She was charged with the theft of a pocketbook from an unknown woman in [[New Jersey]], which contained $12 and a railroad ticket, and it was requested by the court that she be [[Remand (detention)|remanded]]. Her lawyer, Emanuel Friend, successfully argued for her release by pointing out the largely vague circumstances of the charges and the absence of the store detective. The magistrate agreed that the city had no evidence to prosecute Lyons and dismissed her case.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05E6D71338E233A25751C2A9609C94679ED7CF \"Sophie Lyons Again Arrested.; This Time There Was No Evidence Against the Woman\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 22, 1896</ref>\n\n===Retirement and later years===\nFollowing her \"retirement\" from crime in 1913, Lyons eventually settled in Detroit, where she wrote her memoir, ''Why Crime Does Not Pay'', and became a known philanthropist and prison reformer. She also owned 40 houses, not including vacant property, due to real estate and business investments worth $500,000<ref>\"Queen Of Crooks Reforms; Mrs. Lyons-Burke Will Devote Half-Million to Aiding Convicts\". ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 13, 1913</ref> (approximately $12.7 million in 2018). She publicly offered to provide rent-free homes for any criminals with families who were brought to Detroit by the Pathfinders' Club reform group. On February 2, 1916, she announced at the Pathfinders' annual dinner that she would be donating land worth $35,000 to establish a building for juvenile delinquents.\n\nThe Pathfinders' Club operated a similar \"character building\" facility at [[Lafayette Boulevard]] on Twenty-Fourth Street. Lyons specified that the gift was offered on the following condition: \"The home is to be devoted to the work of convincing children who have begun to be criminals that they have chosen the wrong path, and also to training them so that they will have the strength to go alright. A secondary purpose is to provide a place in which adults who have fallen into crime may get a new start in life.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70813F6355C13738DDDAA0894DA405B868DF1D3 \"Sophie Lyons Offers Gift.; Retired Thief Has Site for Criminals Home in Detroit\"]. ''[[The New York Times]], February 3, 1916</ref>\n\nIn July 1922, the 73-year-old Lyons discovered that her house had been robbed of between $6,000{{ndash}}7,000 in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and $13,000 in diamonds. She had returned home after a day trip to [[Put-in-Bay]] to find her house \"ransacked and the floor strewn with empty boxes, books and other articles\". She claimed the diamonds were a gift from her son, who had recently died in [[Seattle]]. She commented to reporters, \"I have no idea who did the 'job,' and I am unhappy to think that men would do such a thing to an old woman who devotes a large income to prison relief work.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17448997/sophie-lyons-detroit-home-robbed/ |title=Rob Ex-Confidence Woman; Burglars Sack Sophie L.
