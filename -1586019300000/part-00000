The mission became the initial base for and is historically closely related to the [[Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum]]. During the first decades of its existence, the mission only had an in-house chapel for worshiping but not a separate church.\n\nThe construction of the church began in November 2015; the foundation was completed in January 2016 and the cornerstone brought from the Holy Trinity Church in [[Druya|Druja]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://krynica.info/be/2016/02/08/kamen-z-drui-stausya-kraevugolnym-dlya-belaruskajj-carkvy-u-londane/|title=\u041a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0437 \u0414\u0440\u0443\u0456 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u045e\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0431\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0439 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0432\u044b \u045e \u041b\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0435|last=|first=|date=|website=Krynica.info|publisher=|access-date=25 March 2016}}</ref> was laid during a ceremony presided by the [[Apostolic Nuncio|Apostolic Papal Nuncio]], Archbishop Antonio Mennini and Bishop of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Holy Family of London, Bishop [[Hlib Lonchyna]] on 7 February 2016.

Larva that had been raised on meth-infused meat developed faster and ended up larger in size, and weight. The increase in body size poses a problem for determining relative ages of larva since most use body size as an indication of age. Time estimates can be up to 78 hours off. The other difficulty for establishing time of death is determining what species of insect is coming off a cadaver. Since methamphetamines are toxic to ''C. stygia'' most flies die in the pupal stage, it is difficult to make proper identifications.\n\n==Life History==\n''C. stygia'' has three life stages; 3 larval instars, pupa, and adult.<ref name=Parry /> The larval stage is very difficult to identify species. has a break down as to how to distinguish several different larvae. Most entomologists wait until the adult emerges to identify the species.\n\nLarva feed on the soft tissues of a corpse or host that they were placed on by their parent.

{"title_page": "Carpet cleaning", "text_new": "{{news release|date=February 2015}}\n'''Carpet cleaning''', for appearance, and the removal of stains, dirt, and [[allergen]]s is done through several methods. Clean [[carpet]]s are recognized by manufacturers as being more visually pleasing, potentially longer-lasting, and probably healthier than poorly maintained carpets.\n\n== Hot water extraction ==\n{{details|Hot water extraction}}\nAlthough there is an actual [[steam cleaning]] industrial process, in the context of carpet cleaning, \"steam cleaning\" is often mistaken for hot water soil extraction cleaning, which is professionally known as HWE. The hot water soil extraction cleaning method uses equipment that sprays heated water and detergent on the carpet and simultaneously, the water and detergent is extracted, along with any dislodged and dissolved dirt. Many carpet manufacturers recommend professional hot water extraction as the most effective carpet cleaning method which also provides a deeper clean. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Actual steam could damage man-made carpet fibers and change the characteristics as they are usually set using heat. Woven carpets can shrink but most carpets are not woven and are in fact tuffed on a laminate backing, velvet-piled carpets and Berber carpets may become fuzzy which is known as pile burst. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.localexpertcleaning.co.uk/|title=Local Expert Cleaning {{!}} 1 Best Cleaning Company Birmingham|website=Local Expert Cleaning|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> Most problems can be avoided by professional experienced cleaners. \n\nHot water extraction equipment may be a portable unit that plugs into an electrical outlet, or a [https://www.localexpertcleaning.co.uk/ truck mount carpet cleaner] requiring long hoses from the truck or trailer. Truck-mounted equipment may be used where electricity is unavailable, but may be unsuited to premises distant from a driveway or road, and require hoses to pass through windows to reach the upper floors of a building. The hoses needed for truck-mount and professional portable carpet cleaning may present a trip hazard, and allow pets or children to escape through doors left ajar. Heated or air conditioned air can also be wasted when doors are left open for hoses. Truck-mounted carpet cleaning equipment minimizes the noise in the room being cleaned, but may cause noise and air pollution offensive to neighbors, and could violate anti-idling bylaws in some jurisdictions. However, truck-mounted cleaning is much faster than portable equipment, and the extra heat will dissolve more spots and stains, and more vacuum suction power will reduce drying times.\n\n[[File:Carpet Cleaning Machine Rug Doctor.jpg|thumb|right|A Rug Doctor rental carpet cleaning machine]]\nA common process of hot water extraction begins with preconditioning. [[alkalinity|Alkaline]] agents such as ammonia solution for synthetic carpets, or acidic solution (such as vinegar solution) for woollen carpets, are sprayed into the carpet, then agitated with a grooming brush or an automatic scrubbing machine. Next, a pressurized manual or automatic cleaning tool (known as a wand) passes over the surface to rinse out all pre-conditioner, residue, and particulates. If an alkaline detergent is used on a woollen carpet, use of a mild [[acetic acid]] solution will restore neutral fiber [[pH scale|pH]]. The acidic rinse thus neutralizes the alkaline residues, and can contribute to softening cleaned fabrics.\n\nExtraction is, by far, the most important step in the hot water extraction process. Since the hot-water extraction method uses much more water than other methods like bonnet or shampoo cleaning, proper extraction and air flow are critical to avoid drying issues such as mold growth & browning of wool fibres. Drying time may also be decreased by extra use of fans, de-humidifiers, and/or outdoor ventilation.\n\nOlder surfaces, such as double jute-backed carpets and loose rugs with natural foundation yarns, could shrink after a wet treatment, leading to suppositions that wet-cleaning could also remove wrinkles. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} However, this notion is antiquated and this method could also occasionally tear seams or uproot strips. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Newer carpets, such as with [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] backing and foundation yarns, do not shrink, and they smooth easily; in such carpets, wrinkles indicate an underlying problem, such as delamination where the secondary backing becomes unstuck from the primary backing, that may need a certified carpet inspector to determine.\n\nWet-cleaning systems naturally require drying time, which may lead to concerns about very slow drying, the risk of soiling returning during drying as the moisture evaporates bringing the soils from deeper within the pile to the surface, as well as odors, bacteria, fungi, molds, and mildews. Carpet cleaning specialists try to find a balance between rapid drying (attributable to lower flow rate through the cleaning jets of a spray system) and the need to remove the most soil (attributable to higher flow rate).\n\nHow Can Hot water extraction-steam [https://www.localexpertcleaning.co.uk/local-expert-cleaning/carpet-cleaning-birmingham/ carpet cleaner Birmingham] functions!\n\nIf our cleaner arrives, they will pick the right carpet cleaning system and compounds to utilize dependent on the form of carpet amount of soiling, tear or wear, and just how well your carpet was fit.\n\nYour Own Carpet Will Be Dry in two -- 3 times, It is not a fantastic idea to walk a moist carpet with sneakers which have only been outdoors as the cleaning solution will well wash out the dirt off your shoes on the wash carpet.

These systems are mostly \"very low moisture\" (VLM) systems, relying on dry compounds complemented by application cleaning solutions, and are growing significantly in market share due in part to their very rapid drying time, a significant factor for 24-hour commercial installations. Dry-cleaning and \"very low moisture\" systems are also often faster and less labor-intensive than wet-extraction systems.\n\nHeavily soiled areas require the application of manual spotting, pretreatments, preconditioners, and/or \"traffic-lane cleaners\", (commonly sprayed onto carpet prior to the primary use of the dry-cleaning system) which are detergents or emulsifiers which break the binding of different soils to carpet fibers over a short period of time. For example, one chemical may dissolve the greasy films that bind soils to the carpet, and thus prevent effective soil removal through vacuuming. The solution may add a solvent like [[d-limonene]], [[petroleum]] byproducts, [[glycol ether]]s, or [[butyl]] agents. The amount of time the pretreatment dwells in the carpet should be less than 15 minutes, due to the thorough carpet brushing common to these \"very low moisture\" systems, which provides added agitation to ensure the pretreatment works fully through the carpet. The benefit of dry carpet cleaning, over wet solutions, is that dry chemical compounds don't attract dirt, like dried shampoo.{{citation needed|reason=Are there any verifiable studies?|date=December 2015}} While dry carpet cleaning is more expensive and more time consuming to clean than bonnet or extraction, dry cleaning formulas put less stress on the carpets themselves.{{citation needed|reason=Are there any verifiable studies?|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Dry compound ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\nA 98% biodegradable or others,<ref name=\"HOD\">Heinrich Waldhoff, Rudiger Spilker, ''Handbook Of Detergents, Part C:'' P. 26, CRC Press, 30 November 2004</ref> slightly moist absorbent cleaning compound may be spread evenly over carpet and brushed or scrubbed in.

Encapsulators are specialty detergent polymers which become part of the detergent system. As drying occurs (20-30 min. drytime), after cleaning, these encapsulators bind the detergent molecules and residual soils in a brittle, crystalline structure.<ref name=\"HOD\" /> Detergent and soil particles can no longer attract other soils and are easily removed by dry vacuuming. In addition to binding the detergent and soil residues the encapsulation chemistry coats the clean fibre with the same brittle film. This reduces the fibre\u2019s affinity for oily and particulate soils. As this brittle film \"breaks away\" and more soil is removed, the appearance of the fibre improves as opposed to soiling more rapidly. Products which also employ fluorochemical technology, display dramatically extended anti re-soiling time periods.<!--<ref name=cmc>{{cite web|title=Dry Carpet Cleaner|work=CM Cleanfax|date=2005-04-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|page=48}}-->\nCleaning solution is applied by rotary machine, brush applicator, or compression sprayer.

This industry machine resembles a floor buffer, with an absorbent spin or oscillating pad that attracts soil and is rinsed or replaced repeatedly. The bonnet method is not strictly dry-cleaning.\n\nTo reduce pile distortion, the absorbent bonnet should be kept well-lubricated with cleaning solution. It is not recommended to dunk the bonnet in a bucket of cleaning solution and then wring it out with a mop-bucket wringer, as this will make the bonnet too wet. It is important to change or turn the bonnet early, as bonnets can become filled with soil in just a few hundred square feet. Once loaded with soil, the bonnet will not hold any more; instead, it simply moves the soil from one area to another. An overly wet bonnet also deposits residues that attract soils when they are dry, creating the need to clean more often. It is recommended for robust and not for high floor carpet, it swirls the floor. It distorts pile and grinds dirt deeper in carpet fiber, and also has an abrasive effect.<ref>[http://www.servicesmag.org/commercial-cleaning-services-business-plan/window-cleaning-service/item/174-an-effective-alternative-to-bonnet-cleaning servicesmag.org An Effective Alternative to Bonnet Cleaning]</ref>\n\nWhen there is a large amount of foreign material in the carpet, extraction with a wet process may be needed. Normally, the spin-bonnet method may not be as capable of sanitizing carpet fibers due to the lack of hot water, for this a special thermo machine is needed, here the buffing machine is equipped with a heating, to heat up the bonnet,  but a post-cleaning application of an antimicrobial agent is used to make up for this. A small amount of water is required with spin-bonnet carpet cleaning. It only cleans the top of the carpet 1/8 inch but it is very fast for wide areas. However, bonnet cleaning is not the best mechanism for completely removing the chemical that is pre-sprayed onto a carpet. It is recommended that only surfactant free or encapsulating products are used.\n\n=== Shampoo ===\nWet shampoo cleaning with rotary machines, followed by thorough wet vacuuming, was widespread until about the 1970s, but industry perception of shampoo cleaning changed with the advent of encapsulation. Hot-water extraction, also regarded as preferable by all manufacturers, had not been introduced either.

This ensures high cleaning performance, extracting the dirt from the carpet to a depth of half an inch. By immediately reabsorbing the wash water, the drying time is greatly shortened. This method is suitable for intermediate and basic cleaning. Because it does not require cleaning products, it leaves no detergent residue. Vacuum washing has long been in use in Europe, mostly in larger train and bus companies, schools, and historic preservation. The system works on all surfaces which are water resistant (carpet, upholstered furniture, wooden floors, stone, plastics).

The hot water soil extraction cleaning method uses equipment that sprays heated water and detergent on the carpet and simultaneously, the water and detergent is extracted, along with any dislodged and dissolved dirt. Many carpet manufacturers recommend professional hot water extraction as the most effective carpet cleaning method which also provides a deeper clean. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Actual steam could damage man-made carpet fibers and change the characteristics as they are usually set using heat. Woven carpets can shrink but most carpets are not woven and are in fact tuffed on a laminate backing, velvet-piled carpets and Berber carpets may become fuzzy which is known as pile burst. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.localexpertcleaning.co.uk/|title=Local Expert Cleaning {{!}} 1 Best Cleaning Company Birmingham|website=Local Expert Cleaning|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> Most problems can be avoided by professional experienced cleaners. \n\nHot water extraction equipment may be a portable unit that plugs into an electrical outlet, or a [https://www.localexpertcleaning.co.uk/ truck mount carpet cleaner] requiring long hoses from the truck or trailer. Truck-mounted equipment may be used where electricity is unavailable, but may be unsuited to premises distant from a driveway or road, and require hoses to pass through windows to reach the upper floors of a building. The hoses needed for truck-mount and professional portable carpet cleaning may present a trip hazard, and allow pets or children to escape through doors left ajar. Heated or air conditioned air can also be wasted when doors are left open for hoses. Truck-mounted carpet cleaning equipment minimizes the noise in the room being cleaned, but may cause noise and air pollution offensive to neighbors, and could violate anti-idling bylaws in some jurisdictions. However, truck-mounted cleaning is much faster than portable equipment, and the extra heat will dissolve more spots and stains, and more vacuum suction power will reduce drying times.\n\n[[File:Carpet Cleaning Machine Rug Doctor.jpg|thumb|right|A Rug Doctor rental carpet cleaning machine]]\nA common process of hot water extraction begins with preconditioning. [[alkalinity|Alkaline]] agents such as ammonia solution for synthetic carpets, or acidic solution (such as vinegar solution) for woollen carpets, are sprayed into the carpet, then agitated with a grooming brush or an automatic scrubbing machine. Next, a pressurized manual or automatic cleaning tool (known as a wand) passes over the surface to rinse out all pre-conditioner, residue, and particulates.

A near-divine being, he is also credited as the author of most of [[Mandala 3]] of the [[Rigveda]], including [[Gayatri Mantra]]. The [[Puranas]] mention that only 24 rishis since antiquity have understood the whole meaning of\u2014and thus wielded the whole power of\u2014Gayatri Mantra. Vishvamitra is supposed to be the first, and [[Yajnavalkya]] the last.\n\nThe story of Vishvamitra is narrated in the [[Valmiki Ramayana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valmikiramayan.net |title=Valmiki Ramayana |publisher=Valmikiramayan.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>  \n\nVishvamitra was a king in ancient India, also called Kaushik (descendant of Kusha) and belonged to [[Amavasu Dynasty]]. Vishwamitra was originally the [[Chandravanshi]] ([[Somavanshi]]) King of Kanyakubja. He was a valiant warrior and the great-grandson of a great king named Kusha. ''Valmiki Ramayana'', prose 51 of Bala Kanda, starts with the story of Vishvamitra:\n\n{{quote|There was a king named Kusha (not to be confused with [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]], son of [[Rama]]), a brainchild of [[Brahma]] and Kusha's son was the powerful and verily righteous Kushanabha. One who is highly renowned by the name [[Gaadhi]] was the son of Kushanabha and Gaadhi's son is this great-saint of great resplendence, Vishvamitra.

[[Vishnu Purana]] and [[Harivamsha]] chapter 27 (dynasty of Amaavasu) of ''Mahabharata'' narrates the birth of Vishvamitra. According to [[Vishnu Purana]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mythfolklore.net/india/encyclopedia/viswamitra.htm |title=Vi\u015bwamitra |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date=2007-10-16 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> Kushanabha married a damsel of Purukutsa dynasty (later called as Shatamarshana lineage - descendants of the [[Ikshvaku]] king Trasadasyu) and had a son by name Gaadhi, who had a daughter named Satyavati (not to be confused with the [[Satyavati]] of ''Mahabharata'').\n\nSatyavati was married to an old man known as Ruchika who was foremost among the race of [[Bhrigu]]. Ruchika desired a son having the qualities of a good person and so he gave Satyavati a sacrificial offering ([[charu]]) which he had prepared to achieve this objective. He also gave Satyavati's mother another charu to make her conceive a son with the character of a [[Kshatriya]] at her request. But Satyavati's mother privately asked Satyavati to exchange her charu with her. This resulted in Satyavati's mother giving birth to Vishvamitra, and Satyavati gave birth to [[Jamadagni]], father of [[Parashurama]], a person with qualities of a warrior\n\n==Conflict with Vashista==\n[[File:Viswamitra taking with Vasista.jpg|thumb|left|Viswamitra talking with Vasista]]\n[[File:Coin of Dharaghosha king of the Audumbaras.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin of Dharaghosha, king of the [[Audumbaras]], in the [[Indo-Greek]] style, with depiction of Vishvamitra, circa 100 BCE.<ref name=\"Rapson\"/><br>'''Obv:''' Standing figure, probably of Vishvamitra, [[Kharoshthi]] legend, around: ''Mahadevasa Dharaghoshasa/Odumbarisa'' \"Great Lord King Dharaghosha/Prince of Audumabara\", across: ''Vi\u00e7vamitra'' \"Vishvamitra\".<br>'''Rev:''' Trident battle-axe, tree with railing, [[Brahmi]] legend identical in content to the obverse.<ref name=\"Rapson\">Ancient India, from the earliest times to the first century, A.D by Rapson, E.

It consumes Vishvamitra's most powerful weapons, including the [[brahmastra]]. Vashista then attempts to attack Vishvamitra, but his anger is allayed by [[deva (Hinduism)|Devas]].

He asked Vasistha to hand over her but Vasistha refused to do so saying she actually belongs to Devas and not him. King Kaushika became angry and attacked Vasishtha with all his forces. However, he was defeated by Vasistha by the power of his penance and was somehow rescued by Vamdeva.\n\nHe asked Vamdeva, how can Vasistha defeat all his might on his alone. Vamdeva told him this happened due to Vasishtha's Brahmashakti. Kaushika then wanted to become like Vasistha. Doing penance guided by Vamdeva, King Kaushika became Vishwamitra.\n\n==Tapasya==\nMenaka was born during the churning of the ocean by the Devas and Asuras and was one of the most beautiful apsaras (celestial nymph) in the world with quick intelligence and innate talent. However, Menaka desired a family. Due to his penance and the power he achieved through it, Vishwamitra frightened the gods and even tried to create another heaven. Indra, frightened by Vishwamitra's powers, sent Menaka from heaven to earth to lure him and break his meditation. Menaka successfully incited Vishwamitra's lust and passion. She succeeded in breaking the meditation of Vishwamitra. However, she fell in genuine love with him and a baby was born to them who later grew in Sage Kanva's ashram and came to be called Shakuntala. Later Shakuntala falls in love with King Dushyanta and gives birth to a child called Bharata. \n\nHowever, later Vishwamitra merely cursed Menaka to be separated from him forever, for he loved her as well and knew that she had lost all devious intentions towards him long ago.\n\nVishwamitra was also tested by the Apsara Rambha. She, however was cursed by Vishwamitra.\n\n==Rise to Brahmarishi==\n\nAfter cursing Menaka, Vishwamitra goes to the highest mountain of [[Himalayas]] to perform an even more severe tapasya for over 1000 years. He ceases to eat and reduces his breathing to a bare minimum.\n\nHe is tested again by Indra, who comes as a poor [[Brahmin]] begging for food just as Kaushika is ready to break a fast of many years by eating some rice. Kaushika instantly gives his food away to Indra and resumes his meditation. Kaushika also finally masters his passions, refusing to be provoked by any of Indra's testing and seductive interferences.\n\nAt the penultimate culmination of a multi-thousand-year journey, Kaushika's yogic power is at a peak. At this point, Brahma, as the head of [[deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] led by Indra, names Kaushika a [[Brahmarishi]] and names him ''Vishvamitra'' or ''Friend of All'' for his unlimited compassion. He then goes to meet Vashishta. It was customary that, if a sage was greeted by an equal or superior person, the sage would also greet the person. If the sage was greeted by an inferior person, the sage would simply bless them. Initially, when Vishwamitra greeted Vashishta with the pride of being a new Brahmarishi in heart, Vashishta simply blessed him. Suddenly all pride and desire left Vishwamitra's heart and he became a clean and clear Brahmarishi. When Vishwamitra turned back to leave, Vashishta realised a change of heart and proceeded to greet Vishwamitra. Vishwamitra is also embraced by [[Vashista]] and their enmity is instantly ended.\n\n==Gayatri mantra==\n\nVishvamitra is said to have found [[Gayatri Mantra]]. It is a verse from a sukta of Rigveda (Mandala 3.62.10). G\u0101yatr\u012b is the name of the [[Vedic meter]] in which the verse is composed.\n\nGayatri mantra is repeated and cited very widely in Vedic literature{{sfn|Bloomfield|1906|p=392b}} and praised in several well-known classical Hindu texts such as [[Manusmriti]] (\"there is nothing greater than the ''Savitri (Gayatri) Mantra''.\", Manu II, 83),{{sfn|Dutt|2006|p=51}} [[Harivamsa]]{{sfn|Vedas|2003|p=15\u201316}} and [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Rahman|2005|p=300}}{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1994|p=266}} The mantra is an important part of the [[upanayana]] ceremony for young males in [[Hinduism]] and has long been recited by [[dvija]] men as part of their daily rituals. Modern [[Hindu reform movements]] spread the practice of the mantra to include women and all castes and its recitation is now widespread.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=127}}{{sfn|Lipner|1994|p=53}}\n\n==Legends==\n\nVishvamitra is featured in many legends and in different works of the [[Sanatana dharma]].\n\n===Trisanku===\n[[File:Vishwamitra.jpg|thumb|Vishwamitra]]\nAnother story Vishvamitra is known for is his creation of his own version of ''Svarga'' or heaven, called ''Trisanku Svarga''.\n\nWhen a proud King [[Trishanku|Trisanku]] asked his [[Guru]] [[Vashista]] to send him to heaven in his own body, guru responded that the body cannot ascend to heaven. King Trisanku then asked Vashista's hundred sons to send him to heaven. The sons, believing that Trisanku should not come to them after their father had refused, took outrage and cursed Trisanku to be a Chandala. Trisanku was transformed into a person with body smeared of ash, clothed in black and wearing iron jewelry. Unrecognizable to his subjects, he was driven out of the kingdom.\n\nIn his exile, Trisanku came across the sage Vishvamitra, who agreed to help him. Vishvamitra organized a great sacrifice and ritual propitiating the [[deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s, pleading that they accept Trisanku into heaven. Not one Deva responded. Angered, Vishvamitra used his yogic powers and ordered Trisanku to rise to heaven. Miraculously, Trisanku rose into the sky until he reached heaven, where he was pushed back down by [[Indra]].\n\nEnraged even more by this, Vishvamitra commenced the creation of another Universe (including another Brahma) for Trisanku. He had only completed the Universe when [[Brihaspati]] ordered him to stop. Trisanku, however, did not fully transcend through Trisanku [[Svarga]] created for him. He remained fixed and upside-down in the sky and was transformed into a [[constellation]], which is now known as [[Crux]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130045439/http://spaceyuga.com/crux-constellation-hindu-mythological-name-trishanku/|title=Crux \u2013 Trishanku|date=30 January 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n \nIn the process of forming a new universe, Vishvamitra used up all the tapas he had gained from his austerities. Therefore, after the Trisanku episode, Vishvamitra had to start his prayers again to attain the status of a [[Brahmarshi]] and become an equal of Vashista.\n\n===Harishchandra/Ambarisha's sacrifice===\n[[File:Rama breaking the bow.jpg|left|thumb|Rama breaking the bow]]\nWhile undertaking a penance, Kaushika helps a boy named [[Shunashepa]] who has been sold by his parents to be sacrificed at [[Harishchandra]]/[[Ambarisha]]'s [[yagna]] to please [[Varuna]]. The king's son [[Rohit]] does not want to be the one sacrificed, as was originally promised to Varuna, so young [[Shunahshepa|Sunashepa]] is taken. A devastated and terrified [[Shunahshepa|Sunashepa]] falls at the feet of Kaushika, who is deep in meditation and begs for his help.<ref name=\"p1\">Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. ''Ancient Indian Historical Tradition'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.92.</ref>\n\nKaushika teaches secret mantras to Sunashepa. The boy sings these mantras at the ceremony, is blessed by [[Indra]] and [[Varuna]] and Ambarisha's ceremony is completed.\n\nIn another version of the story, Sunahshepa is lost son of Vishvamitra. When Vishvamitra was Prince of Bharats (Kaushik) - and his name was Vishwarath then, he was abducted by the enemy king Shambar. There, Shambar's daughter, Ugra, falls in love with Vishvarath. Ugra convinces Prince Vishvarath to marry her. Looking at the good character of Vishvarath, Shambar also agrees for the marriage. Soon after the marriage, the Bharatas win the battle against Shambar. When theu found their Prince Vishvarath alive, they feel happy but they could not accept Ugra as their future queen as she is an Asura. To convert Ugra into an Aryan, Vishvarath creates Gayatri Mantra, but people still refuse to accept her. Soon she gives birth to a son, but to save the son from the angry people, the greatest female sage [[Lopamudra]] sends the child to a hidden place. To Lopamudra and Vishvarath's sadness, people kill Ugra. But the son is saved, without the knowledge of Vishvarath. This child grows young and he comes to sacrifice himself in the ceremony of Ambarisha (or King Harishchandra).<ref>Munshi, K. M. (1933). Munshi Granthavali : 7.

A near-divine being, he is also credited as the author of most of [[Mandala 3]] of the [[Rigveda]], including [[Gayatri Mantra]]. The [[Puranas]] mention that only 24 rishis since antiquity have understood the whole meaning of\u2014and thus wielded the whole power of\u2014Gayatri Mantra. Vishvamitra is supposed to be the first, and [[Yajnavalkya]] the last.\n\nThe story of Vishvamitra is narrated in the [[Valmiki Ramayana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valmikiramayan.net |title=Valmiki Ramayana |publisher=Valmikiramayan.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>  \n\nVishvamitra was a king in ancient India, also called Kaushik (descendant of Kusha) and belonged to [[Amavasu Dynasty]]. Vishwamitra was originally the [[Chandravanshi]] ([[Somavanshi]]) King of Kanyakubja. He was a valiant warrior and the great-grandson of a great king named Kusha. ''Valmiki Ramayana'', prose 51 of Bala Kanda, starts with the story of Vishvamitra:\n\n{{quote|There was a king named Kusha (not to be confused with [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]], son of [[Rama]]), a brainchild of [[Brahma]] and Kusha's son was the powerful and verily righteous Kushanabha. One who is highly renowned by the name [[Gaadhi]] was the son of Kushanabha and Gaadhi's son is this great-saint of great resplendence, Vishvamitra.

[[Vishnu Purana]] and [[Harivamsha]] chapter 27 (dynasty of Amaavasu) of ''Mahabharata'' narrates the birth of Vishvamitra. According to [[Vishnu Purana]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mythfolklore.net/india/encyclopedia/viswamitra.htm |title=Vi\u015bwamitra |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date=2007-10-16 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> Kushanabha married a damsel of Purukutsa dynasty (later called as Shatamarshana lineage - descendants of the [[Ikshvaku]] king Trasadasyu) and had a son by name Gaadhi, who had a daughter named Satyavati (not to be confused with the [[Satyavati]] of ''Mahabharata'').\n\nSatyavati was married to an old man known as Ruchika who was foremost among the race of [[Bhrigu]]. Ruchika desired a son having the qualities of a good person and so he gave Satyavati a sacrificial offering ([[charu]]) which he had prepared to achieve this objective. He also gave Satyavati's mother another charu to make her conceive a son with the character of a [[Kshatriya]] at her request. But Satyavati's mother privately asked Satyavati to exchange her charu with her. This resulted in Satyavati's mother giving birth to Vishvamitra, and Satyavati gave birth to [[Jamadagni]], father of [[Parashurama]], a person with qualities of a warrior\n\n==Conflict with Vashista==\n[[File:Viswamitra taking with Vasista.jpg|thumb|left|Viswamitra talking with Vasista]]\n[[File:Coin of Dharaghosha king of the Audumbaras.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin of Dharaghosha, king of the [[Audumbaras]], in the [[Indo-Greek]] style, with depiction of Vishvamitra, circa 100 BCE.<ref name=\"Rapson\"/><br>'''Obv:''' Standing figure, probably of Vishvamitra, [[Kharoshthi]] legend, around: ''Mahadevasa Dharaghoshasa/Odumbarisa'' \"Great Lord King Dharaghosha/Prince of Audumabara\", across: ''Vi\u00e7vamitra'' \"Vishvamitra\".<br>'''Rev:''' Trident battle-axe, tree with railing, [[Brahmi]] legend identical in content to the obverse.<ref name=\"Rapson\">Ancient India, from the earliest times to the first century, A.D by Rapson, E.

It consumes Vishvamitra's most powerful weapons, including the [[brahmastra]]. Vashista then attempts to attack Vishvamitra, but his anger is allayed by [[deva (Hinduism)|Devas]].

He asked Vasistha to hand over her but Vasistha refused to do so saying she actually belongs to Devas and not him. King Kaushika became angry and attacked Vasishtha with all his forces. However, he was defeated by Vasistha by the power of his penance and was somehow rescued by Vamdeva.\n\nHe asked Vamdeva, how can Vasistha defeat all his might on his alone. Vamdeva told him this happened due to Vasishtha's Brahmashakti. Kaushika then wanted to become like Vasistha. Doing penance guided by Vamdeva, King Kaushika became Vishwamitra.\n\n==Tapasya==\nMenaka was born during the churning of the ocean by the Devas and Asuras and was one of the most beautiful apsaras (celestial nymph) in the world with quick intelligence and innate talent. However, Menaka desired a family. Due to his penance and the power he achieved through it, Vishwamitra frightened the gods and even tried to create another heaven. Indra, frightened by Vishwamitra's powers, sent Menaka from heaven to earth to lure him and break his meditation. Menaka successfully incited Vishwamitra's lust and passion. She succeeded in breaking the meditation of Vishwamitra. However, she fell in genuine love with him and a baby was born to them who later grew in Sage Kanva's ashram and came to be called Shakuntala. Later Shakuntala falls in love with King Dushyanta and gives birth to a child called Bharata. \n\nHowever, later Vishwamitra merely cursed Menaka to be separated from him forever, for he loved her as well and knew that she had lost all devious intentions towards him long ago.\n\nVishwamitra was also tested by the Apsara Rambha. She, however was cursed by Vishwamitra.\n\n==Rise to Brahmarishi==\n\nAfter cursing Menaka, Vishwamitra goes to the highest mountain of [[Himalayas]] to perform an even more severe tapasya for over 1000 years. He ceases to eat and reduces his breathing to a bare minimum.\n\nHe is tested again by Indra, who comes as a poor [[Brahmin]] begging for food just as Kaushika is ready to break a fast of many years by eating some rice. Kaushika instantly gives his food away to Indra and resumes his meditation. Kaushika also finally masters his passions, refusing to be provoked by any of Indra's testing and seductive interferences.\n\nAt the penultimate culmination of a multi-thousand-year journey, Kaushika's yogic power is at a peak. At this point, Brahma, as the head of [[deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] led by Indra, names Kaushika a [[Brahmarishi]] and names him ''Vishvamitra'' or ''Friend of All'' for his unlimited compassion. He then goes to meet Vashishta. It was customary that, if a sage was greeted by an equal or superior person, the sage would also greet the person. If the sage was greeted by an inferior person, the sage would simply bless them. Initially, when Vishwamitra greeted Vashishta with the pride of being a new Brahmarishi in heart, Vashishta simply blessed him. Suddenly all pride and desire left Vishwamitra's heart and he became a clean and clear Brahmarishi. When Vishwamitra turned back to leave, Vashishta realised a change of heart and proceeded to greet Vishwamitra. Vishwamitra is also embraced by [[Vashista]] and their enmity is instantly ended.\n\n==Gayatri mantra==\n\nVishvamitra is said to have found [[Gayatri Mantra]]. It is a verse from a sukta of Rigveda (Mandala 3.62.10). G\u0101yatr\u012b is the name of the [[Vedic meter]] in which the verse is composed.\n\nGayatri mantra is repeated and cited very widely in Vedic literature{{sfn|Bloomfield|1906|p=392b}} and praised in several well-known classical Hindu texts such as [[Manusmriti]] (\"there is nothing greater than the ''Savitri (Gayatri) Mantra''.\", Manu II, 83),{{sfn|Dutt|2006|p=51}} [[Harivamsa]]{{sfn|Vedas|2003|p=15\u201316}} and [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Rahman|2005|p=300}}{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1994|p=266}} The mantra is an important part of the [[upanayana]] ceremony for young males in [[Hinduism]] and has long been recited by [[dvija]] men as part of their daily rituals. Modern [[Hindu reform movements]] spread the practice of the mantra to include women and all castes and its recitation is now widespread.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=127}}{{sfn|Lipner|1994|p=53}}\n\n==Legends==\n\nVishvamitra is featured in many legends and in different works of the [[Sanatana dharma]].\n\n===Trisanku===\n[[File:Vishwamitra.jpg|thumb|Vishwamitra]]\nAnother story Vishvamitra is known for is his creation of his own version of ''Svarga'' or heaven, called ''Trisanku Svarga''.\n\nWhen a proud King [[Trishanku|Trisanku]] asked his [[Guru]] [[Vashista]] to send him to heaven in his own body, guru responded that the body cannot ascend to heaven. King Trisanku then asked Vashista's hundred sons to send him to heaven. The sons, believing that Trisanku should not come to them after their father had refused, took outrage and cursed Trisanku to be a Chandala. Trisanku was transformed into a person with body smeared of ash, clothed in black and wearing iron jewelry. Unrecognizable to his subjects, he was driven out of the kingdom.\n\nIn his exile, Trisanku came across the sage Vishvamitra, who agreed to help him. Vishvamitra organized a great sacrifice and ritual propitiating the [[deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s, pleading that they accept Trisanku into heaven. Not one Deva responded. Angered, Vishvamitra used his yogic powers and ordered Trisanku to rise to heaven. Miraculously, Trisanku rose into the sky until he reached heaven, where he was pushed back down by [[Indra]].\n\nEnraged even more by this, Vishvamitra commenced the creation of another Universe (including another Brahma) for Trisanku. He had only completed the Universe when [[Brihaspati]] ordered him to stop. Trisanku, however, did not fully transcend through Trisanku [[Svarga]] created for him. He remained fixed and upside-down in the sky and was transformed into a [[constellation]], which is now known as [[Crux]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130045439/http://spaceyuga.com/crux-constellation-hindu-mythological-name-trishanku/|title=Crux \u2013 Trishanku|date=30 January 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n \nIn the process of forming a new universe, Vishvamitra used up all the tapas he had gained from his austerities. Therefore, after the Trisanku episode, Vishvamitra had to start his prayers again to attain the status of a [[Brahmarshi]] and become an equal of Vashista.\n\n===Harishchandra/Ambarisha's sacrifice===\n[[File:Rama breaking the bow.jpg|left|thumb|Rama breaking the bow]]\nWhile undertaking a penance, Kaushika helps a boy named [[Shunashepa]] who has been sold by his parents to be sacrificed at [[Harishchandra]]/[[Ambarisha]]'s [[yagna]] to please [[Varuna]]. The king's son [[Rohit]] does not want to be the one sacrificed, as was originally promised to Varuna, so young [[Shunahshepa|Sunashepa]] is taken. A devastated and terrified [[Shunahshepa|Sunashepa]] falls at the feet of Kaushika, who is deep in meditation and begs for his help.<ref name=\"p1\">Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. ''Ancient Indian Historical Tradition'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.92.</ref>\n\nKaushika teaches secret mantras to Sunashepa. The boy sings these mantras at the ceremony, is blessed by [[Indra]] and [[Varuna]] and Ambarisha's ceremony is completed.\n\nIn another version of the story, Sunahshepa is lost son of Vishvamitra. When Vishvamitra was Prince of Bharats (Kaushik) - and his name was Vishwarath then, he was abducted by the enemy king Shambar. There, Shambar's daughter, Ugra, falls in love with Vishvarath. Ugra convinces Prince Vishvarath to marry her. Looking at the good character of Vishvarath, Shambar also agrees for the marriage. Soon after the marriage, the Bharatas win the battle against Shambar. When theu found their Prince Vishvarath alive, they feel happy but they could not accept Ugra as their future queen as she is an Asura. To convert Ugra into an Aryan, Vishvarath creates Gayatri Mantra, but people still refuse to accept her. Soon she gives birth to a son, but to save the son from the angry people, the greatest female sage [[Lopamudra]] sends the child to a hidden place. To Lopamudra and Vishvarath's sadness, people kill Ugra. But the son is saved, without the knowledge of Vishvarath. This child grows young and he comes to sacrifice himself in the ceremony of Ambarisha (or King Harishchandra).<ref>Munshi, K. M. (1933). Munshi Granthavali : 7.

Taking place in a world of anthropomorphic [[coffee bean]]s, the film tells the story of a bean assassin named Jack Bean, whose alias is Killer Bean, who goes on a mission to hunt a crime boss. The film was preceded by two [[Web series|web]] [[Short film|short]]s: \"Killer Bean: The Interrogation\" and \"Killer Bean 2.1: The Party\".\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins at 2:48 AM. Bean gangsters are throwing a loud party in Baker Street warehouse. Meanwhile, a red bean assassin named Jack \"Killer\" Bean, is at a nearby apartment trying to sleep, and makes a phone call asking the leader to turn down the music. After the gangster leader refuses, Killer Bean goes to the warehouse and confronts him. After the gangsters fire a shot at Killer Bean and miss, Killer Bean ends up killing every one of the gangsters. The last bean killed is revealed to be the nephew of a crime boss named Cappuccino.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4_7-lYjLEI/killerbeanforever.html |title=Youtube: Killer Bean Forever - Entire First Scene (Posted by Killer Bean Studios) |author=|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe police, led by Detective Cromwell, investigate the warehouse shootings. The warehouse is known to be owned by Cappuccino. As the police investigate, Cromwell discovers a bullet which belongs to Killer Bean. Then a lieutenant of Cappuccino named Vagan, arrives at the warehouse. After discovering the massacre, Vagan quickly informs his boss what has happened and that Cappuccino is Killer Bean's next target. Due to Killer Bean's skill, Vagan suggests hiring mercenary soldiers to kill him.\n\nThat morning, Killer Bean saw Cromwell on the news, he tries to assassinate him but receives an encrypted call from his boss warning him that he is being reckless and that the attack on the warehouse should have never happened, and that only the \"target\" should be killed. Killer Bean assures his boss that the mission will succeed.\n\nIn a Chinese restaurant, an assassin named Jet Bean received a call from his boss sending him on a mission, as he leaves, the owner of the restaurant forces him to pay the bill. After Jet Bean refuses, the owner tells his chef that Jet Bean insulted his food, the chef tries to kill him but gets knocked out.\n\nIn Cappuccino's compound, Cappuccino holds a meeting with several beans from his narcotics department, but their apathetic attitude dissuades him. Disappointed and realizing that the meeting was pointless, Cappuccino proceeds to knock two beans out of the building with his baseball bat. Vagan arrives mid-slaughter and reports to Cappuccino that Killer Bean killed his nephew in his warehouse on Baker Street. Enraged, Cappuccino tell Vagan to kill Killer Bean.\n\nMeanwhile, Killer Bean goes to a second warehouse owned by Cappuccino, but finds nothing there but a note. However, it was a trap set up by Vagan who tries to kill him with his sniper rifle. The fight between Vagan and Killer Bean ends as a draw when Killer Bean destroy Vagan's sniper rifle.  Killer Bean then find a note which reads, \"Shadow Bean, you are too late\".\n\nAfter the battle, Killer Bean later goes to a bar across the street. Detective Cromwell spots Killer Bean and walks into the bar to ask him why he is hunting down Cappuccino. Cromwell reveals to Killer Bean that he knows that he was responsible for the warehouse shooting. The bartender comes in wielding a shotgun, and the three beans get into a [[Mexican Standoff]], but Cromwell breaks it up by backing out. Then Cromwell suggests him that they would work together to bring Cappuccino down, but Killer Bean refuses to help. Later, Cromwell finds the note referencing the \"Shadow Beans\". After a call to Harry, Cromwell discovers that the Shadow Beans were part of the Shadow Agency, a private organization that carried out secret government operations, but presumably disbanded years ago.\n\nIn midnight, Killer Bean locates a third warehouse owned by Cappuccino, evidently attempting to find Cappuccino in there. After killing Cappuccino's gangsters, Killer Bean is confronted by mercenaries hired by Vagan. The mercenaries fail. Vagan and the biker gangs try to kill him, but they also fail, however, Vagan is able to capture Killer Bean.\n\nCappuccino and his men interrogate Killer Bean by asking him why he wants to kill him, but receives no answers. Killer Bean escapes, and then reveals that he is not after Cappuccino, but rather after Vagan. Cappuccino however, furious at Vagan's deception, tells Vagan that he's fired. Vagan then shoots Cappuccino. Killer Bean explains that he has been sent to kill Vagan, a former Shadow Bean whose real name is Dark Bean. Dark Bean had betrayed the Shadow Agency twelve years ago and had stolen their secret database. Dark Bean then explains that the Shadow Agency had degenerated from an honorable agency into simply guns for hire, and that he was ordered to supply weapons to criminals. Dark Bean claims to have left the Shadow Agency and run guns for Cappuccino so that he could be knowledgeable of all weapon transfers, and thus could fight crime. However, Killer Bean doesn't believe him, and kills Dark Bean. As he lays dying, Dark Bean tell Killer Bean that he has to kill him first. Meanwhile, Jet Bean arrives at Beantown to find and kill Killer Bean.\n\nDetective Cromwell witnesses the entire fight, and orders the entire police department to capture Killer Bean. Killer Bean gives up, assuming that only the police can protect him from the Shadow Agency, and presumably because he would have to kill police officers. Back at Cappuccino's warehouse, Jet Bean ask the police where is Killer Bean. However, one of the officers insults him in an Asian accent. Jet Bean, furious, assaults the officer and is promptly arrested.\n\nMeanwhile, Detective Cromwell decided to leave for the night, and Jet Bean, arriving at the prison, frees himself and kills all police beans, before finding Killer Bean in his cell. Killer Bean explains to Jet Bean that the Shadow Agency has gone criminal, but Jet Bean doesn't believe him. The two have a lengthy fight, but Jet Bean is far superior in his combat skills. However, Killer Bean finally gains the upper hand and manages to shoot Jet Bean.\n\nKiller Bean then contacts the Shadow Agency leader on Jet Bean's cell phone. The leader suggests Killer Bean come in to \"talk things over\". Killer Bean says he will come in, but it won't be for talking. The film ends with Killer Bean finding a armoured van with a cache of police weapons, and driving the vehicle to travel to the Shadow Agency's base and confront the leader once and for all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* Vegas E.

Jeff Lew intended this short only to teach himself animation, and it only received about 3000 hits. After practicing animation for about 2 years, Lew started work on \"Killer Bean 2.1: The Party\", a 7-minute short. \"Killer Bean 2\" took about 3 years to create, and was released on [[iFilm]] in 2000. In about 6 months, it received about a million views, which was significant before YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killerbeanforever.com/director.html|title=Killer Bean Forever About the Director|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819102651/http://www.killerbeanforever.com/director.html|archive-date=August 19, 2011|url-status=|accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref> A later edit, \"Killer Bean 2.1\", was uploaded to YouTube in 2009.

The first rough draft of the screen play took about 5 months. [[Previsualization]] (previz) took about one and a half years. One mistake Lew regretted was not making the concept art before previz, which meant that many of the previz shots could not be reused for final animation. Lew then posted an ad on [[Craigslist]] for voices, and auditioned about 20 people and cast four. The concept artist for the characters was Von Caberte.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cabertevon.com/?cat=28 |title=Killer Bean Forever: The Art of Cabertevon |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=21 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813010508/http://cabertevon.com/?cat=28 |archive-date=13 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By July 2005, all preproduction was completed.\n\nThe film took about five years to create, with approximately one and half years in pre-production and three years in animation.

Meanwhile, Jet Bean arrives at Beantown to find and kill Killer Bean.\n\nDetective Cromwell witnesses the entire fight, and orders the entire police department to capture Killer Bean. Killer Bean gives up, assuming that only the police can protect him from the Shadow Agency, and presumably because he would have to kill police officers. Back at Cappuccino's warehouse, Jet Bean ask the police where is Killer Bean. However, one of the officers insults him in a Asian accent. Jet Bean, furious, assaults the officer and is promptly arrested.\n\nMeanwhile, Detective Cromwell decided to leave for the night, and Jet Bean, arriving at the prison, frees himself and kills all police beans, before finding Killer Bean in his cell. Killer Bean explains to Jet Bean that the Shadow Agency has gone criminal, but Jet Bean doesn't believe him. The two have a lengthy fight, but Jet Bean is far superior in his combat skills. However, Killer Bean finally gains the upper hand and manages to shoot Jet Bean.\n\nKiller Bean then contacts the Shadow Agency leader on Jet Bean's cell phone. The leader suggests Killer Bean come in to \"talk things over\". Killer Bean says he will come in, but it won't be for talking. The film ends with Killer Bean finding a armoured van with a cache of police weapons, and driving the vehicle to travel to the Shadow Agency's base and confront the leader once and for all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* Vegas E.

Jeff Lew intended this short only to teach himself animation, and it only received about 3000 hits. After practicing animation for about 2 years, Lew started work on \"Killer Bean 2.1: The Party\", a 7-minute short. \"Killer Bean 2\" took about 3 years to create, and was released on [[iFilm]] in 2000. In about 6 months, it received about a million views, which was significant before YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killerbeanforever.com/director.html|title=Killer Bean Forever About the Director|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819102651/http://www.killerbeanforever.com/director.html|archive-date=August 19, 2011|url-status=|accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref> A later edit, \"Killer Bean 2.1\", was uploaded to YouTube in 2009.

The first rough draft of the screen play took about 5 months. [[Previsualization]] (previz) took about one and a half years. One mistake Lew regretted was not making the concept art before previz, which meant that many of the previz shots could not be reused for final animation. Lew then posted an ad on [[Craigslist]] for voices, and auditioned about 20 people and cast four. The concept artist for the characters was Von Caberte.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cabertevon.com/?cat=28 |title=Killer Bean Forever: The Art of Cabertevon |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=21 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813010508/http://cabertevon.com/?cat=28 |archive-date=13 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By July 2005, all preproduction was completed.\n\nThe film took about five years to create, with approximately one and half years in pre-production and three years in animation.

A spot in the sequence called for Goldberg to pound on the windshield of the limousine with his hands. To ensure his safety, Goldberg had assistance from a piece of metal pipe and his hands were covered in black tape. After this, Goldberg was to break some of the vehicle's windows with the pipe. There were four windows on the side of the limousine and Goldberg used the pipe on two of them. He then got aggressive, dropping the pipe and putting his forearm through the third window.

A spot in the sequence called for Goldberg to pound on the windshield of the limousine with his hands. To ensure his safety, Goldberg had assistance from a piece of metal pipe and his hands were covered in black tape. After this, Goldberg was to break some of the vehicle's windows with the pipe. There were four windows on the side of the limousine and Goldberg used the pipe on two of them. He then got aggressive, dropping the pipe and putting his forearm through the third window.

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|Barfleur]], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the Formidable) joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.86-89</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.90</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.91</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the \"Zele\" and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|\"Magnanime\"]]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.92</ref>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|Monarch]], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|Valiant]], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|Centaur]] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|Belliqueux]]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS Marlborough]] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.103</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' raised the red flag to permit the Marlborough to open fire and engage the French. At this point the Marlborough was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|Dauphin Royal]] who received her full broadside.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.104</ref>\n\nSixteen ships in line separated the Marlborough from the formidable and each stood 200m apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind Marlborough was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS Arrogant]]. Arrogant had been recently re-equipped and managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS Alcide]] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS Nonsuch]] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS Conqueror]] under Captain George Balfour.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.105</ref>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on [[HMS Princessa]] who was in command of the first 12 vessels. Princessa was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS Torbay]] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS Anson]] under Captain William Blair. Captain Blair on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS Fame]] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS Russell]] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.107</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS America]] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS Hercules]] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS Prothee]] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm. He later died of these wounds.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.110</ref> Resolution was followed by [[HMS Duke]] under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAs Formidable was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed, As she passed de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The Ville de Paris was already damaged by the 15 ships ahead of Formidable in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.113</ref> Formidable entered the smoke and approached the Ville de Paris at 8.40am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.117</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the Formidable in sequence behind the Ville de Paris, the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|Couronne]], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|\u00c9veill\u00e9]] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|Sceptre]] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.119</ref>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the Ville de Paris under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|Diadem]] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless Glorieux). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the Formidable on the day.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.123</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship \u2018Formidable\u2019 breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the Formidables three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.126</ref>\n\nThe Diadem appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The Formidable was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS Repulse]] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS Ajax]] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled Glorieux.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.122</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS Bedford]], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|Cesar]] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The Bedford was followed by Hood's red squadron. This broke the French line into three sections.\n\nIn the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS Prince William]] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]] had somehow passed the Bedford, and Bedford was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The whole red squadron then passed between Cesar and Hector, causing each to be crippled.The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS Royal Oak]], passed the stern of the Cesar and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.131</ref>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks... attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the Ville de Paris.In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.133</ref>\n\n===French flight===\n\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS Richmond]], now renamed Richemont, under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled Glorieux. [[French ship Souverain|Souverain]] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the Glorieux was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lt Trogoff de Kerlessi. The ''Souverain'' and ''Richmond'' retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the ''Royal Oak''. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS ''Monarch'' stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and forty barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.137</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, ''[[HMS Centaur]]'' and ''[[HMS Bedford]]'' attacked the stricken {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}} which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul. After a further ten minutes the ship was dismasted, and Paul then surrendered to the ''Centaur''.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.138</ref>\n\nThe French tried to restore order; around 1:30 pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled line on the port tack, but this was not fulfilled; he was soon battling Hood's 90-gun HMS ''Barfleur''.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest. in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. ''C\u00e9sar'', which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> ''Ardent'' soon followed, being taken by the rest of the British centre.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\"/>\n[[File:Fin du C\u00e9sar-Dumoulin-IMG 5478.JPG|thumb|''The end of the C\u00e9sar'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nAt 4 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', alone and being battered by ''Barfleur'', with little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated. [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, succeeded in rallying eight ships of his own division.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n===End of the battle===\nFinally, the isolated ''Ville de Paris'', being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood took the surrender; the boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, Ville de Paris presented a scene of complete horror.

Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> With a fire out of control, the [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]] aboard the ''C\u00e9sar'' exploded, killing more than 400 French and 50 British sailors, although many men jumped overboard trying to avoid the disaster.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, learning of Grasse's fate, assumed command of the scattered French naval fleet.

The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|Barfleur]], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the Formidable) joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.86-89</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.90</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.91</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the \"Zele\" and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|\"Magnanime\"]]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.92</ref>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|Monarch]], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|Valiant]], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|Centaur]] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|Belliqueux]]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS Marlborough]] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.103</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' raised the red flag to permit the Marlborough to open fire and engage the French. At this point the Marlborough was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|Dauphin Royal]] who received her full broadside.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.104</ref>\n\nSixteen ships in line separated the Marlborough from the formidable and each stood 200m apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind Marlborough was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS Arrogant]]. Arrogant had been recently re-equipped and managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS Alcide]] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS Nonsuch]] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS Conqueror]] under Captain George Balfour.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.105</ref>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on [[HMS Princessa]] who was in command of the first 12 vessels. Princessa was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS Torbay]] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS Anson]] under Captain William Blair. Captain Blair on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS Fame]] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS Russell]] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.107</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS America]] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS Hercules]] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS Prothee]] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm. He later died of these wounds.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.110</ref> Resolution was followed by [[HMS Duke]] under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAs Formidable was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed, As she passed de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The Ville de Paris was already damaged by the 15 ships ahead of Formidable in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.113</ref> Formidable entered the smoke and approached the Ville de Paris at 8.40am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.117</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the Formidable in sequence behind the Ville de Paris, the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|Couronne]], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|\u00c9veill\u00e9]] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|Sceptre]] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.119</ref>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the Ville de Paris under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|Diadem]] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless Glorieux). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the Formidable on the day.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.123</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship \u2018Formidable\u2019 breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the Formidables three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.126</ref>\n\nThe Diadem appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The Formidable was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS Repulse]] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS Ajax]] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled Glorieux.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.122</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS Bedford]], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|Cesar]] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The Bedford was followed by Hood's red squadron. This broke the French line into three sections.\n\nIn the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS Prince William]] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]] had somehow passed the Bedford, and Bedford was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The whole red squadron then passed between Cesar and Hector, causing each to be crippled.The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS Royal Oak]], passed the stern of the Cesar and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.131</ref>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks... attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the Ville de Paris.In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.133</ref>\n\n===French flight===\n\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS Richmond]], now renamed Richemont, under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled Glorieux. [[French ship Souverain|Souverain]] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the Glorieux was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lt Trogoff de Kerlessi. The Souverain and Richmond retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the Royal Oak. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS Monarch stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and 40 barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.137</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, [[HMS Centaur]] and [[HMS Bedford]] attacked the stricken Cesar which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul. After a further ten minutes the ship was demasted, and Paul then surrendered to the Centaur.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.138</ref>\n\nThe French tried to restore order; around 1:30 pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled line on the port tack, but this was not fulfilled; he was soon battling Hood's 90-gun HMS ''Barfleur''.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest. in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}}, which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> ''Ardent'' soon followed, being taken by the rest of the British centre.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\"/>\n[[File:Fin du C\u00e9sar-Dumoulin-IMG 5478.JPG|thumb|''The end of the C\u00e9sar'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nAt 4 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', alone and being battered by ''Barfleur'', with little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated. [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, succeeded in rallying eight ships of his own division.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n===End of the battle===\nFinally, the isolated ''Ville de Paris'', being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood took the surrender; the boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, Ville de Paris presented a scene of complete horror.

Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> With a fire out of control, the [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]] aboard the ''C\u00e9sar'' exploded, killing more than 400 French and 50 British sailors, although many men jumped overboard trying to avoid the disaster.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, learning of Grasse's fate, assumed command of the scattered French naval fleet.

The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008
