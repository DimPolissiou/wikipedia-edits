Its lead character is Prince Adam, the young son of Eternia's rulers, [[King Randor]] and [[Queen Marlena]]. Whenever Prince Adam holds the [[The Power Sword|Sword of Power]] aloft and proclaims \"By the Power of Grayskull!\" he is endowed with \"fabulous secret powers\" and transformed into [[He-Man]], the most powerful man in the universe. Together with his close allies, [[Battle Cat]] (who undergoes a similar transformation from being Adam's cowardly pet tiger Cringer), [[Sorceress of Castle Grayskull|The Sorceress]], [[Teela]], [[Man-At-Arms]] and [[Orko (fictional character)|Orko]], He-Man uses his powers to defend Eternia from the evil forces of [[Skeletor]]. Skeletor's main goal is to conquer the mysterious fortress of [[Castle Grayskull]], from which He-Man draws his powers.

The resulting series, ''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'', debuted through [[broadcast syndication|barter syndication]] in September 1983,{{#tag:ref|In the practice of barter syndication, production companies give television stations a series for free, in exchange for advertising.<ref name=pantheon>{{cite book|last=Engelhardt|first=Tom|editor1-last=Gitlin|editor1-first=Todd|title=Watching Television: A Pantheon Guide to Popular Culture|chapter=Children's Television: The Shortcake Strategy|pages=[https://archive.org/details/watchingtelevisi00gitl/page/76 76\u201377]|isbn=0-394-74651-1|year=1986|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] ([[Random House]])|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/watchingtelevisi00gitl/page/76}}</ref>|group=nb}} and became the first syndicated show to be based on a toy.  By 1984, it was seen on 120 U.S. stations and in more than 30 countries.<ref name=pantheon/>\n\nDespite the [[limited animation]] techniques that were used to produce the series, ''He-Man'' was notable for breaking the boundaries of [[censorship]] that had severely restricted the narrative scope of children's TV programming in the 1970s. For the first time in years, a cartoon series could feature a muscular [[superhero]] who was actually allowed to hit people (although he more typically used wrestling-style moves rather than actually punching enemies), though he still could not use his sword often; more often than not He-Man opted to pick up his opponents and toss them away rather than hit them. The cartoon was controversial in that it was produced in connection with marketing a line of toys; [[advertising to children]] was itself controversial during this period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-06-30-fi-191-story.html|title=Marketing to Children Raises Big Questions|date=June 30, 1986|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, advertising regulations forbade commercials for He-Man toys to accompany the program itself. In similar fashion to other shows at the time, notably ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe]]'', an attempt to mitigate the negative publicity generated by this controversy was made by including a \"life lesson\" or \"moral of the story\" at the end of each episode. This moral was usually directly tied to the action or central theme of that episode.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|title=CONTROVERSY ABOUT TOYS, TV VIOLENCE a|work=New York Times|date=1985-12-12|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/12/garden/controversy-about-toys-tv-violence.html|accessdate=2010-03-04|first=Glenn|last=Collins|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627180620/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/12/garden/controversy-about-toys-tv-violence.html|archivedate=2012-06-27}}</ref><ref name=\"Diamond\">{{cite news|title=Marketing to Children Raises Big Questions|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=1986-06-30|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-30/business/fi-191_1_slime-pit|accessdate=2010-03-04|first=S.

Whenever Prince Adam holds the [[The Power Sword|Sword of Power]] aloft and proclaims \"By the Power of Grayskull!\" he is endowed with \"fabulous secret powers\" and transformed into [[He-Man]], the most powerful man in the universe.

By 1984, it was seen on 120 U.S. stations and in more than 30 countries.<ref name=pantheon/>\n\nDespite the [[limited animation]] techniques that were used to produce the series, ''He-Man'' was notable for breaking the boundaries of [[censorship]] that had severely restricted the narrative scope of children's TV programming in the 1970s. For the first time in years, a cartoon series could feature a muscular [[superhero]] who was actually allowed to hit people (although he more typically used wrestling-style moves rather than actually punching enemies), though he still could not use his sword often; more often than not He-Man opted to pick up his opponents and toss them away rather than hit them. The cartoon was controversial in that it was produced in connection with marketing a line of toys; [[advertising to children]] was itself controversial during this period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-06-30-fi-191-story.html|title=Marketing to Children Raises Big Questions|date=June 30, 1986|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, advertising regulations forbade commercials for He-Man toys to accompany the program itself. In similar fashion to other shows at the time, notably ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe]]'', an attempt to mitigate the negative publicity generated by this controversy was made by including a \"life lesson\" or \"moral of the story\" at the end of each episode. This moral was usually directly tied to the action or central theme of that episode.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|title=CONTROVERSY ABOUT TOYS, TV VIOLENCE a|work=New York Times|date=1985-12-12|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/12/garden/controversy-about-toys-tv-violence.html|accessdate=2010-03-04|first=Glenn|last=Collins|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627180620/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/12/garden/controversy-about-toys-tv-violence.html|archivedate=2012-06-27}}</ref><ref name=\"Diamond\">{{cite news|title=Marketing to Children Raises Big Questions|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=1986-06-30|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-30/business/fi-191_1_slime-pit|accessdate=2010-03-04|first=S.

Between 2004 and 2011, the nation achieved eight consecutive top ten placements in the final. To this point, Greece in {{ESCYr|2016}} with [[Argo (band)|Argo]]'s \"[[Utopian Land]]\" failed to qualify from the semi-finals for the first time ever, being absent from the final for the first time since 2000.

Since 2010, the Greek entry has been selected via a national final that featured a competition among several artists and songs with the votes of an expert jury and a public televote deciding the Greek Eurovision entry.\n\n==Before Eurovision==\n=== Internal selection of performer ===\nIn December 2016, it was revealed that [[Demy (singer)|Demy]] and the duo Stereo Soul would compete in a national final with two songs each. These rumors continued until 13 January 2017, when ERT officially revealed that Demy would be the representative of the country at the 62nd Eurovision Song Contest. [[Dimitris Kontopoulos]] and Fokas Evangelinos (the so-called from public \"Dream Team\") were announced officially as the composer and the chorographer respectively.\n\n=== Ellinik\u00f3s Telik\u00f3s 2017 ===\nLater the day of Demy's announcement as performer at Eurovision, ERT revealed that [[Dimitris Kontopoulos]] (the selected songwriter) will write three songs for Demy, that they would compete in a national final with video clips at late February 2017 where the Greek public, would select their favorite song. Voting to select the song at the national final was conducted through 100% televoting and SMS texting by the public. The three songs were in [[English language]] and each one of the songs are in different genres. ''The first song is a ballad, the second one is a dance song and the third is surprise'', Demy said at 19 January, when she was invited by ERT t\u03bf gave her first interview after the announcement as the representative of country at Eurovision. The official video clips were recorded in both [[Greece]] and [[Ukraine]], especially in the city of [[Odessa]], in order to show the hellenism of the city and ''to build bridges of friendship between the two countries''.\n\nLater, ERT announced the date of the national final, being the 6th of March, with presenters the journalist Elena Bouzala and the actor-comedian Antonis Loudaros. On 28 February 2017, the titles of the songs were announced. [[Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017|The representative of Cyprus]], [[Hovig Demirjian|Hovig]] and [[Moldova in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017|the representative of Moldova]], [[SunStroke Project]] were the guests of the night, singing the Cypriot entry \"[[Gravity (Hovig song)|Gravity]]\" and the Moldovan entry \"[[Hey, Mamma!]]\" respectively.\n\nInitially, ERT announced that the winning song would be selected by 100% televoting. Later, it was announced that for the first time, together with the public, the song would be selected by a jury of Greek communities of [[Greek diaspora|the Diaspora]].\n\nIn particular, their vote gave representatives of communities from [[Belgium]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Germany]] ([[Munich]] and [[Nuremberg]]), [[Armenia]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]] and [[Ukraine]].

The Greek national broadcaster [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ERT) held a national final on 6 March 2017, at which three songs written by Kontopoulos were performed by Demy. The song with the highest percentage was selected represent the country. Eventually, \"This Is Love\" performed by Demy was selected as the Greek entry for the 2017 in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]].\n\nGreece was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 9 May 2017. Performing during the show in position 10, \"This Is Love\" was announced among the top 10 entries of the first semi-final and therefore qualified to compete in the final on 13 May.\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\nPrior to the 2016 contest, Greece had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest thirty-six times since their debut in {{Escyr|1974}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greece {{!}} Country profile {{!}} Eurovision Song Contest|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-country/country?country=19|website=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> The nation has won the contest on one occasion in {{ESCYr|2005}} with the song \"[[My Number One]]\" performed by [[Helena Paparizou]]. Following the [[Eurovision Song Contest#Semi-finals|introduction of semi-finals]] for the {{ESCYr|2004|2004 contest}}, Greece has managed to thus far qualify to the final with each of their entries. Between 2004 and 2011, the nation achieved eight consecutive top ten placements in the final. To this point, Greece in {{ESCYr|2016}} with [[Argo (band)|Argo]]'s \"[[Utopian Land]]\" failed to qualify from the semi-finals for the first time ever, being absent from the final for the first time since 2000. This was Greece's worst result at the contest.\n\nThe Greek national broadcaster, [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ERT), broadcasts the event within Greece and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. ERT had been in charge of Greece's participation in the contest since their debut in 1974 until 2013 when the broadcaster was shutdown by a government directive and replaced with the interim [[Dimosia Tileorasi]] (DT) and then later by the [[New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television]] (NERIT) broadcaster.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Savaricas|first1=Nathalie|title=Greece's state-run TV service resumes with a blast from the past|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greeces-state-run-tv-service-resumes-with-a-blast-from-the-past-8703956.html|website=independent.co.uk|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=18 January 2016|date=11 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Greece's replacement public broadcaster launched|url=http://www.dw.com/en/greeces-replacement-public-broadcaster-launched/a-17612095|website=dw.com|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|accessdate=18 January 2016|date=4 May 2014}}</ref> Following the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|January 2015 Greek legislative election]], a draft proposal was initiated to reinstate ERT as the public Greek broadcaster.

Since 2010, the Greek entry has been selected via a national final that featured a competition among several artists and songs with the votes of an expert jury and a public televote deciding the Greek Eurovision entry.\n\n==Before Eurovision==\n=== Internal selection of performer ===\nIn December 2016, it was revealed that [[Demy (singer)|Demy]] and the duo Stereo Soul would compete in a national final with two songs each. These rumors continued until 13 January 2017, when ERT officially revealed that Demy would be the representative of the country at the 62nd Eurovision Song Contest. [[Dimitris Kontopoulos]] and Fokas Evangelinos (the so-called from public \"Dream Team\") were announced officially as the composer and the chorographer respectively.\n\n=== Ellinik\u00f3s Telik\u00f3s 2017 ===\nLater the day of Demy's announcement as performer at Eurovision, ERT revealed that [[Dimitris Kontopoulos]] (the selected songwriter) will write three songs for Demy, that they would compete in a national final with video clips at late February 2017 where the Greek public, would select their favorite song. Voting to select the song at the national final was conducted through 100% televoting and SMS texting by the public. The three songs were in [[English language]] and each one of the songs are in different genres. ''The first song is a ballad, the second one is a dance song and the third is surprise'', Demy said at 19 January, when she was invited by ERT t\u03bf gave her first interview after the announcement as the representative of country at Eurovision. The official video clips were recorded in both [[Greece]] and [[Ukraine]], especially in the city of [[Odessa]], in order to show the hellenism of the city and ''to build bridges of friendship between the two countries''.\n\nLater, ERT announced the date of the national final, being the 6th of March, with presenters the journalist Elena Bouzala and the actor-comedian Antonis Loudaros. In 28 February 2017, the titles of the songs were announced. [[Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017|\u03a4he representative of Cyprus]], [[Hovig Demirjian|Hovig]] and [[Moldova in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017|the representative of Moldova]], [[SunStroke Project]] were the guests of the night, singing the Cypriot entry \"[[Gravity (Hovig song)|Gravity]]\" and the Moldovan entry \"[[Hey, Mamma!]]\" respectively.\n\nInitially, ERT announced that the winning song would be selected by 100% televoting. Later, it was announced that for the first time, together with the public, the song would be selected by a jury of Greek communities of [[Greek diaspora|the Diaspora]].\n\nIn particular, their vote gave representatives of communities from [[Belgium]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Germany]] ([[Munich]] and [[Nuremberg]]), [[Armenia]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]] and [[Ukraine]].
