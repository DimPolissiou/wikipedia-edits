In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the [[Pueblo Revolt]], until 1692 when [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was reconquered and once again became the capital.\n\nThe [[Texas Revolution]] (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side.<ref name=\"elpaso7475\">''El Paso, A Borderlands History'', by W.H. Timmons, pp. 74, 75</ref> The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\n\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral]] which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with [[San Elizario, Texas|San Elizario]] as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of [[Cross-border town naming]] until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring [[Anson Mills]] to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.<ref name=\"handbook\">{{Handbook of Texas | id=hde01 | name=El Paso, Texas}}</ref>[[File:El Paso c1880.jpg|thumb|El Paso circa 1880|alt=|left]]During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union [[California Column]] in 1862.

The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild [[boomtown]] known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the [[Department of the Army]] pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez).

However, this period was short-lived as the [[Mexican Revolution]] greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast [[Plan de San Diego]] which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens.<ref name=TSHAPSD>{{cite web | url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ngp04 | publisher=Texas State Historical Association | title=Plan of San Diego | accessdate=October 4, 2015| date=June 15, 2010 }}</ref> The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives.

The [[El Paso and Northeastern Railway]] was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by [[Prohibition era|Prohibition-era]] bootlegging.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger [[Great Depression]] was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the [[Depression era]] overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nDuring and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the [[Permian Basin (North America)]], helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, [[Petroleum|oil]] refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the [[bracero program]] which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[Farah strike|The Farah Strike]], 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas.

El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the [[Sunset Heights]] district. It is close to the [[El Paso International Airport]], the international border, and [[Fort Bliss]]. It is part of the [[El Paso Independent School District]].\n\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the [[white American]] residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic-American]] residents lived in an area called [[Chihuahuita]] (\"little [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area.<ref>Metz, Leon. \"[http://www.elpasotimes.com/sunbowl/ci_4749639 Downtown El Paso has colorful history] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120731023721/http://www.elpasotimes.com/sunbowl/ci_4749639 |date=July 31, 2012 }}.\" [[El Paso Times]].

Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like [[east El Paso]] and [[northwest El Paso]], but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at [[Ft. Bliss]] in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at [[Andress High School]], [[Parkland High School (Texas)|Parkland High School]], [[Irvin High School]], and [[Captain John L. Chapin High School|Chapin High School]].\n\n===East El Paso===\n{{main|East El Paso}}\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/censusexplorer/censusexplorer.html|title=Census Explorer|last=|first=|date=|website=census.gov|access-date=February 25, 2019}}</ref> It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/07/01/197623129/the-zip-code-turns-50-today-here-are-9-that-stand-out |title= The ZIP Code Turns 50 Today; Here Are 9 That Stand Out| publisher=NPR |year=2013 |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Mission Valley===\n{{main|Mission Valley (El Paso)}}\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind [[east El Paso]] and [[central El Paso]]. Hawkins Road and [[Interstate 10]] border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day [[Texas]] was under the rule of [[Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (New Spain).\n\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: [[Ysleta Mission]]-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), [[Socorro Mission]]-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and [[San Elizario Chapel]] (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\n\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. [[Don Juan de O\u00f1ate]], a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared [[La Toma]] (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\n[[Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo]] (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\n\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n===Texas and New Mexico suburbs===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are [[Socorro, Texas|Socorro]], [[Horizon City, Texas|Horizon City]], [[Fort Bliss]] and [[San Elizario, Texas|San Elizario]]. Other Texas suburbs are [[Anthony, Texas|Anthony]], [[Canutillo, Texas|Canutillo]], [[Sparks, Texas|Sparks]], [[Fabens, Texas|Fabens]], and [[Vinton, Texas|Vinton]].\n\nAlthough [[Anthony, New Mexico|Anthony]], [[Santa Teresa, New Mexico|Santa Teresa]], [[Sunland Park, New Mexico|Sunland Park]], and [[Chaparral, New Mexico|Chaparral]] lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]] metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/List4.txt.html |title=Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Components |publisher=U.S Census Bureau |date=November 2004 |accessdate=June 27, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Cityscape===\n{{wide image|El_paso_city.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|A panoramic view of El Paso, looking northeast through south, near Scenic Drive.

During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support [[University of Texas at El Paso]] athletics.

First opening to the public as the El Paso Aerial Tramway, the facility provided rides from 1960 to 1986, when high liability insurance costs forced the tram to stop public operations. The tram was only used to service the transmitter towers. Wyler donated the tramway for public use in his will.

In any given climbing season, which generally lasts from October through March, it is common for climbers from across Europe, Asia, and Australia to visit the park. Since implementation of the Public Use Plan, following a brief closure of the entire park due to the park service's inability to manage the growing crowds of international climbers, volunteer or commercial guides are required to access more than 2/3 of the park's area. Only North Mountain is accessible without guides, and then only for about 70 people at any given time.

In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the [[Pueblo Revolt]], until 1692 when [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was reconquered and once again became the capital.\n\nThe [[Texas Revolution]] (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side.<ref name=\"elpaso7475\">''El Paso, A Borderlands History'', by W.H. Timmons, pp. 74, 75</ref> The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\n\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral]] which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with [[San Elizario, Texas|San Elizario]] as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of [[Cross-border town naming]] until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring [[Anson Mills]] to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.<ref name=\"handbook\">{{Handbook of Texas | id=hde01 | name=El Paso, Texas}}</ref>[[File:El Paso c1880.jpg|thumb|El Paso circa 1880|alt=|left]]During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union [[California Column]] in 1862.

The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild [[boomtown]] known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the [[Department of the Army]] pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez).

Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso.

These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.<ref name=TSHAPSD />\n\nSimultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund.<ref>{{Cite book| title = ''Mexicans \"of the better class\": The elite culture and ideology of Porfirian Chihuahua and its influence on the Mexican American generation, 1876\u20131936''| author = V\u00edctor M.

The [[El Paso and Northeastern Railway]] was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by [[Prohibition era|Prohibition-era]] bootlegging.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger [[Great Depression]] was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the [[Depression era]] overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nDuring and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the [[Permian Basin (North America)]], helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, [[Petroleum|oil]] refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the [[bracero program]] which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[Farah strike|The Farah Strike]], 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas.

El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the [[Sunset Heights]] district. It is close to the [[El Paso International Airport]], the international border, and [[Fort Bliss]]. It is part of the [[El Paso Independent School District]].\n\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the [[white American]] residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic-American]] residents lived in an area called [[Chihuahuita]] (\"little [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area.<ref>Metz, Leon. \"[http://www.elpasotimes.com/sunbowl/ci_4749639 Downtown El Paso has colorful history] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120731023721/http://www.elpasotimes.com/sunbowl/ci_4749639 |date=July 31, 2012 }}.\" [[El Paso Times]].

Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like [[east El Paso]] and [[northwest El Paso]], but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at [[Ft. Bliss]] in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at [[Andress High School]], [[Parkland High School (Texas)|Parkland High School]], [[Irvin High School]], and [[Captain John L. Chapin High School|Chapin High School]].\n\n===East El Paso===\n{{main|East El Paso}}\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/censusexplorer/censusexplorer.html|title=Census Explorer|last=|first=|date=|website=census.gov|access-date=February 25, 2019}}</ref> It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/07/01/197623129/the-zip-code-turns-50-today-here-are-9-that-stand-out |title= The ZIP Code Turns 50 Today; Here Are 9 That Stand Out| publisher=NPR |year=2013 |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Mission Valley===\n{{main|Mission Valley (El Paso)}}\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind [[east El Paso]] and [[central El Paso]]. Hawkins Road and [[Interstate 10]] border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day [[Texas]] was under the rule of [[Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (New Spain).\n\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: [[Ysleta Mission]]-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), [[Socorro Mission]]-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and [[San Elizario Chapel]] (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\n\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. [[Don Juan de O\u00f1ate]], a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared [[La Toma]] (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\n[[Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo]] (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\n\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n===Texas and New Mexico suburbs===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are [[Socorro, Texas|Socorro]], [[Horizon City, Texas|Horizon City]], [[Fort Bliss]] and [[San Elizario, Texas|San Elizario]]. Other Texas suburbs are [[Anthony, Texas|Anthony]], [[Canutillo, Texas|Canutillo]], [[Sparks, Texas|Sparks]], [[Fabens, Texas|Fabens]], and [[Vinton, Texas|Vinton]].\n\nAlthough [[Anthony, New Mexico|Anthony]], [[Santa Teresa, New Mexico|Santa Teresa]], [[Sunland Park, New Mexico|Sunland Park]], and [[Chaparral, New Mexico|Chaparral]] lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]] metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/List4.txt.html |title=Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Components |publisher=U.S Census Bureau |date=November 2004 |accessdate=June 27, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Cityscape===\n{{wide image|El_paso_city.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|A panoramic view of El Paso, looking northeast through south, near Scenic Drive.

First opening to the public as the El Paso Aerial Tramway, the facility provided rides from 1960 to 1986, when high liability insurance costs forced the tram to stop public operations. The tram was only used to service the transmitter towers. Wyler donated the tramway for public use in his will.

In any given climbing season, which generally lasts from October through March, it is common for climbers from across Europe, Asia, and Australia to visit the park. Since implementation of the Public Use Plan, following a brief closure of the entire park due to the park service's inability to manage the growing crowds of international climbers, volunteer or commercial guides are required to access more than 2/3 of the park's area. Only North Mountain is accessible without guides, and then only for about 70 people at any given time.

Brown's paintings, which are uniformly smooth in surface, typically offer a [[trompe l'oeil]] illusion of turbulent, painterly application. In fact, many viewers of his work have expressed the sensation of wanting to \"lick\" and \"touch\" the paintings.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|title=A real scene stealer: Glenn Brown's 'second-hand' art is the subject of a Tate retrospective|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/a-real-scene-stealer-glenn-browns-secondhand-art-is-the-subject-of-a-tate-retrospective-1622648.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=16 February 2009|location=London}}</ref> Brown uses thin brushes with which he produces particularly elongated curls and twists. The resulting flatness of the painting alludes to its origin as the chosen photograph or digital image.

The computer increases and develops his choices of found imagery, but it is only a means, not the end. [\u2026].

Most paintings share a morbid, almost creepy atmosphere, which is especially underlined by the incorporation of certain unsightly physical features of his figures such as yellowish decaying teeth,<ref>Evident for example in \u201cThe Great Masturbator\u201d from 2006.</ref> translucently white blind-looking eyeballs,<ref>Evident in \u201cSex\u201d from 2003 or \u201cWild Horses\u201d from 2007.</ref> unnatural skin colours<ref>Evident in \u201cDark Star\u201d from 2003, \u201cJoseph Beuys\u201d from 2001, \u201cLed Zeppelin\u201d from 2005 and many more.</ref> and suggestions of foulness and smell emanating from figures' bodies.<ref>See for instance \u201cSpearmint Rhino\u201d from 2009, \u201cGreetings from the Future\u201d from 2005, \u201cKill Yourself\u201d from 2002.</ref> Brown: \"I like my paintings to have one foot in the grave, as it were, and to be not quite of this world.

Brown's sculptures stand in stark contrast to his flat paintings as they bare all the technical features that the paintings deny. The sculptures are created by accumulating thick layers of [[oil paint]] on acrylic and wire, stainless steel or [[fibreglass]] structures with large brushstrokes. In contrast to the flat surfaces of his paintings, the sculptures deliberately emphasize the three-dimensional quality of oil brushstrokes. They are piled up to amorphous heaps of paint with sharp-cutting edges. Brown comments on his three-dimensional use of brushstrokes as follows: \"I see the sculptural brush marks as challenging the logic of paint in that they appear to defy gravity by actually staying upright. For me, they exist within a surreal world that is based on getting paint to do something it shouldn\u2018t do, and to sit in a three-dimensional world that it shouldn\u2018t be in.\".<ref>Quoted in {{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rochelle|title=Glenn Brown|year=2004|publisher=Serpentine Gallery|location=London|pages=99}}</ref> Furthermore, Brown modulates the sculptures by suggestively painting 'shadows' on them.<ref>Brown: \"Like the paintings, the sculptures are always given an imaginary light source. Unlike most sculptures that rely on the light of the room to give them shadow, I paint shadow on the works so they have a light and dark side. Sometimes there will be several different light sources of various colours, for example green light coming from underneath, red coming from one angle and white coming from another. This is partly why the sculptures seem to me to exist within the world of painting; it feels like I\u2019m reaching inside painting to make the sculpture, and because the light source remains on its sculpture, that sculpture never fully leaves the world of painting.\" Quoted in {{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rochelle|title=Glenn Brown|year=2004|publisher=Serpentine Gallery|location=London|pages=99}}</ref> His sculpture \"Three Wise Virgins\" has additional attributes attached to it, such as red clown noses thus ironically rendering them somewhat ridiculous.\n\n==Etchings ==\n[[File:'Half-Life (after Rembrandt) 1' (2016) Glenn Brown.jpg|thumb|'Half-Life (after Rembrandt) 1' (2016) Etching on paper, Velin Arches 400 gsm 76 x 56 cm (29 7/8 x 22 1/8 in) image; 89 x 68 cm (35 x 26 3/4 in)]]\nIn 2008 Brown created a series of prints entitled \"Layered Etchings (Portraits)\" which were inspired by the artists [[Urs Graf]], Rembrandt and [[Lucian Freud]]. Brown scanned a vast number of reproductions from books and digitally manipulated them by stretching them to standard sizes. He then layered selected scans over each other, resulting in single images for which a handful of etching plates were made. The many contour and incarnation lines of the original works (the artist used up to fifteen different image sources for one layered portrait), as well as the textured spots of [[lithograph]]ic printing, obscure the sitters' individual identities. The resulting half-length portraits are \"de-individualised\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Stonard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Glenn Brown Etchings (Portraits)|year=2009|publisher=Ridinghouse/Karsten Schubert Gallery|location=London|pages=8}}</ref> by the deliberate accumulation of too many portraits over each other.\n\nThe etchings were collated in ''Glenn Brown: Etchings (Portraits)'', published by [[Ridinghouse]] in 2009 which featured a specially commissioned text by John-Paul Stonard that discusses elements of the old and the new in the portraits as they embody concepts of destruction and the violence of appropriation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glenn Brown: Etchings|url=http://ridinghouse.co.uk/publications/32/|publisher=Ridinghouse|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Drawings ==\n[[File:'The Music of the Mountains' (2016) Glenn Brown.jpg|thumb|'The Music of the Mountains' (2016) Indian ink and acrylic on panel 135 x 95 x 3 cm (53 1/8 x 37 3/8 x 1 1/8 in)]]\nSince 2013, Glenn Brown has extensively embraced drawing. Still conceptually rooted to art historical references, he stretches, combines, distorts and layers images to create subtle yet complex line-based works. He works with Indian ink, acrylic and oil paint on a variety of papers and panels.\n\n==Controversy==\n\nIn 2000, Turner Prize nominee Glenn Brown was accused of plagiarism by the Times newspaper. Glenn Brown referenced a work by Anthony Roberts for a science fiction novel cover. Photographer [[Wolfgang Tillmans]] won the Turner prize that year, and a legal case brought by Roberts against Brown was settled out of court.<ref>http://www.epuk.org/The-Curve/456/visual-plagiarism?pg=2</ref>\n\nMany of Brown's works are based on works by other artists, from masters like Rembrandt, Fragonard, Van Gogh, Soutine and Delacroix, to contemporary artists like Chris Foss, Tony Roberts and Georg Baselitz, which are then altered in colour, tone or cropping. [[Appropriation (art)]], the operative term used in the art industry, has been employed by many artists in history, but most prominently by [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Richard Prince]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*https://vimeo.com/224295294 Glenn Brown at Museo Stefano Bardini \n*https://vimeo.com/258340509 Glenn Brown in conversation with Xavier Bray on the occasion of 'Come to Dust' at Gagosian Gallery\n*https://vimeo.com/303764755 Glenn Brown Interview accompanying 'Fantasy Landscapes, Portraits and Beasts'  \n*https://vimeo.com/184584054 In Situ: 6 Questions with Glenn Brown\n*https://vimeo.com/179322572 Glenn Brown in conversation with Brice Curiger\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUELar_lLCk&feature=emb_title Glenn Brown in conversation with Jonas Storsve\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kd1S_hY_QY&feature=emb_title Glenn Brown - \"Closed Eyes\" by Odilon Redon for  the Mus\u00e9e D'orsay\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=309&v=JfYvsJoW134&feature=emb_logo Glenn Brown 'After Life' at Museum Het Rembrandthuis\n*https://vimeo.com/258357553 Albert Oehlen interviewed by Glenn Brown \n*https://vimeo.com/254320583 Glenn Brown in conversation with Jeff Fleming on the occasion of a retrospective at the Des Moines Art Center\n*https://vimeo.com/137309687 Glenn Brown lecturing at the College de France about his practice\n* https://vimeo.com/175266526 Glenn Brown first exhibition of drawings and a sculpture at Galerie Max Hetzler, Paris. 5 September - 10 October 2015\n* https://archive.is/20130703015419/http://www.culturecritic.co.uk/blog/culturecritic-interviews-glenn-brown/ CultureCritic interview with Glenn Brown on the occasion of his participation at SNAP Art Festival, Suffolk\n*[http://www.artreview.com/video/mike-stubbs-glenn-brown-keith-tyson Michael Stubbs, Glenn Brown and Keith Tyson in conversation]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pscu04xTkyw Ludwig Museum, Budapest, opening ceremony speeches.

In fact, many viewers of his work have expressed the sensation of wanting to \"lick\" and \"touch\" the paintings.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|title=A real scene stealer: Glenn Brown's 'second-hand' art is the subject of a Tate retrospective|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/a-real-scene-stealer-glenn-browns-secondhand-art-is-the-subject-of-a-tate-retrospective-1622648.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=16 February 2009|location=London}}</ref> Brown uses thin brushes with which he produces particularly elongated curls and twists. The resulting flatness of the painting alludes to its origin as the chosen photograph or digital image. Per the artist Michael Stubbs: \"Brown\u2018s computer-based preparation method prior to painting is [not] the sole reason for his relation with the digital. The computer increases and develops his choices of found imagery, but it is only a means, not the end. [\u2026]. On the contrary, his works are markers for the future of painting because they are both surface effect and material methodology, not despite the screen, but because of it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stubbs|first=Michael|title=Glenn Brown, exhibition catalogue Tate Liverpool|year=2009|publisher=Tate Publishing|location=London|page=108}}</ref>\"\n\nA lot of his titles refer to titles of albums,<ref>See Pablo Lafuente\u2019s summary of album titles resembled in Glenn Brown\u2019s paintings: \"Architecture and Morality (after a 1981 album by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark), Death Disco (a 1979 record by Public Image Ltd.), Alas Dies Laughing (a Cocteau Twins song from 1982), The Osmond Family (after the 1970s American band), and The Three Wise Virgins (after Gladys Brooks\u2019 1957 novel, or maybe after Carlos Schwabe\u2019s 1970s painting, or possibly a 16th-century fresco in Parma). {{cite journal|last=Lafuente|first=Pablo|title=Glenn Brown|journal=Flash Art|date=May\u2013June 2004|page=111}}</ref> film titles,<ref>Such as \"The Rebel\", \"Saturday Night Fever\" or \"The Sound of Music\". {{cite book|last=Gingeras|first=Alison|title=Glenn Brown|year=2004|publisher=Serpentine Gallery|pages=19}}</ref> [[science fiction]] literature,<ref>For example the paintings \"after Chris Foss\", the illustrator of science fiction novels.</ref> or a specific dedication to a person.<ref>Such as the series of paintings dedicated \"for Ian Curtis\", the lead singer of the band Joy Division, or his painting \"Joseph Beuys\" from 2001.</ref> The titles are not obviously connected to the paintings themselves and are not meant to be descriptive of the artwork. Instead they are intended to complement it. Brown: \"That\u2018s it \u2013 the titles are often trying to be embarrassingly direct, and vulgar in their directness. I don\u2018t think that the painting is less direct, but I don\u2018t want the paintings to be illustrative.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=MacRitchie |first=Lynn |title=Interview: Glenn Brown |journal=Art in America |date=3 April 2009 |url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/features/interview-glenn-brown/ |accessdate=8 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Paintings ==\n\nThe subject matter in Glenn Brown's paintings ranges from his early science-fiction landscapes over abstract compositions and still lives to the figurative images based on art historical references. Most paintings share a morbid, almost creepy atmosphere, which is especially underlined by the incorporation of certain unsightly physical features of his figures such as yellowish decaying teeth,<ref>Evident for example in \u201cThe Great Masturbator\u201d from 2006.</ref> translucently white blind-looking eyeballs,<ref>Evident in \u201cSex\u201d from 2003 or \u201cWild Horses\u201d from 2007.</ref> unnatural skin colours<ref>Evident in \u201cDark Star\u201d from 2003, \u201cJoseph Beuys\u201d from 2001, \u201cLed Zeppelin\u201d from 2005 and many more.</ref> and suggestions of foulness and smell emanating from figures' bodies.<ref>See for instance \u201cSpearmint Rhino\u201d from 2009, \u201cGreetings from the Future\u201d from 2005, \u201cKill Yourself\u201d from 2002.</ref> Brown: \"I like my paintings to have one foot in the grave, as it were, and to be not quite of this world. I would like them to exist in a dream world, which I think of as being the place that they occupy, a world that is made up of the accumulation of images that we have stored in our subconscious, and that coagulate and mutate when we sleep.\"<ref>Glenn Brown quoted in {{cite book|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|title=Glenn Brown - Three Exhibitions|year=2009|publisher=Rizzoli/Gagosian Gallery|location=London|pages=70}}</ref>  Many of Brown's portraits depict amorphous beings that have been described as \"tumurous lumps that look like outsized, inflamed organs\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uszynska |first1=Katarzyna |title=Glenn Brown |year=2008 |publisher=Kunsthistorishes Museum |location=Vienna |pages=14 |author2=Wilfried Seipel}}</ref> Often they are ironically attributed with recurring features such as flowers growing out of their compost-like bodies,<ref>See \"The Hinterland\" from 2006, \"Polichinelle\" from 2007, \"The Revolutionary Corps of Teenage Jesus\" from 2005.</ref> hallows placed over heads<ref>See especially Brown\u2019s portraits that reference the works by Frank Auerbach, for example Brown\u2019s \"The Riches of the Poor\" from 2003 or \"Shallow Deaths\" from 2000.</ref> or red noses.<ref>See \"Sex\" from 2003, \"Declining Nude\" from 2006 or \"The Holy Virgin\" from 2003.</ref> In few of these amorphous and abstract forms, female figures are embedded<ref>Such as the female figure in \"God Speed to a Great Astronaut\" from 2007 or \"Asylums of Mars\" from 2006.</ref> within the mottling masses of unidentifiable matter.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holzwarth|first1=Hans W.|title=100 Contemporary Artists A-Z|date=2009|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-1490-3|pages=80\u201387|edition=Taschen's 25th anniversary special}}</ref>\n\n==Sculptures ==\n\nThere are fewer [[sculpture]]s than [[painting]]s in Brown's oeuvre, but they nevertheless form a central point of his practice. Brown's sculptures stand in stark contrast to his flat paintings as they bare all the technical features that the paintings deny. The sculptures are created by accumulating thick layers of [[oil paint]] on acrylic and wire, stainless steel or [[fibreglass]] structures with large brushstrokes. In contrast to the flat surfaces of his paintings, the sculptures deliberately emphasize the three-dimensional quality of oil brushstrokes. They are piled up to amorphous heaps of paint with sharp-cutting edges. Brown comments on his three-dimensional use of brushstrokes as follows: \"I see the sculptural brush marks as challenging the logic of paint in that they appear to defy gravity by actually staying upright. For me, they exist within a surreal world that is based on getting paint to do something it shouldn\u2018t do, and to sit in a three-dimensional world that it shouldn\u2018t be in.\".<ref>Quoted in {{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rochelle|title=Glenn Brown|year=2004|publisher=Serpentine Gallery|location=London|pages=99}}</ref> Furthermore, Brown modulates the sculptures by suggestively painting 'shadows' on them.<ref>Brown: \"Like the paintings, the sculptures are always given an imaginary light source. Unlike most sculptures that rely on the light of the room to give them shadow, I paint shadow on the works so they have a light and dark side. Sometimes there will be several different light sources of various colours, for example green light coming from underneath, red coming from one angle and white coming from another. This is partly why the sculptures seem to me to exist within the world of painting; it feels like I\u2019m reaching inside painting to make the sculpture, and because the light source remains on its sculpture, that sculpture never fully leaves the world of painting.\" Quoted in {{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rochelle|title=Glenn Brown|year=2004|publisher=Serpentine Gallery|location=London|pages=99}}</ref> His sculpture \"Three Wise Virgins\" has additional attributes attached to it, such as red clown noses thus ironically rendering them somewhat ridiculous.\n\n==Etchings ==\n[[File:'Half-Life (after Rembrandt) 1' (2016) Glenn Brown.jpg|thumb|'Half-Life (after Rembrandt) 1' (2016) Etching on paper, Velin Arches 400 gsm 76 x 56 cm (29 7/8 x 22 1/8 in) image; 89 x 68 cm (35 x 26 3/4 in)]]\nIn 2008 Brown created a series of prints entitled \"Layered Etchings (Portraits)\" which were inspired by the artists [[Urs Graf]], Rembrandt and [[Lucian Freud]]. Brown scanned a vast number of reproductions from books and digitally manipulated them by stretching them to standard sizes. He then layered selected scans over each other, resulting in single images for which a handful of etching plates were made. The many contour and incarnation lines of the original works (the artist used up to fifteen different image sources for one layered portrait), as well as the textured spots of [[lithograph]]ic printing, obscure the sitters' individual identities. The resulting half-length portraits are \"de-individualised\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Stonard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Glenn Brown Etchings (Portraits)|year=2009|publisher=Ridinghouse/Karsten Schubert Gallery|location=London|pages=8}}</ref> by the deliberate accumulation of too many portraits over each other.\n\nThe etchings were collated in ''Glenn Brown: Etchings (Portraits)'', published by [[Ridinghouse]] in 2009 which featured a specially commissioned text by John-Paul Stonard that discusses elements of the old and the new in the portraits as they embody concepts of destruction and the violence of appropriation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glenn Brown: Etchings|url=http://ridinghouse.co.uk/publications/32/|publisher=Ridinghouse|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Drawings ==\n[[File:'The Music of the Mountains' (2016) Glenn Brown.jpg|thumb|'The Music of the Mountains' (2016) Indian ink and acrylic on panel 135 x 95 x 3 cm (53 1/8 x 37 3/8 x 1 1/8 in)]]\nSince 2013, Glenn Brown has extensively embraced drawing. Still conceptually rooted to art historical references, he stretches, combines, distorts and layers images to create subtle yet complex line-based works. He works with Indian ink, acrylic and oil paint on a variety of papers and panels.\n\n==Controversy==\n\nIn 2000, Turner Prize nominee Glenn Brown was accused of plagiarism by the Times newspaper. Glenn Brown referenced a work by Anthony Roberts for a science fiction novel cover. Photographer [[Wolfgang Tillmans]] won the Turner prize that year, and a legal case brought by Roberts against Brown was settled out of court.<ref>http://www.epuk.org/The-Curve/456/visual-plagiarism?pg=2</ref>\n\nMany of Brown's works are based on works by other artists, from masters like Rembrandt, Fragonard, Van Gogh, Soutine and Delacroix, to contemporary artists like Chris Foss, Tony Roberts and Georg Baselitz, which are then altered in colour, tone or cropping. [[Appropriation (art)]], the operative term used in the art industry, has been employed by many artists in history, but most prominently by [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Richard Prince]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* https://vimeo.com/137309687 Glenn Brown lecturing at the College de France about his practice\n* https://vimeo.com/175266526 Glenn Brown first exhibition of drawings and a sculpture at Galerie Max Hetzler, Paris. 5 September - 10 October 2015\n* https://archive.is/20130703015419/http://www.culturecritic.co.uk/blog/culturecritic-interviews-glenn-brown/ CultureCritic interview with Glenn Brown on the occasion of his participation at SNAP Art Festival, Suffolk\n*[http://www.artreview.com/video/mike-stubbs-glenn-brown-keith-tyson Michael Stubbs, Glenn Brown and Keith Tyson in conversation]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pscu04xTkyw Ludwig Museum, Budapest, opening ceremony speeches.

Inspired by papers from the [[Berkeley RISC]] project, Acorn considered designing its own processor.<ref name=\"informit\">{{cite book | url=https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1620207 | title=Understanding ARM Architectures | date=23 August 2010 | accessdate=26 May 2013 | author=Chisnall, David}}</ref> A visit to the [[Western Design Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], where the 6502 was being updated by what was effectively a single-person company, showed Acorn engineers [[Steve Furber]] and Sophie Wilson they did not need massive resources and state-of-the-art [[research and development]] facilities.<ref>{{cite book |author=Furber, Stephen B. |title=ARM system-on-chip architecture|publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2000 |isbn=0-201-67519-6 |title-link=ARM system-on-chip architecture}}</ref>\n\nWilson developed the instruction set, writing a simulation of the processor in [[BBC&nbsp;BASIC]] that ran on a BBC&nbsp;Micro with a [[BBC Micro expansion unit#6502 Second Processor|6502 second processor]]. This convinced Acorn engineers they were on the right track. Wilson approached Acorn's CEO, [[Hermann Hauser]], and requested more resources. Hauser gave his approval and assembled a small team to implement Wilson's model in hardware.\n\n===Acorn RISC Machine: ARM2===\nThe official ''Acorn RISC Machine'' project started in October 1983. They chose [[VLSI Technology]] as the ''silicon partner'', as they were a source of ROMs and custom chips for Acorn. Wilson and Furber led the design. They implemented it with efficiency principles similar to the 6502.<ref name=\"zdnet wouldbe\">{{cite news | url=https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/intels-victims-eight-would-be-giant-killers/ | title=Intel's victims: Eight would-be giant killers | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=4 December 2010 | accessdate=7 March 2012| author=Goodwins, Rupert}}</ref> A key design goal was achieving low-latency input/output (interrupt) handling like the 6502. The 6502's memory access architecture had let developers produce fast machines without costly [[direct memory access]] (DMA) hardware.\n\nThe first samples of ARM silicon worked properly when first received and tested on 26 April 1985.<ref name=\"ARM1\" />\n\nThe first ARM application was as a second processor for the BBC&nbsp;Micro, where it helped in developing simulation software to finish development of the support chips (VIDC, IOC, MEMC), and sped up the [[CAD software]] used in ARM2 development. Wilson subsequently rewrote BBC&nbsp;BASIC in ARM assembly language. The in-depth knowledge gained from designing the instruction set enabled the code to be very dense, making ARM BBC&nbsp;BASIC an extremely good test for any ARM emulator. The original aim of a principally ARM-based computer was achieved in 1987 with the release of the [[Acorn Archimedes]].<ref>{{YouTube|hrj-EEnsacQ|Acorn Archimedes Promotion from 1987}}</ref> In 1992, Acorn once more won the [[Queen's Award for Technology]] for the ARM.\n\nThe ARM2 featured a [[32-bit]] [[Bus (computing)|data bus]], [[26-bit]] address space and 27&nbsp;32-bit [[Processor register|registers]]. Eight&nbsp;bits from the [[program counter]] register were available for other purposes; the top six&nbsp;bits (available because of the 26-bit address space) served as status flags, and the bottom two&nbsp;bits (available because the program counter was always [[Data structure alignment|word-aligned]]) were used for setting modes. The address bus was extended to 32&nbsp;bits in the ARM6, but program code still had to lie within the first 64&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MB]] of memory in 26-bit compatibility mode, due to the reserved bits for the status flags.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heyrick.co.uk/assembler/32bit.html|title=32&nbsp;bit operation|author=Richard Murray}}</ref> The ARM2 had a [[microprocessor chronology#1980s|transistor count]] of just 30,000, compared to Motorola's six-year-older 68000 model with around 40,000.<ref name=\"Markus Levy, Convergence Promotions\">{{cite web | url=http://www.reds.ch/share/cours/ReCo/documents/TheHistoryOfTheArmArchitecture.pdf | title=The History of The ARM Architecture: From Inception to IPO | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Levy, Markus}}</ref> Much of this simplicity came from the lack of [[microcode]] (which represents about one-quarter to one-third of the 68000) and from (like most CPUs of the day) not including any [[CPU cache|cache]].

The [[original design manufacturer]] combines the ARM core with other parts to produce a complete device, typically one that can be built in existing [[semiconductor fabrication plant]]s (fabs) at low cost and still deliver substantial performance. The most successful implementation has been the [[ARM7#ARM7TDMI|ARM7TDMI]] with hundreds of millions sold. [[Atmel]] has been a precursor design center in the ARM7TDMI-based embedded system.\n\nThe ARM architectures used in smartphones, PDAs and other [[mobile device]]s range from ARMv5 to ARMv7-A, used in low-end and midrange devices, to ARMv8-A used in current high-end devices.\n\nIn 2009, some manufacturers introduced netbooks based on ARM architecture CPUs, in direct competition with netbooks based on [[Intel Atom]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Always-Innovating-Touch-Book/ |title=ARM netbook ships with detachable tablet |first=Eric |last=Brown |year=2009 |access-date=19 August 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130103181613/http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Always-Innovating-Touch-Book/ |archive-date=3 January 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> According to an 18 July 2011 forecast from analyst firm IHS iSuppli, by 2015, ARM [[integrated circuit]]s may be in 23% of all laptops.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dylan |last=McGrath |work=EE Times |url=https://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4217951/IHS--ARM-ICs-to-be-in-23--of-laptops-in-2015 |title=IHS: ARM ICs to be in 23% of laptops in 2015 |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nArm Holdings offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. Arm Holdings provides to all licensees an integratable hardware description of the ARM core as well as complete software development toolset ([[compiler]], [[debugger]], [[software development kit]]) and the right to sell manufactured [[Semiconductor device|silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\nSoC packages integrating ARM's core designs include Nvidia Tegra's first three generations, CSR plc's Quatro family, ST-Ericsson's Nova and NovaThor, Silicon Labs's Precision32 MCU, Texas Instruments's OMAP products, Samsung's Hummingbird and [[Exynos]] products, Apple's [[Apple A4|A4]], [[Apple A5|A5]], and [[Apple A5X|A5X]], and [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]]'s [[i.MX]].\n\n[[Fabless manufacturing|Fabless]] licensees, who wish to integrate an ARM core into their own chip design, are usually only interested in acquiring a ready-to-manufacture verified [[semiconductor intellectual property core]]. For these customers, Arm Holdings delivers a [[netlist|gate netlist]] description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. More ambitious customers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] ([[Verilog]]) form. With the synthesizable RTL, the customer has the ability to perform architectural level optimisations and extensions. This allows the designer to achieve exotic design goals not otherwise possible with an unmodified netlist ([[Clock rate|high clock speed]], very low power consumption, instruction set extensions, etc.). While Arm Holdings does not grant the licensee the right to resell the ARM architecture itself, licensees may freely sell manufactured product such as chip devices, evaluation boards and complete systems. [[Foundry model|Merchant foundries]] can be a special case; not only are they allowed to sell finished silicon containing ARM cores, they generally hold the right to re-manufacture ARM cores for other customers.\n\nArm Holdings prices its IP based on perceived value. Lower performing ARM cores typically have lower licence costs than higher performing cores. In implementation terms, a synthesizable core costs more than a hard macro (blackbox) core. Complicating price matters, a merchant foundry that holds an ARM licence, such as Samsung or Fujitsu, can offer fab customers reduced licensing costs. In exchange for acquiring the ARM core through the foundry's in-house design services, the customer can reduce or eliminate payment of ARM's upfront licence fee.\n\nCompared to dedicated semiconductor foundries (such as [[TSMC]] and [[United Microelectronics Corporation|UMC]]) without in-house design services, Fujitsu/Samsung charge two- to three-times more per manufactured [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For low to mid volume applications, a design service foundry offers lower overall pricing (through subsidisation of the licence fee). For high volume mass-produced parts, the long term cost reduction achievable through lower wafer pricing reduces the impact of ARM's NRE (Non-Recurring Engineering) costs, making the dedicated foundry a better choice.\n\nCompanies that have developed chips with cores designed by Arm Holdings include [[Amazon.com]]'s [[Annapurna Labs]] subsidiary,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1328624& |title=Amazon Now Sells Own ARM chips |author=Peter Clarke |date=7 January 2016}}</ref> [[Analog Devices]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[AppliedMicro]] (now: [[MACOM Technology Solutions]]<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.macom.com/about/news-and-events/press-release-archive/row-col1/news--event-archive/macom-successfully-completes-a-1|title=MACOM Successfully Completes Acquisition of AppliedMicro|date=26 January 2017}}</ref>), [[Atmel]], [[Broadcom]], [[Cavium]], [[Cypress Semiconductor]], [[Freescale Semiconductor]] (now [[NXP Semiconductors]]), [[Huawei]], [[Intel]],{{Dubious|ARM-based chips and Intel|reason=StrongARM and XScale did not use cores designed by Arm Holdings, and no other ARM-based Intel chips are known|date=December 2019}} [[Maxim Integrated]], [[Nvidia]], [[NXP]], [[Qualcomm]], [[Renesas Electronics|Renesas]], [[Samsung Electronics]], [[ST Microelectronics]], [[Texas Instruments]] and [[Xilinx]].\n\n===Built on ARM Cortex Technology licence===\nIn February 2016, ARM announced the Built on ARM Cortex Technology licence, often shortened to Built on Cortex (BoC) licence. This licence allows companies to partner with ARM and make modifications to ARM Cortex designs. These design modifications will not be shared with other companies. These semi-custom core designs also have brand freedom, for example [[Kryo#Kryo 280|Kryo 280]].\n\nCompanies that are current licensees of Built on ARM Cortex Technology include [[Qualcomm]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/10366/arm-built-on-cortex-license|title=ARM Details Built on ARM Cortex Technology License|last=Frumusanu|first=Andrei|website=www.anandtech.com|access-date=26 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Architectural licence===\nCompanies can also obtain an ARM ''architectural licence'' for designing their own CPU cores using the ARM instruction sets.

That is, each mode that can be entered because of an exception has its own R13 and R14. These registers generally contain the stack pointer and the return address from function calls, respectively.\n\nAliases:\n\n* R13 is also referred to as SP, the [[Stack register|Stack Pointer]].\n* R14 is also referred to as LR, the [[Link register|Link Register]].\n* R15 is also referred to as PC, the [[Program Counter]].\n\nThe Current Program Status Register (CPSR) has the following 32&nbsp;bits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0290g/I27695.html|title=ARM Information Center|accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n* M (bits 0\u20134) is the processor mode bits.\n* T (bit 5) is the Thumb state bit.\n* F (bit 6) is the FIQ disable bit.\n* I (bit 7) is the IRQ disable bit.\n* A (bit 8) is the imprecise data abort disable bit.\n* E (bit 9) is the data endianness bit.\n* IT (bits 10\u201315 and 25\u201326) is the if-then state bits.\n* GE (bits 16\u201319) is the greater-than-or-equal-to bits.\n* DNM (bits 20\u201323) is the do not modify bits.\n* J (bit 24) is the Java state bit.\n* Q (bit 27) is the sticky overflow bit.\n* V (bit 28) is the overflow bit.\n* C (bit 29) is the carry/borrow/extend bit.\n* Z (bit 30) is the zero bit.\n* N (bit 31) is the negative/less than bit.\n\n====Conditional execution====\nAlmost every ARM instruction has a conditional execution feature called [[Branch predication|predication]], which is implemented with a 4-bit condition code selector (the predicate). To allow for unconditional execution, one of the four-bit codes causes the instruction to be always executed. Most other CPU architectures only have condition codes on branch instructions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Condition Codes 1: Condition flags and codes |url=https://community.arm.com/developer/ip-products/processors/b/processors-ip-blog/posts/condition-codes-1-condition-flags-and-codes |website=ARM Community |accessdate=26 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThough the predicate takes up four of the 32&nbsp;bits in an instruction code, and thus cuts down significantly on the encoding bits available for displacements in memory access instructions, it avoids branch instructions when generating code for small [[conditional (programming)|<code>if</code> statements]]. Apart from eliminating the branch instructions themselves, this preserves the fetch/decode/execute pipeline at the cost of only one cycle per skipped instruction.\n\nThe standard example of conditional execution is the subtraction-based [[Euclidean algorithm]]:\n\nIn the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], the function is:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint gcd(int a, int b) {\n  while (a != b)  // We enter the loop when a<b or a>b, but not when a==b\n    if (a > b)   // When a>b we do this\n      a -= b;\n    else         // When a<b we do that (no if(a<b) needed since a!=b is checked in while condition)\n      b -= a;\n  return a;\n}\n</source>\nFor ARM [[assembly language|assembly]], the function can be effectively transformed into:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nloop:\n    // Compare a and b\n    GT = a > b;\n    LT = a < b;\n    NE = a != b;\n\n    // Perform operations based on flag results\n    if(GT) a -= b;    // Subtract *only* if greater-than\n    if(LT) b -= a;    // Subtract *only* if less-than\n    if(NE) goto loop; // Loop *only* if compared values were not equal\n    return a;\n</source>\nand coded as:<!-- using nasm because \"gas\", although correct, does not recognize all the insns. the nasm lexer just looks for all uppercase on the other hand. -->\n<source lang=\"nasm\">\n; assign a to register r0, b to r1\nloop:   CMP    r0, r1       ; set condition \"NE\" if (a != b),\n                            ;               \"GT\" if (a > b),\n                            ;            or \"LT\" if (a < b)\n        SUBGT  r0, r0, r1   ; if \"GT\" (Greater Than), a = a-b;\n        SUBLT  r1, r1, r0   ; if \"LT\" (Less Than), b = b-a;\n        BNE  loop           ; if \"NE\" (Not Equal), then loop\n        B    lr             ; if the loop is not entered, we can safely return\n</source>\n\nwhich avoids the branches around the <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> clauses. If <code>r0</code> and <code>r1</code> are equal then neither of the <code>SUB</code> instructions will be executed, eliminating the need for a conditional branch to implement the <code>while</code> check at the top of the loop, for example had <code>SUBLE</code> (less than or equal) been used.\n\nOne of the ways that Thumb code provides a more dense encoding is to remove the four-bit selector from non-branch instructions.\n\n====Other features====\nAnother feature of the [[instruction set]] is the ability to fold shifts and rotates into the \"data processing\" (arithmetic, logical, and register-register move) instructions, so that, for example, the C statement\n\n<source lang=\"c\">a += (j << 2);</source>\n\ncould be rendered as a single-word, single-cycle instruction:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0214b/ch09s01s02.html | title=9.1.2. Instruction cycle counts}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"arm\">ADD  Ra, Ra, Rj, LSL #2</source>\n\nThis results in the typical ARM program being denser than expected with fewer memory accesses; thus the pipeline is used more efficiently.\n\nThe ARM processor also has features rarely seen in other RISC architectures, such as [[Program counter|PC]]-relative addressing (indeed, on the 32-bit<ref name=\"v8arch\">{{cite web | url=https://www.arm.com/files/downloads/ARMv8_Architecture.pdf | title=ARMv8-A Technology Preview | year=2011 | accessdate=31 October 2011 | first=Richard | last=Grisenthwaite}}</ref> ARM the [[Program counter|PC]] is one of its 16&nbsp;registers) and pre- and post-increment addressing modes.\n\nThe ARM instruction set has increased over time. Some early ARM processors (before ARM7TDMI), for example, have no instruction to store a two-byte quantity.\n\n====Pipelines and other implementation issues====\nThe ARM7 and earlier implementations have a three-stage [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]; the stages being fetch, decode and execute. Higher-performance designs, such as the ARM9, have deeper pipelines: Cortex-A8 has thirteen stages. Additional implementation changes for higher performance include a faster [[Adder (electronics)|adder]] and more extensive [[branch prediction]] logic. The difference between the ARM7DI and ARM7DMI cores, for example, was an improved multiplier; hence the added \"M\".\n\n====Coprocessors====\nThe ARM architecture (pre-ARMv8) provides a non-intrusive way of extending the instruction set using \"coprocessors\" that can be addressed using MCR, MRC, MRRC, MCRR and similar instructions. The coprocessor space is divided logically into 16&nbsp;coprocessors with numbers from 0 to 15, coprocessor&nbsp;15 (cp15) being reserved for some typical control functions like managing the caches and [[Memory management unit|MMU]] operation on processors that have one.\n\nIn ARM-based machines, peripheral devices are usually attached to the processor by mapping their physical registers into ARM memory space, into the coprocessor space, or by connecting to another device (a bus) that in turn attaches to the processor. Coprocessor accesses have lower latency, so some peripherals\u2014for example, an XScale interrupt controller\u2014are accessible in both ways: through memory and through coprocessors.\n\nIn other cases, chip designers only integrate hardware using the coprocessor mechanism. For example, an image processing engine might be a small ARM7TDMI core combined with a coprocessor that has specialised operations to support a specific set of HDTV transcoding primitives.\n\n==={{Anchor|CoreSight}}Debugging===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2011}}\nAll modern ARM processors include hardware debugging facilities, allowing software debuggers to perform operations such as halting, stepping, and breakpointing of code starting from reset. These facilities are built using [[JTAG]] support, though some newer cores optionally support ARM's own two-wire \"SWD\" protocol. In ARM7TDMI cores, the \"D\" represented JTAG debug support, and the \"I\" represented presence of an \"EmbeddedICE\" debug module. For ARM7 and ARM9 core generations, EmbeddedICE over JTAG was a de facto debug standard, though not architecturally guaranteed.\n\nThe ARMv7 architecture defines basic debug facilities at an architectural level. These include breakpoints, watchpoints and instruction execution in a \"Debug Mode\"; similar facilities were also available with EmbeddedICE. Both \"halt mode\" and \"monitor\" mode debugging are supported. The actual transport mechanism used to access the debug facilities is not architecturally specified, but implementations generally include JTAG support.\n\nThere is a separate ARM \"CoreSight\" debug architecture, which is not architecturally required by ARMv7 processors.\n\n====Debug Access Port====\nThe Debug Access Port (DAP) is an implementation of an ARM Debug Interface.<ref>\n[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0314h/Babdadfc.html \"CoreSight Components: About the Debug Access Port\"].\n</ref>\nThere are two different supported implementations, the Serial Wire [[JTAG]] Debug Port (SWJ-DP) and the Serial Wire Debug Port (SW-DP).<ref>\n[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dai0179b/ar01s01s03.html \"The Cortex-M3: Debug Access Port (DAP)\"].\n</ref>\nCMSIS-DAP is a standard interface that describes how various debugging software on a host PC can communicate over USB to firmware running on a hardware debugger, which in turn talks over SWD or JTAG to a CoreSight-enabled ARM Cortex CPU.<ref>\nMike Anderson.\n[https://elinux.org/images/7/7f/Manderson5.pdf \"Understanding ARM HW Debug Options\"].\n</ref><ref>\n[http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/dapdebug/dapdebug_introduction.htm \"CMSIS-DAP Debugger User's Guide\"].\n</ref><ref>\n[https://www.nimblemachines.com/cmsis-dap/ \"CMSIS-DAP\"].\n</ref><ref>\n[https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/405134/swdap-vs-cmsis-dap-vs-daplink \"SWDAP vs CMSIS-DAP vs DAPLink\"].\n</ref>\n\n===DSP enhancement instructions===\nTo improve the ARM architecture for [[digital signal processing]] and multimedia applications, DSP instructions were added to the set.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/cpu-arch-DSP.html |title=ARM DSP Instruction Set Extensions |website=arm.com |accessdate=18 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090414011837/https://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/cpu-arch-DSP.html| archivedate= 14 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> These are signified by an \"E\" in the name of the ARMv5TE and ARMv5TEJ architectures.

Support for this state is signified by the \"J\" in the ARMv5TEJ architecture, and in ARM9EJ-S and ARM7EJ-S core names. Support for this state is required starting in ARMv6 (except for the ARMv7-M profile), though newer cores only include a trivial implementation that provides no hardware acceleration.\n\n==={{anchor|THUMB}}Thumb===\nTo improve compiled code-density, processors since the ARM7TDMI (released in 1994<ref>[http://www.atmel.com/Images/DDI0029G_7TDMI_R3_trm.pdf ARM7TDMI Technical Reference Manual] page ii</ref>) have featured the ''Thumb'' instruction set, which have their own state. (The \"T\" in \"TDMI\" indicates the Thumb feature.) When in this state, the processor executes the Thumb instruction set, a compact 16-bit encoding for a subset of the ARM instruction set.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jaggar |first=Dave |title=ARM Architecture Reference Manual |year=1996 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-736299-8 |pages=6\u20131}}</ref> Most of the Thumb instructions are directly mapped to normal ARM instructions. The space-saving comes from making some of the instruction operands implicit and limiting the number of possibilities compared to the ARM instructions executed in the ARM instruction set state.\n\nIn Thumb, the 16-bit opcodes have less functionality. For example, only branches can be conditional, and many opcodes are restricted to accessing only half of all of the CPU's general-purpose registers. The shorter opcodes give improved code density overall, even though some operations require extra instructions. In situations where the memory port or bus width is constrained to less than 32&nbsp;bits, the shorter Thumb opcodes allow increased performance compared with 32-bit ARM code, as less program code may need to be loaded into the processor over the constrained memory bandwidth.\n\nUnlike processor architectures with variable length (16- or 32-bit) instructions, such as the Cray-1 and [[Hitachi]] [[SuperH]], the ARM and Thumb instruction sets exist independently of each other. Embedded hardware, such as the [[Game Boy Advance]], typically have a small amount of RAM accessible with a full 32-bit datapath; the majority is accessed via a 16-bit or narrower secondary datapath. In this situation, it usually makes sense to compile Thumb code and hand-optimise a few of the most CPU-intensive sections using full 32-bit ARM instructions, placing these wider instructions into the 32-bit bus accessible memory.\n\nThe first processor with a Thumb [[instruction decoder]] was the ARM7TDMI. All ARM9 and later families, including XScale, have included a Thumb instruction decoder. It includes instructions adopted from the Hitachi [[SuperH]] (1992), which was licensed by ARM.<ref name=\"lwn\">{{cite web|url=//lwn.net/Articles/647636|title=Resurrecting the SuperH architecture|author=Nathan Willis|date=10 June 2015|publisher=[[LWN.net]]}}</ref> ARM's smallest processor families (Cortex M0 and M1) implement only the 16-bit Thumb instruction set for maximum performance in lowest cost applications.\n\n===Thumb-2===\n<!-- Section header used in redirects -->\n''Thumb-2'' technology was introduced in the ''ARM1156&nbsp;core'', announced in 2003. Thumb-2 extends the limited 16-bit instruction set of Thumb with additional 32-bit instructions to give the instruction set more breadth, thus producing a variable-length instruction set. A stated aim for Thumb-2 was to achieve code density similar to Thumb with performance similar to the ARM instruction set on 32-bit memory.\n\nThumb-2 extends the Thumb instruction set with bit-field manipulation, table branches and conditional execution. At the same time, the ARM instruction set was extended to maintain equivalent functionality in both instruction sets. A new \"Unified Assembly Language\" (UAL) supports generation of either Thumb or ARM instructions from the same source code; versions of Thumb seen on ARMv7 processors are essentially as capable as ARM code (including the ability to write interrupt handlers). This requires a bit of care, and use of a new \"IT\" (if-then) instruction, which permits up to four successive instructions to execute based on a tested condition, or on its inverse. When compiling into ARM code, this is ignored, but when compiling into Thumb it generates an actual instruction. For example:\n\n<source lang=\"nasm\">\n; if (r0 == r1)\nCMP r0, r1\nITE EQ        ; ARM: no code ... Thumb: IT instruction\n; then r0 = r2;\nMOVEQ r0, r2  ; ARM: conditional; Thumb: condition via ITE 'T' (then)\n; else r0 = r3;\nMOVNE r0, r3  ; ARM: conditional; Thumb: condition via ITE 'E' (else)\n; recall that the Thumb MOV instruction has no bits to encode \"EQ\" or \"NE\".\n</source>\n\nAll ARMv7 chips support the Thumb instruction set. All chips in the Cortex-A series, Cortex-R series, and ARM11 series support both \"ARM instruction set state\" and \"Thumb instruction set state\", while chips in the [[ARM Cortex-M|Cortex-M]] series support only the Thumb instruction set.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/architecture.html |title=ARM Processor Instruction Set Architecture |publisher=Arm.com |accessdate=18 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090415171228/http://arm.com/products/CPUs/architecture.html| archivedate= 15 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS7814673959.html |title=ARM aims son of Thumb at uCs, ASSPs, SoCs |publisher=Linuxdevices.com |accessdate=18 April 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121209133741/http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/ARM-aims-son-of-Thumb-at-uCs-ASSPs-SoCs/ |archive-date=9 December 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0290g/I1005458.html |title=ARM Information Center |publisher=Infocenter.arm.com |accessdate=18 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|ThumbEE}}Thumb Execution Environment (ThumbEE)===\n''ThumbEE'' (erroneously called ''Thumb-2EE'' in some ARM documentation), which was marketed as [https://web.archive.org/web/20170602084751/https://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/jazelle.php Jazelle RCT] (Runtime Compilation Target), was announced in 2005, first appearing in the ''Cortex-A8'' processor. ThumbEE is a fourth instruction set state, making small changes to the Thumb-2 extended instruction set. These changes make the instruction set particularly suited to code generated at runtime (e.g. by [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT compilation]]) in managed ''Execution Environments''. ThumbEE is a target for languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Perl]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and allows [[JIT compiler]]s to output smaller compiled code without impacting performance.\n\nNew features provided by ThumbEE include automatic null pointer checks on every load and store instruction, an instruction to perform an array bounds check, and special instructions that call a handler.

The ''[[Acorn Business Computer]]'' (ABC) plan required that a number of [[second processor (BBC Micro)|second processor]]s be made to work with the BBC&nbsp;Micro platform, but processors such as the [[Motorola 68000]] and [[National Semiconductor 32016]] were considered unsuitable, and the 6502 was not powerful enough for a [[graphics-based user interface]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/29/04/1998/7242/ARM39s-way.htm | title=ARM's way | work=[[Electronics Weekly]] | date=29 April 1998 | accessdate=26 October 2012 | author=Manners, David | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729024818/http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/29/04/1998/7242/ARM39s-way.htm | archive-date=29 July 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Sophie Wilson]], all the processors tested at that time performed about the same, with about a 4&nbsp;Mbit/second bandwidth.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4nWLIeBuf4|title=Sophie Wilson at Alt Party 2009 (Part 3/8)}}</ref>\n\nAfter testing all available processors and finding them lacking, Acorn decided it needed a new architecture. Inspired by papers from the [[Berkeley RISC]] project, Acorn considered designing its own processor.<ref name=\"informit\">{{cite book | url=https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1620207 | title=Understanding ARM Architectures | date=23 August 2010 | accessdate=26 May 2013 | author=Chisnall, David}}</ref> A visit to the [[Western Design Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], where the 6502 was being updated by what was effectively a single-person company, showed Acorn engineers [[Steve Furber]] and Sophie Wilson they did not need massive resources and state-of-the-art [[research and development]] facilities.<ref>{{cite book |author=Furber, Stephen B. |title=ARM system-on-chip architecture|publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2000 |isbn=0-201-67519-6 |title-link=ARM system-on-chip architecture}}</ref>\n\nWilson developed the instruction set, writing a simulation of the processor in [[BBC&nbsp;BASIC]] that ran on a BBC&nbsp;Micro with a [[BBC Micro expansion unit#6502 Second Processor|6502 second processor]]. This convinced Acorn engineers they were on the right track. Wilson approached Acorn's CEO, [[Hermann Hauser]], and requested more resources. Hauser gave his approval and assembled a small team to implement Wilson's model in hardware.\n\n===Acorn RISC Machine: ARM2===\nThe official ''Acorn RISC Machine'' project started in October 1983. They chose [[VLSI Technology]] as the ''silicon partner'', as they were a source of ROMs and custom chips for Acorn. Wilson and Furber led the design. They implemented it with efficiency principles similar to the 6502.<ref name=\"zdnet wouldbe\">{{cite news | url=https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/intels-victims-eight-would-be-giant-killers/ | title=Intel's victims: Eight would-be giant killers | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=4 December 2010 | accessdate=7 March 2012| author=Goodwins, Rupert}}</ref> A key design goal was achieving low-latency input/output (interrupt) handling like the 6502. The 6502's memory access architecture had let developers produce fast machines without costly [[direct memory access]] (DMA) hardware.\n\nThe first samples of ARM silicon worked properly when first received and tested on 26 April 1985.<ref name=\"ARM1\" />\n\nThe first ARM application was as a second processor for the BBC&nbsp;Micro, where it helped in developing simulation software to finish development of the support chips (VIDC, IOC, MEMC), and sped up the [[CAD software]] used in ARM2 development. Wilson subsequently rewrote BBC&nbsp;BASIC in ARM assembly language. The in-depth knowledge gained from designing the instruction set enabled the code to be very dense, making ARM BBC&nbsp;BASIC an extremely good test for any ARM emulator. The original aim of a principally ARM-based computer was achieved in 1987 with the release of the [[Acorn Archimedes]].<ref>{{YouTube|hrj-EEnsacQ|Acorn Archimedes Promotion from 1987}}</ref> In 1992, Acorn once more won the [[Queen's Award for Technology]] for the ARM.\n\nThe ARM2 featured a [[32-bit]] [[Bus (computing)|data bus]], [[26-bit]] address space and 27&nbsp;32-bit [[Processor register|registers]]. Eight&nbsp;bits from the [[program counter]] register were available for other purposes; the top six&nbsp;bits (available because of the 26-bit address space) served as status flags, and the bottom two&nbsp;bits (available because the program counter was always [[Data structure alignment|word-aligned]]) were used for setting modes. The address bus was extended to 32&nbsp;bits in the ARM6, but program code still had to lie within the first 64&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MB]] of memory in 26-bit compatibility mode, due to the reserved bits for the status flags.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heyrick.co.uk/assembler/32bit.html|title=32&nbsp;bit operation|author=Richard Murray}}</ref> The ARM2 had a [[microprocessor chronology#1980s|transistor count]] of just 30,000, compared to Motorola's six-year-older 68000 model with around 40,000.<ref name=\"Markus Levy, Convergence Promotions\">{{cite web | url=http://www.reds.ch/share/cours/ReCo/documents/TheHistoryOfTheArmArchitecture.pdf | title=The History of The ARM Architecture: From Inception to IPO | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Levy, Markus}}</ref> Much of this simplicity came from the lack of [[microcode]] (which represents about one-quarter to one-third of the 68000) and from (like most CPUs of the day) not including any [[CPU cache|cache]].

The [[original design manufacturer]] combines the ARM core with other parts to produce a complete device, typically one that can be built in existing [[semiconductor fabrication plant]]s (fabs) at low cost and still deliver substantial performance. The most successful implementation has been the [[ARM7#ARM7TDMI|ARM7TDMI]] with hundreds of millions sold. [[Atmel]] has been a precursor design center in the ARM7TDMI-based embedded system.\n\nThe ARM architectures used in smartphones, PDAs and other [[mobile device]]s range from ARMv5 to ARMv7-A, used in low-end and midrange devices, to ARMv8-A used in current high-end devices.\n\nIn 2009, some manufacturers introduced netbooks based on ARM architecture CPUs, in direct competition with netbooks based on [[Intel Atom]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Always-Innovating-Touch-Book/ |title=ARM netbook ships with detachable tablet |first=Eric |last=Brown |year=2009 |access-date=19 August 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130103181613/http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Always-Innovating-Touch-Book/ |archive-date=3 January 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> According to an 18 July 2011 forecast from analyst firm IHS iSuppli, by 2015, ARM [[integrated circuit]]s may be in 23% of all laptops.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dylan |last=McGrath |work=EE Times |url=https://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4217951/IHS--ARM-ICs-to-be-in-23--of-laptops-in-2015 |title=IHS: ARM ICs to be in 23% of laptops in 2015 |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nArm Holdings offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. Arm Holdings provides to all licensees an integratable hardware description of the ARM core as well as complete software development toolset ([[compiler]], [[debugger]], [[software development kit]]) and the right to sell manufactured [[Semiconductor device|silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\nSoC packages integrating ARM's core designs include Nvidia Tegra's first three generations, CSR plc's Quatro family, ST-Ericsson's Nova and NovaThor, Silicon Labs's Precision32 MCU, Texas Instruments's OMAP products, Samsung's Hummingbird and [[Exynos]] products, Apple's [[Apple A4|A4]], [[Apple A5|A5]], and [[Apple A5X|A5X]], and [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]]'s [[i.MX]].\n\n[[Fabless manufacturing|Fabless]] licensees, who wish to integrate an ARM core into their own chip design, are usually only interested in acquiring a ready-to-manufacture verified [[semiconductor intellectual property core]]. For these customers, Arm Holdings delivers a [[netlist|gate netlist]] description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. More ambitious customers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] ([[Verilog]]) form. With the synthesizable RTL, the customer has the ability to perform architectural level optimisations and extensions. This allows the designer to achieve exotic design goals not otherwise possible with an unmodified netlist ([[Clock rate|high clock speed]], very low power consumption, instruction set extensions, etc.). While Arm Holdings does not grant the licensee the right to resell the ARM architecture itself, licensees may freely sell manufactured product such as chip devices, evaluation boards and complete systems. [[Foundry model|Merchant foundries]] can be a special case; not only are they allowed to sell finished silicon containing ARM cores, they generally hold the right to re-manufacture ARM cores for other customers.\n\nArm Holdings prices its IP based on perceived value. Lower performing ARM cores typically have lower licence costs than higher performing cores. In implementation terms, a synthesizable core costs more than a hard macro (blackbox) core. Complicating price matters, a merchant foundry that holds an ARM licence, such as Samsung or Fujitsu, can offer fab customers reduced licensing costs. In exchange for acquiring the ARM core through the foundry's in-house design services, the customer can reduce or eliminate payment of ARM's upfront licence fee.\n\nCompared to dedicated semiconductor foundries (such as [[TSMC]] and [[United Microelectronics Corporation|UMC]]) without in-house design services, Fujitsu/Samsung charge two- to three-times more per manufactured [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For low to mid volume applications, a design service foundry offers lower overall pricing (through subsidisation of the licence fee). For high volume mass-produced parts, the long term cost reduction achievable through lower wafer pricing reduces the impact of ARM's NRE (Non-Recurring Engineering) costs, making the dedicated foundry a better choice.\n\nCompanies that have developed chips with cores designed by Arm Holdings include [[Amazon.com]]'s [[Annapurna Labs]] subsidiary,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1328624& |title=Amazon Now Sells Own ARM chips |author=Peter Clarke |date=7 January 2016}}</ref> [[Analog Devices]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[AppliedMicro]] (now: [[MACOM Technology Solutions]]<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.macom.com/about/news-and-events/press-release-archive/row-col1/news--event-archive/macom-successfully-completes-a-1|title=MACOM Successfully Completes Acquisition of AppliedMicro|date=26 January 2017}}</ref>), [[Atmel]], [[Broadcom]], [[Cavium]], [[Cypress Semiconductor]], [[Freescale Semiconductor]] (now [[NXP Semiconductors]]), [[Huawei]], [[Intel]],{{Dubious|ARM-based chips and Intel|reason=StrongARM and XScale did not use cores designed by Arm Holdings, and no other ARM-based Intel chips are known|date=December 2019}} [[Maxim Integrated]], [[Nvidia]], [[NXP]], [[Qualcomm]], [[Renesas Electronics|Renesas]], [[Samsung Electronics]], [[ST Microelectronics]], [[Texas Instruments]] and [[Xilinx]].\n\n=== Built on ARM Cortex Technology licence ===\nIn February 2016, ARM announced the Built on ARM Cortex Technology licence, often shortened to Built on Cortex (BoC) licence. This licence allows companies to partner with ARM and make modifications to ARM Cortex designs. These design modifications will not be shared with other companies. These semi-custom core designs also have brand freedom, for example [[Kryo#Kryo 280|Kryo 280]].\n\nCompanies that are current licensees of Built on ARM Cortex Technology include [[Qualcomm]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/10366/arm-built-on-cortex-license|title=ARM Details Built on ARM Cortex Technology License|last=Frumusanu|first=Andrei|website=www.anandtech.com|access-date=26 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Architectural licence===\nCompanies can also obtain an ARM ''architectural licence'' for designing their own CPU cores using the ARM instruction sets.

That is, each mode that can be entered because of an exception has its own R13 and R14. These registers generally contain the stack pointer and the return address from function calls, respectively.\n\nAliases:\n\n* R13 is also referred to as SP, the [[Stack register|Stack Pointer]].\n* R14 is also referred to as LR, the [[Link register|Link Register]].\n* R15 is also referred to as PC, the [[Program Counter]].\n\nThe Current Program Status Register (CPSR) has the following 32&nbsp;bits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0290g/I27695.html|title=ARM Information Center|accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n* M (bits 0\u20134) is the processor mode bits.\n* T (bit 5) is the Thumb state bit.\n* F (bit 6) is the FIQ disable bit.\n* I (bit 7) is the IRQ disable bit.\n* A (bit 8) is the imprecise data abort disable bit.\n* E (bit 9) is the data endianness bit.\n* IT (bits 10\u201315 and 25\u201326) is the if-then state bits.\n* GE (bits 16\u201319) is the greater-than-or-equal-to bits.\n* DNM (bits 20\u201323) is the do not modify bits.\n* J (bit 24) is the Java state bit.\n* Q (bit 27) is the sticky overflow bit.\n* V (bit 28) is the overflow bit.\n* C (bit 29) is the carry/borrow/extend bit.\n* Z (bit 30) is the zero bit.\n* N (bit 31) is the negative/less than bit.\n\n====Conditional execution====\nAlmost every ARM instruction has a conditional execution feature called [[Branch predication|predication]], which is implemented with a 4-bit condition code selector (the predicate). To allow for unconditional execution, one of the four-bit codes causes the instruction to be always executed. Most other CPU architectures only have condition codes on branch instructions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Condition Codes 1: Condition flags and codes |url=https://community.arm.com/developer/ip-products/processors/b/processors-ip-blog/posts/condition-codes-1-condition-flags-and-codes |website=ARM Community |accessdate=26 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThough the predicate takes up four of the 32&nbsp;bits in an instruction code, and thus cuts down significantly on the encoding bits available for displacements in memory access instructions, it avoids branch instructions when generating code for small [[conditional (programming)|<code>if</code> statements]]. Apart from eliminating the branch instructions themselves, this preserves the fetch/decode/execute pipeline at the cost of only one cycle per skipped instruction.\n\nThe standard example of conditional execution is the subtraction-based [[Euclidean algorithm]]:\n\nIn the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], the function is:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint gcd(int a, int b) {\n  while (a != b)  // We enter the loop when a<b or a>b, but not when a==b\n    if (a > b)   // When a>b we do this\n      a -= b;\n    else         // When a<b we do that (no if(a<b) needed since a!=b is checked in while condition)\n      b -= a;\n  return a;\n}\n</source>\nFor ARM [[assembly language|assembly]], the function can be effectively transformed into:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nloop:\n    // Compare a and b\n    GT = a > b;\n    LT = a < b;\n    NE = a != b;\n\n    // Perform operations based on flag results\n    if(GT) a -= b;    // Subtract *only* if greater-than\n    if(LT) b -= a;    // Subtract *only* if less-than\n    if(NE) goto loop; // Loop *only* if compared values were not equal\n    return a;\n</source>\nand coded as:<!-- using nasm because \"gas\", although correct, does not recognize all the insns. the nasm lexer just looks for all uppercase on the other hand. -->\n<source lang=\"nasm\">\n; assign a to register r0, b to r1\nloop:   CMP    r0, r1       ; set condition \"NE\" if (a != b),\n                            ;               \"GT\" if (a > b),\n                            ;            or \"LT\" if (a < b)\n        SUBGT  r0, r0, r1   ; if \"GT\" (Greater Than), a = a-b;\n        SUBLT  r1, r1, r0   ; if \"LT\" (Less Than), b = b-a;\n        BNE  loop           ; if \"NE\" (Not Equal), then loop\n        B    lr             ; if the loop is not entered, we can safely return\n</source>\n\nwhich avoids the branches around the <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> clauses. If <code>r0</code> and <code>r1</code> are equal then neither of the <code>SUB</code> instructions will be executed, eliminating the need for a conditional branch to implement the <code>while</code> check at the top of the loop, for example had <code>SUBLE</code> (less than or equal) been used.\n\nOne of the ways that Thumb code provides a more dense encoding is to remove the four-bit selector from non-branch instructions.\n\n====Other features====\nAnother feature of the [[instruction set]] is the ability to fold shifts and rotates into the \"data processing\" (arithmetic, logical, and register-register move) instructions, so that, for example, the C statement\n\n<source lang=\"c\">a += (j << 2);</source>\n\ncould be rendered as a single-word, single-cycle instruction:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0214b/ch09s01s02.html | title=9.1.2. Instruction cycle counts}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"arm\">ADD  Ra, Ra, Rj, LSL #2</source>\n\nThis results in the typical ARM program being denser than expected with fewer memory accesses; thus the pipeline is used more efficiently.\n\nThe ARM processor also has features rarely seen in other RISC architectures, such as [[Program counter|PC]]-relative addressing (indeed, on the 32-bit<ref name=\"v8arch\">{{cite web | url=https://www.arm.com/files/downloads/ARMv8_Architecture.pdf | title=ARMv8-A Technology Preview | year=2011 | accessdate=31 October 2011 | first=Richard | last=Grisenthwaite}}</ref> ARM the [[Program counter|PC]] is one of its 16&nbsp;registers) and pre- and post-increment addressing modes.\n\nThe ARM instruction set has increased over time. Some early ARM processors (before ARM7TDMI), for example, have no instruction to store a two-byte quantity.\n\n====Pipelines and other implementation issues====\nThe ARM7 and earlier implementations have a three-stage [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]; the stages being fetch, decode and execute. Higher-performance designs, such as the ARM9, have deeper pipelines: Cortex-A8 has thirteen stages. Additional implementation changes for higher performance include a faster [[Adder (electronics)|adder]] and more extensive [[branch prediction]] logic. The difference between the ARM7DI and ARM7DMI cores, for example, was an improved multiplier; hence the added \"M\".\n\n====Coprocessors====\nThe ARM architecture (pre-ARMv8) provides a non-intrusive way of extending the instruction set using \"coprocessors\" that can be addressed using MCR, MRC, MRRC, MCRR and similar instructions. The coprocessor space is divided logically into 16&nbsp;coprocessors with numbers from 0 to 15, coprocessor&nbsp;15 (cp15) being reserved for some typical control functions like managing the caches and [[Memory management unit|MMU]] operation on processors that have one.\n\nIn ARM-based machines, peripheral devices are usually attached to the processor by mapping their physical registers into ARM memory space, into the coprocessor space, or by connecting to another device (a bus) that in turn attaches to the processor. Coprocessor accesses have lower latency, so some peripherals\u2014for example, an XScale interrupt controller\u2014are accessible in both ways: through memory and through coprocessors.\n\nIn other cases, chip designers only integrate hardware using the coprocessor mechanism. For example, an image processing engine might be a small ARM7TDMI core combined with a coprocessor that has specialised operations to support a specific set of HDTV transcoding primitives.\n\n==={{Anchor|CoreSight}}Debugging===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2011}}\nAll modern ARM processors include hardware debugging facilities, allowing software debuggers to perform operations such as halting, stepping, and breakpointing of code starting from reset. These facilities are built using [[JTAG]] support, though some newer cores optionally support ARM's own two-wire \"SWD\" protocol. In ARM7TDMI cores, the \"D\" represented JTAG debug support, and the \"I\" represented presence of an \"EmbeddedICE\" debug module. For ARM7 and ARM9 core generations, EmbeddedICE over JTAG was a de facto debug standard, though not architecturally guaranteed.\n\nThe ARMv7 architecture defines basic debug facilities at an architectural level. These include breakpoints, watchpoints and instruction execution in a \"Debug Mode\"; similar facilities were also available with EmbeddedICE. Both \"halt mode\" and \"monitor\" mode debugging are supported. The actual transport mechanism used to access the debug facilities is not architecturally specified, but implementations generally include JTAG support.\n\nThere is a separate ARM \"CoreSight\" debug architecture, which is not architecturally required by ARMv7 processors.\n\n==== Debug Access Port ====\nThe Debug Access Port (DAP) is an implementation of an ARM Debug Interface.<ref>\n[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0314h/Babdadfc.html \"CoreSight Components: About the Debug Access Port\"].\n</ref>\nThere are two different supported implementations, the Serial Wire [[JTAG]] Debug Port (SWJ-DP) and the Serial Wire Debug Port (SW-DP).<ref>\n[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dai0179b/ar01s01s03.html \"The Cortex-M3: Debug Access Port (DAP)\"].\n</ref>\nCMSIS-DAP is a standard interface that describes how various debugging software on a host PC can communicate over USB to firmware running on a hardware debugger, which in turn talks over SWD or JTAG to a CoreSight-enabled ARM Cortex CPU.<ref>\nMike Anderson.\n[https://elinux.org/images/7/7f/Manderson5.pdf \"Understanding ARM HW Debug Options\"].\n</ref><ref>\n[http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/dapdebug/dapdebug_introduction.htm \"CMSIS-DAP Debugger User's Guide\"].\n</ref><ref>\n[https://www.nimblemachines.com/cmsis-dap/ \"CMSIS-DAP\"].\n</ref><ref>\n[https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/405134/swdap-vs-cmsis-dap-vs-daplink \"SWDAP vs CMSIS-DAP vs DAPLink\"].\n</ref>\n\n===DSP enhancement instructions===\nTo improve the ARM architecture for [[digital signal processing]] and multimedia applications, DSP instructions were added to the set.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/cpu-arch-DSP.html |title=ARM DSP Instruction Set Extensions |website=arm.com |accessdate=18 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090414011837/https://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/cpu-arch-DSP.html| archivedate= 14 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> These are signified by an \"E\" in the name of the ARMv5TE and ARMv5TEJ architectures.

Support for this state is signified by the \"J\" in the ARMv5TEJ architecture, and in ARM9EJ-S and ARM7EJ-S core names. Support for this state is required starting in ARMv6 (except for the ARMv7-M profile), though newer cores only include a trivial implementation that provides no hardware acceleration.\n\n==={{anchor|THUMB}}Thumb===\nTo improve compiled code-density, processors since the ARM7TDMI (released in 1994<ref>[http://www.atmel.com/Images/DDI0029G_7TDMI_R3_trm.pdf ARM7TDMI Technical Reference Manual] page ii</ref>) have featured the ''Thumb'' instruction set, which have their own state. (The \"T\" in \"TDMI\" indicates the Thumb feature.) When in this state, the processor executes the Thumb instruction set, a compact 16-bit encoding for a subset of the ARM instruction set.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jaggar |first=Dave |title=ARM Architecture Reference Manual |year=1996 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-736299-8 |pages=6\u20131}}</ref> Most of the Thumb instructions are directly mapped to normal ARM instructions. The space-saving comes from making some of the instruction operands implicit and limiting the number of possibilities compared to the ARM instructions executed in the ARM instruction set state.\n\nIn Thumb, the 16-bit opcodes have less functionality. For example, only branches can be conditional, and many opcodes are restricted to accessing only half of all of the CPU's general-purpose registers. The shorter opcodes give improved code density overall, even though some operations require extra instructions. In situations where the memory port or bus width is constrained to less than 32&nbsp;bits, the shorter Thumb opcodes allow increased performance compared with 32-bit ARM code, as less program code may need to be loaded into the processor over the constrained memory bandwidth.\n\nUnlike processor architectures with variable length (16- or 32-bit) instructions, such as the Cray-1 and [[Hitachi]] [[SuperH]], the ARM and Thumb instruction sets exist independently of each other. Embedded hardware, such as the [[Game Boy Advance]], typically have a small amount of RAM accessible with a full 32-bit datapath; the majority is accessed via a 16-bit or narrower secondary datapath. In this situation, it usually makes sense to compile Thumb code and hand-optimise a few of the most CPU-intensive sections using full 32-bit ARM instructions, placing these wider instructions into the 32-bit bus accessible memory.\n\nThe first processor with a Thumb [[instruction decoder]] was the ARM7TDMI. All ARM9 and later families, including XScale, have included a Thumb instruction decoder. It includes instructions adopted from the Hitachi [[SuperH]] (1992), which was licensed by ARM.<ref name=\"lwn\">{{cite web|url=//lwn.net/Articles/647636|title=Resurrecting the SuperH architecture|author=Nathan Willis|date=10 June 2015|publisher=[[LWN.net]]}}</ref> ARM's smallest processor families (Cortex M0 and M1) implement only the 16-bit Thumb instruction set for maximum performance in lowest cost applications.\n\n===Thumb-2===\n<!-- Section header used in redirects -->\n''Thumb-2'' technology was introduced in the ''ARM1156&nbsp;core'', announced in 2003. Thumb-2 extends the limited 16-bit instruction set of Thumb with additional 32-bit instructions to give the instruction set more breadth, thus producing a variable-length instruction set. A stated aim for Thumb-2 was to achieve code density similar to Thumb with performance similar to the ARM instruction set on 32-bit memory.\n\nThumb-2 extends the Thumb instruction set with bit-field manipulation, table branches and conditional execution. At the same time, the ARM instruction set was extended to maintain equivalent functionality in both instruction sets. A new \"Unified Assembly Language\" (UAL) supports generation of either Thumb or ARM instructions from the same source code; versions of Thumb seen on ARMv7 processors are essentially as capable as ARM code (including the ability to write interrupt handlers). This requires a bit of care, and use of a new \"IT\" (if-then) instruction, which permits up to four successive instructions to execute based on a tested condition, or on its inverse. When compiling into ARM code, this is ignored, but when compiling into Thumb it generates an actual instruction. For example:\n\n<source lang=\"nasm\">\n; if (r0 == r1)\nCMP r0, r1\nITE EQ        ; ARM: no code ... Thumb: IT instruction\n; then r0 = r2;\nMOVEQ r0, r2  ; ARM: conditional; Thumb: condition via ITE 'T' (then)\n; else r0 = r3;\nMOVNE r0, r3  ; ARM: conditional; Thumb: condition via ITE 'E' (else)\n; recall that the Thumb MOV instruction has no bits to encode \"EQ\" or \"NE\".\n</source>\n\nAll ARMv7 chips support the Thumb instruction set. All chips in the Cortex-A series, Cortex-R series, and ARM11 series support both \"ARM instruction set state\" and \"Thumb instruction set state\", while chips in the [[ARM Cortex-M|Cortex-M]] series support only the Thumb instruction set.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/architecture.html |title=ARM Processor Instruction Set Architecture |publisher=Arm.com |accessdate=18 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090415171228/http://arm.com/products/CPUs/architecture.html| archivedate= 15 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS7814673959.html |title=ARM aims son of Thumb at uCs, ASSPs, SoCs |publisher=Linuxdevices.com |accessdate=18 April 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121209133741/http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/ARM-aims-son-of-Thumb-at-uCs-ASSPs-SoCs/ |archive-date=9 December 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0290g/I1005458.html |title=ARM Information Center |publisher=Infocenter.arm.com |accessdate=18 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|ThumbEE}}Thumb Execution Environment (ThumbEE)===\n''ThumbEE'' (erroneously called ''Thumb-2EE'' in some ARM documentation), which was marketed as [https://web.archive.org/web/20170602084751/https://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/jazelle.php Jazelle RCT] (Runtime Compilation Target), was announced in 2005, first appearing in the ''Cortex-A8'' processor. ThumbEE is a fourth instruction set state, making small changes to the Thumb-2 extended instruction set. These changes make the instruction set particularly suited to code generated at runtime (e.g. by [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT compilation]]) in managed ''Execution Environments''. ThumbEE is a target for languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Perl]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and allows [[JIT compiler]]s to output smaller compiled code without impacting performance.\n\nNew features provided by ThumbEE include automatic null pointer checks on every load and store instruction, an instruction to perform an array bounds check, and special instructions that call a handler.

He later plead guilty to the murders and numerous robberies, and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].<ref name=term>{{Citeweb|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41657911/hunter-pleads-guilty-1/|title=Man gets 8 life terms in stranglings|author=Gary Hendricks|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=May 6, 1987}}</ref>\n\n==Murders==\nThe first victim was 85-year-old Annie Rochelle Copeland, who lived alone in a small apartment in southwest Atlanta. She was found by a neighbor, a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], on March 1, 1986, who got worried after knocking on the door and receiving no reply. She was found lying on her bed in the fetal position, covered with a bedspread and blanket, and her face covered by a pillow and her blue nightgown. The apartment had been turned upside down, with items from a pocketbook strewn about and a bloody pillowcase placed between her legs. The perpetrator had managed to enter by cutting the screen of a living room window and pulling out the windowpane.<ref name=sly>{{Citeweb|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41653775/richard-lewis-hunter-victims-and-early/|title=Slayings|author=Bill Montgomery|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=April 12, 1986}}</ref> The killing scared other elderly residents living near [[Clark University]], who took additional measures to protect themselves in case the perpetrator struck again.<ref>{{Citeweb|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41652736/annie-rochelle-copeland-richard-hunter/|title=Police believe robbery motive in women's killing|author=David Corvette|publisher=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=March 2, 1986}}</ref>\n\nOnly a few days later, on March 6, 25-year-old Felton Clements went to check on his 61-year-old mother Aretha, who lived alone in northwest Atlanta, only to find her dead and her apartment ransacked. Mrs. Clements had been manually strangled and then wrapped up in her bedspread, nightgown disarranged, her head put against the foot of the bed and her right leg beneath her. Her plants had been overturned, her drawers emptied, with the killer then stealing her 25-inch color TV set and a pocketbook.<ref name=sly/> There were no suspects in this case either, as Aretha rarely left her home, except when visiting her best friend or for treatment at [[Grady Memorial Hospital]].<ref>{{Citeweb|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41652957/aretha-clements-hunter-victim/|title=Son finds mother, 61, slain at her small apartment|author=Larry Copeland|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=March 7, 1986}}</ref>\n\nThe situation repeated on March 11, with the discovery of the body of 62-year-old Dena Mae Mike, a blind woman who hasn't been seen in two days.<ref name=hunt>{{Citeweb|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41653182/dena-mae-mike-pt1-hunter/|title=Police hunt link in slayings of 3 elderly women|author=Larry Copeland|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=March 12, 1986}}</ref> Similarly to Copeland and Clements, she had either been smothered, and several objects had been placed on her head, including a sweater, a pillow, a plastic garment bag with clothing on hangers and a duffel bag. Like Copeland, her nightgown had been trampled with, and a bloody pillowcase was found between her legs.<ref name=sly/> Her killer had apparently entered through a kitchen window.<ref>{{Citeweb|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41653225/dena-mike-murder-by-hunter-pt2/|title=Slayings|author=Larry Copeland|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=March 12, 1986}}</ref> With Mike's death, law enforcement from Atlanta Homicide began to make connections between the recent murders: all of the victims had been elderly black women, living alone off [[Social Security (United States)|social security benefits]], within one general area, and all had had their apartments burgled and items stolen after death. The [[Georgia Bureau of Investigation|GBI]] was involved in the investigations, and residents of the area were querried about any suspicious individuals in the area.<ref name=hunt/>\n\nFor the following weeks, the murders suddenly ceased, before abruptly resuming with the killing of 65-year-old Grace Hill on April 9. She was found by her friends, partially naked, on her living room floor in northwest Atlanta, suffocated to death and signs of possible sexual assault. The killer, whom had entered through an unlocked back door, had put a newspaper over her chest, and a doll between her legs.<ref name=sly/> With her death, the authorities officially announced to the media that they were investigating all four deaths as the doings of a serial killer.<ref>{{Citeweb|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41653358/grace-hill-4th-victim-of-hunter/|title=Fourth elderly women found dead|publisher=[[Hawaii Tribune-Herald]]|date=April 10, 1986}}</ref>\n\n===Community response and perpetrator profile===\nThe murders caused a great stir in the city, including among politicians and community leaders, with then-Governor [[Joe Frank Harris]] offering a total of $8,000 reward for any information regarding the murders. Comparisons were also drawn to the [[Atlanta murders of 1979\u20131981]], albeit most of the victims were younger males.<ref>{{Citeweb|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41653503/richard-hunter-victim-similarities/|title=Elderly westside victims lived, died in poverty and isolation|author=Bill Montgomery|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=April 12, 1986}}</ref> According to Dr. James Alan Fox, the killer was black, in his 30s, and lived near the victims, additionally theorizing that he was a sadist and that he might've developed a hatred for the elderly due to an abusive childhood.<ref name=sly/>\n\n==Arrest, trial and imprisonment==\nIn mid-April, an anonymous tip was received by police about a certain felon who should be investigated for the series.
