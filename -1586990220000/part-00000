The [[foundation stock]], a general [[landrace]] of small dogs of the region, are widely found throughout the country, have traditionally been more common in urban areas, and have been a popular companion of Greeks for centuries.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name {{lang|el-Latn|Kokoni}} probably derives from the word {{lang|el|\u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1}} {{lang|el-Latn|kokona}} which is another word for 'daughter' in [[Modern Greek]]. In past times, the daughter's life was mostly in and around the house, so the Kokoni dog was the 'daughter's dog' or the 'dog for the house', unlike the [[hunting dog]]s or the [[livestock guardian dog]]s.\n\nIn some places in Greece, the word {{lang|el-Latn|kokoni}} is used for any dog incapable of serious working duties (e.g., if a livestock guardian dog shows signs of fear, the shepherd calls it {{lang|el-Latn|kokoni}}). In other places in Greece, the word is used for any small dog.  \n\n==Breed recognition==\nA [[Breed standard|standardized breed]] named the Kokoni has been developed from [[landrace]] dogs of Greece, and is formally recognized as a breed by the [[Greek Kennel Club]]. The details below pertain to this breed. They are not yet recognized by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]] (the major international [[breed registry]] for dogs).  \n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Kokoni dog at international dog show in Greece.jpg|thumb|left|A black and tan Small Greek Domestic Dog]]\nThis breed of dog is of a small to medium size, ranging from approximately 4 to 8 kilograms, and with an average height around 28 centimeters.  They have dropped ears, a short snout, and a long body, with a long and curved tail.  This breed comes in a variety of colors and combinations of colors, such as black and tan, blonde, cream, and white.  \n\n[[File:Cadela da ra\u00e7a Kokoni.jpg|thumb|The coat is may be slightly wavy]]\nThe coat of the Kokoni is of three lengths, and is easy to groom. It can be straight or wavy, but it should always feel silky. The coat is rich, dense and weatherproof. Straight coated Kokoni's are genetically dominant to wavy coated Kokoni's. \n\nThe sickle-shaped tail of the Kokoni is usually long. The dog holds its tail up high, and has an elegant curve.  The coat of this dog forms a brush under its tail.\n\nThis breed of dog has large eyes which vary in shape from round to more of an almond shape. They are bright and are not deep-set. The color goes with the color of the coat, but they will never be transparent or blue. \n\nThe muzzle \"tapers easily to the nose\", and the topline is level. The nose of the has well-opened nostrils. It is not large compared to the muzzle, and it is moist, flat, and level on the front surface. The jaws are strong, with scissor-bite teeth.\n\n==Temperament==\n\nKokoni's have a loud, strong bark for their size though they do not bark much. The Kokoni is said{{by whom?|date=February 2020}} to have an even temper and gentle disposition, and to be lively, cheerful, amiable and not generally aggressive or timid.
