Gierek replaced [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party|First Secretary]] of the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) in the [[Polish People's Republic]] in 1970. He is known for opening communist Poland to Western influence and for his economic policies based on foreign loans, which ultimately failed. He was removed from power after labour strikes led to the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]] between the communist state and workers of the emerging [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity free trade union]] movement.\n\nBorn in [[Upper Silesia]] to a devoutly Catholic family, Gierek emigrated with his relatives to [[France]] at a young age. In 1934, he was deported to Poland for communist advocacy and campaigning, but subsequently moved to [[Belgium]] to work as a coal miner in [[Genk]]. As a result, he was proficient in [[French language|French]], which benefited in pursuing his future political career. During the [[Second World War]], Gierek was active in the [[Belgian Resistance]] against the Germans. He returned to [[Polish People's Republic|post-war Poland]] only in 1948 after spending 22 years abroad. In 1954, he became part of the Central Committee of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) under [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] as a representative of the Silesian region. Known for his openness and public speaking, Gierek gradually emerged as one of the most respected and progressive politicians in the country, whilst becoming a strong opponent to more authoritarian [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]].\n\nGomu\u0142ka was removed from office after the [[1970 Polish protests]] were violently throttled on his authority. In December 1970, Gierek was appointed the new First Secretary and ''de facto'' leader of the Polish People's Republic. The first years of his term were marked by industrialization as well as the improvement of living and working conditions. Having spent time in [[Western Europe]], he opened communist Poland to new Western ideas and loosened the [[Censorship in Communist Poland|censorship]], thus turning Poland into the most [[Liberalism|liberal]] country of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The large sums of money lent by foreign [[creditor]]s were directed at constructing [[blocks of flats]] and at creating heavy steel and coal industries in his native Silesia. In 1976, Gierek opened the first fully-operational Polish [[highway]] from Warsaw to [[Katowice]], which colloquially bares his name to this day. However, by the end of the 1970s Poland submerged into decline. The country was so heavily indebted that [[rationing]] was introduced due to shortages as the government was unable to pay off the loans. In 1980, he allowed for the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity trade union]] to appear per [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], which formed a basis for workers' rights. Seen as a radical move to renounce communism, Gierek was removed from office alike his predecessor.\n\nDespite dragging Poland into financial and economic decline, Edward Gierek is fondly remembered for his patriotism and modernization policies; over 1.8 million flats were constructed to house the growing population, and he is also responsible for initiating the production of [[Fiat 126]] in Poland and the erection of [[Warszawa Centralna railway station]], the most modern European station at the time of its completion.<ref>https://polskatimes.pl/ile-mieszkan-wybudowal-nam-gierek/ar/c3-10155120?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=ff5dd947416156ef6b876d9cf528f5e76d8e5814-1584261839-0-ATDwZQbB41psZXHHm6pnvorV6To4w2wQb_T9REkLxDYw3H7Wsapcq5QiqQX8YiNn4hYCWB1wueboZgbYOMd23YA5DAzJBAzFp4wyFsvkM0AyPpeDvKG_kJ_4qLSRH01sGamBQ04EuqVMY2UzLxBMhK8s-xHKk9B2IWkW1uSNZnFy9B-ihenJlj0y5C0l22CeRMoKdKn4IiOMx4PQ5n8Y-NirHySFJaEFUqlcp5F2Hau8vqPzSzvOOCZNl83GbvaE038p6Cq-O1ltOHGqRKaUyOc_xKVF7w0D_l5u-jgNUGMUZ3oqkvQj5l-8ngoOyTQPDX4wqZjlFBUenqpStPWx79Y</ref> Numerous aphorisms and sayings were popularized under his term, in particular the ones referring to the food shortages were later promoted by [[Ronald Reagan]].    \n \n==Youth and early career==\n\nEdward Gierek was born in Por\u0105bka, now part of [[Sosnowiec]], into a coal mining family.<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 94\"/> He lost his father to a mining accident in a pit at the age of four. His mother remarried and emigrated to northern [[France]], where he lived from the age of 10 and worked in a coal mine from the age of 13. Gierek joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1931 and in 1934 was deported to Poland for organizing a strike.<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 68\"/><ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/> After completing compulsory military service in [[Stryi]] in southeastern Poland (1934\u20131936), Gierek married Stanis\u0142awa J\u0119drusik, but was unable to find employment. The Giereks went to [[Belgium]], where Edward worked in the coal mines of [[Genk|Waterschei]], contracting [[pneumoconiosis]] (black lung disease) in the process. In 1939 Gierek joined the [[Communist Party of Belgium]]. During the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation]], he participated in communist anti-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Belgian Resistance|Belgian resistance activities]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/><ref name=\"Gajdzinski 53\"/> After the war Gierek remained politically active among the Polish immigrant community. He was a co-founder of the Belgian branch of the [[Polish Workers' Party]] (PPR) and a chairman of the National Council of Poles in Belgium.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/>\n\n==Polish United Workers' Party activist==\n\n[[File:Edward Gierek Dzie\u0144 Czynu Partyjnego 1974.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Gierek and wife contribute on Party Volunteer Labor Day]]\n\nGierek, who in 1948 was 35 and had spent 22 years abroad, was directed by the PPR authorities to return to Poland, which he did with his wife and their two sons.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/><ref name=\"Gajdzinski 57\"/> Working in the [[Katowice]] district PPR organization, in December 1948, as a [[Sosnowiec]] delegate he participated in the PPR-[[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]] unification congress, which resulted in the establishment of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR). In 1949, he was designated for and attended a two-year higher party course in [[Warsaw]], where he was judged to be poorly qualified for intellectual endeavors but highly motivated for party work. In 1951 [[Roman Zambrowski]] sent Gierek to a striking coal mine, charging him with restoring order. Gierek was able to resolve the situation using persuasion and a use of force was avoided.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 262\u2013264\"/>  He was a member of the ''[[Sejm]]'', Polish parliament, from 1952.<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 70\"/> During the II Congress of the PZPR (March 1954), he was elected a member of the party's [[Central Committee]]. As chief of the Central Committee's Heavy Industry Division, he worked directly under First Secretary [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] in Warsaw.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 262\u2013264\"/>\n\nIn March 1956, when [[Edward Ochab]] became the party's first secretary, Gierek became a secretary of the Central Committee, even though he publicly expressed doubts about his own qualifications. On 28 June 1956 he was sent to [[Pozna\u0144]], where a [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|workers' protest]] was taking place. Afterwards, delegated by the [[Politburo]], he headed the commission charged with investigating the causes and course of the Pozna\u0144 events. They presented their report on 7 July, blaming a hostile anti-socialist foreign inspired conspiracy that took advantage of worker discontent in Pozna\u0144 enterprises. In July Gierek became a member of the PZPR Politburo, but lasted in that position only until October, when [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] [[Polish October|replaced Ochab as first secretary]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] criticized Gomu\u0142ka for not retaining Gierek in the Politburo; he remained a Central Committee secretary responsible for economic affairs, however. He would return to the Politburo in March 1959, at the III Congress of the PZPR.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 264\u2013268\"/>\n\n==Katowice industrial district leader==\n\n[[File:Gierek in Rz\u0105\u015bnik.jpg|thumb|right|235 px|First Secretary Edward Gierek (second from left)]]\n\nIn March 1957, in addition to his Central Committee duties, Gierek became first secretary of the [[Katowice Voivodeship]] PZPR organization, and he kept this job until 1970.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 264\u2013268\"/> He created a personal power base in the Katowice region and became the nationally recognized leader of the young technocrat faction of the party. On the one hand Gierek was regarded as a pragmatic, non-ideological and economic progress-oriented manager, on the other he was known for his servile attitude toward the Soviet leaders, for whom he was a source of information concerning the PZPR and its personalities. Both the industrial supremacy of Gierek's well-run [[Upper Silesia]] territory and the special relationship with the Soviets he cultivated made many believe that Gierek was a likely successor to Gomu\u0142ka.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 268\u2013272\"/>\n\nGierek may have tried to make his move during the [[1968 Polish political crisis]]. Soon after the student rally on 8 March in Warsaw, on 14 March in Katowice he led a mass gathering of 100,000 party members from the entire province. He was the first Politburo member to speak publicly on the issue of the protests then taking place and later claimed that his motivation was to demonstrate support for Gomu\u0142ka's rule, threatened by [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]]'s intra-party conspiring. Gierek used strong language to condemn the purported \"enemies of [[Polish People's Republic|People's Poland]]\" who were \"disturbing the peaceful [[Silesia]]n water\". He showered them with propaganda epithets and alluded to their bones being crushed if they persevered in their attempts to turn the \"nation\" away from its \"chosen course.\" Gierek was supposedly embarrassed when participants of the party conference in Warsaw on 19 March shouted his name along with that of Gomu\u0142ka, as an expression of support. The 1968 events strengthened Gierek's position, also in the eyes of his sponsors in [[Moscow]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 272\u2013275\"/>\n\n==First secretary of the PZPR==\n\n[[File:Osiedle Ustronie w Radomiu 3.jpg|thumb|235px|Gierek participated in hundreds of field trips and visitations, meeting ordinary Poles and seeking their feedback<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/>]]\n\nWhen the [[1970 Polish protests]] were violently suppressed, Gierek replaced Gomu\u0142ka as first secretary of the party and had thus become the most powerful politician in Poland.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 275\u2013277\"/> In late January 1971, he put his new authority on the line and traveled to [[Szczecin]] and [[Gda\u0144sk]], to bargain personally with the striking workers.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\"/> Consumer price increases that triggered the recent revolt were rescinded. Among Gierek's popular moves was the decision to rebuild the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle in Warsaw]], destroyed during [[World War II]] and not included in the post-war restoration of the city's [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]]. State controlled media stressed his Western upbringing and his fluency in the French language.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/>\n\nThe arrival of the Gierek team meant the final generational replacement of the ruling communist elite, a process begun in 1968 under Gomu\u0142ka. Many thousands of party activists, including important elder leaders with background in the prewar [[Communist Party of Poland]], were removed from positions of responsibility and replaced with people whose careers formed after World War II. Much of the overhaul was accomplished during and after the VI Congress of the PZPR, convened in December 1971. The resulting [[nomenklatura|governing class]] was one of the youngest in Europe. The role of the administration was expanded at the expense of the party, according to the maxim \"the party leads, the government governs\". Throughout the 1970s, the most highly visible member of the top leadership after Gierek was Prime Minister [[Piotr Jaroszewicz]]. From May 1971, Gierek's rival party politician Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar was increasingly marginalized.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/>\n\nAccording to historian [[Krzysztof Pomian]], early in his term Gierek abandoned the regime's long-standing practice of on-and-off confrontation with the Polish [[Catholic Church]], and opted for cooperation. The policy resulted in a privileged position of the Church and its leaders for the duration of the communist rule in Poland. The Church markedly expanded its physical infrastructure and also became a crucial political third force, often involved in mediating conflict between the authorities and opposition activists.<ref name=\"Krzysztof Pomian\"/>\n\n===Economic expansion and decline===\n[[Image:Huta Katowice 20081030.jpg|400px|right|thumb|[[Katowice Steelworks]], Gierek's major industrial project]]\n\nSince the riots that brought down Gomu\u0142ka were caused primarily by economic difficulties, Gierek promised economic reform and instituted a program to modernize industry and increase the availability of consumer goods. His \"reform\" was based primarily on large scale foreign borrowing, not accompanied by major systemic restructuring. The need for deeper reform was obscured by the investment boom the country was enjoying in the first half of the 1970s.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/> The first secretary's good relations with Western leaders, especially France's [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] and [[West Germany]]'s [[Helmut Schmidt]], were a catalyst for his receiving Western aid and loans. Gierek is widely credited with opening Poland to political and economic influence from the West. He himself extensively traveled abroad and received important foreign guests in Poland, including three presidents of the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/> Gierek also was trusted by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], which meant that he was able to pursue his policies ([[globalization]] of Poland's economy) without much [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] interference.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/><ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\"/> He had readily granted the Soviets concessions that his predecessor Gomu\u0142ka would consider contrary to the Polish national interest.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/>\n\n[[File:Polski Fiat 126p rocznik 1973.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Polish [[Fiat 126]]p, nicknamed ''maluch'' (tiny)]]\n\n[[Standard of living]] increased markedly in Poland in the first half of the 1970s, and for a time Gierek was hailed as a miracle-worker. Poles, to an unprecedented degree, were able to purchase desired consumer items such as compact cars, travel to the West rather freely, and even a solution to the intractable housing supply problem seemed to be on the horizon. Decades later many remembered the period as the most prosperous in their lives.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 285\u2013286\"/> The economy, however, began to falter during the [[1973 oil crisis]], and by 1976 price increases became necessary. The [[June 1976 protests]] were forcibly suppressed, but the planned price increases were canceled. The greatest accumulation of foreign debt occurred in the late 1970s, as the regime struggled to counter the effects of the crisis.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/>\n\n===Crisis, protests, organized opposition===\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Edward Gierek First Secretary of Poland - NARA - 177308.tif|thumb|235px|left|Gierek with President [[Jimmy Carter]]]]\n\nThe period of Gierek's rule is notable for the rise of organized opposition in Poland. Changes in the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|constitution]], proposed by the regime, caused considerable controversy at the turn of 1975 and 1976. The intended amendments included formalizing the \"socialist character of the state\", the leading role of the PZPR and the Polish-Soviet alliance. The widely opposed alterations resulted in numerous protest letters and other actions, but were supported at the VII Congress of the PZPR in December 1975 and largely implemented by the ''[[Sejm]]'' in February 1976. Organized opposition circles developed gradually and reached 3000\u20134000 members by the end of the decade.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 289\u2013290\"/>\n\nBecause of the deteriorating economic situation, at the end of 1975 the authorities announced that the 1971 freeze in food prices would have to be lifted. Prime Minister Jaroszewicz forced the price rises, in combination with financial compensation favoring upper income brackets; the policy ultimately was adopted despite strong objections voiced by the Soviet leadership. The increase, supported by Gierek, was announced by Jaroszewicz in the ''Sejm'' on 24 June 1976. Strikes broke out the following day, with particularly serious disturbances, brutally pacified by the police, taking place in [[Radom]], at Warsaw's [[Ursus Factory]] and in [[P\u0142ock]]. On 26 June, Gierek engaged in the traditional party crisis-confronting mode of operation, ordering mass public gatherings in Polish cities to demonstrate people's supposed support for the party and condemn the \"trouble makers\".<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 290\u2013296\"/>\n\n[[File:Kartka cukier 1kg 07-76.jpg|thumb|1976 food [[Ration stamp|ration card]]]]\n\nOrdered by Brezhnev not to attempt any further manipulations with prices, Gierek and his government undertook other measures to rescue the market destabilized in the summer of 1976. In August, sugar \"merchandise coupons\" were introduced to ration the product. The politics of \"dynamic development\" was over, as evidenced by such [[ration stamp|ration cards]], which would remain a part of Poland's daily reality until July 1989.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 290\u2013296\"/>\n\nIn the aftermath of the June 1976 protests, a major opposition group, the [[Workers' Defence Committee]] (KOR), commenced its activities in September to help the persecuted worker protest participants. Other opposition organizations were also established in 1977\u201379, but historically the KOR proved to be of particular importance.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 296\u2013300\"/>\n \nIn 1979, Poland's ruling communists reluctantly allowed [[Pope John Paul II]] to make his first papal visit to Poland (2\u201310 June), despite Soviet advice to the contrary. Gierek, who had previously met [[Pope Paul VI]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], talked with the Pope on the occasion of his visit.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 296\u2013300\"/>\n\n==Downfall==\n\nAlthough Gierek, distressed by the 1976 price increase policy failure, was persuaded by his colleagues not to resign, divisions within his team intensified. One faction, led by [[Edward Babiuch]] and Piotr Jaroszewicz, wanted him to remain at the helm, while another, led by [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]] and [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], was less interested in preserving his leadership.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 290\u2013296\"/>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S0529-101, Frankfurt-Oder, Edward Gierek, Erich Honecker.jpg|thumb|235px|left|Gierek with [[East Germany|East German]] leader [[Erich Honecker]]]]\n\nIn May 1980, after the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and the subsequent Western boycott of the Soviet Union, Gierek arranged a meeting between [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in Warsaw. As was the case with [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] a decade earlier, a foreign policy success created an illusion that the Polish party leader was secure in his statesman aura, while the paramount political facts were being determined by the deteriorating economic situation and the resultant labor unrest. In July Gierek went to the [[Crimea]], his usual vacation spot. For the last time he talked there with his friend Brezhnev. He responded to Brezhnev's gloomy assessment of the situation in Poland (including the out-of-control indebtedness) with his own upbeat predictions, possibly not fully cognizant of the country's, and his own, predicament.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 300\u2013304\"/>\n\nHigh foreign debts, food shortages, and an outmoded industrial base were among the factors that forced a new round of economic reforms. Once again, in the summer of 1980 price increases set off protests across the country, especially in the [[Gda\u0144sk]] and [[Szczecin]] [[Gda\u0144sk Shipyard|shipyards]]. Unlike on previous occasions, the regime decided not to resort to force to suppress the strikes. In the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]] and other accords reached with Polish workers, Gierek was forced to concede their right to strike, and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] labor union was born.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 300\u2013304\"/>\n\n[[File:Gr\u00f3b Edwarda i Stanis\u0142awy Gierek.jpg|thumb|155px|Grave of Edward and Stanis\u0142awa Gierek in [[Sosnowiec]]]]\n\nShortly thereafter, in early September 1980, he was replaced by the Central Committee's VI [[Plenary session|Plenum]] as party first secretary by [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]] and removed from power.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 300\u2013304\"/> A popular and trusted leader in the early 1970s, Gierek left surrounded by infamy and ridicule, deserted by most of his collaborators.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\"/> The VII Plenum in December 1980 held Gierek and Jaroszewicz personally liable for the situation in the country and removed them from the Central Committee.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 305\u2013311\"/> The extraordinary IX Congress of the PZPR, in an unprecedented move, voted in July 1981 to expel Gierek and his close associates from the party, as the delegates considered them responsible for the Solidarity-related crisis in Poland, and First Secretary Kania was unable to prevent their action.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 368\u2013369\"/> The next first secretary of the PZPR, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], introduced [[martial law in Poland]] on 13 December 1981. Gierek was [[internment|interned]] for a year from December 1981. Unlike the (also-interned) opposition activists, the internment status brought Gierek no social respect. He ended his political career as the era's main [[Outcast (person)|pariah]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 305\u2013311\"/>\n\nEdward Gierek died in July 2001 of the miner's lung illness in a hospital in [[Cieszyn]], near the southern mountain resort of [[Ustro\u0144]] where he spent his last years. From the perspective of time his rule was now seen in a more positive light and over ten thousand people attended his funeral.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 305\u2013311\"/>\n\nWith his lifelong wife, Stanis\u0142awa ''n\u00e9e'' J\u0119drusik, Gierek had two sons,<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/> one of whom is [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Adam Gierek]].\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn 1990 two books, based on extended interviews with Gierek by Janusz Rolicki, were published in Poland and became bestsellers.<ref name=\"Rzeczpospolita\"/>\n\nPolish society is divided in its assessment of Gierek. His government is fondly remembered by some for the improved living standards the Poles enjoyed in the 1970s under his rule. Uniquely among the PZPR leaders, the Polish public has shown signs of Gierek nostalgia, discernible especially after the former first secretary's death.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\"/>\n\nOthers emphasize that the improvements were only made possible by the unwise and unsustainable policies based on huge foreign loans, which led directly to the economic crises of the 1970s and 1980s. Judged by hindsight, the total sum of over 24 [[billion]] borrowed (in 1970s dollars) was not well-spent.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\"/>\n\nUpon becoming first secretary in December 1970, Gierek promised himself that under his watch people would not be shot on streets. In 1976 the security forces did intervene in strikes, but only after giving up their firearms. In 1980, they did not use force at all.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 305\u2013311\"/>\n\nAccording to sociologist Maciej Gdula, the social and cultural transformation that took place in [[History of Poland (1945\u201389)#Gierek decade (1970\u201380)|Poland in the 1970s]] was even more fundamental than the one which occurred in the 1990s, following the [[History of Poland (1945\u201389)#Politics of the  People's Republic's last years and the transition period|political transition]]. Regarding the politics of alliance of the political and later also money elites with the [[middle class]] at the expense of the [[working class]], he said \"the general idea of the relationship of forces in our society has remained the same from the 1970s, and the [[History of Poland (1945\u201389)#Final decade of the Polish People's Republic (1980\u201390)|period of mass solidarity]] was an exception\" (\"mass solidarity\" being the years 1980\u201381). Since the time of Gierek, Polish society has been hegemonized by cultural perceptions and norms of the (at that time emerging) middle class. Terms like management, initiative, personality, or the [[individualism|individualistic]] maxim \"get educated, work hard and get ahead in life\", combined with orderliness, replaced [[class consciousness]] and the socialist [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] concept, as workers were losing their symbolic status, to be eventually separated into a marginalized stratum.<ref name=\"Gdula Sutowski\"/>\n\n==Decorations and awards==\n* [[Order of the Builders of People's Poland]]\n* Grand Collar of the [[Order of Prince Henry]] (Portugal)\n* [[Order of Lenin]] (Soviet Union)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Poland|Politics|Communism|History}}\n* [[History of Poland (1945\u201389)]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 255\u2013260</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], Wydawnictwo Czerwone i Czarne, Warszawa 2014, {{ISBN|978-83-7700-042-7}}, pp. 260\u2013262</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 262\u2013264\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 262\u2013264</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 264\u2013268\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 264\u2013268</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 268\u2013272\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 268\u2013272</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 272\u2013275\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 272\u2013275</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 275\u2013277\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 275\u2013277</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 277\u2013285</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 285\u2013286\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 285\u2013286</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 289\u2013290\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 289\u2013290</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 290\u2013296\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 290\u2013296</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 296\u2013300\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 296\u2013300</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 300\u2013304\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 300\u2013304</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 305\u2013311\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 305\u2013311</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 368\u2013369\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 368\u2013369</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 53\">{{cite book| first= Piotr | last= Gajdzi\u0144ski | title=Gierek Cz\u0142owiek z w\u0119gla |trans-title=Gierek: the man of coal| page=53}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 57\">{{cite book | first= Piotr | last= Gajdzi\u0144ski | title=Gierek Cz\u0142owiek z w\u0119gla |trans-title=Gierek: the man of coal | page = 57}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 68\">{{cite book| first= Piotr | last= Gajdzi\u0144ski | title=Gierek Cz\u0142owiek z w\u0119gla |trans-title=Gierek: the man of coal | page=68}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 70\">{{cite book| first= Piotr | last= Gajdzi\u0144ski | title=Gierek Cz\u0142owiek z w\u0119gla |trans-title=Gierek: the man of coal | page=70}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 94\">{{cite book| first= Piotr | last= Gajdzi\u0144ski | title=Gierek Cz\u0142owiek z w\u0119gla |trans-title=Gierek: the man of coal| publisher=Wydawnictwo Pozna\u0144skie | location=Pozna\u0144 | year=2013 | page=94 | isbn=978-83-7177-924-4}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gdula Sutowski\">Micha\u0142 Sutowski, ''Gdula: co nam zosta\u0142o z lat 70.?''

Gierek replaced [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party|First Secretary]] of the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) in the [[Polish People's Republic]] in 1970. He is known for opening communist Poland to Western influence and for his economic policies based on foreign loans, which ultimately failed. He was removed from power after labour strikes led to the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]] between the communist state and workers of the emerging [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity free trade union]] movement.\n\nBorn in [[Upper Silesia]] to a devoutly Catholic family, Gierek emigrated with his relatives to [[France]] at a young age. In 1934, he was deported to Poland for communist advocacy and campaigning, but subsequently moved to [[Belgium]] to work as a coal miner in [[Genk]]. As a result, he was proficient in [[French language|French]], which benefited in pursuing his future political career. During the [[Second World War]], Gierek was active in the [[Belgian Resistance]] against the Germans. He returned to [[Polish People's Republic|post-war Poland]] only in 1948 after spending 22 years abroad. In 1954, he became part of the Central Committee of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) under [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] as a representative of the Silesian region. Known for his openness and public speaking, Gierek gradually emerged as one of the most respected and progressive politicians in the country, whilst becoming a strong opponent to more authoritarian [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]].\n\nGomu\u0142ka was removed from office after the [[1970 Polish protests]] were violently throttled on his authority. In December 1970, Gierek was appointed the new First Secretary and ''de facto'' leader of the Polish People's Republic. The first years of his term were marked by industrialization as well as the improvement of living and working conditions. Having spent time in [[Western Europe]], he opened communist Poland to new Western ideas and loosened the [[Censorship in Communist Poland|censorship]], thus turning Poland into the most [[liberal]] country of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The large sums of money lent by foreign [[creditor]]s were directed at constructing [[blocks of flats]] and at creating heavy steel and coal industries in his native Silesia. In 1976, Gierek opened the first fully-operational Polish [[highway]] from Warsaw to [[Katowice]], which colloquially bares his name to this day. However, by the end of the 1970s Poland submerged into decline. The country was so heavily indebted that [[rationing]] was introduced due to shortages as the government was unable to pay off the loans. In 1980, he allowed for the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity trade union]] to appear per [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], which formed a basis for workers' rights. Seen as a radical move to renounce communism, Gierek was removed from office alike his predecessor.\n\nDespite dragging Poland into financial and economic decline, Edward Gierek is fondly remembered for his patriotism and modernization policies; over 1.8 million flats were constructed to house the growing population, and he is also responsible for initiating the production of [[Fiat 126]] in Poland and the erection of [[Warszawa Centralna railway station]], the most modern European station at the time of its completion.<ref>https://polskatimes.pl/ile-mieszkan-wybudowal-nam-gierek/ar/c3-10155120?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=ff5dd947416156ef6b876d9cf528f5e76d8e5814-1584261839-0-ATDwZQbB41psZXHHm6pnvorV6To4w2wQb_T9REkLxDYw3H7Wsapcq5QiqQX8YiNn4hYCWB1wueboZgbYOMd23YA5DAzJBAzFp4wyFsvkM0AyPpeDvKG_kJ_4qLSRH01sGamBQ04EuqVMY2UzLxBMhK8s-xHKk9B2IWkW1uSNZnFy9B-ihenJlj0y5C0l22CeRMoKdKn4IiOMx4PQ5n8Y-NirHySFJaEFUqlcp5F2Hau8vqPzSzvOOCZNl83GbvaE038p6Cq-O1ltOHGqRKaUyOc_xKVF7w0D_l5u-jgNUGMUZ3oqkvQj5l-8ngoOyTQPDX4wqZjlFBUenqpStPWx79Y</ref> Numerous aphorisms and sayings were popularized under his term, in particular the ones referring to the food shortages were later promoted by [[Ronald Reagan]].    \n \n==Youth and early career==\n\nEdward Gierek was born in Por\u0105bka, now part of [[Sosnowiec]], into a coal mining family.<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 94\"/> He lost his father to a mining accident in a pit at the age of four. His mother remarried and emigrated to northern [[France]], where he lived from the age of 10 and worked in a coal mine from the age of 13. Gierek joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1931 and in 1934 was deported to Poland for organizing a strike.<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 68\"/><ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/> After completing compulsory military service in [[Stryi]] in southeastern Poland (1934\u20131936), Gierek married Stanis\u0142awa J\u0119drusik, but was unable to find employment. The Giereks went to [[Belgium]], where Edward worked in the coal mines of [[Genk|Waterschei]], contracting [[pneumoconiosis]] (black lung disease) in the process. In 1939 Gierek joined the [[Communist Party of Belgium]]. During the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation]], he participated in communist anti-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Belgian Resistance|Belgian resistance activities]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/><ref name=\"Gajdzinski 53\"/> After the war Gierek remained politically active among the Polish immigrant community. He was a co-founder of the Belgian branch of the [[Polish Workers' Party]] (PPR) and a chairman of the National Council of Poles in Belgium.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/>\n\n==Polish United Workers' Party activist==\n\n[[File:Edward Gierek Dzie\u0144 Czynu Partyjnego 1974.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Gierek and wife contribute on Party Volunteer Labor Day]]\n\nGierek, who in 1948 was 35 and had spent 22 years abroad, was directed by the PPR authorities to return to Poland, which he did with his wife and their two sons.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/><ref name=\"Gajdzinski 57\"/> Working in the [[Katowice]] district PPR organization, in December 1948, as a [[Sosnowiec]] delegate he participated in the PPR-[[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]] unification congress, which resulted in the establishment of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR). In 1949, he was designated for and attended a two-year higher party course in [[Warsaw]], where he was judged to be poorly qualified for intellectual endeavors but highly motivated for party work. In 1951 [[Roman Zambrowski]] sent Gierek to a striking coal mine, charging him with restoring order. Gierek was able to resolve the situation using persuasion and a use of force was avoided.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 262\u2013264\"/>  He was a member of the ''[[Sejm]]'', Polish parliament, from 1952.<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 70\"/> During the II Congress of the PZPR (March 1954), he was elected a member of the party's [[Central Committee]]. As chief of the Central Committee's Heavy Industry Division, he worked directly under First Secretary [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] in Warsaw.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 262\u2013264\"/>\n\nIn March 1956, when [[Edward Ochab]] became the party's first secretary, Gierek became a secretary of the Central Committee, even though he publicly expressed doubts about his own qualifications. On 28 June 1956 he was sent to [[Pozna\u0144]], where a [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|workers' protest]] was taking place. Afterwards, delegated by the [[Politburo]], he headed the commission charged with investigating the causes and course of the Pozna\u0144 events. They presented their report on 7 July, blaming a hostile anti-socialist foreign inspired conspiracy that took advantage of worker discontent in Pozna\u0144 enterprises. In July Gierek became a member of the PZPR Politburo, but lasted in that position only until October, when [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] [[Polish October|replaced Ochab as first secretary]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] criticized Gomu\u0142ka for not retaining Gierek in the Politburo; he remained a Central Committee secretary responsible for economic affairs, however. He would return to the Politburo in March 1959, at the III Congress of the PZPR.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 264\u2013268\"/>\n\n==Katowice industrial district leader==\n\n[[File:Gierek in Rz\u0105\u015bnik.jpg|thumb|right|235 px|First Secretary Edward Gierek (second from left)]]\n\nIn March 1957, in addition to his Central Committee duties, Gierek became first secretary of the [[Katowice Voivodeship]] PZPR organization, and he kept this job until 1970.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 264\u2013268\"/> He created a personal power base in the Katowice region and became the nationally recognized leader of the young technocrat faction of the party. On the one hand Gierek was regarded as a pragmatic, non-ideological and economic progress-oriented manager, on the other he was known for his servile attitude toward the Soviet leaders, for whom he was a source of information concerning the PZPR and its personalities. Both the industrial supremacy of Gierek's well-run [[Upper Silesia]] territory and the special relationship with the Soviets he cultivated made many believe that Gierek was a likely successor to Gomu\u0142ka.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 268\u2013272\"/>\n\nGierek may have tried to make his move during the [[1968 Polish political crisis]]. Soon after the student rally on 8 March in Warsaw, on 14 March in Katowice he led a mass gathering of 100,000 party members from the entire province. He was the first Politburo member to speak publicly on the issue of the protests then taking place and later claimed that his motivation was to demonstrate support for Gomu\u0142ka's rule, threatened by [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]]'s intra-party conspiring. Gierek used strong language to condemn the purported \"enemies of [[Polish People's Republic|People's Poland]]\" who were \"disturbing the peaceful [[Silesia]]n water\". He showered them with propaganda epithets and alluded to their bones being crushed if they persevered in their attempts to turn the \"nation\" away from its \"chosen course.\" Gierek was supposedly embarrassed when participants of the party conference in Warsaw on 19 March shouted his name along with that of Gomu\u0142ka, as an expression of support. The 1968 events strengthened Gierek's position, also in the eyes of his sponsors in [[Moscow]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 272\u2013275\"/>\n\n==First secretary of the PZPR==\n\n[[File:Osiedle Ustronie w Radomiu 3.jpg|thumb|235px|Gierek participated in hundreds of field trips and visitations, meeting ordinary Poles and seeking their feedback<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/>]]\n\nWhen the [[1970 Polish protests]] were violently suppressed, Gierek replaced Gomu\u0142ka as first secretary of the party and had thus become the most powerful politician in Poland.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 275\u2013277\"/> In late January 1971, he put his new authority on the line and traveled to [[Szczecin]] and [[Gda\u0144sk]], to bargain personally with the striking workers.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\"/> Consumer price increases that triggered the recent revolt were rescinded. Among Gierek's popular moves was the decision to rebuild the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle in Warsaw]], destroyed during [[World War II]] and not included in the post-war restoration of the city's [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]]. State controlled media stressed his Western upbringing and his fluency in the French language.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/>\n\nThe arrival of the Gierek team meant the final generational replacement of the ruling communist elite, a process begun in 1968 under Gomu\u0142ka. Many thousands of party activists, including important elder leaders with background in the prewar [[Communist Party of Poland]], were removed from positions of responsibility and replaced with people whose careers formed after World War II. Much of the overhaul was accomplished during and after the VI Congress of the PZPR, convened in December 1971. The resulting [[nomenklatura|governing class]] was one of the youngest in Europe. The role of the administration was expanded at the expense of the party, according to the maxim \"the party leads, the government governs\". Throughout the 1970s, the most highly visible member of the top leadership after Gierek was Prime Minister [[Piotr Jaroszewicz]]. From May 1971, Gierek's rival party politician Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar was increasingly marginalized.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/>\n\nAccording to historian [[Krzysztof Pomian]], early in his term Gierek abandoned the regime's long-standing practice of on-and-off confrontation with the Polish [[Catholic Church]], and opted for cooperation. The policy resulted in a privileged position of the Church and its leaders for the duration of the communist rule in Poland. The Church markedly expanded its physical infrastructure and also became a crucial political third force, often involved in mediating conflict between the authorities and opposition activists.<ref name=\"Krzysztof Pomian\"/>\n\n===Economic expansion and decline===\n[[Image:Huta Katowice 20081030.jpg|400px|right|thumb|[[Katowice Steelworks]], Gierek's major industrial project]]\n\nSince the riots that brought down Gomu\u0142ka were caused primarily by economic difficulties, Gierek promised economic reform and instituted a program to modernize industry and increase the availability of consumer goods. His \"reform\" was based primarily on large scale foreign borrowing, not accompanied by major systemic restructuring. The need for deeper reform was obscured by the investment boom the country was enjoying in the first half of the 1970s.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/> The first secretary's good relations with Western leaders, especially France's [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] and [[West Germany]]'s [[Helmut Schmidt]], were a catalyst for his receiving Western aid and loans. Gierek is widely credited with opening Poland to political and economic influence from the West. He himself extensively traveled abroad and received important foreign guests in Poland, including three presidents of the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/> Gierek also was trusted by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], which meant that he was able to pursue his policies ([[globalization]] of Poland's economy) without much [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] interference.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/><ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\"/> He had readily granted the Soviets concessions that his predecessor Gomu\u0142ka would consider contrary to the Polish national interest.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/>\n\n[[File:Polski Fiat 126p rocznik 1973.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Polish [[Fiat 126]]p, nicknamed ''maluch'' (tiny)]]\n\n[[Standard of living]] increased markedly in Poland in the first half of the 1970s, and for a time Gierek was hailed as a miracle-worker. Poles, to an unprecedented degree, were able to purchase desired consumer items such as compact cars, travel to the West rather freely, and even a solution to the intractable housing supply problem seemed to be on the horizon. Decades later many remembered the period as the most prosperous in their lives.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 285\u2013286\"/> The economy, however, began to falter during the [[1973 oil crisis]], and by 1976 price increases became necessary. The [[June 1976 protests]] were forcibly suppressed, but the planned price increases were canceled. The greatest accumulation of foreign debt occurred in the late 1970s, as the regime struggled to counter the effects of the crisis.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\"/>\n\n===Crisis, protests, organized opposition===\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Edward Gierek First Secretary of Poland - NARA - 177308.tif|thumb|235px|left|Gierek with President [[Jimmy Carter]]]]\n\nThe period of Gierek's rule is notable for the rise of organized opposition in Poland. Changes in the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|constitution]], proposed by the regime, caused considerable controversy at the turn of 1975 and 1976. The intended amendments included formalizing the \"socialist character of the state\", the leading role of the PZPR and the Polish-Soviet alliance. The widely opposed alterations resulted in numerous protest letters and other actions, but were supported at the VII Congress of the PZPR in December 1975 and largely implemented by the ''[[Sejm]]'' in February 1976. Organized opposition circles developed gradually and reached 3000\u20134000 members by the end of the decade.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 289\u2013290\"/>\n\nBecause of the deteriorating economic situation, at the end of 1975 the authorities announced that the 1971 freeze in food prices would have to be lifted. Prime Minister Jaroszewicz forced the price rises, in combination with financial compensation favoring upper income brackets; the policy ultimately was adopted despite strong objections voiced by the Soviet leadership. The increase, supported by Gierek, was announced by Jaroszewicz in the ''Sejm'' on 24 June 1976. Strikes broke out the following day, with particularly serious disturbances, brutally pacified by the police, taking place in [[Radom]], at Warsaw's [[Ursus Factory]] and in [[P\u0142ock]]. On 26 June, Gierek engaged in the traditional party crisis-confronting mode of operation, ordering mass public gatherings in Polish cities to demonstrate people's supposed support for the party and condemn the \"trouble makers\".<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 290\u2013296\"/>\n\n[[File:Kartka cukier 1kg 07-76.jpg|thumb|1976 food [[Ration stamp|ration card]]]]\n\nOrdered by Brezhnev not to attempt any further manipulations with prices, Gierek and his government undertook other measures to rescue the market destabilized in the summer of 1976. In August, sugar \"merchandise coupons\" were introduced to ration the product. The politics of \"dynamic development\" was over, as evidenced by such [[ration stamp|ration cards]], which would remain a part of Poland's daily reality until July 1989.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 290\u2013296\"/>\n\nIn the aftermath of the June 1976 protests, a major opposition group, the [[Workers' Defence Committee]] (KOR), commenced its activities in September to help the persecuted worker protest participants. Other opposition organizations were also established in 1977\u201379, but historically the KOR proved to be of particular importance.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 296\u2013300\"/>\n \nIn 1979, Poland's ruling communists reluctantly allowed [[Pope John Paul II]] to make his first papal visit to Poland (2\u201310 June), despite Soviet advice to the contrary. Gierek, who had previously met [[Pope Paul VI]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], talked with the Pope on the occasion of his visit.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 296\u2013300\"/>\n\n==Downfall==\n\nAlthough Gierek, distressed by the 1976 price increase policy failure, was persuaded by his colleagues not to resign, divisions within his team intensified. One faction, led by [[Edward Babiuch]] and Piotr Jaroszewicz, wanted him to remain at the helm, while another, led by [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]] and [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], was less interested in preserving his leadership.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 290\u2013296\"/>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S0529-101, Frankfurt-Oder, Edward Gierek, Erich Honecker.jpg|thumb|235px|left|Gierek with [[East Germany|East German]] leader [[Erich Honecker]]]]\n\nIn May 1980, after the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and the subsequent Western boycott of the Soviet Union, Gierek arranged a meeting between [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in Warsaw. As was the case with [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] a decade earlier, a foreign policy success created an illusion that the Polish party leader was secure in his statesman aura, while the paramount political facts were being determined by the deteriorating economic situation and the resultant labor unrest. In July Gierek went to the [[Crimea]], his usual vacation spot. For the last time he talked there with his friend Brezhnev. He responded to Brezhnev's gloomy assessment of the situation in Poland (including the out-of-control indebtedness) with his own upbeat predictions, possibly not fully cognizant of the country's, and his own, predicament.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 300\u2013304\"/>\n\nHigh foreign debts, food shortages, and an outmoded industrial base were among the factors that forced a new round of economic reforms. Once again, in the summer of 1980 price increases set off protests across the country, especially in the [[Gda\u0144sk]] and [[Szczecin]] [[Gda\u0144sk Shipyard|shipyards]]. Unlike on previous occasions, the regime decided not to resort to force to suppress the strikes. In the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]] and other accords reached with Polish workers, Gierek was forced to concede their right to strike, and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] labor union was born.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 300\u2013304\"/>\n\n[[File:Gr\u00f3b Edwarda i Stanis\u0142awy Gierek.jpg|thumb|155px|Grave of Edward and Stanis\u0142awa Gierek in [[Sosnowiec]]]]\n\nShortly thereafter, in early September 1980, he was replaced by the Central Committee's VI [[Plenary session|Plenum]] as party first secretary by [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]] and removed from power.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 300\u2013304\"/> A popular and trusted leader in the early 1970s, Gierek left surrounded by infamy and ridicule, deserted by most of his collaborators.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\"/> The VII Plenum in December 1980 held Gierek and Jaroszewicz personally liable for the situation in the country and removed them from the Central Committee.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 305\u2013311\"/> The extraordinary IX Congress of the PZPR, in an unprecedented move, voted in July 1981 to expel Gierek and his close associates from the party, as the delegates considered them responsible for the Solidarity-related crisis in Poland, and First Secretary Kania was unable to prevent their action.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 368\u2013369\"/> The next first secretary of the PZPR, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], introduced [[martial law in Poland]] on 13 December 1981. Gierek was [[internment|interned]] for a year from December 1981. Unlike the (also-interned) opposition activists, the internment status brought Gierek no social respect. He ended his political career as the era's main [[Outcast (person)|pariah]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 305\u2013311\"/>\n\nEdward Gierek died in July 2001 of the miner's lung illness in a hospital in [[Cieszyn]], near the southern mountain resort of [[Ustro\u0144]] where he spent his last years. From the perspective of time his rule was now seen in a more positive light and over ten thousand people attended his funeral.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 305\u2013311\"/>\n\nWith his lifelong wife, Stanis\u0142awa ''n\u00e9e'' J\u0119drusik, Gierek had two sons,<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/> one of whom is [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Adam Gierek]].\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn 1990 two books, based on extended interviews with Gierek by Janusz Rolicki, were published in Poland and became bestsellers.<ref name=\"Rzeczpospolita\"/>\n\nPolish society is divided in its assessment of Gierek. His government is fondly remembered by some for the improved living standards the Poles enjoyed in the 1970s under his rule. Uniquely among the PZPR leaders, the Polish public has shown signs of Gierek nostalgia, discernible especially after the former first secretary's death.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\"/>\n\nOthers emphasize that the improvements were only made possible by the unwise and unsustainable policies based on huge foreign loans, which led directly to the economic crises of the 1970s and 1980s. Judged by hindsight, the total sum of over 24 [[billion]] borrowed (in 1970s dollars) was not well-spent.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\"/>\n\nUpon becoming first secretary in December 1970, Gierek promised himself that under his watch people would not be shot on streets. In 1976 the security forces did intervene in strikes, but only after giving up their firearms. In 1980, they did not use force at all.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 305\u2013311\"/>\n\nAccording to sociologist Maciej Gdula, the social and cultural transformation that took place in [[History of Poland (1945\u201389)#Gierek decade (1970\u201380)|Poland in the 1970s]] was even more fundamental than the one which occurred in the 1990s, following the [[History of Poland (1945\u201389)#Politics of the  People's Republic's last years and the transition period|political transition]]. Regarding the politics of alliance of the political and later also money elites with the [[middle class]] at the expense of the [[working class]], he said \"the general idea of the relationship of forces in our society has remained the same from the 1970s, and the [[History of Poland (1945\u201389)#Final decade of the Polish People's Republic (1980\u201390)|period of mass solidarity]] was an exception\" (\"mass solidarity\" being the years 1980\u201381). Since the time of Gierek, Polish society has been hegemonized by cultural perceptions and norms of the (at that time emerging) middle class. Terms like management, initiative, personality, or the [[individualism|individualistic]] maxim \"get educated, work hard and get ahead in life\", combined with orderliness, replaced [[class consciousness]] and the socialist [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] concept, as workers were losing their symbolic status, to be eventually separated into a marginalized stratum.<ref name=\"Gdula Sutowski\"/>\n\n==Decorations and awards==\n* [[Order of the Builders of People's Poland]]\n* Grand Collar of the [[Order of Prince Henry]] (Portugal)\n* [[Order of Lenin]] (Soviet Union)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Poland|Politics|Communism|History}}\n* [[History of Poland (1945\u201389)]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 255\u2013260\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 255\u2013260</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 260\u2013262\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], Wydawnictwo Czerwone i Czarne, Warszawa 2014, {{ISBN|978-83-7700-042-7}}, pp. 260\u2013262</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 262\u2013264\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 262\u2013264</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 264\u2013268\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 264\u2013268</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 268\u2013272\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 268\u2013272</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 272\u2013275\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 272\u2013275</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 275\u2013277\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 275\u2013277</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 277\u2013285\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 277\u2013285</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 285\u2013286\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 285\u2013286</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 289\u2013290\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 289\u2013290</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 290\u2013296\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 290\u2013296</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 296\u2013300\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 296\u2013300</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 300\u2013304\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 300\u2013304</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 305\u2013311\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 305\u2013311</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 368\u2013369\">Jerzy Eisler, ''Siedmiu wspania\u0142ych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR'' [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], pp. 368\u2013369</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 53\">{{cite book| first= Piotr | last= Gajdzi\u0144ski | title=Gierek Cz\u0142owiek z w\u0119gla |trans-title=Gierek: the man of coal| page=53}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 57\">{{cite book | first= Piotr | last= Gajdzi\u0144ski | title=Gierek Cz\u0142owiek z w\u0119gla |trans-title=Gierek: the man of coal | page = 57}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 68\">{{cite book| first= Piotr | last= Gajdzi\u0144ski | title=Gierek Cz\u0142owiek z w\u0119gla |trans-title=Gierek: the man of coal | page=68}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 70\">{{cite book| first= Piotr | last= Gajdzi\u0144ski | title=Gierek Cz\u0142owiek z w\u0119gla |trans-title=Gierek: the man of coal | page=70}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gajdzinski 94\">{{cite book| first= Piotr | last= Gajdzi\u0144ski | title=Gierek Cz\u0142owiek z w\u0119gla |trans-title=Gierek: the man of coal| publisher=Wydawnictwo Pozna\u0144skie | location=Pozna\u0144 | year=2013 | page=94 | isbn=978-83-7177-924-4}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gdula Sutowski\">Micha\u0142 Sutowski, ''Gdula: co nam zosta\u0142o z lat 70.?''

Studies show that internal migration mainly affects urbanizing middle income countries, such as [[China]], where more than one in three [[Rural area|rural]] children are left behind by migrating parents.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nInternational migration mainly affects high income countries, where immigrants make up at least 15% of the [[student]] population in half of [[school]]s.

More than half of those forcibly displaced are underage 18.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs of 2017, the number of forcibly displaced people worldwide was estimated at 68.5 million by UNHCR, including 40 million internally displaced persons, 25.4 million refugees and 3.1 million asylum-seekers. More than half of the 25.4 million refugees were [[child]]ren (below 18 years of age).<ref>UNHCR. 2018.

Increased [[classroom]] diversity brings both challenges and opportunities to learn from other [[culture]]s and experiences. Countries are challenged to fulfil the international commitment to respect the [[right to education]] for all, from addressing the needs of those cramming into [[slum]]s to living nomadically or awaiting refugee status.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Teacher]]s have to deal with [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] classrooms and traumas affecting displaced students. Qualifications and prior learning need to be recognized to make the most of migrants\u2019 and refugees\u2019 skills.\n\nInternal migration is challenging inclusion in education. [[Rural migration|Rural migrant]] workers constitute 21% of the [[China|Chinese]] population following the largest wave of internal migration in recent history. Residence permit restrictions introduced in an attempt to control the flows led the majority of migrant children in cities including [[Beijing]] to attend unauthorized migrant schools of lower quality.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBarriers to immigrant education persist despite efforts towards inclusion. In [[South Africa]], education legislation guarantees the [[right to education]] for all children regardless of migration or legal status, but [[immigration legislation]] prevents undocumented migrants from enrolling.\n\nIn the United States, anti-immigration raids led to surges in dropout among children of undocumented immigrants wary of deportation, where as an earlier policy providing deportation protection had increased secondary school completion.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Funds ===\nRefugee education remains underfunded. According to the ''Global Education Monitoring Report, Youth Report 2019'', an estimated US$800 million was spent on refugee education in 2016, split roughly equally between [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] and [[development aid]]. That is only about one-third of the most recently estimated funding gap. If the international community employed humanitarian aid only, the share to education would have to increase tenfold to meet refugees\u2019 education needs. Improving refugee education funding requires bridging humanitarian and development aid in line with commitments in the [[New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Educational improvements ==\nImproving educational needs can help refugees, migrants and displaced persons fully realise their [[potential]]. Non-formal education programmes can help strengthen a sense of belonging. [[Literacy]] skills support social and intercultural communication and physical, social and economic well-being, however barriers limit access to and success in adult language programmes in some countries. A 2016 survey of [[Asylum seeker|asylum-seekers]] in [[Germany]] showed that 34% were literate in a [[Latin script]], 51% were literate in another script and 15% were illiterate. Yet they were the least likely to attend a literacy or language course.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Curricula and textbooks ===\nAppropriate education content can help citizens critically process information and promote cohesive societies. Inappropriate content can spread negative, partial, exclusive or dismissive notions of [[Immigration|immigrants]] and [[refugee]]s. [[Curriculum|Curricula]] and [[textbook]]s often include outdated depictions of migration and displacement. According to research, 81% of respondents in [[European Union|EU]] countries agreed school materials should cover [[ethnic diversity]]. By not addressing diversity in education, countries ignore its power to promote social inclusion and cohesion. A global analysis showed that social science textbook coverage of conflict prevention and resolution (i.e. discussion of domestic or international trials, truth commissions and economic reparations) was low at around 10% of texts in 2000\u20132011.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Teacher training ===\n[[Teacher]]s affected by migration and displacement are inadequately prepared to carry out the more complex tasks, such as managing [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] classrooms and helping children needing [[psychosocial]] support. In six [[European Union|European]] countries, half of teachers felt there was insufficient support to manage diversity in the classroom.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the [[Syrian Arab Republic]], 73% of teachers surveyed had no training on providing children with psychosocial support. Teacher recruitment and management policies often react too slowly to emerging needs. [[Germany]] needs an additional 42,000 teachers and educators, [[Turkey]] needs 80,000 teachers and [[Uganda]] needs 7,000 primary teachers to teach all current refugees.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Recognition of qualifications ===\nRecognition of qualifications and prior learning can ease entry into [[labour markets]], especially concerning professional qualifications. If migrants and refugees lack access to [[employment]] that uses their [[skill]]s, they are unlikely to develop them further. However, less than one-quarter of global migrants are covered by a bilateral qualifications recognition agreement. Existing mechanisms are often fragmented or too complex to meet immigrants\u2019 and refugees\u2019 needs and end up underutilized.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Mobile learning ===\n[[File:A human\u2013organization\u2013technology model to map values of mobile learning for refugees.svg|thumb|A human\u2013organization\u2013technology model to map values of mobile learning for refugees]]\n{{Main|Mobile learning for refugees}}\n\nMobile learning for refugees ensures that refugees and displaced populations have access to equitable and inclusive quality [[education]] and [[lifelong learning]] opportunities through digital mobile technologies. Mobile learning plays a key role in [[refugee]]s\u2019 informal learning. The increased access that refugees have to digital [[Mobile technology|mobile technologies]] suggests that leveraging these tools more frequently could be a source of support for education delivery, administration and support services in refugee contexts.<ref>{{Cite book|last=UNESCO|first=|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261278|title=A Lifeline to learning: leveraging mobile technology to support education for refugees|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100262-5|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== National education systems ===\nThe inclusion of [[refugee children]] and youth in national systems provides the tools for integration of individuals and communities and can foster mutual acceptance, tolerance and respect in situations of social upheaval.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn recent years, the governments have moved towards including immigrants and refugees in national education systems. Practices are being abandoned as a result of forward-looking decisions, political pragmatism and international solidarity.<ref name=\":1\" /> Countries party to the 2018 [[Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration]] and the Global Compact on Refugees, which refer to education, recognize education as an opportunity. Among 21 high income countries, [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] had adopted multiculturalism in their curricula by 1980. By 2010, it had been adopted in [[Finland]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Sweden]], and partly adopted in over two-thirds of the countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCountries such as [[Chad]], the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] and [[Turkey]] carry out measures to ensure that [[Sudan|Sudanese]], [[Afghan]], [[Syrian]] and other refugees attend school alongside nationals. In the 2017 Djibouti Declaration on Regional Refugee Education, seven education ministers from eastern [[Africa]] committed to the inclusion of education for refugees and returnees into sector plans by 2020.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSince 2006, [[China]] has progressively revised the system, requiring local authorities to provide education to migrant children, abolishing public school fees for them and declining registered residence from access to education for migrants. In [[India]], the 2009 [[Right to Education Act]] legally obliged local authorities to admit migrant children, while national guidelines recommend flexible admission, seasonal hostels, transport support, mobile education volunteers and improved coordination between states and districts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Education in emergencies and conflict areas]]\n*[[Mobile learning for refugees]]\n* [[Refugee children]]\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Migration, displacement and education: building bridges, not walls; Global education monitoring report, youth report, 2019\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000266274\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = A Lifeline to learning: leveraging mobile technology to support education for refugees\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261278\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Right to education handbook\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000366556\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n", "text_old": "'''Education for refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons''' is the process of teaching and giving the [[knowledge]] and [[skill]]s for [[refugee]]s, [[migrant]]s and [[internally displaced person]]s to fully participate in [[society]].

Existing mechanisms are often fragmented or too complex to meet immigrants\u2019 and refugees\u2019 needs and end up underutilized.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Mobile learning ===\n[[File:A human\u2013organization\u2013technology model to map values of mobile learning for refugees.svg|thumb|A human\u2013organization\u2013technology model to map values of mobile learning for refugees]]\n{{Main|Mobile learning for refugees}}\n\nMobile learning for refugees ensures that refugees and displaced populations have access to equitable and inclusive quality [[education]] and [[lifelong learning]] opportunities through digital mobile technologies. Mobile learning plays a key role in [[refugee]]s\u2019 informal learning. The increased access that refugees have to digital [[Mobile technology|mobile technologies]] suggests that leveraging these tools more frequently could be a source of support for education delivery, administration and support services in refugee contexts.<ref>{{Cite book|last=UNESCO|first=|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261278|title=A Lifeline to learning: leveraging mobile technology to support education for refugees|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100262-5|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== National education systems ===\nThe inclusion of [[refugee children]] and youth in national systems provides the tools for integration of individuals and communities and can foster mutual acceptance, tolerance and respect in situations of social upheaval.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn recent years, the governments have moved towards including immigrants and refugees in national education systems.
