The two-door coupe was loosely derived from the [[Honda Accord]] and spanned five generations. The Prelude was used by Honda to introduce the Japanese Honda retail sales chain ''[[Honda#Japanese marketing|Honda Verno]],'' with the international release of the model following shortly after.\n\nPrelude competitors included the [[Toyota Celica]], the [[Nissan Silvia]] and the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]]. Production of the Prelude concluded in 2001 upon the introduction of the [[Honda Integra DC5]].\n\nThe Prelude name was originally trademarked by [[Toyota]], but was amicably given to Honda for use. The Prelude complied with the series of music-themed vehicle names which Honda used at the time, along with the [[Honda Accord|Accord]], [[Honda Quint|Quintet]], [[Honda Concerto|Concerto]], [[Honda Jazz|Jazz]] and [[Honda Ballade|Ballade]].\n\n==First generation (1978\u20131982)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (SN)\n| image = Honda Prelude 2D.jpg\n| production = 1978\u20131982\n| designer = Shinya Iwakura, Hiroshi Kizawa (1978)\n| engine = 1,602&nbsp;cc ''[[Honda E engine#EL|EL]]'' 8-valve I4 <br /> 1,751&nbsp;cc ''[[Honda E engine#EK|EK CVCC]]'' 12-valve I4\n| weight = {{convert|900|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2320|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4090|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1635|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1290|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 2-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n}}\n\nOn 24 November 1978, the Prelude was launched to the Japanese market.<ref name=\"AR80\">{{cite journal | title = Automobil Revue '80 | editor1-last = Braunschweig | editor1-first = Robert | editor2-last = B\u00fcschi | editor2-first = Hans-Ulrich | publisher = Hallwag, AG | page = 330 | language = German, French | location = Berne, Switzerland | volume = 75 | date = 6 March 1980 }}</ref> It had its world premier at the 1979 [[AutoRAI]] in Amsterdam, two months later.<ref name=\"AV246\">{{cite journal | journal = Autovisie | date = 24 March 1979 | volume = 24 | number = 6 | publisher = Arnold van der Wees | location = Amersfoort, Netherlands | language = Dutch | title = Rijden met Honda Prelude | trans-title = Test drive: Honda Prelude | last = Enklaar | first = Gert | page = 32 | ref = stj\u00e4rt }}</ref> In Japan it was only available at the newly established dealership sales channel ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]''.

In Japan, the Prelude was available with a sliding metal sunroof, while US versions received a glass top which freed up more headroom.<ref name=\"WC79j\"/> Japanese buyers were liable for slightly more annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]]es over the smaller Civic, which also had a smaller engine. While marketed as a 2+2, the rear seat was not usable for anyone larger than a small child.<ref name=\"AV246\"/>\n\nInitial reviews for the Prelude were favorable. \"It is,\" wrote [[Brock Yates]] for ''Motor Trend'', \"by any sane measurement, a splendid automobile. The machine, like all Hondas, embodies fabrication that is, in my opinion, surpassed only by the narrowest of margins by Mercedes-Benz. It is a relatively powerful little automobile by anybody's standards.\" ''Motor Trend'' measured an early Prelude completing the quarter-mile in 18.8 seconds at 70&nbsp;mph. In terms of underpinnings it was mostly a Honda Accord, although its more compact package and lower weight allowed for a marginally higher top speed and gas mileage.<ref name=\"AV246\"/>\n\n[[File:Honda Prelude (14904412778).jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of SN Prelude]]\nThe standard engine at the time of introduction was the \"EL\" SOHC eight-valve 1,602&nbsp;cc (non-CVCC) [[Inline-four engine|inline-four]] rated at {{convert|80|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|12.9|kgm|Nm lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,500&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=\"AR80\"/> It remained the only engine available for most markets, aside from the US and Japan.

In addition to the standard fabrics offered in most models, an 'Executive' option was offered in some markets which added power steering and [[Connolly leather]] upholstery. Honda used a single central gauge cluster design in this car which housed the speedometer and tachometer in one combined unit where both instrument's needles swept along the same arc. They also placed the compact AM/FM radio unit up high next to the gauge cluster. The Prelude featured intermittent wipers, tinted glass, and a remote trunk release. 1980 saw the introduction of the CVCC-II engine which employed the use of a catalytic converter and several other refinements that improved driveability, the Prelude also received a mild facelift in 1981. This facelift meant a return to a more traditional dashboard, rather than the much critiqued \"Concentrated Target Meter\" used before.<ref name=RT82>{{cite journal | ref = 81bg | journal = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1981 | issue = January\u2013February 1981 | title = 1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 100 }}</ref> The 1981 Prelude also received a stainless steel trim strip along the bumpers and side moldings, as well as a new grille. 313,000 units were manufactured by Honda from 1978-1982, with 80% being sold outside of Japan. \n\nThe Prelude was introduced in Europe during 1979, but was not a strong seller, its high asking price not helping its chances of sales success. \n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Second generation (1982\u20131987)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Second generation (AB, BA1/2/3/6, BB)\n|image=2nd Honda Prelude 2.0Si.jpg\n|production=1982\u20131987\n|engine={{ubl\n  | 1829&nbsp;cc ''[[Honda A engine#A18A|A18A]]/[[Honda E engine#ET|ET]]'' 12-valve [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 1829&nbsp;cc ''[[Honda E engine#ES|ES]]'' [[CVCC]] 12-valve I4\n  | 1955&nbsp;cc ''[[Honda A engine#A20A|A20A3]]'' 12-valve I4\n  | 1958&nbsp;cc ''[[Honda B20A engine|B20A]]'' [[DOHC]] 16-valve I4\n  }}\n|weight= {{convert|2023|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} - {{convert|2954|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (depending on model)\n|wheelbase= {{convert|96.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|length= {{convert|172.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|width= {{convert|66.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|height= {{convert|51|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|transmission=4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|designer= Masahito Nakano (1979)<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCourt |first1=Mark |title=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/prelude-to-love-1983-87-honda-prelude/ |url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/prelude-to-love-1983-87-honda-prelude/ |website=[[Hemmings]] |accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe second-generation Prelude was released in Japan on 25 November 1982 and worldwide in the spring of 1983. Riding on an all-new platform, the Prelude was initially available with an [[Honda A engine|A18A]] or ET-2, 1.8&nbsp;L 12-valve twin carburetor engine, producing 105&nbsp;PS (77&nbsp;kW).<ref name=Moniteur>{{cite journal | ref = PdL | journal = Le Moniteur de l'Automobile | pages = 16\u201317 | title = Essai D\u00e9taille: Honda Prelude EX | last = De Leener | first = Philippe | location = Brussels, Belgium | language = French | volume = 33 | number = 770 | date = 2 June 1983 | publisher = Editions Auto-Magazine }}</ref> In Japan, Asia and Europe, it later became available with a 2-liter DOHC 16-valve PGM-FI engine (JDM = BA1, EU = BA2) although this engine was not released in Europe until 1986. The JDM [[Honda B20A engine|B20A]] produced {{convert|160|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6300&nbsp;rpm, while the European B20A1 produced only {{convert|137|hp|abbr=on}}. This was the first generation of Prelude to have pop-up headlights, which allowed for a more aerodynamic front clip, reducing drag. Opening the headlights, however, especially at higher speeds, produced significantly more drag. The design retained nothing of the first generation, being considerably more aerodynamic and with large glass surfaces. As with the predecessor, it was amply equipped, with an air of \"[[Grand tourer|mini-gran turismo]]\" rather than that of a sports car.<ref name=Mon15>[[#PdL|De Leener]], p. 15</ref> It also offered, as an option, Honda's new [[Anti-lock braking system|\"A.L.B.\" anti-lock brakes]].<ref name=Moniteur/>\n\nIn Japan, the Prelude was one of the key models sold at Japanese Honda dealership sales channels, called ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'', which offered performance-oriented products. All ''Honda Verno'' products, like the [[Honda Vigor#Second generation (CA1-CA2-CA3)|Vigor]], initially shared the concealed headlights introduced with this generation Prelude that would help identify \"sports\" products from Honda in Japan however, the approach was short-lived. The model with the 2.0 liter engine was regarded as the top level car in Japan because Japanese buyers were liable for a higher annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] over the car with the 1.8 liter engine. The Japanese 1.8 had CVCC and claimed {{convert|125|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, considerably more than export models.\n\nWhen the 2-liter 16-valve DOHC engine came out the hood had to be slightly modified since the larger engine could not fit under the original hood. The original 1.8-liter engine was developed specifically for the Prelude to allow a low hoodline, even tilting the engine backward to make it lower yet.<ref name=Moniteur/> The European version also saw slight modifications to the rear lights and revised front and rear bumpers which were now color-matched. Due to the fairly low weight of the car ({{convert|1025|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and high power (the 16-valve engine produced {{convert|160|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} in Japanese trim), the car was relatively nimble in comparison to its competitors, which most Preludes had not been up to that time.\n\nThe North American 1983 model is identifiable by its standard painted steel wheels with bright trim rings (although alloy rims were optional). The 1984-87 base models had Civic-style full wheel covers. In Canada, a \"Special Edition\" trim was created, which is essentially the same as the USA 2.0Si \"sport injected\" model. Fuel injection was introduced in the \"Si\" models in 1985. North American 1.8's offered {{Convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the later 2.0 has {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThis version of the Prelude was far more popular in Britain than its predecessor, and sold well at a time when sports cars were declining in popularity and many manufacturers were withdrawing from this market sector; including [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], who did not replace the [[Ford Capri|Capri]] after its 1986 demise, even though it had been one of Britain's 10 most popular new cars as recently as 1980. The European lineup originally consisted of the base Prelude, without power steering, and the well-equipped EX which was also available with an automatic transmission and the A.L.B. brakes.<ref name=Moniteur/>\n\n{{gallery | width = 191 | height = 107\n|File:Prelude 2nd gen rear.jpg|1986 Honda Prelude SE Rear\n|File:1986-1987 Honda Prelude Si coupe 01.jpg|1986\u20131987 Honda Prelude Si coupe (Australia)\n|File:1986-1987 Honda Prelude Si coupe 02.jpg|1986\u20131987 Honda Prelude Si coupe (Australia)\n|File:1987 Honda Prelude side.JPG|Honda Prelude. 1987, Base 1.8L DOHC, twin carb.

Featuring evolutionary styling from its predecessor, it shared design cues from the [[Honda NSX]] that would be introduced later in 1989. The Prelude featured innovative features for its time such as a 0.34 drag coefficient, roof pillars made of high-strength metal and its signature feature, the available option of the world's first mechanical [[four wheel steering]] system available in a mass-production passenger car.

The front and rear bumpers were revised on the new Prelude. The rear front bumper and rear tail lights featured clear indicators and a revised parking light design. Many of the interior parts were also revised, including the dash bezel, the door handle and window switches. The Japanese version of the Si with the B20A was rated 140&nbsp;PS with the JDM engine and was rated for 37 MPG.\n\nAlong with the facelift, a new Prelude model was introduced to the [[Japanese domestic market]], the Prelude INX.  It featured fixed headlights, with a front fascia very similar to the contemporary [[Honda Legend#Legend coupe and other changes|Honda Legend]] coupe and [[Honda Accord#Third generation (1986\u20131989)|Honda Accord]] of the same time period. It also featured chrome trim on the headlights front and rear bumpers, side moldings, tail lights and both front and rear windscreens to enhance the focus on luxury rather than sportiness. The Prelude INX coincided with changes to North American lighting requirements in the United States and Canada, and a greater focus on safety was offered with available [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] and optional [[Airbag|driver's side airbag]] exclusively offered on the Si/SR/S models.\n\nIn the US, the facelifted Prelude debuted for the 1990 model year, with the carbureted 2.0S model being discontinued. The fuel-injected 2.0Si became the entry-level model, being supplanted by a new Si model with the B21A1 engine, with Si 4WS or [[anti-lock braking system|Si ALB]] (ABS) as optional trim models. The revised version of the B20A5, called the [[Honda B20A engine#B21A1|B21A1]] was available. It was bored to {{convert|83|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} with a total displacement of 2056&nbsp;cc producing up to {{Convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and had a special cylinder liner featuring FRM (fiber reinforced metal) that is reported to be extremely tough. This causes premature piston ring wear contributing to exceptionally high oil consumption.\n\nFor the Canadian market, the S, SR and SR 4WS models were introduced for 1990. In 1991, SR ALB and SE models were introduced. The SE model was closer to the JDM and EDM models in that it was fully optioned with leather interior and was equipped with both 4WS and ALB.\n\n=== Prelude SiStates and Prelude SiTCV ===\nHonda released two new special limited edition trim models in Japan in 1989 for the facelift Prelude, the '''Prelude SiStates''' and '''Prelude SiTCV.''' These cars were a limited production run and very few were built. SiStates catalogues indicate 3000 built. They both featured standard 4WS, ALB, Viscous LSD transmissions, TCS (SiTCV only), leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear lever, extra sound-deadening insulation on the firewall and hood, and many more features that were usually options. The SiStates also featured a Japanese version of the 2.1 liter [[Honda B engine|B21A]]1 engine called the B21A rated at {{convert|150|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Two major distinctions of the SiStates was that it was the same width as the Prelude sold in North America, from which it took its name, due to the wider side moldings. The other being that it was over 2.0 liters, a limitation in engine displacement in Japan for insurance reasons. The extra width and the larger engine combined to place the Prelude SiStates in a considerably higher tax bracket; while this slowed sales it also targeted some status hungry buyers. The SiStates model was only available with the MY8A LSD equipped automatic transmission. The SiTCV model was available with the MY8A automatic or the D2E4 manual 5-speed transmission.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:9091frontbumper.jpg| 90-91 Front bumper\nFile:8889tails.jpg| 88-89 Rear bumper and tail lights\nFile:9091tails.jpg| 90-91 Rear bumper and tail lights\n</gallery>\n\n==Fourth generation (1991\u20131996)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Fourth generation (BA8/9, BB1-BB4)\n|image=1996 Honda Prelude Si coupe (2015-07-09) 01.jpg\n|production=1991\u20131996\n|engine= see chart\n|wheelbase= {{convert|100.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|length= {{convert|174.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|width= {{convert|69.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|height= {{convert|50.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|weight= {{convert|2840|lb|kg|abbr=on|0|order=flip}}\n|transmission=4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|designer = Yukio Kurosu (1989)<ref>{{cite web |title=USD347806S |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/USD347806S/en?q=automobile&q=%22our+new+design%22&assignee=honda&before=priority:19970101&after=priority:19910101 |accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\nOn 19 September 1991, the fourth-generation Prelude was introduced in Japan, and in Europe from early 1992. The car had a 58% front and 42% rear weight distribution. The four wheel steering system was changed to an electronic version and the engine was increased in capacity from 2.1 liters to 2.2 liters for the base model \"S\" (SOHC [[Honda F engine#F22A|F22A1]] engine, {{convert|135|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm, {{convert|203|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm) and \"[[VTEC]]\" model (DOHC [[VTEC]] [[Honda H engine#H22|H22A1]], {{convert|190|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6800 rpm, {{convert|207|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm), with a 2.3-liter for the \"Si\" (DOHC [[Honda H engine#H23|H23A1]], {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5800 rpm, {{convert|212|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 5300 rpm). The Japanese Si came with the [[Honda F engine#F22B|F22B]] (2.2 L DOHC non-VTEC, {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}). The VTEC model had an upgraded brake system, going from a 10.3\" (262&nbsp;mm) front rotor to an 11.1\" (282&nbsp;mm) front rotor and utilizing larger brake caliper and pads, similar to those found in the [[Honda Vigor]]. Its styling approach is similar to the [[Honda Ascot#Ascot Innova .28CB3.2F4.29|Honda Ascot Innova]] during the same time period.\n\nAdditionally, a 2.0i, single overhead cam (SOHC) model was released in Europe, rated at {{convert|133|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. 1993 was the last year that the \"Si-VTEC\" (BB4) name was used, and beginning in 1994 it was shortened to just \"[[VTEC]]\" and stayed that way throughout the rest of the generation. In some countries, the Prelude with 2.2 VTEC engine was called the VTi-R. Later the 96 prelude SI/SR was introduced with a 2.3 Non-VTEC engine. In Canada, the Si was called the SR, and the VTEC was called the SR-V. Due to the width dimensions and the engine displacement exceeding [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese government regulations]] for vehicles classified as \"compact\", this generation Prelude obligated Japanese owners to yearly taxes.\n\nThis model also marked the end for the pop-up headlights. The 1992 Prelude incorporated other design features that had also become the \"Prelude standard\".  The rear end was rounded and fairly high in comparison to the previous square trunk line.  The front fascia of the car became wider with fixed headlights. The glass [[moonroof]] made way for a steel sliding [[sunroof]] which no longer retracted into the car but extended out and over it.\n\nThe light blue back lighting introduced in the third generation was continued. Later models (1994 and on) also featured translucent speedometer and tachometer needles. All VTEC & SE models received leather interior. Also featured was an 8-speaker audio system (Gathers DSP 8 Speaker System) which included a center dash-mounted speaker and rear center subwoofer, while the U.S. version received only 7 speakers (center dash speaker not included). The Japanese version also included a digital climate control system. The Canadian version received some options which were not available in the United States.  For instance, the Japanese Prelude had power folding mirrors as well as a rear windscreen wiper, while the Canadian market was the one to have heated mirrors and optional heated seats.  The Japanese model came with optional Honda Access accessories such as Typus ski racks, under dash lights, headrest covers, a cabin air filter, and floor mats. Some of the Japanese domestic market fourth generation Prelude VTECs did not come with options such as a sunroof and 4-wheel steering, as it was possible to skip these options when buying in Japan. The fourth generation Prelude also shares some suspension components with the fifth generation (1994\u201397) [[Honda Accord]]. \n\n===Models and Markets===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:100%; color:black\"\n|- \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Model\n!colspan=\"3\"|Engine\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Steering\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Chassis<br />code\n!colspan=\"5\"|Markets\n|-\n!Code\n!C/R\n!Power\n!{{flag|Japan}}\n!{{flag|USA}}\n!{{flag|Canada}}\n!{{flag|Europe}}\n!{{flag|Australia}}\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Si\n|rowspan=\"2\"|F22B\n|rowspan=\"2\"|9.5:1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{Convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n|2WS\n|BA8\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n|4WS\n|BA9\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|SiR VTEC\n|rowspan=\"2\"|H22A\n|rowspan=\"2\"|10.6:1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{Convert|200|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n|2WS\n|BB4\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n|4WS\n|BB1 for 1993 include a usdm & jdm model the usdm model is rarely known\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n!S\n|F22A1\n|8.8:1\n|{{Convert|135|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n|2WS\n|BA8\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Si\n|rowspan=\"2\"|H23A1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|9.8:1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{Convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n|2WS\n|BB2\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n|4WS\n|BB2\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n!SE (1995)\n|H23A1\n|9.8:1\n|{{Convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n|2WS\n|BB2\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n!VTEC (93-96) (usdm vtec 2ws is Honda's only vtec shell ever created.

Most fifth-generation Honda Preludes came with {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} [[aluminum]] alloy wheels with all-season 205/50 R16 87V tires, featured the 11.1\" front brakes like the '96 VTEC model, and most Preludes also received a five-lug hub (not the four-lug wheel hub of older models). The Prelude was only available in three models for Canada and two models for the US (the Base and Type SH). All models came with 16-inch alloy wheels and 200HP (203 PS). The 2.0i and JDM Si trims came with 195/60 R15 steel wheel, and the JDM Xi came with 14\" steel wheels. Unlike the North American market Preludes, JDM Preludes came with rear windscreen wipers, except for the Xi.\n\nThe fifth-generation Prelude marked a return to the more square bodystyle of the third generation (1987\u20131991), in an attempt to curb slumping sales of the fourth-generation bodystyle.

this included a {{convert|5|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} bump in power for manual ({{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}) and automatic ({{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}) transmission models, a new front grille featuring a small \"Prelude\" badge, a cabin air filtration system, and changes to available colors.\n\n=== Canadian Market ===\nCanadian-market Preludes were very similar to US models, although all were equipped with heated seats as standard equipment, and received a 4.5L washer fluid reservoir in place of the smaller 2.5L US spec.<ref>https://justgivemethedamnmanual.com/wp-content/plugins/pdfjs-viewer-shortcode/pdfjs/web/viewer.php?file=https://justgivemethedamnmanual.com/manuals/2000_honda_prelude.pdf&download=true&print=true&openfile=false</ref> In 2001, Canada received a replacement for the Type SH, the SE trim level. The SE was mechanically identical to base models, but it came equipped with perforated, heated leather seats, Type SH [[Enkei Corporation|Enkei]] rims, Type SH spoiler, a leather-wrapped shift knob, and simulated carbon fiber trim kit on the door panels and audio panel. The SE did not receive body colored side skirts as standard like the Type SH, and also did not feature the active torque transfer system (ATTS). Dealer accessories for Canadian vehicles included: carbon fiber audio panel, sunroof visor, 6-disc-in-dash CD changer, trunk mounted CD changer, cassette player, roof rack, gold plated emblem kit, gold plated exhaust finisher, leather shift knob, full and half nose mask, security system, and a cargo mat.\n\n=== Japanese-Exclusive Type S ===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi Automatic 2.2 Rear.jpg\n| caption1 = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi\n| image2 = 1997-2001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS coupe (2011-11-17) 01.jpg\n| image3 = 1997-2001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS coupe (2011-11-17) 02.jpg\n| caption3 = 1997\u20132001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS, Australia\n}}\nOne version of the fifth generation Prelude, a high-performance model called the '''Type S''', was only available in Japan. It was equipped with the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Honda H engine|H22A]], featuring [[VTEC]] and producing {{convert|217|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 7,200&nbsp;rpm and 163&nbsp;lbf\u00b7ft (221&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 6,500&nbsp;rpm. With a compression ratio of 11.0:1, {{convert|87.0|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore x {{convert|90.7|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stroke and [[VTEC]]-valve timing, lift and duration were adjusted to {{convert|12.2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} intake and {{convert|11.2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} exhaust. [[Honda]] also overhauled the air box and replaced it with a more efficient design that is often referred to as ''Dynamic Chambering,'' along with a larger throttle body design bored to 62&nbsp;mm (as opposed to the previous 60&nbsp;mm). The exhaust system was also treated to a redesign, with the pipe cross sections becoming more cylindrical rather than oval. The three-way catalytic converter was also increased in size, as well as the exhaust piping from 2 to 2\u00bc in (51 to 57&nbsp;mm) (tToV). In addition to a higher output engine both Type S and USDM Type SH featured an overhauled front suspension layout which offered a more effective camber curve.  The fifth generation curb weight was {{cvt|1,310|kg}}, and ground clearance was {{cvt|140|mm|in}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Unlike the SiR S-spec that had an LSD, the Type S acquired the Honda technology known as the [[Active Torque Transfer System]] (ATTS). The gearing on the Type S matches all other fifth-generation Preludes that had a manual transmission except for the five-speed 2.2 VTi VTEC and had a final drive ratio of 4.266:1. The Type S had an Active Control ABS system, different from the others which had the standard ABS systems. The interior featured newly developed synthentic materials called Cabron and Excene to upholster the seats which most people perceive as leather and Alcantara laced with red stitching. Manufacturer styling options included seat lettering. The exterior styling of fifth generation Preludes was standardized for most models. All had a sunroof except for the Type S model.\n\n=== Prelude Motegi ===\nHonda also released a special edition fifth generation Prelude, called '''Motegi'''. The name of this special edition derives from the \u2018twin-ring Motegi\u2019 motor-racing circuit, located in Haga District, Tochigi, Japan. This track was built in 1997 by Honda as part of their effort to bring the IndyCar series to Japan.\n\nThe Motegi edition Prelude featured an OEM Honda body kit, 17\" Honda alloy wheels, lowered sports suspension and a Motegi badge on the trunk lid. All of these items, with the exception of the trunk lid badge, were optional on non-Motegi models.\n\n==Sales==\nSales were not strong, particularly due to competition from Honda's other offerings. The [[Honda Accord#CG|sixth-generation Accord coupe]] received an exclusive front fascia, rear tail lights, wheels and many other body panels, now being marketed alongside the Prelude with shared brochures in Canada, yet its sedan roots gave it much more utility than the comparatively cramped Prelude, and the option of a V6 engine gave North American buyers an appealing alternative. The [[Honda Civic (sixth generation)|sixth-generation Civic]] Si coupe was considerably less expensive than the Prelude as well, while also providing better fuel economy ratings. The [[Honda S2000]] was another offering that while more expensive than the Prelude, offered rear wheel drive, a six-speed transmission, 40 extra horsepower, and a convertible top. The exterior dimensions of the Prelude were no longer in compliance with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese government regulations]], and the additional costs resulting from this contributed to the popularity of smaller Honda products.

Currently, there have been convertibles made from the first, second and fourth generation Preludes.\n\nFirst generation Preludes were modified into full convertibles by several companies in both the US, Canada and Germany. The Solaire Corporation, a southern based company in Santa Ana California owned by Al Rowland & Jim Bruemmer, lead the idea for mass market sales. He brought in craftsman Bruce Meyers (Known for the famous Meyers Manx Dune Buggy) to help design the tooling and fiberglass work for production. A believed 150 Preludes, between 1980 - 1982, were modified and sold to US Honda dealerships with full factory warranties. Dealer prices ranged from $14,000-$15,000, while the conversion itself sold around $5,000. Solaire collaborated with other companies including Classic Touch, Con-tec, Silcco, Steas Industries and National Coach. It was marketed as \"Honda's 450 SL\", drawing aesthetic comparisons to the Mercedes 450SL. \n\nTropic Design, located in [[Crailsheim]], Germany.<ref name=\"AK83\">{{cite book | title = Auto Katalog 1983 | editor-last = Heitz | editor-first = Rudolf | publisher = [[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH & Co.

Very few have remained in Europe, initially all in Germany. Some have been sold over time to nearby countries, at least one to the [[Netherlands]], one to France and one to Belgium.\n\nSecond generation Preludes were modified by another German company; some 100 Preludes were modified. No DOHC engine-equipped models have been known to be converted into convertibles, however. Three versions were available: a basic version, one which had more luxurious options, and one which added a body kit.\n\nThere is believed to be a few third generation preludes made however it is not confirmed how many were made. There is currently one confirmed Japanese imported third generation prelude currently in Australia though not much is known of its history.\n\nOf the fourth generation Preludes, only some 15 were modified into a convertible by German company Honda-Autohaus Manfred Ernst. No details are known about the engine types and other specifics. Since only 15 were ever made, they are assumed by many to be custom-built.\n\n==Scale Models==\n\n[[Corgi Toys|Corgi]] and Neo have produced 1:43 models of the first generation.<br>\n[[Minichamps]] and Neo have produced 1:43 models of the fourth generation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Honda Prelude}}\n{{wiktionary|prelude}}\n{{Modern Honda vehicles}}\n{{Honda}}\n\n[[Category:Honda vehicles|Prelude]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive sports cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:Vehicles with four-wheel steering]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Touring cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi Automatic 2.2 Front.jpg\n| name = Honda Prelude\n| caption = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi\n| manufacturer = [[Honda]]\n| production = 1978\u20132001\n| class = [[Sports car]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, front-wheel-drive]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coup\u00e9]]\n| assembly = [[Sayama, Saitama]], Japan\n| successor = [[Honda Accord (North America seventh generation)#2003\u20132005|Accord Coupe (seventh generation)]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Honda Prelude''' is a [[sports car| sports]] car which was produced by Japanese car manufacturer [[Honda]] from 1978 until 2001. The two-door coupe was loosely derived from the [[Honda Accord]] and spanned five generations. The Prelude was used by Honda to introduce the Japanese Honda retail sales chain ''[[Honda#Japanese marketing|Honda Verno]],'' with the international release of the model following shortly after.\n\nPrelude competitors included the [[Toyota Celica]], the [[Nissan Silvia]] and the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]]. Production of the Prelude concluded in 2001 upon the introduction of the [[Honda Integra DC5]].\n\nThe Prelude name was originally trademarked by [[Toyota]], but was amicably given to Honda for use. The Prelude complied with the series of music-themed vehicle names which Honda used at the time, along with the [[Honda Accord|Accord]], [[Honda Quint|Quintet]], [[Honda Concerto|Concerto]], [[Honda Jazz|Jazz]] and [[Honda Ballade|Ballade]].\n\n==First generation (1978\u20131982)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (SN)\n| image = Honda Prelude 2D.jpg\n| production = 1978\u20131982\n| designer = Shinya Iwakura, Hiroshi Kizawa (1978)\n| engine = 1,602&nbsp;cc ''[[Honda E engine#EL|EL]]'' 8-valve I4 <br /> 1,751&nbsp;cc ''[[Honda E engine#EK|EK CVCC]]'' 12-valve I4\n| weight = {{convert|900|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2320|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4090|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1635|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1290|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 2-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n}}\n\nOn 24 November 1978, the Prelude was launched to the Japanese market.<ref name=\"AR80\">{{cite journal | title = Automobil Revue '80 | editor1-last = Braunschweig | editor1-first = Robert | editor2-last = B\u00fcschi | editor2-first = Hans-Ulrich | publisher = Hallwag, AG | page = 330 | language = German, French | location = Berne, Switzerland | volume = 75 | date = 6 March 1980 }}</ref> It had its world premier at the 1979 [[AutoRAI]] in Amsterdam, two months later.<ref name=\"AV246\">{{cite journal | journal = Autovisie | date = 24 March 1979 | volume = 24 | number = 6 | publisher = Arnold van der Wees | location = Amersfoort, Netherlands | language = Dutch | title = Rijden met Honda Prelude | trans-title = Test drive: Honda Prelude | last = Enklaar | first = Gert | page = 32 | ref = stj\u00e4rt }}</ref> In Japan it was only available at the newly established dealership sales channel ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]''.

The machine, like all Hondas, embodies fabrication that is, in my opinion, surpassed only by the narrowest of margins by Mercedes-Benz. It is a relatively powerful little automobile by anybody's standards.\" ''Motor Trend'' measured an early Prelude completing the quarter-mile in 18.8 seconds at 70&nbsp;mph.

In addition to the standard fabrics offered in most models, an 'Executive' option was offered in some markets which added power steering and [[Connolly leather]] upholstery. Honda used a single central gauge cluster design in this car which housed the speedometer and tachometer in one combined unit where both instrument's needles swept along the same arc. They also placed the compact AM/FM radio unit up high next to the gauge cluster. The Prelude featured intermittent wipers, tinted glass, and a remote trunk release. 1980 saw the introduction of the CVCC-II engine which employed the use of a catalytic converter and several other refinements that improved driveability, the Prelude also received a mild facelift in 1981.

The JDM [[Honda B20A engine|B20A]] produced {{convert|160|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6300&nbsp;rpm, while the European B20A1 produced only {{convert|137|hp|abbr=on}}. This was the first generation of Prelude to have pop-up headlights, which allowed for a more aerodynamic front clip, reducing drag. Opening the headlights, however, especially at higher speeds, produced significantly more drag. The design retained nothing of the first generation, being considerably more aerodynamic and with large glass surfaces. As with the predecessor, it was amply equipped, with an air of \"[[Grand tourer|mini-gran turismo]]\" rather than that of a sports car.<ref name=Mon15>[[#PdL|De Leener]], p. 15</ref> It also offered, as an option, Honda's new [[Anti-lock braking system|\"A.L.B.\" anti-lock brakes]].<ref name=Moniteur/>\n\nIn Japan, the Prelude was one of the key models sold at Japanese Honda dealership sales channels, called ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'', which offered performance-oriented products. All ''Honda Verno'' products, like the [[Honda Vigor#Second generation (CA1-CA2-CA3)|Vigor]], initially shared the concealed headlights introduced with this generation Prelude that would help identify \"sports\" products from Honda in Japan however, the approach was short-lived. The model with the 2.0 liter engine was regarded as the top level car in Japan because Japanese buyers were liable for a higher annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] over the car with the 1.8 liter engine. The Japanese 1.8 had CVCC and claimed {{convert|125|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, considerably more than export models.\n\nWhen the 2-liter 16-valve DOHC engine came out the hood had to be slightly modified since the larger engine could not fit under the original hood. The original 1.8-liter engine was developed specifically for the Prelude to allow a low hoodline, even tilting the engine backward to make it lower yet.<ref name=Moniteur/> The European version also saw slight modifications to the rear lights and revised front and rear bumpers which were now color-matched. Due to the fairly low weight of the car ({{convert|1025|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and high power (the 16-valve engine produced {{convert|160|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} in Japanese trim), the car was relatively nimble in comparison to its competitors, which most Preludes had not been up to that time.\n\nThe North American 1983 model is identifiable by its standard painted steel wheels with bright trim rings (although alloy rims were optional). The 1984-87 base models had Civic-style full wheel covers. In Canada, a \"Special Edition\" trim was created, which is essentially the same as the USA 2.0Si \"sport injected\" model. Fuel injection was introduced in the \"Si\" models in 1985. North American 1.8's offered {{Convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the later 2.0 has {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThis version of the Prelude was far more popular in Britain than its predecessor, and sold well at a time when sports cars were declining in popularity and many manufacturers were withdrawing from this market sector; including [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], who did not replace the [[Ford Capri|Capri]] after its 1986 demise, even though it had been one of Britain's 10 most popular new cars as recently as 1980. The European lineup originally consisted of the base Prelude, without power steering, and the well-equipped EX which was also available with an automatic transmission and the A.L.B. brakes.<ref name=Moniteur/>\n\n{{gallery | width = 191 | height = 107\n|File:Prelude 2nd gen rear.jpg|1986 Honda Prelude SE Rear\n|File:1986-1987 Honda Prelude Si coupe 01.jpg|1986\u20131987 Honda Prelude Si coupe (Australia)\n|File:1986-1987 Honda Prelude Si coupe 02.jpg|1986\u20131987 Honda Prelude Si coupe (Australia)\n|File:1987 Honda Prelude side.JPG|Honda Prelude. 1987, Base 1.8L DOHC, twin carb.

Featuring evolutionary styling from its predecessor, it shared design cues from the [[Honda NSX]] that would be introduced later in 1989. The Prelude featured innovative features for its time such as a 0.34 drag coefficient, roof pillars made of high-strength metal and its signature feature, the available option of the world's first mechanical [[four wheel steering]] system available in a mass-production passenger car.

The front and rear bumpers were revised on the new Prelude. The rear front bumper and rear tail lights featured clear indicators and a revised parking light design. Many of the interior parts were also revised, including the dash bezel, the door handle and window switches. The Japanese version of the Si with the B20A was rated 140&nbsp;PS with the JDM engine and was rated for 37 MPG.\n\nAlong with the facelift, a new Prelude model was introduced to the [[Japanese domestic market]], the Prelude INX.  It featured fixed headlights, with a front fascia very similar to the contemporary [[Honda Legend#Legend coupe and other changes|Honda Legend]] coupe and [[Honda Accord#Third generation (1986\u20131989)|Honda Accord]] of the same time period. It also featured chrome trim on the headlights front and rear bumpers, side moldings, tail lights and both front and rear windscreens to enhance the focus on luxury rather than sportiness. The Prelude INX coincided with changes to North American lighting requirements in the United States and Canada, and a greater focus on safety was offered with available [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] and optional [[Airbag|driver's side airbag]] exclusively offered on the Si/SR/S models.\n\nIn the US, the facelifted Prelude debuted for the 1990 model year, with the carbureted 2.0S model being discontinued. The fuel-injected 2.0Si became the entry-level model, being supplanted by a new Si model with the B21A1 engine, with Si 4WS or [[anti-lock braking system|Si ALB]] (ABS) as optional trim models. The revised version of the B20A5, called the [[Honda B20A engine#B21A1|B21A1]] was available. It was bored to {{convert|83|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} with a total displacement of 2056&nbsp;cc producing up to {{Convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and had a special cylinder liner featuring FRM (fiber reinforced metal) that is reported to be extremely tough. This causes premature piston ring wear contributing to exceptionally high oil consumption.\n\nFor the Canadian market, the S, SR and SR 4WS models were introduced for 1990. In 1991, SR ALB and SE models were introduced. The SE model was closer to the JDM and EDM models in that it was fully optioned with leather interior and was equipped with both 4WS and ALB.\n\n=== Prelude SiStates and Prelude SiTCV ===\nHonda released two new special limited edition trim models in Japan in 1989 for the facelift Prelude, the '''Prelude SiStates''' and '''Prelude SiTCV.''' These cars were a limited production run and very few were built. SiStates catalogues indicate 3000 built. They both featured standard 4WS, ALB, Viscous LSD transmissions, TCS (SiTCV only), leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear lever, extra sound-deadening insulation on the firewall and hood, and many more features that were usually options. The SiStates also featured a Japanese version of the 2.1 liter [[Honda B engine|B21A]]1 engine called the B21A rated at {{convert|150|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Two major distinctions of the SiStates was that it was the same width as the Prelude sold in North America, from which it took its name, due to the wider side moldings. The other being that it was over 2.0 liters, a limitation in engine displacement in Japan for insurance reasons. The extra width and the larger engine combined to place the Prelude SiStates in a considerably higher tax bracket; while this slowed sales it also targeted some status hungry buyers. The SiStates model was only available with the MY8A LSD equipped automatic transmission. The SiTCV model was available with the MY8A automatic or the D2E4 manual 5-speed transmission.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:9091frontbumper.jpg| 90-91 Front bumper\nFile:8889tails.jpg| 88-89 Rear bumper and tail lights\nFile:9091tails.jpg| 90-91 Rear bumper and tail lights\n</gallery>\n\n==Fourth generation (1991\u20131996)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Fourth generation (BA8/9, BB1-BB4)\n|image=1996 Honda Prelude Si coupe (2015-07-09) 01.jpg\n|production=1991\u20131996\n|engine= see chart\n|wheelbase= {{convert|100.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|length= {{convert|174.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|width= {{convert|69.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|height= {{convert|50.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|weight= {{convert|2840|lb|kg|abbr=on|0|order=flip}}\n|transmission=4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|designer = Yukio Kurosu (1989)<ref>{{cite web |title=USD347806S |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/USD347806S/en?q=automobile&q=%22our+new+design%22&assignee=honda&before=priority:19970101&after=priority:19910101 |accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\nOn 19 September 1991, the fourth-generation Prelude was introduced in Japan, and in Europe from early 1992. The car had a 58% front and 42% rear weight distribution. The four wheel steering system was changed to an electronic version and the engine was increased in capacity from 2.1 liters to 2.2 liters for the base model \"S\" (SOHC [[Honda F engine#F22A|F22A1]] engine, {{convert|135|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm, {{convert|203|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm) and \"[[VTEC]]\" model (DOHC [[VTEC]] [[Honda H engine#H22|H22A1]], {{convert|190|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6800 rpm, {{convert|207|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm), with a 2.3-liter for the \"Si\" (DOHC [[Honda H engine#H23|H23A1]], {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5800 rpm, {{convert|212|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 5300 rpm). The Japanese Si came with the [[Honda F engine#F22B|F22B]] (2.2 L DOHC non-VTEC, {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}). The VTEC model had an upgraded brake system, going from a 10.3\" (262&nbsp;mm) front rotor to an 11.1\" (282&nbsp;mm) front rotor and utilizing larger brake caliper and pads, similar to those found in the [[Honda Vigor]]. Its styling approach is similar to the [[Honda Ascot#Ascot Innova .28CB3.2F4.29|Honda Ascot Innova]] during the same time period.\n\nAdditionally, a 2.0i, single overhead cam (SOHC) model was released in Europe, rated at {{convert|133|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. 1993 was the last year that the \"Si-VTEC\" (BB4) name was used, and beginning in 1994 it was shortened to just \"[[VTEC]]\" and stayed that way throughout the rest of the generation. In some countries, the Prelude with 2.2 VTEC engine was called the VTi-R. Later the 96 prelude SI/SR was introduced with a 2.3 Non-VTEC engine. In Canada, the Si was called the SR, and the VTEC was called the SR-V. Due to the width dimensions and the engine displacement exceeding [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese government regulations]] for vehicles classified as \"compact\", this generation Prelude obligated Japanese owners to yearly taxes.\n\nThis model also marked the end for the pop-up headlights. The 1992 Prelude incorporated other design features that had also become the \"Prelude standard\".  The rear end was rounded and fairly high in comparison to the previous square trunk line.  The front fascia of the car became wider with fixed headlights. The glass [[moonroof]] made way for a steel sliding [[sunroof]] which no longer retracted into the car but extended out and over it.\n\nThe light blue back lighting introduced in the third generation was continued. Later models (1994 and on) also featured translucent speedometer and tachometer needles. All VTEC & SE models received leather interior. Also featured was an 8-speaker audio system (Gathers DSP 8 Speaker System) which included a center dash-mounted speaker and rear center subwoofer, while the U.S. version received only 7 speakers (center dash speaker not included). The Japanese version also included a digital climate control system. The Canadian version received some options which were not available in the United States.  For instance, the Japanese Prelude had power folding mirrors as well as a rear windscreen wiper, while the Canadian market was the one to have heated mirrors and optional heated seats.  The Japanese model came with optional Honda Access accessories such as Typus ski racks, under dash lights, headrest covers, a cabin air filter, and floor mats. Some of the Japanese domestic market fourth generation Prelude VTECs did not come with options such as a sunroof and 4-wheel steering, as it was possible to skip these options when buying in Japan. The fourth generation Prelude also shares some suspension components with the fifth generation (1994\u201397) [[Honda Accord]]. \n\n===Models and Markets===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:100%; color:black\"\n|- \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Model\n!colspan=\"3\"|Engine\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Steering\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Chassis<br />code\n!colspan=\"5\"|Markets\n|-\n!Code\n!C/R\n!Power\n!{{flag|Japan}}\n!{{flag|USA}}\n!{{flag|Canada}}\n!{{flag|Europe}}\n!{{flag|Australia}}\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Si\n|rowspan=\"2\"|F22B\n|rowspan=\"2\"|9.5:1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{Convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n|2WS\n|BA8\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n|4WS\n|BA9\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|SiR VTEC\n|rowspan=\"2\"|H22A\n|rowspan=\"2\"|10.6:1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{Convert|200|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n|2WS\n|BB4\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n|4WS\n|BB1 for 1993 include a usdm & jdm model the usdm model is rarely known\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n!S\n|F22A1\n|8.8:1\n|{{Convert|135|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n|2WS\n|BA8\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Si\n|rowspan=\"2\"|H23A1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|9.8:1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{Convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n|2WS\n|BB2\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n|4WS\n|BB2\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n!SE (1995)\n|H23A1\n|9.8:1\n|{{Convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n|2WS\n|BB2\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:Yes check.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|[[File:X mark.svg|16px]]\n|-\n!VTEC (93-96) (usdm vtec 2ws is Honda's only vtec shell ever created.

Most fifth-generation Honda Preludes came with {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} [[aluminum]] alloy wheels with all-season 205/50 R16 87V tires, featured the 11.1\" front brakes like the '96 VTEC model, and most Preludes also received a five-lug hub (not the four-lug wheel hub of older models). The Prelude was only available in three models for Canada and two models for the US (the Base and Type SH). All models came with 16-inch alloy wheels and 200HP (203 PS). The 2.0i and JDM Si trims came with 195/60 R15 steel wheel, and the JDM Xi came with 14\" steel wheels. Unlike the North American market Preludes, JDM Preludes came with rear windscreen wipers, except for the Xi.\n\nThe fifth-generation Prelude marked a return to the more square bodystyle of the third generation (1987\u20131991), in an attempt to curb slumping sales of the fourth-generation bodystyle. All models and [[trim package]]s stayed within the BB-chassis code (BB5-BB9) and housed either an [[Honda H engine|H-series]] or [[Honda F engine|F-Series]] engine:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;

this included a {{convert|5|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} bump in power for manual ({{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}) and automatic ({{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}) transmission models, a new front grille featuring a small \"Prelude\" badge, a cabin air filtration system, and changes to available colors.\n\n=== Canadian Market ===\nCanadian-market Preludes were very similar to US models, although all were equipped with heated seats as standard equipment, and received a 4.5L washer fluid reservoir in place of the smaller 2.5L US spec.<ref>https://justgivemethedamnmanual.com/wp-content/plugins/pdfjs-viewer-shortcode/pdfjs/web/viewer.php?file=https://justgivemethedamnmanual.com/manuals/2000_honda_prelude.pdf&download=true&print=true&openfile=false</ref> In 2001, Canada received a replacement for the Type SH, the SE trim level. The SE was mechanically identical to base models, but it came equipped with perforated, heated leather seats, Type SH [[Enkei Corporation|Enkei]] rims, Type SH spoiler, a leather-wrapped shift knob, and simulated carbon fiber trim kit on the door panels and audio panel. The SE did not receive body colored side skirts as standard like the Type SH, and also did not feature the active torque transfer system (ATTS). Dealer accessories for Canadian vehicles included: carbon fiber audio panel, sunroof visor, 6-disc-in-dash CD changer, trunk mounted CD changer, cassette player, roof rack, gold plated emblem kit, gold plated exhaust finisher, leather shift knob, full and half nose mask, security system, and a cargo mat.\n\n=== Japanese-Exclusive Type S ===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi Automatic 2.2 Rear.jpg\n| caption1 = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi\n| image2 = 1997-2001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS coupe (2011-11-17) 01.jpg\n| image3 = 1997-2001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS coupe (2011-11-17) 02.jpg\n| caption3 = 1997\u20132001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS, Australia\n}}\nOne version of the fifth generation Prelude, a high-performance model called the '''Type S''', was only available in Japan. It was equipped with the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Honda H engine|H22A]], featuring [[VTEC]] and producing {{convert|217|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 7,200&nbsp;rpm and 163&nbsp;lbf\u00b7ft (221&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 6,500&nbsp;rpm. With a compression ratio of 11.0:1, {{convert|87.0|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore x {{convert|90.7|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stroke and [[VTEC]]-valve timing, lift and duration were adjusted to {{convert|12.2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} intake and {{convert|11.2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} exhaust. [[Honda]] also overhauled the air box and replaced it with a more efficient design that is often referred to as ''Dynamic Chambering,'' along with a larger throttle body design bored to 62&nbsp;mm (as opposed to the previous 60&nbsp;mm). The exhaust system was also treated to a redesign, with the pipe cross sections becoming more cylindrical rather than oval. The three-way catalytic converter was also increased in size, as well as the exhaust piping from 2 to 2\u00bc in (51 to 57&nbsp;mm) (tToV). In addition to a higher output engine both Type S and USDM Type SH featured an overhauled front suspension layout which offered a more effective camber curve.  The fifth generation curb weight was {{cvt|1,310|kg}}, and ground clearance was {{cvt|140|mm|in}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Unlike the SiR S-spec that had an LSD, the Type S acquired the Honda technology known as the [[Active Torque Transfer System]] (ATTS). The gearing on the Type S matches all other fifth-generation Preludes that had a manual transmission except for the five-speed 2.2 VTi VTEC and had a final drive ratio of 4.266:1. The Type S had an Active Control ABS system, different from the others which had the standard ABS systems. The interior featured newly developed synthentic materials called Cabron and Excene to upholster the seats which most people perceive as leather and Alcantara laced with red stitching. Manufacturer styling options included seat lettering. The exterior styling of fifth generation Preludes was standardized for most models. All had a sunroof except for the Type S model.\n\n=== Prelude Motegi ===\nHonda also released a special edition fifth generation Prelude, called '''Motegi'''. The name of this special edition derives from the \u2018twin-ring Motegi\u2019 motor-racing circuit, located in Haga District, Tochigi, Japan. This track was built in 1997 by Honda as part of their effort to bring the IndyCar series to Japan.\n\nThe Motegi edition Prelude featured an OEM Honda body kit, 17\" Honda alloy wheels, lowered sports suspension and a Motegi badge on the trunk lid. All of these items, with the exception of the trunk lid badge, were optional on non-Motegi models.\n\n==Sales==\nSales were not strong, particularly due to competition from Honda's other offerings. The [[Honda Accord#CG|sixth-generation Accord coupe]] received an exclusive front fascia, rear tail lights, wheels and many other body panels, now being marketed alongside the Prelude with shared brochures in Canada, yet its sedan roots gave it much more utility than the comparatively cramped Prelude, and the option of a V6 engine gave North American buyers an appealing alternative. The [[Honda Civic (sixth generation)|sixth-generation Civic]] Si coupe was considerably less expensive than the Prelude as well, while also providing better fuel economy ratings. The [[Honda S2000]] was another offering that while more expensive than the Prelude, offered rear wheel drive, a six-speed transmission, 40 extra horsepower, and a convertible top.

Currently, there have been convertibles made from the first, second and fourth generation Preludes.\n\nFirst generation Preludes were modified into full convertibles by several companies in both the US, Canada and Germany. The Solaire Corporation, a southern based company in Santa Ana California owned by Al Rowland & Jim Bruemmer, lead the idea for mass market sales. He brought in craftsman Bruce Meyers (Known for the famous Meyers Manx Dune Buggy) to help design the tooling and fiberglass work for production. A believed 150 Preludes, between 1980 - 1982, were modified and sold to US Honda dealerships with full factory warranties. Dealer prices ranged from $14,000-$15,000, while the conversion itself sold around $5,000. Solaire collaborated with other companies including Classic Touch, Con-tec, Silcco, Steas Industries and National Coach. It was marketed as \"Honda's 450 SL\", drawing aesthetic comparisons to the Mercedes 450SL. \n\nTropic Design, located in [[Crailsheim]], Germany.<ref name=\"AK83\">{{cite book | title = Auto Katalog 1983 | editor-last = Heitz | editor-first = Rudolf | publisher = [[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH & Co.

Very few have remained in Europe, initially all in Germany. Some have been sold over time to nearby countries, at least one to the [[Netherlands]], one to France and one to Belgium.\n\nSecond generation Preludes were modified by another German company; some 100 Preludes were modified. No DOHC engine-equipped models have been known to be converted into convertibles, however. Three versions were available: a basic version, one which had more luxurious options, and one which added a body kit.\n\nThere is believed to be a few third generation preludes made however it is not confirmed how many were made. There is currently one confirmed Japanese imported third generation prelude currently in Australia though not much is known of its history.\n\nOf the fourth generation Preludes, only some 15 were modified into a convertible by German company Honda-Autohaus Manfred Ernst. No details are known about the engine types and other specifics. Since only 15 were ever made, they are assumed by many to be custom-built.\n\n==Scale Models==\n\n[[Corgi Toys|Corgi]] and Neo have produced 1:43 models of the first generation.<br>\n[[Minichamps]] and Neo have produced 1:43 models of the fourth generation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Honda Prelude}}\n{{wiktionary|prelude}}\n{{Modern Honda vehicles}}\n{{Honda}}\n\n[[Category:Honda vehicles|Prelude]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive sports cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:Vehicles with four-wheel steering]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Touring cars]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "recieved > received", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Prelude"}

In 1966, Henderson moved to Geneva to become director of the campaign. At that time, smallpox was occurring widely throughout Brazil and in 30 countries in Africa and South Asia. More than 10 million cases and 2 million deaths were occurring annually. Vaccination brought some control, but the key strategy was \"surveillance-containment\". This technique entailed rapid reporting of cases from all health units and prompt vaccination of household members and close contacts of confirmed cases.  WHO staff and advisors from some 73 countries worked closely with national staff. The last case occurred in [[Somalia]] on October 26, 1977, only 10 years after the program began.<ref name= \"book2009\" />  Three years later, the World Health Assembly recommended that smallpox vaccination could cease.

He was a resident physician in medicine at the [[Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]], and, later, a Public Health Service Officer in the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the [[Communicable Disease Center]] (now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014CDC). He earned an MPH degree in 1960 from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health (now the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]).<ref name=\"book2009\" />\n\n==Research and career==\n===Eradication of smallpox===\nHenderson served as Chief of the CDC virus disease surveillance programs from 1960 to 1965, working closely with epidemiologist [[Alexander Langmuir]]. During this period, he and his unit developed a proposal for a [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) program to eliminate smallpox and control measles during a 5-year period in 18 contiguous countries in western and central Africa.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 =Henderson | first1 = D | last2 = Klepac | first2 = P | year = 2013 | title = Lessons from the Eradication of Smallpox: An Interview with D.

In 1966, Henderson moved to Geneva to become director of the campaign. At that time, smallpox was occurring widely throughout Brazil and in 30 countries in Africa and South Asia. More than 10 million cases and 2 million deaths were occurring annually. Vaccination brought some control, but the key strategy was \"surveillance-containment\". This technique entailed rapid reporting of cases from all health units and prompt vaccination of household members and close contacts of confirmed cases.  WHO staff and advisors from some 73 countries worked closely with national staff. The last case occurred in [[Somalia]] on October 26, 1977, only 10 years after the program began.<ref name= \"book2009\" />  Three years later, the World Health Assembly recommended that smallpox vaccination could cease. Smallpox is the first human disease ever to be eradicated.<ref>Health Topics: Smallpox. World Health Organization. 2015. http://www.who.int/topics/smallpox/en/.
