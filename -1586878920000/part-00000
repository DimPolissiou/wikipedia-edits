In Mithraism, festivals had a deep linkage with the Sun's light. The Iranian festivals such as [[Mehrgan]] ([[autumnal equinox]]), [[Tirgan]], and the eve of [[Yalda|Chelle ye Zemestan]] ([[winter solstice]]) also had an origin in the Sun god ([[Surya]]). Among other ideas, Zoroastrianism is the first [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion that emphasizes broad concepts such as the corresponding work of good and evil in the world, and the connection of humans to nature. Zoroastrian practices were dominant for much of the history of ancient Iran. In Zoroastrianism, the seven most important Zoroastrian festivals are the six [[Gahambars|Gahambar]] festivals and Nowruz, which occurs at the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]].

In Mithraism, festivals had a deep linkage with the Sun's light. The Iranian festivals such as [[Mehrgan]] ([[autumnal equinox]]), [[Tirgan]], and the eve of [[Yalda|Chelle ye Zemestan]] ([[winter solstice]]) also had an origin in the Sun god ([[Surya]]). Among other ideas, Zoroastrianism is the first [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion that emphasizes broad concepts such as the corresponding work of good and evil in the world, and the connection of humans to nature. Zoroastrian practices were dominant for much of the history of ancient Iran. In Zoroastrianism, the seven most important Zoroastrian festivals are the six [[Gahambars|Gahambar]] festivals and Nowruz, which occurs at the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]]. According to [[Mary Boyce]],<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-i Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, \"Festivals: Zoroastrian\" Boyce, Mary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111074500/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-i |date=January 11, 2012 }}</ref> \"It seems a reasonable surmise that Nowruz, the holiest of them all, with deep doctrinal significance, was founded by [[Zoroaster]] himself\"; although there is no clear date of origin.<ref>Boyce, M.

Under the Sassanid emperors, Nowruz was celebrated as the most important day of the year.

Other celebrations such as the [[Gahambars]] and [[Mehrgan]] were eventually side-lined or only observed by [[Zoroastrians]]. Nowruz became the main royal holiday during the [[Abbasid]] period. Much like their predecessors in the Sasanian period, [[Dehqan|Dehqans]] would offer gifts to the caliphs and local rulers at the Nowruz and Mehragan festivals.<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dehqan DEHQ\u0100N] iranicaonline.org</ref>\n\nFollowing the demise of the caliphate and the subsequent re-emergence of Iranian dynasties such as the [[Samanids]] and [[Buyids]], Nowruz became an even more important event. The Buyids revived the ancient traditions of Sassanian times and restored many smaller celebrations that had been eliminated by the caliphate. The Iranian [[Buyid]] ruler [['Adud al-Dawla]] (r. 949\u2013983) customarily welcomed Nowruz in a majestic hall, decked with gold and silver plates and vases full of fruit and colorful flowers.<ref name=\"IranicaShahbazi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nowruz-ii |title=A.

The police are empowered to enforce the law and to effect public and social order, as well as being responsible for [[border control]].<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/documents/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/docs/handbook-annex_01.pdf |chapter=Annex 1: List of national services responsible for border control |title=Practical Handbook for Border Guards (Schengen Handbook) |date=6 November 2006 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nThe police of Denmark consists of 12 districts each managed by a director and two minor districts in [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], run by a local chief of police.\nThe district of [[Copenhagen]] is somewhat differently organized due to its size and tasks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nBesides the regular districts other organizations exist that work outside the general police:\n* [[Rigspolitiet]] - a nationwide police force with specialized tasks such as ''Budgets and Accounts'', ''Building Surveying Department'' and the ''Data Investigating Department''\n* [[Politiets Efterretningstjeneste]] - the national security intelligence agency of Denmark\n* [[Politiets Aktionsstyrke]] - the special forces unit of the Danish police\n\n==Equipment==\n===Uniform===\nThe common uniform is a light blue shirt with the police insignia on the sleeve. Usually a tie is also worn. Rank-insignia is worn on the shoulders. The trousers are dark blue with reflective patches. Black shoes are also included in the standard uniform. Special tactical suits are made of flame-resistant materials and are worn in situations requiring such equipment. The tactical suit also includes a protective helmet.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} \n\n===Vehicles===\nFor daily duties, the patrol-vehicles are white and dog-patrols are mostly dark blue. They have a blue strobe-light or flashing light and the word \"POLITI\" painted on the side in clear reflective paint. The most commonly used patrol vehicles are [[Ford Mondeo]], [[Volkswagen Passat]] and [[Opel Vectra]], with 2.0 to 2.2 litre engines. In 2009, the 3.6 litre [[\u0160koda Superb]] was added to the fleet. Unmarked cars are usually fitted with engines with a size of around 1.6 to 2.2 litres. In addition a large number of small unmarked cars are used like [[Peugeot 307]], [[Opel Astra]], [[Ford Focus (international)|Ford Focus]] and Toyota Yaris - with engine size of around 1.2 to 1.6 litre. The [[Peugeot 607]] is used by a security attachment for cabinet members and the royal court. The [[Toyota Landcruiser]] and VW Touareg are used for special tasks. Small detachments typically use [[Volkswagen Transporter|VW Transporters]], while [[Volkswagen LT|VW LTs]] and [[Ford Transit]] mini-buses are used in larger operations, which require a lot of manpower (demonstrations, football matches and larger civil unrests). In extreme events, a variation of the [[Mercedes-Benz Vario|MB Vario]] is used. It is generally known as the ''Dutchman's vehicle'' (in Danish ''Holl\u00e6ndervogn''). This name derives from the fact that these vehicles are kitted out in the Netherlands as [[Armoured personnel carrier|light APC's]] with reinforced windows, wheels and metal parts and [[Fireproofing|fire-resistant]] coating. They are used both as light APCs in event of demonstrations or public disturbances, and as general transportation of large numbers of detainees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Other vehicles in use are the [[Mercedes-Benz Vito]] (used by both Central Patrol Leaders, a kind of on-street watch commanders) and [[Nissan Patrol]]s used by the mounted police squads with a horse carrier attached.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe traffic police also use unmarked vans for automatic traffic control. These are primarily VW Transporters, Mercedes Benz Vitos, [[Toyota Hiace]]s, but others are used as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.10-20.dk/fotovogn.htm |title=Fotovogne i Danmark |trans-title=Photo vehicles in Denmark |website=10-20.dk |language=da  |accessdate=7 November 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020021815/http://www.10-20.dk/fotovogn.htm |archivedate=20 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nSome rural police officers use civilian vehicles with a dismountable magnetic roof beacon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nFor traffic regulation and VIP and ambulance escorts [[motorcycle]]s are also used, primarily [[Yamaha FJR1300]]A, [[Honda ST1300]]a,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politi.dk/da/aktuelt/nyheder/2005/motorcykler_220905.htm |title=Politiet f\u00e5r nye motorcykler |trans-title=Police get new motorcycles |date=22 September 2005 |website=Politi.dk |language=da |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref> [[BMW K1200R]]S and [[BMW K1200GT]] (over time replacing older [[BMW motorcycles#K Series|BMW K1100LT]] and [[BMW motorcycles#R Series|BMW R1100RT]]).\n\n===Weapons===\nThe standard service handgun is the [[Heckler & Koch USP|H&K USP Compact]] 9mm [[pistol]].

The police must promote this purpose through prevention, assistance and enforcement.\"\n\nThe second section states that other areas of police jurisdiction include:\n\n# preventing criminal actions, disturbances of the public peace and order and danger to individual citizens and public safety\n# stopping criminal actions and investigating and prosecuting criminal actions\n# supporting citizens in dangerous situations\n# carrying out checking and inspecting under current rules and regulations\n# supporting other agencies under current rules and regulations\n# performing other tasks under current rules and regulations, as well as handling other tasks which are naturally associated with police duties.\n\nLastly, the third section states:\n\"The police may in other situations than those mentioned in statutory law only interfere with citizens under this Act.\"<ref group=note>Though this may seem obvious, it is a precaution that clearly states that the police may under no circumstances act towards the citizens in ways not stated by law (da: ''hjemlet''). This ensures that the police cannot make their own interpretations of laws or regulations.</ref>\n\n==Ranks and insignia==\nIn Denmark, the local prosecution service is part of the police.

The police are empowered to enforce the law and to effect public and social order, as well as being responsible for [[border control]].<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/documents/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/docs/handbook-annex_01.pdf |chapter=Annex 1: List of national services responsible for border control |title=Practical Handbook for Border Guards (Schengen Handbook) |date=6 November 2006 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nThe police of Denmark consists of 12 districts each managed by a director and two minor districts in [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], run by a local chief of police.\nThe district of [[Copenhagen]] is somewhat differently organized due to its size and tasks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nBesides the regular districts other organizations exist that work outside the general police:\n* [[Rigspolitiet]] - a nationwide police force with specialized tasks such as ''Budgets and Accounts'', ''Building Surveying Department'' and the ''Data Investigating Department''\n* [[Politiets Efterretningstjeneste]] - the national security intelligence agency of Denmark\n* [[Politiets Aktionsstyrke]] - the special forces unit of the Danish police\n\n==Equipment==\n===Uniform===\nThe common uniform is a light blue shirt with the police insignia on the sleeve. Usually a tie is also worn. Rank-insignia is worn on the shoulders. The trousers are dark blue with reflective patches. Black shoes are also included in the standard uniform. Special tactical suits are made of flame-resistant materials and are worn in situations requiring such equipment. The tactical suit also includes a protective helmet.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} \n\n===Vehicles===\nFor daily duties, the patrol-vehicles are white and dog-patrols are mostly dark blue. They have a blue strobe-light or flashing light and the word \"POLITI\" painted on the side in clear reflective paint. The most commonly used patrol vehicles are [[Ford Mondeo]], [[Volkswagen Passat]] and [[Opel Vectra]], with 2.0 to 2.2 litre engines. In 2009, the 3.6 litre [[\u0160koda Superb]] was added to the fleet. Unmarked cars are usually fitted with engines with a size of around 1.6 to 2.2 litres. In addition a large number of small unmarked cars are used like [[Peugeot 307]], [[Opel Astra]], [[Ford Focus (international)|Ford Focus]] and Toyota Yaris - with engine size of around 1.2 to 1.6 litre. The [[Peugeot 607]] is used by a security attachment for cabinet members and the royal court. The [[Toyota Landcruiser]] and VW Touareg are used for special tasks. Small detachments typically use [[Volkswagen Transporter|VW Transporters]], while [[Volkswagen LT|VW LTs]] and [[Ford Transit]] mini-buses are used in larger operations, which require a lot of manpower (demonstrations, football matches and larger civil unrests). In extreme events, a variation of the [[Mercedes-Benz Vario|MB Vario]] is used. It is generally known as the ''Dutchman's vehicle'' (in Danish ''Holl\u00e6ndervogn''). This name derives from the fact that these vehicles are kitted out in the Netherlands as [[Armoured personnel carrier|light APC's]] with reinforced windows, wheels and metal parts and [[Fireproofing|fire-resistant]] coating. They are used both as light APCs in event of demonstrations or public disturbances, and as general transportation of large numbers of detainees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Other vehicles in use are the [[Mercedes-Benz Vito]] (used by both Central Patrol Leaders, a kind of on-street watch commanders) and [[Nissan Patrol]]s used by the mounted police squads with a horse carrier attached.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe traffic police also use unmarked vans for automatic traffic control. These are primarily VW Transporters, Mercedes Benz Vitos, [[Toyota Hiace]]s, but others are used as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.10-20.dk/fotovogn.htm |title=Fotovogne i Danmark |trans-title=Photo vehicles in Denmark |website=10-20.dk |language=da  |accessdate=7 November 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020021815/http://www.10-20.dk/fotovogn.htm |archivedate=20 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nSome rural police officers use civilian vehicles with a dismountable magnetic roof beacon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nFor traffic regulation and VIP and ambulance escorts [[motorcycle]]s are also used, primarily [[Yamaha FJR1300]]A, [[Honda ST1300]]a,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politi.dk/da/aktuelt/nyheder/2005/motorcykler_220905.htm |title=Politiet f\u00e5r nye motorcykler |trans-title=Police get new motorcycles |date=22 September 2005 |website=Politi.dk |language=da |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref> [[BMW K1200R]]S and [[BMW K1200GT]] (over time replacing older [[BMW motorcycles#K Series|BMW K1100LT]] and [[BMW motorcycles#R Series|BMW R1100RT]]).\n\n===Weapons===\nThe standard service handgun is the [[Heckler & Koch USP|H&K USP Compact]] 9mm [[pistol]].

The police must promote this purpose through prevention, assistance and enforcement.\"\n\nThe second section states that other areas of police jurisdiction include:\n\n# preventing criminal actions, disturbances of the public peace and order and danger to individual citizens and public safety\n# stopping criminal actions and investigating and prosecuting criminal actions\n# supporting citizens in dangerous situations\n# carrying out checking and inspecting under current rules and regulations\n# supporting other agencies under current rules and regulations\n# performing other tasks under current rules and regulations, as well as handling other tasks which are naturally associated with police duties.\n\nLastly, the third section states:\n\"The police may in other situations than those mentioned in statutory law only interfere with citizens under this Act.\"<ref group=note>Though this may seem obvious, it is a precaution that clearly states that the police may under no circumstances act towards the citizens in ways not stated by law (da: ''hjemlet''). This ensures that the police cannot make their own interpretations of laws or regulations.</ref>\n\n==Ranks and insignia==\nIn Denmark, the local prosecution service is part of the police.

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations.

He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates.

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.
