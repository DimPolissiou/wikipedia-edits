Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the [[post-war period]] as the preferred typeface of many [[Switzerland|Swiss]] graphic designers in what became called the [[International Typographic Style|'International' or 'Swiss' design style]] which became popular across the [[Western world]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

It would also prove to be last album to feature the band's longtime drummer, [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]] (minus one final appearance on their next album, [[Don't Believe the Truth]], on the track [[Lyla (song)| Lyla]]), who left in early 2004, with Noel Gallagher claiming White's commitment to the band was not adequate. He was effectively replaced with [[Ringo Starr]]'s son, [[Zak Starkey]]. The album was released to generally mixed reviews from critics.\n\nThe name \"Heathen Chemistry\" was taken from a second hand T-shirt that Noel had stumbled across.<ref>{{YouTube|user=oasisinetofficial|Oasisnetofficial}}</ref> The album has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.oasisinet.com/#!/music/album/heathen-chemistry|title=Archived copy|access-date=6 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825180037/http://www.oasisinet.com/#!/music/album/heathen-chemistry|archive-date=25 August 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\n''Heathen Chemistry'' was recorded during 2001\u2013early 2002 and is the first Oasis album to have significant writing contributions from members other than chief songwriter [[Noel Gallagher]]. Front man [[Liam Gallagher]] contributed three songs, and new bassist [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]] and lead guitarist [[Gem Archer]] contributed one song each as well.<ref>Wiederhorn, Jon.

I finished my bits three-and-a-half months ago, and then we handed it over to Liam, and in three-and-a-half months he's done nothing. Just concentrated on his drinking habit again. It's just drifting at the moment.\n\n::All the backing tracks are done and it's a fantastic album of instrumentals. Hand it over to the singer and it just slows down and becomes this one really long, drawn-out, painful process. So, to be honest with you, I don't know when it'll come out now. It's down to him.<ref>\"Noel 'livid' as Liam delays new Oasis album\", [[NME]] Online, 11 October 2001</ref>\n\nDespite the setbacks during the recording process, when the album was finally complete Noel was confident that it was the group's second best album to date, behind their debut ''[[Definitely Maybe]]''.<ref>Downey, Ryan J.

Similarly, the name of the first single, \"The Hindu Times\", originated from a logo on a T-shirt that read the same thing, which Noel saw during a photo shoot for GQ's 100 Greatest Guitarists edition. The name was given to the track when it was just an instrumental and the name stuck once the track was finished.\n\n==Release==\nThe release of the album was overshadowed by an [[Internet leak]] of all 11 songs almost three months prior to release, which was evident at a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] show the group performed where fans knew the words to several new songs before the album's release.<ref>Goldner, Jonathan.

MTV.com. 29 April 2002.</ref> However, listeners of the commercially released album heard slight differences to two tracks, \"Little by Little\" and \"Better Man\".\n\nThe length of track 11, \"Better Man\" is 38:03, this is because of a hidden track called \"The Cage\", which begins after 30 minutes of silence. In the Japanese and digital versions, \"Better Man\" and the hidden track \"The Cage\" were separated and the 30-minute silence was removed.\n\nThe album has sold around one million copies in the UK, being certified triple platinum,<ref>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=30757 ''Heathen Chemistry'' certification].

It would also prove to be last album to feature the band's longtime drummer, [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]] (minus one final appearance on their next album, [[Don't Believe the Truth]], on the track [[Lyla (song)| Lyla]]), who left in early 2004, with Noel Gallagher claiming White's commitment to the band was not adequate. He was effectively replaced with [[Ringo Starr]]'s son, [[Zak Starkey]]. The album was released to generally mixed reviews from critics.\n\nThe name \"Heathen Chemistry\" was taken from a second hand T-shirt that Noel had stumbled across.<ref>{{YouTube|user=oasisinetofficial|Oasisnetofficial}}</ref> The album has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.oasisinet.com/#!/music/album/heathen-chemistry|title=Archived copy|access-date=6 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825180037/http://www.oasisinet.com/#!/music/album/heathen-chemistry|archive-date=25 August 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\n''Heathen Chemistry'' was recorded during 2001\u2013early 2002 and is the first Oasis album to have significant writing contributions from members other than chief songwriter [[Noel Gallagher]]. Front man [[Liam Gallagher]] contributed three songs, and new bassist [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]] and lead guitarist [[Gem Archer]] contributed one song each as well.<ref>Wiederhorn, Jon. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453242/20020403/oasis.jhtml \"Oasis Turn to Heathens, Hedonism for Inspiration on New LP\"]. mtv.com. 3 April 2002.</ref>\n\nAlthough most of the song's instrumentation was complete by mid-to-late 2001, Noel indicated that the release date of the album was being needlessly delayed by Liam's apparent reluctance to lay down his vocal parts at recording sessions, and went on to state that he was \"livid\" at the lack of work being done:\n\n::I was really happy with (the album) until recently, but I'm fucking livid now. I finished my bits three-and-a-half months ago, and then we handed it over to Liam, and in three-and-a-half months he's done nothing. Just concentrated on his drinking habit again. It's just drifting at the moment.\n\n::All the backing tracks are done and it's a fantastic album of instrumentals. Hand it over to the singer and it just slows down and becomes this one really long, drawn-out, painful process. So, to be honest with you, I don't know when it'll come out now. It's down to him.<ref>\"Noel 'livid' as Liam delays new Oasis album\", [[NME]] Online, 11 October 2001</ref>\n\nDespite the setbacks during the recording process, when the album was finally complete Noel was confident that it was the group's second best album to date, behind their debut ''[[Definitely Maybe]]''.<ref>Downey, Ryan J. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453989/20020515/oasis.jhtml?headlines=true \"Oasis Set Up U.S. Tour Whether Liam Likes It Or Not\"]. mtvnews.com. 16 May 2002.</ref>\n\nThe title of the album, according to Noel, came from a T-shirt he bought in [[Ibiza]] which featured a logo reading, \"The Society of Heathen Chemists\". Similarly, the name of the first single, \"The Hindu Times\", originated from a logo on a T-shirt that read the same thing, which Noel saw during a photo shoot for GQ's 100 Greatest Guitarists edition. The name was given to the track when it was just an instrumental and the name stuck once the track was finished.\n\n==Release==\nThe release of the album was overshadowed by an [[Internet leak]] of all 11 songs almost three months prior to release, which was evident at a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] show the group performed where fans knew the words to several new songs before the album's release.<ref>Goldner, Jonathan.

MTV.com. 29 April 2002.</ref> However, listeners of the commercially released album heard slight differences to two tracks, \"Little by Little\" and \"Better Man\".\n\nThe length of track 11, \"Better Man\" is 38:03, this is because of a hidden track called \"The Cage\", which begins after 30 minutes of silence. In the Japanese and digital versions, \"Better Man\" and the hidden track \"The Cage\" were separated and the 30-minute silence was removed.\n\nThe album has sold around one million copies in the UK, being certified triple platinum,<ref>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=30757 ''Heathen Chemistry'' certification].

Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of political favors in the city. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in July 2004 that a contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign.<ref name=LFC/> The park's full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.<ref name=cloutheavycafe>{{cite news |first1=Tim |last1=Novak |first2=Steve |last2=Warmbir |first3=Robert |last3=Herguth |first4=Mark |last4=Brown|title=City puts heat on clout-heavy cafe; Changes ordered at Park Grill, with Daley cronies among backers |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=February 11, 2005 |page=6, News section}}</ref><ref name=oversight>{{cite news |title= Millennium Park oversight plan advances  |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=May 9, 2007  |first=Fran |last=Spielman|page=66, Financial section}}</ref>\n[[Image:SBC Plaza.JPG|thumb|A corporate underwriter's stone marker.

While a monument in Wrigley Square honors the park's many private and corporate donors, many park features are also named for their corporate underwriters, with the sponsors' names prominently indicated with stone markers (The Boeing Gallery, The Exelon Pavilion, The AT&T Plaza, The Wrigley Square). Some critics have deemed this to be inappropriate for a public space. Julie Deardorff, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' health and fitness reporter, described the naming of the McDonald's Cycle Center as a continuation of the \"&nbsp;'McDonaldization' of America\" and as somewhat \"insidious\" because the company is making itself more prominent as the social sentiment is to move away from [[fast food]].<ref name=IMismnam/> Timothy Gilfoyle, author of ''Millennium Park: Creating a Chicago Landmark'', notes that a controversy surrounds the corporate naming of several of the park's features, including the BP Bridge, named for an [[Oil major|oil company]].<ref>Gilfoyle, p. 345.</ref>  Naming rights were sold for high fees,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EED71E3BF930A25754C0A9629C8B63|title=Letter from Chicago; A Prized Project, a Mayor and Persistent Criticism |accessdate=August 4, 2008|date=July 13, 2004|author=Kinzer, Stephen|work=The New York Times}}</ref> and Gilfoyle was not the only one who chastised park officials for selling naming rights to the highest bidder.

In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of political favors in the city. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in July 2004 that a contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign.<ref name=LFC/> The park's full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.<ref name=cloutheavycafe>{{cite news |first1=Tim |last1=Novak |first2=Steve |last2=Warmbir |first3=Robert |last3=Herguth |first4=Mark |last4=Brown|title=City puts heat on clout-heavy cafe; Changes ordered at Park Grill, with Daley cronies among backers |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=February 11, 2005 |page=6, News section}}</ref><ref name=oversight>{{cite news |title= Millennium Park oversight plan advances  |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=May 9, 2007  |first=Fran |last=Spielman|page=66, Financial section}}</ref>\n[[Image:SBC Plaza.JPG|thumb|A corporate underwriter's stone marker. ([[SBC Communications|SBC]] Plaza is now [[AT&T Plaza]].)]]\nConcerns have also been raised over the mixed use of taxpayer and corporate funding and associated naming rights for sections of the park. While a monument in Wrigley Square honors the park's many private and corporate donors, many park features are also named for their corporate underwriters, with the sponsors' names prominently indicated with stone markers (The Boeing Gallery, The Exelon Pavilion, The AT&T Plaza, The Wrigley Square). Some critics have deemed this to be inappropriate for a public space. Julie Deardorff, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' health and fitness reporter, described the naming of the McDonald's Cycle Center as a continuation of the \"&nbsp;'McDonaldization' of America\" and as somewhat \"insidious\" because the company is making itself more prominent as the social sentiment is to move away from [[fast food]].<ref name=IMismnam/> Timothy Gilfoyle, author of ''Millennium Park: Creating a Chicago Landmark'', notes that a controversy surrounds the corporate naming of several of the park's features, including the BP Bridge, named for an [[Oil major|oil company]].<ref>Gilfoyle, p. 345.</ref>  Naming rights were sold for high fees,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EED71E3BF930A25754C0A9629C8B63|title=Letter from Chicago; A Prized Project, a Mayor and Persistent Criticism |accessdate=August 4, 2008|date=July 13, 2004|author=Kinzer, Stephen|work=The New York Times}}</ref> and Gilfoyle was not the only one who chastised park officials for selling naming rights to the highest bidder.

The later acquisition of [[Wales West and North Television|Teledu Cymru]] in 1964 enabled TWW to extend its coverage across most of Wales and to provide separate services for the Welsh and English parts of the resulting 'dual region' franchise.\n\nAfter losing their franchise to [[ITV Wales & West|Harlech]], TWW ended their service early in protest long before Harlech was ready to take over. This forced the [[Independent Television Authority]] to organise an [[Independent Television Service for Wales and the West|emergency transitional service]] run by Harlech but using TWW's staff, leftover programming, and some assets.\n\n==History==\n\n===Launch===\nTelevision Wales and the West opened transmission at 4:45 pm on 14 January 1958 with a live, 15-minute opening ceremony by station chairman [[Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], Sir Ifan ab Owen Edwards and Alfred Francis. The master of ceremonies was chief continuity announcer, Bruce Lewis.\n\nAt 5:00 pm, ''Youth Wants to Know'', a children's interview programme produced by [[Granada Television]], became the first programme to be broadcast by TWW. In the programme, Lady Megan Lloyd George and Raymond Gower fielded questions from Welsh school children. Following ''Youth Wants to Know'', [[ITN]]'s early evening news at 5:40 pm was read by Huw Thomas from TWW's studios at [[Pontcanna]].\n\nThe main opening programme came at 7:00 pm with ''The Stars Rise in the West'', a filmed special introduced by ''[[It's That Man Again]]'' regular [[Jack Train]]. The programme, produced in association with ITN, featured appearances from [[Sir Ralph Richardson]], [[Stanley Baker]] (later a founder of TWW's successors, [[ITV Wales & West|Harlech Television]]), [[Naunton Wayne]], [[Donald Sinden]], [[Tessie O'Shea]], [[Donald Houston]], [[Petula Clark]], [[Tommy Cooper]] and [[Ralph Reader]]. [[Harry Secombe]] also appeared in a short film clip, performing ''[[Nessun Dorma]]''.\n\n===Franchise loss===\nPartly because its regional programming was so well regarded it came as a great shock when TWW lost its franchise in the 1967 franchise review, in favour of the [[ITV Wales & West|Harlech Consortium]], whose bid promised a glittering future of star-filled entertainment and quality documentaries.\n\nNo reason was given for the dismissal (as is common practice for franchise changes) but it was believed that TWW's decision to keep its corporate headquarters in London and not move them to within the region was a significant factor. A darker explanation proffered at the time was that it was \"government revenge\" against the broadcaster's major shareholder the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper, which had printed a series of critical articles about the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]]. This does appear unlikely as although the ITA was answerable to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] it was a wholly independent body.\n\nDespite there being many months left on the contract, TWW quit its franchise early in protest, selling the last five months to Harlech for \u00a3500,000 even though the new company was not yet ready to start broadcasting at the time. Following the intervention of the [[Independent Television Authority|ITA]], a temporary service was set up \u2014 [[Independent Television Service for Wales and the West]], broadcasting from the old TWW Pontcanna studios in Cardiff, and staffed by former TWW workers, until Harlech (soon renamed \"[[ITV Wales & West|HTV]]\") was ready to take over its franchise early, on 20 May 1968.\n\n===Closure===\nMuch of the station's closing night was made up of in-house produced output including ''Live Like A Lord'' (a music and comedy show with mainstay TWW personality [[Ivor Emmanuel]] and [[Clive Dunn]]) and ''Sing Me A Fantasy'' (a musical film). The feature programme of the night was TWW's penultimate production, ''All Good Things'', a late night variety special presented by [[Bernard Braden]] and featuring amongst others, [[Tessie O'Shea]], [[Stan Stennett]], Ivor Emmanuel, [[Manfred Mann]], [[Clifford Evans (actor)|Clifford Evans]], [[Anita Harris]] and [[Morecambe & Wise]]. The programme was preceded by an introduction from company chairman Lord Derby.\n\nHaving felt desperately hard-done-by the ITA, and in the fits of a corporate tantrum, the company showed their final display of anger by closing down with ''Come To An End'', a reflective epilogue with John Betjeman, who had made several films for the station, paying tribute to the personnel, programmes and achievements of TWW (which Betjeman affectionately referred to as ''Tellywelly'').\n\nIronically recorded at the Granville Theatre in London, Betjeman closed the epilogue and the station with these words:\n\n''The new firm, Harlech, which will be centred in Cardiff, must build up its own personality. Tellywelly, you had a warm, friendly and inspiring one. Like many others, I'm very grateful to you. I'm sorry to see you go. It's like the death of an old friend.''\n\nAs Betjeman walked out of the theatre and the credits rolled, the camera tilted up to the \"EXIT\" sign on the wall, and TWW ended its transmission for the last time. An interim service, [[Independent Television Service for Wales and the West]], managed by TWW on behalf of the incoming Harlech Television, replaced it.\n\n==Studios==\n\nTWW operated from two sites \u2013 a converted farm at [[Pontcanna]], near [[Cardiff]] (now demolished and replaced by a housing estate) and similar facilities at Bath Road in [[Bristol]]. In January 1964, TWW was required to take over the franchise of its neighbour, Teledu Cymru (the on-screen name of [[Wales West and North Television]], WWN) when that company became the only ITV company to fail financially. The former WWN area was still run as a separate area under the banner ''TWW \u2013 Teledu Cymru''.\n\nAlthough TWW inherited Teledu Cymru's studios in Western Avenue, Cardiff it was decided to sell these and base both operations at Pontcanna. To accommodate this dual presentation and general increase in production the takeover created, \u00a32&nbsp;million was spent on updating and extending the studios at Pontcanna, including a new studio and separate transmission control suites.\n\nTWW was also a player in the development of 625-line colour transmission for the ITV network. Although the bulk of test transmissions and research were conducted for the [[Independent Television Authority]] (ITA) at the [[Associated British Corporation|ABC]] studios at [[Teddington Studios|Teddington]], TWW leased two prototype [[EMI]] colour cameras and associated equipment in 1966 and began running trials, with shows being transmitted on internal networks for viewing by employees.<ref>[http://freespace.virgin.net/mymail.athome/features/colour/colour.html Historical Television Website<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084347/http://freespace.virgin.net/mymail.athome/features/colour/colour.html |date=2007-08-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Transmitters and Sub-regions==\n\nUntil 1965, viewers in both south east Wales and the English West parts of the franchise received ITV on VHF channel 10 from the [[Independent Television Authority|ITA]] transmitter at [[St Hilary transmitting station|St Hilary]] located on Stalling Down, near Cowbridge in south Wales. This did not accommodate separate programme services and so a combined service was provided to viewers in both the Welsh and English parts of the single licence area. Although TWW had studios in both Cardiff and Bristol, the outputs of these were combined at Cardiff into a single programme stream to feed the single transmitter at St Hilary. Hence, for example, local news bulletins involved an on-air switch or handover between the two studios and viewers would alternately see items from both sources.\n\nWhilst the original service provided by TWW from St Hilary had to carry a mix of content for viewers on each side of the Bristol Channel, the west and north of Wales were served by other VHF transmitters which carried a more specific Welsh programme service branded Teledu Cymru. TWW had acquired the licence to broadcast to the west and north of Wales following the commercial failure of [[Wales West and North Television]] (WWN)<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/oct/07/citynews.ITV</ref> which originally held a separate franchise licence for a much larger but, critically, less densely populated part of Wales.<ref>[[List of counties of Wales by population in 1971]]</ref> Following the acquisition of WWN, a second VHF transmitter (using VHF channel 7) was added at St Hilary in 1965<ref>[[St Hilary transmitting station]]</ref> to effectively extend the ex-WWN transmitter network into SE Wales thus permitting programmes of specific interest in Wales to be broadcast exclusively to Wales whilst running a separate schedule for English viewers on channel 10.<ref>http://www.pembers.freeserve.co.uk/405-Lines/tx-list.html#ITA {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414222659/http://www.pembers.freeserve.co.uk/405-Lines/tx-list.html#ITA |date=2012-04-14 }}</ref> This was the first significant step in providing two distinct and separate programme services for Wales and for West and effectively established TWW's area as a 'dual region' during the last few years of their tenure.\n\nThe introduction of the UHF transmitter network for ITV, including particularly the [[Mendip transmitting station|Mendip]] transmitter and the start of HTV's UHF transmissions from there and [[Wenvoe transmitting station|Wenvoe]] in 1970, replicated the separation of ITV programme services to Wales and the West. St Hilary was never used as part of the UHF network and TV transmission from it ceased when the VHF services were closed down many years later in 1985. The mast continues to be used for communications and radio broadcasting.\n\n==Identity==\n\nTWW's on screen identity consisted, originally, of a circle containing the letters TWW, with a large 'T' in the centre and a small 'W' to either side. This apparently static caption was used for the first few years of the stations existence before the familiar box logo appeared. This logo was animated and formed when the boxes rotated revealing one letter at a time, accompanied by a twelve note fanfare.<ref name=HHG>{{cite web|title=Idents, Clocks and Testcards|url=http://www.hhg.org.uk/ids.html|publisher=Harlech House of Graphics|accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the acquisition of WWN, their Teledu Cymru branding was utilised by TWW for the North and West Wales service. The TWW logo was added beneath the Teledu Cymru dragon, along with the caption 'Network for Wales'.<ref name=HHG/>\n\n==Programmes==\n\nTWW did not produce many programmes for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, although the monthly Sunday evening Welsh musical entertainment show, ''Land of Song'', proved very popular during it six-year run 1958-64; but TWW's news and local programming were well regarded (it won many plaudits for its sensitive coverage of the [[Aberfan Disaster]]).\n\nIts Welsh magazine programme was called ''[[Amser Te]]'' (''Tea Time''). Amongst other items, it featured a regular cookery item hosted by [[Myfanwy Howell]] and the popular Welsh music show ''[[Gwlad y Gan]]''.\n\nTWW also launched the careers of many famous faces, who appeared on their early broadcasts. These include [[John Humphrys]] and [[Claire Rayner]]. TWW was the first to showcase [[Adge Cutler]] \u2013 his appearances on the TWW programme 'The Cider Apple' led to Adge's fame spreading and the formation of [[The Wurzels]]. Bruce Lewis was one of TWW's main news presenters; he went on to write various books about his experience during the Second World War, \"Aircrew, a Few of the First\", plus other titles such as ''How to be A TV Presenter'' \u2013 his son, [[Peter Lewis (announcer)|Peter Lewis]], hosted ''Movie Magazine'' and went on to announce for TWW, HTV West, and most famously, LWT.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wales West and North Television]]\n* [[Independent Television Service for Wales and the West]]\n* [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.hhg.org.uk/ Harlech House of Graphics (unofficial history site)]\n* [http://625.uk.com/tv_logos/flash/tww_channel_10.asp Animated TWW Channel 10 logo], 1960s, from 625.uk.com (Requires [[Macromedia Flash]] version 6 or later).\n* [http://625.uk.com/tv_logos/flash/wwn.asp Animated TWW/Teledu Cymru ident], 1964, from 625.uk.com\n\n\n{{ITV}}\n{{Television in Wales}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Television Wales And The West}}\n[[Category:ITV franchisees]]\n[[Category:Television channels in Wales]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1958]]\n[[Category:Media in Bristol]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox broadcasting network\n| name                 = Television Wales and the West\n| logo                 = Tww tv 60logo.svg\n| logo_size            = 150\n| logo_alt             = \n| logo caption         = \n| image                = TWW until 1968 coverage map.svg\n| image_size           = 150\n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = Reception areas of the two TWW services when it closed in 1968\n| type                 = Region of [[television network]]\n| branding             = {{legend|#984ea3|TWW}}{{legend|#ff8900|Teledu Cymru, TWW network for Wales}}\n| country              = England and [[Wales]]\n| airdate              = {{start date and years ago|1958|1|14|df=yes}} \n| available            = \n| founded              = \n| founder              = \n| motto                = \n| slogan               = \n| tvtransmitters       = [[St Hilary transmitting station|St Hilary]], [[Preseli transmitting station|Preseli]], [[Arfon transmitting station|Arfon]], [[Moel-y-Parc transmitting station|Moel-y-Parc]]\n| license_area         = \n| headquarters         = [[London]], [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]]\n| broadcast_area       = [[South Wales]]<br />[[West of England]]<br />[[West Wales|West]] and [[North Wales]] from 1964\n| area                 = \n| nation               = \n| regions              = \n| owner                = Self-owned\n| parent               = \n| key_people           = \n| established          = \n| launch_date          = \n| dissolved            = {{End date and age|1968|3|3|df=y}}\n| former_names         = \n| Picture format       = [[405-line television system|405-line]]\n| affiliation          = [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]\n| groups               = \n| former_affiliations  = \n| webcast              = \n| website              = \n| language             = English and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]\n| replaced             = [[Wales West and North Television]] in west and north Wales in 1964\n| replaced_by          = [[Independent Television Service for Wales and the West]]\n| subsidiary           = \n| footnotes            = \n}}\n\n'''Television Wales and the West'''<ref>[http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/ident/album/tww.php Ident] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715153056/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/ident/album/tww.php |date=2006-07-15 }} (Transdiffusion Broadcasting System / Electromusications), accessed 19 August 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.rts.org.uk/Information_page_+_3_pic_det.asp?id=4570&sec_id=822 Royal Television Society], accessed 19 August 2006</ref> ('''TWW''') was the British \"[[ITV (TV network)|Independent Television]]\" (commercial television) contractor for the franchise area serving 'South Wales and West of England' 1956\u20131968 (franchise awarded 26 October 1956, started transmissions on 14 January 1958, the eighth franchise to launch).\n\nFor the first six years, TWW's service was provided from a single [[Very high frequency|VHF]] transmitter serving both south east Wales and the west of England.

Following ''Youth Wants to Know'', [[ITN]]'s early evening news at 5:40 pm was read by Huw Thomas from TWW's studios at [[Pontcanna]].\n\nThe main opening programme came at 7:00 pm with ''The Stars Rise in the West'', a filmed special introduced by ''[[It's That Man Again]]'' regular [[Jack Train]]. The programme, produced in association with ITN, featured appearances from [[Sir Ralph Richardson]], [[Stanley Baker]] (later a founder of TWW's successors, [[ITV Wales & West|Harlech Television]]), [[Naunton Wayne]], [[Donald Sinden]], [[Tessie O'Shea]], [[Donald Houston]], [[Petula Clark]], [[Tommy Cooper]] and [[Ralph Reader]]. [[Harry Secombe]] also appeared in a short film clip, performing ''[[Nessun Dorma]]''.\n\n===Franchise loss===\nPartly because its regional programming was so well regarded it came as a great shock when TWW lost its franchise in the 1967 franchise review, in favour of the [[ITV Wales & West|Harlech Consortium]], whose bid promised a glittering future of star-filled entertainment and quality documentaries.\n\nNo reason was given for the dismissal (as is common practice for franchise changes) but it was believed that TWW's decision to keep its corporate headquarters in London and not move them to within the region was a significant factor. A darker explanation proffered at the time was that it was \"government revenge\" against the broadcaster's major shareholder the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper, which had printed a series of critical articles about the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]]. This does appear unlikely as although the ITA was answerable to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] it was a wholly independent body.\n\nDespite there being many months left on the contract, TWW quit its franchise early in protest, selling the last five months to Harlech for \u00a3500,000 even though the new company was not yet ready to start broadcasting at the time. Following the intervention of the [[Independent Television Authority|ITA]], a temporary service was set up \u2014 [[Independent Television Service for Wales and the West]], broadcasting from the old TWW Pontcanna studios in Cardiff, and staffed by former TWW workers, until Harlech (soon renamed \"[[ITV Wales & West|HTV]]\") was ready to take over its franchise early, on 20 May 1968.\n\n===Closure===\nMuch of the station's closing night was made up of in-house produced output including ''Live Like A Lord'' (a music and comedy show with mainstay TWW personality [[Ivor Emmanuel]] and [[Clive Dunn]]) and ''Sing Me A Fantasy'' (a musical film). The feature programme of the night was TWW's penultimate production, ''All Good Things'', a late night variety special presented by [[Bernard Braden]] and featuring amongst others, [[Tessie O'Shea]], [[Stan Stennett]], Ivor Emmanuel, [[Manfred Mann]], [[Clifford Evans (actor)|Clifford Evans]], [[Anita Harris]] and [[Morecambe & Wise]]. The programme was preceded by an introduction from company chairman Lord Derby.\n\nHaving felt desperately hard-done-by the ITA, and in the fits of a corporate tantrum, the company showed their final display of anger by closing down with ''Come To An End'', a reflective epilogue with John Betjeman, who had made several films for the station, paying tribute to the personnel, programmes and achievements of TWW (which Betjeman affectionately referred to as ''Tellywelly'').\n\nIronically recorded at the Granville Theatre in London, Betjeman closed the epilogue and the station with these words:\n\n''The new firm, Harlech, which will be centred in Cardiff, must build up its own personality. Tellywelly, you had a warm, friendly and inspiring one. Like many others, I'm very grateful to you. I'm sorry to see you go. It's like the death of an old friend.''\n\nAs Betjeman walked out of the theatre and the credits rolled, the camera tilted up to the \"EXIT\" sign on the wall, and TWW ended its transmission for the last time. An interim service, [[Independent Television Service for Wales and the West]], managed by TWW on behalf of the incoming Harlech Television, replaced it.\n\n==Studios==\n\nTWW operated from two sites \u2013 a converted farm at [[Pontcanna]], near [[Cardiff]] (now demolished and replaced by a housing estate) and similar facilities at Bath Road in [[Bristol]]. In January 1964, TWW was required to take over the franchise of its neighbour, Teledu Cymru (the on-screen name of [[Wales West and North Television]], WWN) when that company became the only ITV company to fail financially. The former WWN area was still run as a separate area under the banner ''TWW \u2013 Teledu Cymru''.\n\nAlthough TWW inherited Teledu Cymru's studios in Western Avenue, Cardiff it was decided to sell these and base both operations at Pontcanna. To accommodate this dual presentation and general increase in production the takeover created, \u00a32&nbsp;million was spent on updating and extending the studios at Pontcanna, including a new studio and separate transmission control suites.\n\nTWW was also a player in the development of 625-line colour transmission for the ITV network. Although the bulk of test transmissions and research were conducted for the [[Independent Television Authority]] (ITA) at the [[Associated British Corporation|ABC]] studios at [[Teddington Studios|Teddington]], TWW leased two prototype [[EMI]] colour cameras and associated equipment in 1966 and began running trials, with shows being transmitted on internal networks for viewing by employees.<ref>[http://freespace.virgin.net/mymail.athome/features/colour/colour.html Historical Television Website<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084347/http://freespace.virgin.net/mymail.athome/features/colour/colour.html |date=2007-08-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Transmitters and Sub-regions==\n\nUntil 1965, viewers in both south east Wales and the English West parts of the franchise received ITV on VHF channel 10 from the [[Independent Television Authority|ITA]] transmitter at [[St Hilary transmitting station|St Hilary]] located on Stalling Down, near Cowbridge in south Wales. This did not accommodate separate programme services and so a combined service was provided to viewers in both the Welsh and English parts of the single licence area. Although TWW had studios in both Cardiff and Bristol, the outputs of these were combined at Cardiff into a single programme stream to feed the single transmitter at St Hilary. Hence, for example, local news bulletins involved an on-air switch or handover between the two studios and viewers would alternately see items from both sources.\n\nWhilst the original service provided by TWW from St Hilary had to carry a mix of content for viewers on each side of the Bristol Channel, the west and north of Wales were served by other VHF transmitters which carried a more specific Welsh programme service branded Teledu Cymru. TWW had acquired the licence to broadcast to the west and north of Wales following the commercial failure of [[Wales West and North Television]] (WWN)<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/oct/07/citynews.ITV</ref> which originally held a separate franchise licence for a much larger but, critically, less densely populated part of Wales.<ref>[[List of counties of Wales by population in 1971]]</ref> Following the acquisition of WWN, a second VHF transmitter (using VHF channel 7) was added at St Hilary in 1965<ref>[[St Hilary transmitting station]]</ref> to effectively extend the ex-WWN transmitter network into SE Wales thus permitting programmes of specific interest in Wales to be broadcast exclusively to Wales whilst running a separate schedule for English viewers on channel 10.<ref>http://www.pembers.freeserve.co.uk/405-Lines/tx-list.html#ITA {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414222659/http://www.pembers.freeserve.co.uk/405-Lines/tx-list.html#ITA |date=2012-04-14 }}</ref> This was the first significant step in providing two distinct and separate programme services for Wales and for West and effectively established TWW's area as a 'dual region' during the last few years of their tenure.\n\nThe introduction of the UHF transmitter network for ITV, including particularly the [[Mendip transmitting station|Mendip]] transmitter and the start of HTV's UHF transmissions from there and [[Wenvoe transmitting station|Wenvoe]] in 1970, replicated the separation of ITV programme services to Wales and the West. St Hilary was never used as part of the UHF network and TV transmission from it ceased when the VHF services were closed down many years later in 1985. The mast continues to be used for communications and radio broadcasting.\n\n==Identity==\n\nTWW's on screen identity consisted, originally, of a circle containing the letters TWW, with a large 'T' in the centre and a small 'W' to either side. This apparently static caption was used for the first few years of the stations existence before the familiar box logo appeared. This logo was animated and formed when the boxes rotated revealing one letter at a time, accompanied by a twelve note fanfare.<ref name=HHG>{{cite web|title=Idents, Clocks and Testcards|url=http://www.hhg.org.uk/ids.html|publisher=Harlech House of Graphics|accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the acquisition of WWN, their Teledu Cymru branding was utilised by TWW for the North and West Wales service. The TWW logo was added beneath the Teledu Cymru dragon, along with the caption 'Network for Wales'.<ref name=HHG/>\n\n==Programmes==\n\nTWW did not produce many programmes for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, although the monthly Sunday evening Welsh musical entertainment show, ''Land of Song'', proved very popular during it six-year run 1958-64; but TWW's news and local programming were well regarded (it won many plaudits for its sensitive coverage of the [[Aberfan Disaster]]).\n\nIts Welsh magazine programme was called ''[[Amser Te]]'' (''Tea Time''). Amongst other items, it featured a regular cookery item hosted by [[Myfanwy Howell]] and the popular Welsh music show ''[[Gwlad y Gan]]''.\n\nTWW also launched the careers of many famous faces, who appeared on their early broadcasts. These include [[John Humphrys]] and [[Claire Rayner]]. TWW was the first to showcase [[Adge Cutler]] \u2013 his appearances on the TWW programme 'The Cider Apple' led to Adge's fame spreading and the formation of [[The Wurzels]]. Bruce Lewis was one of TWW's main news presenters; he went on to write various books about his experience during the Second World War, \"Aircrew, a Few of the First\", plus other titles such as ''How to be A TV Presenter'' \u2013 his son, [[Peter Lewis (announcer)|Peter Lewis]], hosted ''Movie Magazine'' and went on to announce for TWW, HTV West, and most famously, LWT.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wales West and North Television]]\n* [[Independent Television Service for Wales and the West]]\n* [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.hhg.org.uk/ Harlech House of Graphics (unofficial history site)]\n* [http://625.uk.com/tv_logos/flash/tww_channel_10.asp Animated TWW Channel 10 logo], 1960s, from 625.uk.com (Requires [[Macromedia Flash]] version 6 or later).\n* [http://625.uk.com/tv_logos/flash/wwn.asp Animated TWW/Teledu Cymru ident], 1964, from 625.uk.com\n\n\n{{ITV}}\n{{Television in Wales}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Television Wales And The West}}\n[[Category:ITV franchisees]]\n[[Category:Television channels in Wales]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1958]]\n[[Category:Media in Bristol]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c8:4300:0:8406:fd9d:f646:25bf", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Wales_and_the_West"}

Their employers are Edmond Bernadac, a rich and staid businessman, and his flighty new Swiss wife Elisabeth, a former air hostess who is fond of alcohol and men. \n\nTheir new butler rapidly becomes indispensable at smoothing over the continual problems which beset the household, one being that the son of the house immediately wants to marry Suzanne and has therefore to win the permission of her supposed father. He meanwhile has to contend with problems at home, where his dead wife's parents have moved in and claim to be his heirs. In the end he has to come back to life in order to thwart them and to allow Suzanne to marry the boy she loves.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jean Gabin]] as Monsieur \n* [[Liselotte Pulver]] as Elizabeth Bernadac\n* [[Mireille Darc]] as Suzanne \n* [[Philippe Noiret]] as Edmond Bernadac \n* [[Gaby Morlay]] as Madame Bernadac m\u00e8re \n* [[Gabrielle Dorziat]] as La belle-m\u00e8re \n* [[Peter Vogel (actor)|Peter Vogel]] as Michel Corbeil \n* [[Marina Berti]] as Madame Danoni \n* [[Claudio Gora]] as Danoni \n* [[Berthe Granval]] as Nathalie Bernadac \n* [[Jean-Paul Moulinot]] as Me Flamand, le notaire \n* [[Jean-Pierre Darras]] as Jos\u00e9 \n* [[Henri Cr\u00e9mieux]] as Le beau-p\u00e8re \n* [[Heinz Blau]] as Alain Bernadac \n* [[Maryse Martin]] as Justine \n* [[Andrex (actor)|Andrex]] as Antoine \n* [[Alain Bouvette]] as Marc \n* [[Jean Lefebvre]] as Le detective priv\u00e9 \n* [[Max Elder]] as Le valet de chambre \n* [[Armand Meffre]] as Le patron du bistrot \n* [[Jean Champion]] as Le patron de l'h\u00f4tel \n* [[Pierre Moncorbier]] as Le serrurier \n* [[Angela Minervini]] as La serveuse du snack \n* [[Christian Brocard]] as Un client sans-g\u00eane \n* [[Andr\u00e9 Dalibert]] as Le tailleur \n* [[Paul Faivre]] as Le cur\u00e9 \n* [[Michel Nastorg]] as Le docteur \n* [[Raoul Henry]] as L'invit\u00e9 Bretteville \n* [[Ren\u00e9 Fleur]] as Le d\u00e9corateur\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Bock, Hans-Michael & Bergfelder, Tim.

His brother Antoine was a Nationalist MP and Parliamentary Secretary while a cousin, [[Ugo Mifsud Bonnici]], was a Nationalist MP, Minister and [[President of Malta]]. Karmenu has two sisters and three brothers, one of whom (Antoine) is a Nationalist member of Parliament and another is an Archpriest. He never married. <ref name=OPM/>\n\nKarmenu Mifsud Bonnici studied at the Lyceum and graduated in Law at the [[University of Malta]] in 1954. He also later studied [[taxation]] and [[industrial law]] at the [[University College of London]] in 1967-68, and has since been alecturer in Industrial and [[Fiscal Law]] at the University of Malta.<ref name=OPM/>\n\nIn the 1960s, at the height of the dispute between the [[Maltese Church]] and the Labour Party, Mifsud Bonnici was an official of a number of lay organisations connected to the Church, including the the Catholic Social Guild and the Young Christian Workers Movement (also as editorial board member of their ''Il-Haddiem'' newspaper),<ref name=OPM/> and supported the \"diocesan junta\" of Church organisations opposing [[Dom Mintoff]] and his Party. He would later claim to be \"a Nationalist by birth, but a Labourite through free choice and conviction\". {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn 1969 Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici got a job as a local consultant of Malta's [[General Workers' Union]], playing a role in the struggle of the trade union and the Labour party against the Nationalist government-proposed Industrial Relations Bill, which foresaw sanctions up to imprisonment for workers on strike.<ref name=OPM/><ref name=rudolf/> He continued his engagement with the [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]] throughout the 1970s.\n \n===Labour Party leader and Prime minister===\nIn May 1980, [[Dom Mintoff]] appointed Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici as deputy leader of the Labour Party, which was confirmed by the party conference. Mifsud Bonnici managed the party campaign for the [[1981 Maltese general election|1981 elections]] - the third and last victory of Mintoff's Labour.<ref name=OPM/>\n\nIn October 1981 Mintoff designated Mifsud Bonnici as his successor, again confirmed by the party conference. Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici was thus co-opted into Parliament in May 1982 upon the resignation of Paul Xuereb, and assigned the Ministry of Employment and Social Services,<ref name=OPM/> without ever standing for election.

Relations with the church deteriorated further on two fronts: the enactment of a Bill to seize church property without compensation, and attempts by the government to take control of church schools. In 1984, a demonstration by some workers of the [[Malta Drydocks]], at which Mifsud Bonnici was present, climaxed when the offices of the Maltese Curia were ransacked after the demonstration had ended.
