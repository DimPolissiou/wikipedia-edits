For the ''[[Westminster Review#London and Westminster Review|London Review]]'', founded by [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|Sir William Molesworth]] in 1834, he wrote a notable article entitled \"The Church and its Reform\", which was much too sceptical for the time, and injured the ''Review''. Mill, himself was an atheist.<ref>https://mises.org/library/james-mill-laissez-faires-lenin</ref> His last published book was the ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' (1835).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\n==Intellectual legacy==\n\n===''The History of British India''===\n{{Main|The History of British India}}\n\nMill preferred to take a more theoretical approach to social subjects than the [[Empiricism|empirical]] one common at the time. His best known literary work is his ''History of British India'', in which he describes the acquisition of the [[British India|Indian Empire]] by England and later the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. He also brings political theory to bear on the delineation of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] civilization, and subjects the conduct of the actors in the successive stages of the conquest and administration of India to severe criticism. The work itself, and the author's official connection with India for the last seventeen years of his life, effected a complete change in the whole system of governance in the country.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} Mill never visited the Indian colony, relying solely on documentary material and archival records in compiling his work. This fact has led to severe criticism of Mill's ''History of India'' by notable economist [[Amartya Sen]].<ref>[[Amartya Sen]]'s address given to the Millennium Session of the Indian History Congress [https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/458/history-and-the-enterprise-of-knowledge]</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Thomas Trautmann]], \"James Mill's highly influential History of British India (1817) \u2013 most particularly the long essay 'Of the Hindus' comprising ten chapters&nbsp;\u2013 is the single most important source of British Indophobia and hostility to Orientalism\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Aryans and British India |pages=117 |first=Thomas R. |last=Trautmann |location=New Delhi |publisher=YODA Press |edition=2nd Indian |year=2006 |origyear=1997 |isbn=81-902272-1-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jR_LPnEH3GsC&pg=PA117}}</ref> In the chapter titled General Reflections in \"Of the Hindus\", Mill wrote \"under the glosing exterior of the Hindu, lies a general disposition to deceit and perfidy\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of British India |first= James |last=Mill |publisher = Madden |year=1858 |url=https://archive.org/details/historybritishi24wilsgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historybritishi24wilsgoog/page/n170 150] }}</ref> According to Mill, \"the same insincerity, mendacity, and perfidy; the same indifference to the feelings of others; the same prostitution and venality\" were the conspicuous characteristics of both the Hindoos and the Muslims. The Muslims, however, were perfuse, when possessed of wealth, and devoted to pleasure; the Hindoos almost always penurious and ascetic; and \"in truth, the Hindoo like the eunuch, excels in the qualities of a slave\". Furthermore, similar to the Chinese, the Hindoos were \"dissembling, treacherous, mendacious, to an excess which surpasses even the usual measure of uncultivated society\". Both the Chinese and the Hindoos were \"disposed to excessive exaggeration with regard to everything relating to themselves\". Both were \"cowardly and unfeeling\". Both were \"in the highest degree conceited of themselves, and full of affected contempt for others\". And, above all, both were \"in physical sense, disgustingly unclean in their persons and houses\".<ref>Dharampal, The Beautiful Tree.</ref>\n\n===British politics===\nMill also played a great part in British politics, and was a dominant figure in the establishment of what was called \"[[Philosophical Radicals|philosophic radicalism]]\". His writings on government and his personal influence among the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politicians of his time determined the change of view from the [[French Revolution]] theories of the rights of man and the absolute equality of men to the claiming of securities for good government through a wide extension of the franchise. It was under this banner that the [[Reform Bill]] was fought and won. His ''Elements of Political Economy'' followed up the views of his friend [[David Ricardo]]. By 1911, the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] described it as being of mainly historical interest, \"an accurate summary of views that are now largely discarded\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} Among the more important of its theses are:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n# that the chief problem of practical reformers is to limit the increase of population, on the assumption that capital does not naturally increase at the same rate as population (ii. \u00a7 2, art. 3)\n# that the value of a thing depends entirely on the quantity of labour put into it; and\n# that what is now known as the \"[[unearned increment]]\" of land is a proper object for taxation.\n\n===Other areas===\nBy his ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind'' and his ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' Mill acquired a position in the history of psychology and ethics. He took up the problems of mind very much after the fashion of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], as then represented by [[Thomas Reid]], [[Dugald Stewart]] and [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], but made a new start, due in part to [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and still more to his own independent thinking. He carried out the principle of association into the analysis of the complex emotional states, as the affections, the aesthetic emotions and the moral sentiment, all which he endeavoured to resolve into pleasurable and painful sensations. But the salient merit of the ''Analysis'' is the constant endeavour after precise definition of terms and clear statement of doctrines. He had a great effect on [[Franz Brentano]] who discussed his work in his own empirical psychology.<ref>Franz Brentano: ''Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt''. Ed. Oskar Kraus, 2 vols. Leipzig: Meiner, 1924\u201325; ed. Mauro Antonelli. Heusenstamm: Ontos, 2008</ref> The ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' severely criticizes the alleged flimsiness and misrepresentations of Sir [[James Mackintosh]]'s ''Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy'' (1830), and discusses the foundations of ethics from the author's utilitarian point of view.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=4543}}\n\n==Major works==\n[[File:Mill - Elements of political economy, 1826 - 5894644.tif|thumb|''Elements of political economy'', 1826]]\n[[File:Bain - James Mill, 1882 - 5825460.tif|thumb|[[Alexander Bain]], ''James Mill.

His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the [[Jacobite risings|Stuart rising]]{{which|date=January 2018}}, resolved that he should receive a first-rate education, and sent him first to the parish school and then to the [[Montrose Academy]], where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half. He then entered the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he distinguished himself as a Greek scholar.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\nIn October 1789, he was ordained as a [[minister of the Church of Scotland]], but met with little success. According to John Stuart Mill's ''Autobiography'', his father though \"educated in the creed of Scotch Presbyterianism, had by his own studies and reflections been early led to reject not only the belief in Revelation but the foundations of what is commonly called Natural Religion.\"<ref>https://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/mill/auto/auto.c02.html</ref> From 1790 to 1802, in addition to holding various tutorships, he occupied himself with historical and philosophical studies. Finding little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802 he went to London, England, in company with [[Sir John Stuart, 4th Baronet|Sir John Stuart]] of [[Fettercairn]], then member of parliament for [[Kincardineshire]], and devoted himself to literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the ''Literary Journal'', which professed to give a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time he also edited the ''St James's Chronicle'', belonging to the same proprietor. In 1804, he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade, arguing against a bounty on the exportation of grain. In 1805, he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of ''An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther'', a [[Charles de Villers|C.F. Villers]]'s work  on the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], an attack on the alleged vices of the papal system.  About the end of this year he began his ''[[The History of British India]]'', which he took twelve years to complete, instead of three or four, as had been expected.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\nIn that year he also married Harriet Burrow, whose mother, a widow, kept what was then known as an establishment for lunatics in [[Hoxton]]. He then took a house in [[Pentonville]], where his eldest son, [[John Stuart Mill]], was born in 1806.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\n[[File:19 York Street, Westminster (1848).jpg|thumb|The back of No. 19, York Street (1848).

He adopted Bentham's principles in their entirety, and determined to devote all his energies to bringing them before the world. Between 1806 and 1818, he wrote for the ''[[Anti-Jacobin Review]]'', the ''British Review'' and ''[[The Eclectic Review]]''; but there is no means of tracing his contributions. In 1808, he began to write for the [[Edinburgh Review]], to which he contributed steadily till 1813, his first known article being \"Money and Exchange.\" He also wrote on Spanish America, China, [[Francisco de Miranda]], the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], and the Liberty of the Press. In the ''Annual Review'' for 1808 two articles of his are traced\u2014a \"Review of Fox's History\", and an article on \"Bentham's Law Reforms\", probably his first published notice of Bentham. In 1811 he co-operated with [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]] (1770\u20131843), a [[Quaker]] and [[chemist]], in a periodical called the ''Philanthropist''. He contributed largely to every issue \u2013 his principal topics being Education, Freedom of the Press, and Prison Discipline (under which he expounded Bentham's [[Panopticon]]). He made powerful onslaughts on the Church in connection with the [[Monitorial System|Bell and Lancaster]] controversy, and took a  part in the discussions that led to the foundation of the [[University of London]] in 1825. In 1814 he wrote a number of articles, containing an exposition of [[utilitarianism]], for the supplement to the fifth edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', the most important being those on \"Jurisprudence\", \"Prisons\", \"Government\"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} and \"Law of Nations\".\n\nIn 1818, ''[[The History of British India]]'' was published, and obtained a great and immediate success.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mill |first=James |year=1817 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= The History of British India |volume= |edition=1 |publisher= Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |publication-date=1817 |publication-place=London |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/historyofbritish1817mill#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=11 December 2012 }}</ref> It brought about a change in the author's fortunes. The year following he was appointed an official in the India House, in the important department of the examiner of Indian correspondence. He gradually rose in ranks until he was appointed, in 1830, head of the office, with a salary of \u00a31900, raised in 1836 to \u00a32000. His great work, the ''Elements of Political Economy'', appeared in 1821 (3rd and revised ed. 1825).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}<ref>{{Citation |last=Mill |first=James |year=1821 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= Elements of Political Economy |volume= |edition=First |publisher= Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |publication-date=1821 |publication-place=London |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/elementsofpoliti00millrich#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=11 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1824 to 1826, Mill contributed to the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', started as the organ of his party, a number of articles in which he attacked the ''[[Edinburgh Review|Edinburgh]]'' and ''[[Quarterly Review|Quarterly]]'' Reviews and ecclesiastical establishments. In 1829 appeared the ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind''. From 1831 to 1833, Mill was largely occupied in the defence of the East India Company, during the controversy attending the renewal of its charter, he being in virtue of his office the spokesman of the court of directors. For the ''[[Westminster Review#London and Westminster Review|London Review]]'', founded by [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|Sir William Molesworth]] in 1834, he wrote a notable article entitled \"The Church and its Reform\", which was much too sceptical for the time, and injured the ''Review''. Mill, himself was an atheist.<ref>https://mises.org/library/james-mill-laissez-faires-lenin</ref> His last published book was the ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' (1835).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\n==Intellectual legacy==\n\n===''The History of British India''===\n{{Main|The History of British India}}\n\nMill preferred to take a more theoretical approach to social subjects than the [[Empiricism|empirical]] one common at the time. His best known literary work is his ''History of British India'', in which he describes the acquisition of the [[British India|Indian Empire]] by England and later the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. He also brings political theory to bear on the delineation of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] civilization, and subjects the conduct of the actors in the successive stages of the conquest and administration of India to severe criticism. The work itself, and the author's official connection with India for the last seventeen years of his life, effected a complete change in the whole system of governance in the country.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} Mill never visited the Indian colony, relying solely on documentary material and archival records in compiling his work. This fact has led to severe criticism of Mill's ''History of India'' by notable economist [[Amartya Sen]].<ref>[[Amartya Sen]]'s address given to the Millennium Session of the Indian History Congress [https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/458/history-and-the-enterprise-of-knowledge]</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Thomas Trautmann]], \"James Mill's highly influential History of British India (1817) \u2013 most particularly the long essay 'Of the Hindus' comprising ten chapters&nbsp;\u2013 is the single most important source of British Indophobia and hostility to Orientalism\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Aryans and British India |pages=117 |first=Thomas R. |last=Trautmann |location=New Delhi |publisher=YODA Press |edition=2nd Indian |year=2006 |origyear=1997 |isbn=81-902272-1-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jR_LPnEH3GsC&pg=PA117}}</ref> In the chapter titled General Reflections in \"Of the Hindus\", Mill wrote \"under the glosing exterior of the Hindu, lies a general disposition to deceit and perfidy\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of British India |first= James |last=Mill |publisher = Madden |year=1858 |url=https://archive.org/details/historybritishi24wilsgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historybritishi24wilsgoog/page/n170 150] }}</ref> According to Mill, \"the same insincerity, mendacity, and perfidy; the same indifference to the feelings of others; the same prostitution and venality\" were the conspicuous characteristics of both the Hindoos and the Muslims. The Muslims, however, were perfuse, when possessed of wealth, and devoted to pleasure; the Hindoos almost always penurious and ascetic; and \"in truth, the Hindoo like the eunuch, excels in the qualities of a slave\". Furthermore, similar to the Chinese, the Hindoos were \"dissembling, treacherous, mendacious, to an excess which surpasses even the usual measure of uncultivated society\". Both the Chinese and the Hindoos were \"disposed to excessive exaggeration with regard to everything relating to themselves\". Both were \"cowardly and unfeeling\". Both were \"in the highest degree conceited of themselves, and full of affected contempt for others\". And, above all, both were \"in physical sense, disgustingly unclean in their persons and houses\".<ref>Dharampal, The Beautiful Tree.</ref>\n\n===British politics===\nMill also played a great part in British politics, and was a dominant figure in the establishment of what was called \"[[Philosophical Radicals|philosophic radicalism]]\". His writings on government and his personal influence among the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politicians of his time determined the change of view from the [[French Revolution]] theories of the rights of man and the absolute equality of men to the claiming of securities for good government through a wide extension of the franchise. It was under this banner that the [[Reform Bill]] was fought and won. His ''Elements of Political Economy'' followed up the views of his friend [[David Ricardo]]. By 1911, the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] described it as being of mainly historical interest, \"an accurate summary of views that are now largely discarded\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} Among the more important of its theses are:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n# that the chief problem of practical reformers is to limit the increase of population, on the assumption that capital does not naturally increase at the same rate as population (ii. \u00a7 2, art. 3)\n# that the value of a thing depends entirely on the quantity of labour put into it; and\n# that what is now known as the \"[[unearned increment]]\" of land is a proper object for taxation.\n\n===Other areas===\nBy his ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind'' and his ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' Mill acquired a position in the history of psychology and ethics. He took up the problems of mind very much after the fashion of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], as then represented by [[Thomas Reid]], [[Dugald Stewart]] and [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], but made a new start, due in part to [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and still more to his own independent thinking. He carried out the principle of association into the analysis of the complex emotional states, as the affections, the aesthetic emotions and the moral sentiment, all which he endeavoured to resolve into pleasurable and painful sensations. But the salient merit of the ''Analysis'' is the constant endeavour after precise definition of terms and clear statement of doctrines. He had a great effect on [[Franz Brentano]] who discussed his work in his own empirical psychology.<ref>Franz Brentano: ''Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt''. Ed. Oskar Kraus, 2 vols. Leipzig: Meiner, 1924\u201325; ed. Mauro Antonelli. Heusenstamm: Ontos, 2008</ref> The ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' severely criticizes the alleged flimsiness and misrepresentations of Sir [[James Mackintosh]]'s ''Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy'' (1830), and discusses the foundations of ethics from the author's utilitarian point of view.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=4543}}\n\n==Major works==\n[[File:Mill - Elements of political economy, 1826 - 5894644.tif|thumb|''Elements of political economy'', 1826]]\n[[File:Bain - James Mill, 1882 - 5825460.tif|thumb|[[Alexander Bain]], ''James Mill.

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment.

since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

The expedition took place in southeastern and central [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid and Byzantine empires shared a long land border.\n\nUpon coming to the throne, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}) ceased paying the [[tribute]] agreed to by his predecessors with the Caliphate, and launched attacks on the Abbasid [[al-Awasim|frontier regions]]. The [[Abbasid caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}), who sought to promote himself as a champion of ''[[jihad]]'', decided to lead in person a retaliatory attack with the objective of punishing the Byzantines and impressing Abassid might upon their emperor.\n\nHarun assembled his army at [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria. Medieval historians record numbers to be as high as 135,000 or even 300,000 men. While these are clearly exaggerated, it is clear that the Abbasid force assembled for the invasion was far larger than anything seen before. The Abbasid army set out from Raqqa on 11 June 806, crossed the coastal region of [[Cilicia]], and the [[Taurus Mountains]]; invaded the Byzantine province of [[Cappadocia]]. The Abbasids met no opposition and raided at will, capturing several towns and fortresses. Celebrated in Arab histories was the siege, fall, and sack of the city of [[Heraclea Cybistra|Herakleia]]; its name was later given to a victory monument erected by the Caliph near Raqqa. The Byzantine losses forced Nikephoros to seek peace terms in which he offered a resumption of tribute payments in exchange for the Abbasids' withdrawal. However, this time Harun exacted an additional [[jizya|personal tax]] levied on the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], as a token of their submission to the Caliph.\n\nAlmost immediately following Harun's departure, Nikephoros violated the peace terms by refortifying the sacked frontier forts and stopping tribute payments. However, Harun's preoccupation with a rebellion in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and his death three years later, prevented a reprisal on a similar scale to 806. Smaller-scale raids continued on both sides, but the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]], which began after 809, and the Byzantine preoccupation with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] contributed to a cessation of large-scale [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine conflict]] for the next two decades.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of Byzantine empress [[Irene of Athens]] in October 802 and the accession of [[Nikephoros I]] in her place marked the start of a more violent phase in the long history of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]. Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1. Historical background}} Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike\u2014a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] source records that when he learned of Nikephoros's accession, a [[Elpidius (rebel)|Byzantine renegade]] warned the Abbasid governor of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] to \"throw away his [[silk]] and put on his armour\". In addition, the new emperor was determined to refill the treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=127, 130}}\n\n[[File:Solidus-Nicephorus I and Staraucius-sb1604.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Obverse and reverse of a medieval gold coin, showing the busts of a bearded crowned man and of a younger crowned man|Gold ''[[solidus (coin)|nomisma]]'' of Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (left) and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]] (right)]]\nIn retaliation for the cessation of tribute and the violation of the peace agreement concluded with Irene, Harun launched a raid under his son [[al-Qasim ibn Harun al-Rashid|al-Qasim]] in spring 803.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=238\u2013239}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=131}} Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced a large-scale revolt of the Byzantine army of Asia Minor under its commander-in-chief, [[Bardanes Tourkos]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph in person. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies faced one another for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle: Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters,{{efn|[[Al-Tabari]] and other Muslim sources record the texts, supposedly of Nikephoros' letter demanding the return of the tribute paid until then, and Harun's brief reply to Nikephoros, calling him \"the dog of the Byzantines\" (''kalb [[R\u00fbm|al-Rum]]''): \"O son of an infidel woman, I have read your letter, and the reply is what you will see, without you having to hear it.

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts or [[al-Awasim|''thugh\u016br'']] in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went. The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils, but the Byzantines marched on to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia. The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nAt the same time, another Byzantine force raided the [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n ''thugh\u016br'' and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Melitene]], while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in [[Cyprus]], which for over a century had been an Arab\u2013Byzantine [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{efn|In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] concluded an agreement whereby Cyprus became a neutral territory, its tax revenue shared between Byzantium and the Caliphate, and its ports open to both powers, including for military purposes against one another. Apart from a brief Byzantine reoccupation under [[Basil I]], this status lasted until 965, when the island was reincorporated into the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Cyprus\" (T. E.

As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]].

Al-Tabari reports that Harun put on a cap with the inscription \"Warrior for the Faith and Pilgrim\" (in Arabic, \"''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', ''[[hajj]]''\"). The Abbasids crossed Cilicia, where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt, and entered Byzantine [[Cappadocia]] through the [[Cilician Gates]]. Harun marched to [[Tyana]], which at the time seems to have been abandoned. There, he began to establish his base of operations, ordering [[Uqbah ibn Ja'far al-Khuza'i]] to refortify the town and erect a [[mosque]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=262\u2013263}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

According to al-Tabari,\n{{quote|[Harun] ordered the slave girl to be sought out; she was brought back, adorned with finery and installed on a seat in the tent in which he himself was lodging. The slave girl and the tent, together with its contents, vessels and fittings, were handed over to Nikephoros's envoy. He also sent to Nikephoros the perfume which he had requested, and he further sent to him dates, dishes of jellied sweets, raisins and healing drugs.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}}}\n\nNikephoros returned the favour by dispatching a horse laden with 50,000 silver coins, 100 [[satin]] garments, 200 garments of fine [[brocade]], 12 [[falcon]]s, four hunting dogs, and three more horses.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}} But as soon as the Arabs had withdrawn, the Emperor again restored the frontier forts and thereafter ceased the payment of tribute.

The larger summer raid under [[Harthama ibn A'yan]] was met by Nikephoros in person, and after an indecisive battle both sides retreated. The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]]. On his return, however, Humayd lost several ships to a storm, and on the Peloponnese, the Slavic revolt was put down after failing to capture the city of [[Patras]] during the siege of 805.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=147\u2013148}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=267\u2013268}} The failure of the year's Abbasid efforts were compounded by the outbreak of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]'s rebellion in Khurasan, which forced Harun to depart again for the East. The Caliph concluded a new truce, and another prisoner exchange was held at the Lamos in 808. Nikephoros was thus left with his gains, both the restored frontier fortifications and the cessation of tribute, intact.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=155}}\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Arabische Eroberung 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Multi-color map of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, showing the phases of Muslim expansion to the 10th century|Map of the [[spread of Islam]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and of the [[Muslim world]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphates, from the {{Interlanguage link|Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas|de|lt=''Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas''}} of [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] (1886)]]\n\nHarun's massive expedition achieved remarkably little in material terms.

In general terms, they were content with the territorial limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or pre-emptive, meant to preserve their frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|p=302}} At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular were important for domestic consumption. The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3.

Shaban]] considers the campaign a \"limited success\" at best, and criticizes Harun's \"single-minded\" attention to the Byzantines as a \"totally misguided effort\". According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna]], the Abbasid civil war that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans. Indeed, the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major, centrally organized, Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=157}} Isolated raids and counter-raids continued at land as well as at sea, and, independently of the Abbasids, local Muslim leaders [[Emirate of Crete|conquered Crete]] and launched the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]] in the 820s.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=127\u2013128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=183, 219\u2013220, 248\u2013257}} Nevertheless, large-scale operations over the land border in eastern Anatolia between the two empires resumed only after the accession of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}), whose confrontations with the caliphs al-Ma'mun and [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}) culminated in the great invasions by al-Ma'mun in 830\u2013833, and the Sack of Amorium by al-Mu'tasim in 838.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=128\u2013131}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=272\u2013275, 278\u2013281, 292\u2013305}}\n\n[[File:Heraqla,SE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Photo of a mound of ruins in a barren field|View of the remnants of ''Hiraqla'', a victory monument erected by Harun after the campaign of 806]]\nThe longest-lasting impact of Harun's campaign is found in literature. Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence. Known as ''{{ill|Hiraqla|de|Heraqla}}'' in local tradition, apparently after Herakleia, it comprises a square structure with sides {{convert|100|m|ft}} long, surrounded by a circular wall about {{convert|500|m|ft}} in diameter, pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions. The main structure, built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun's orders in 806\u2013807, has four vaulted halls on the ground floor, and ramps leading to an upper storey, which was left incomplete on Harun's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death.{{sfn|Meinecke|1995|p=412}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{The History of al-Tabari | volume = 30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Michael | title = Aristocratic Violence and Holy War: Studies in the Jihad and the Arab\u2013Byzantine Frontier | year = 1996 | publisher = American Oriental Society | location = New Haven, Connecticut | isbn = 0-940490-11-0  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brooks | first=E.

The expedition took place in southeastern and central [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid and Byzantine empires shared a long land border.\n\nUpon coming to the throne, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}) ceased paying the [[tribute]] agreed to by his predecessors with the Caliphate, and launched attacks on the Abbasid [[al-Awasim|frontier regions]]. The [[Abbasid caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}), who sought to promote himself as a champion of ''[[jihad]]'', decided to lead in person a retaliatory attack with the objective of punishing the Byzantines and impressing Abassid might upon their emperor.\n\nHarun assembled his army at [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria. Medieval historians record numbers to be as high as 135,000 or even 300,000 men. While these are clearly exaggerated, it is clear that the Abbasid force assembled for the invasion was far larger than anything seen before. The Abbasid army set out from Raqqa on 11 June 806, crossed the coastal region of [[Cilicia]], and the [[Taurus Mountains]]; invaded the Byzantine province of [[Cappadocia]]. The Abbasids met no opposition and raided at will, capturing several towns and fortresses. Celebrated in Arab histories was the siege, fall, and sack of the city of [[Heraclea Cybistra|Herakleia]]; its name was later given to a victory monument erected by the Caliph near Raqqa. The Byzantine losses forced Nikephoros to seek peace terms in which he offered a resumption of tribute payments in exchange for the Abbasids' withdrawal. However, this time Harun exacted an additional [[jizya|personal tax]] levied on the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], as a token of their submission to the Caliph.\n\nAlmost immediately following Harun's departure, Nikephoros violated the peace terms by refortifying the sacked frontier forts and stopping tribute payments. However, Harun's preoccupation with a rebellion in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and his death three years later, prevented a reprisal on a similar scale to 806. Smaller-scale raids continued on both sides, but the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]], which began after 809, and the Byzantine preoccupation with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] contributed to a cessation of large-scale [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine conflict]] for the next two decades.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of Byzantine empress [[Irene of Athens]] in October 802 and the accession of [[Nikephoros I]] in her place marked the start of a more violent phase in the long history of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]. Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1. Historical background}} Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike\u2014a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] source records that when he learned of Nikephoros's accession, a [[Elpidius (rebel)|Byzantine renegade]] warned the Abbasid governor of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] to \"throw away his [[silk]] and put on his armour\". In addition, the new emperor was determined to refill the treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=127, 130}}\n\n[[File:Solidus-Nicephorus I and Staraucius-sb1604.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Obverse and reverse of a medieval gold coin, showing the busts of a bearded crowned man and of a younger crowned man|Gold ''[[solidus (coin)|nomisma]]'' of Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (left) and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]] (right)]]\nIn retaliation for the cessation of tribute and the violation of the peace agreement concluded with Irene, Harun launched a raid under his son [[al-Qasim ibn Harun al-Rashid|al-Qasim]] in spring 803.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=238\u2013239}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=131}} Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced a large-scale revolt of the Byzantine army of Asia Minor under its commander-in-chief, [[Bardanes Tourkos]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph in person. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies faced one another for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle: Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters,{{efn|[[Al-Tabari]] and other Muslim sources record the texts, supposedly of Nikephoros' letter demanding the return of the tribute paid until then, and Harun's brief reply to Nikephoros, calling him \"the dog of the Byzantines\" (''kalb [[R\u00fbm|al-Rum]]''): \"O son of an infidel woman, I have read your letter, and the reply is what you will see, without you having to hear it.

Nikephoros set out to confront the Arabs, but was surprised and heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Krasos]], where he barely escaped with his life.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts or [[al-Awasim|''thugh\u016br'']] in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went. The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils, but the Byzantines marched on to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia. The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nAt the same time, another Byzantine force raided the [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n ''thugh\u016br'' and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Melitene]], while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in [[Cyprus]], which for over a century had been an Arab\u2013Byzantine [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{efn|In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] concluded an agreement whereby Cyprus became a neutral territory, its tax revenue shared between Byzantium and the Caliphate, and its ports open to both powers, including for military purposes against one another. Apart from a brief Byzantine reoccupation under [[Basil I]], this status lasted until 965, when the island was reincorporated into the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Cyprus\" (T. E. Gregory), pp. 567\u2013569}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}\n\nThis sudden resumption of Byzantine offensive activity greatly alarmed Harun, especially as he received reports that Nikephoros was planning similar attacks for the next year, which this time would aim at the full reoccupation of these frontier territories. As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]]. According to [[al-Tabari]], his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} These numbers are easily the largest ever recorded for the entire Abbasid era,{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} and about half as many as the estimated strength of the entire [[Byzantine army]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}} Although they\u2014and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] of 300,000 men\u2014are certainly exaggerated, they are nevertheless indicative of the size of the Abbasid force.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|pp=661, 662 (note 5)}}  At the same time, a naval force under his admiral [[Humayd ibn Ma'yuf al-Hajuri]] was prepared to raid Cyprus.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}}\n\n[[File:Arab-Byzantine frontier zone.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Geophysical map of eastern Anatolia and northern Syria, showing the main fortresses during the Arab\u2013Byzantine frontier wars|Map of the Byzantine\u2013Arab frontier zone in southeastern [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid campaign of 806 took place]]\nThe huge invasion army departed Harun's residence of [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria on 11 June 806, with the Caliph at its head. Al-Tabari reports that Harun put on a cap with the inscription \"Warrior for the Faith and Pilgrim\" (in Arabic, \"''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', ''[[hajj]]''\"). The Abbasids crossed Cilicia, where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt, and entered Byzantine [[Cappadocia]] through the [[Cilician Gates]]. Harun marched to [[Tyana]], which at the time seems to have been abandoned. There, he began to establish his base of operations, ordering [[Uqbah ibn Ja'far al-Khuza'i]] to refortify the town and erect a [[mosque]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=262\u2013263}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

According to al-Tabari,\n{{quote|[Harun] ordered the slave girl to be sought out; she was brought back, adorned with finery and installed on a seat in the tent in which he himself was lodging. The slave girl and the tent, together with its contents, vessels and fittings, were handed over to Nikephoros's envoy. He also sent to Nikephoros the perfume which he had requested, and he further sent to him dates, dishes of jellied sweets, raisins and healing drugs.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}}}\n\nNikephoros returned the favour by dispatching a horse laden with 50,000 silver coins, 100 [[satin]] garments, 200 garments of fine [[brocade]], 12 [[falcon]]s, four hunting dogs, and three more horses.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}} But as soon as the Arabs had withdrawn, the Emperor again restored the frontier forts and thereafter ceased the payment of tribute.

The larger summer raid under [[Harthama ibn A'yan]] was met by Nikephoros in person, and after an indecisive battle both sides retreated. The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]]. On his return, however, Humayd lost several ships to a storm, and on the Peloponnese, the Slavic revolt was put down after failing to capture the city of [[Patras]] during the siege of 805.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=147\u2013148}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=267\u2013268}} The failure of the year's Abbasid efforts were compounded by the outbreak of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]'s rebellion in Khurasan, which forced Harun to depart again for the East. The Caliph concluded a new truce, and another prisoner exchange was held at the Lamos in 808. Nikephoros was thus left with his gains, both the restored frontier fortifications and the cessation of tribute, intact.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=155}}\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Arabische Eroberung 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Multi-color map of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, showing the phases of Muslim expansion to the 10th century|Map of the [[spread of Islam]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and of the [[Muslim world]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphates, from the {{Interlanguage link|Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas|de|lt=''Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas''}} of [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] (1886)]]\n\nHarun's massive expedition achieved remarkably little in material terms.

Consequences}} According to the historian Warren Treadgold, if Harun had taken the advice offered by one of his lieutenants to proceed further west and sack a major city, he might have inflicted more long-lasting damage on Byzantium,{{efn|name=fn2}} but the Caliph's objectives were more limited: Harun was content with a show of force that would intimidate Nikephoros and prevent him from repeating the offensive of 805, and which bolstered his credentials as a champion of Islam.{{efn|name=fn1|In contrast with their Umayyad predecessors, the Abbasid caliphs pursued a conservative foreign policy. In general terms, they were content with the territorial limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or pre-emptive, meant to preserve their frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|p=302}} At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular were important for domestic consumption. The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=168\u2013174}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=146, 157\u2013174}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3. Consequences}}\n\nOn the other hand, the historian [[M. A. Shaban]] considers the campaign a \"limited success\" at best, and criticizes Harun's \"single-minded\" attention to the Byzantines as a \"totally misguided effort\". According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna]], the Abbasid civil war that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans. Indeed, the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major, centrally organized, Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=157}} Isolated raids and counter-raids continued at land as well as at sea, and, independently of the Abbasids, local Muslim leaders [[Emirate of Crete|conquered Crete]] and launched the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]] in the 820s.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=127\u2013128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=183, 219\u2013220, 248\u2013257}} Nevertheless, large-scale operations over the land border in eastern Anatolia between the two empires resumed only after the accession of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}), whose confrontations with the caliphs al-Ma'mun and [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}) culminated in the great invasions by al-Ma'mun in 830\u2013833, and the Sack of Amorium by al-Mu'tasim in 838.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=128\u2013131}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=272\u2013275, 278\u2013281, 292\u2013305}}\n\n[[File:Heraqla,SE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Photo of a mound of ruins in a barren field|View of the remnants of ''Hiraqla'', a victory monument erected by Harun after the campaign of 806]]\nThe longest-lasting impact of Harun's campaign is found in literature. Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence. Known as ''{{ill|Hiraqla|de|Heraqla}}'' in local tradition, apparently after Herakleia, it comprises a square structure with sides {{convert|100|m|ft}} long, surrounded by a circular wall about {{convert|500|m|ft}} in diameter, pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions. The main structure, built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun's orders in 806\u2013807, has four vaulted halls on the ground floor, and ramps leading to an upper storey, which was left incomplete on Harun's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death.{{sfn|Meinecke|1995|p=412}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{The History of al-Tabari | volume = 30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Michael | title = Aristocratic Violence and Holy War: Studies in the Jihad and the Arab\u2013Byzantine Frontier | year = 1996 | publisher = American Oriental Society | location = New Haven, Connecticut | isbn = 0-940490-11-0  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brooks | first=E.

These salts are typical ionic [[halide]]s, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from [[brine]] or [[sea water]]. In North America, magnesium chloride is produced primarily from [[Great Salt Lake]] brine. It is extracted in a similar process from the [[Dead Sea]] in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. Magnesium chloride, as the natural mineral [[bischofite]], is also extracted (by solution mining) out of ancient seabeds, for example, the [[Zechstein]] seabed in northwest Europe. Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater. [[Anhydrous]] magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale. Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available.\n\n==Structure, preparation, and general properties==\nMgCl<sub>2</sub> crystallizes in the [[cadmium chloride]] motif, which features octahedral Mg centers. Several hydrates are known with the formula MgCl<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>''x''</sub>, and each loses water at higher temperatures: ''x'' = 12 (\u221216.4&nbsp;\u00b0C), 8 (\u22123.4&nbsp;\u00b0C), 6 (116.7&nbsp;\u00b0C), 4 (181&nbsp;\u00b0C), 2 (about 300&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>Holleman, A.

When highways are treacherous due to icy conditions, magnesium chloride helps to prevent the ice bond, allowing [[snow]] plows to clear the roads more efficiently.\n\nMagnesium chloride is used in three ways for pavement ice control: Anti-icing, when maintenance professionals spread it onto roads before a snow storm to prevent snow from sticking and ice from forming; prewetting, which means a liquid formulation of magnesium chloride is sprayed directly onto salt as it is being spread onto roadway pavement, wetting the salt so that it sticks to the road; and pretreating, when magnesium chloride and salt are mixed together before they are loaded onto trucks and spread onto paved roads. Calcium chloride damages concrete twice as fast as magnesium chloride.<ref>Jain, J., Olek, J., Janusz, A., and Jozwiak-Niedzwiedzka, D., \"Effects of Deicing Salt Solutions on Physical Properties of Pavement Concretes\", Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 2290, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington, D.C., 2012, pp. 69-75. {{doi|10.3141/2290-09}}.</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Nutritional supplement}} Nutrition and medicine ===\nMagnesium chloride is used in [[nutraceutical]] and [[Magnesium (pharmaceutical preparation)|pharmaceutical preparations]].\n\n=== {{anchor|Culinary use}} Cuisine ===\nMagnesium chloride ([[E number|E511]]<ref name=ceua>{{cite web\n| last = [[Food Standard Agency]]\n| authorlink = \n| title = Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers\n| publisher = \n| date = \n| url = http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist\n| doi =\n| accessdate = 22 March 2010\n}}</ref>) is an important [[Coagulation|coagulant]] used in the preparation of [[tofu]] from [[soy milk]].

A few cases of [[oral administration|oral]] magnesium toxicity have been described in persons with normal renal function ingesting large amounts of magnesium salts, but it is rare. If a large amount of magnesium chloride is eaten, it will have effects similar to [[magnesium sulfate]], causing diarrhea, although the sulfate also contributes to the laxative effect in magnesium sulfate, so the effect from the chloride is not as severe.\n\n=== Plant toxicity ===\n\nChloride (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>) and magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) are both essential nutrients important for normal plant growth. Too much of either nutrient may harm a plant, although foliar chloride concentrations are more strongly related with foliar damage than magnesium. High concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> ions in the soil may be toxic or change water relationships such that the plant cannot easily accumulate water and nutrients. Once inside the plant, chloride moves through the water-conducting system and accumulates at the margins of leaves or needles, where dieback occurs first. Leaves are weakened or killed, which can lead to the death of the tree.<ref name=\"colostate1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07425.html |title=Publications \u2013 ExtensionExtension |publisher=Ext.colostate.edu |accessdate=2017-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924005210/http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07425.html |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Locomotive boiler problem==\nThe presence of dissolved magnesium chloride in the well water ([[Water well#Drilled wells|bore water]]) used in locomotive boilers on the [[Trans-Australian Railway]] caused serious and expensive maintenance problems during the steam era.

These salts are typical ionic [[halide]]s, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from [[brine]] or [[sea water]]. In North America, magnesium chloride is produced primarily from [[Great Salt Lake]] brine. It is extracted in a similar process from the [[Dead Sea]] in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. Magnesium chloride, as the natural mineral [[bischofite]], is also extracted (by solution mining) out of ancient seabeds, for example, the [[Zechstein]] seabed in northwest Europe. Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater. [[Anhydrous]] magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale. Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available.\n\n==Structure, preparation, and general properties==\nMgCl<sub>2</sub> crystallizes in the [[cadmium chloride]] motif, which features octahedral Mg centers. Several hydrates are known with the formula MgCl<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>''x''</sub>, and each loses water at higher temperatures: ''x'' = 12 (\u221216.4&nbsp;\u00b0C), 8 (\u22123.4&nbsp;\u00b0C), 6 (116.7&nbsp;\u00b0C), 4 (181&nbsp;\u00b0C), 2 (about 300&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>Holleman, A.

When highways are treacherous due to icy conditions, magnesium chloride helps to prevent the ice bond, allowing [[snow]] plows to clear the roads more efficiently.\n\nMagnesium chloride is used in three ways for pavement ice control: Anti-icing, when maintenance professionals spread it onto roads before a snow storm to prevent snow from sticking and ice from forming; prewetting, which means a liquid formulation of magnesium chloride is sprayed directly onto salt as it is being spread onto roadway pavement, wetting the salt so that it sticks to the road; and pretreating, when magnesium chloride and salt are mixed together before they are loaded onto trucks and spread onto paved roads. Calcium chloride damages concrete twice as fast as magnesium chloride.<ref>Jain, J., Olek, J., Janusz, A., and Jozwiak-Niedzwiedzka, D., \"Effects of Deicing Salt Solutions on Physical Properties of Pavement Concretes\", Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 2290, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington, D.C., 2012, pp. 69-75. {{doi|10.3141/2290-09}}.</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Nutritional supplement}} Nutrition and medicine ===\nMagnesium chloride is used in [[nutraceutical]] and [[Magnesium (pharmaceutical preparation)|pharmaceutical preparations]].\n\n=== {{anchor|Culinary use}} Cuisine ===\nMagnesium chloride ([[E number|E511]]<ref name=ceua>{{cite web\n| last = [[Food Standard Agency]]\n| authorlink = \n| title = Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers\n| publisher = \n| date = \n| url = http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist\n| doi =\n| accessdate = 22 March 2010\n}}</ref>) is an important [[Coagulation|coagulant]] used in the preparation of [[tofu]] from [[soy milk]].

A few cases of [[oral administration|oral]] magnesium toxicity have been described in persons with normal renal function ingesting large amounts of magnesium salts, but it is rare. If a large amount of magnesium chloride is eaten, it will have effects similar to [[magnesium sulfate]], causing diarrhea, although the sulfate also contributes to the laxative effect in magnesium sulfate, so the effect from the chloride is not as severe.\n\n=== Plant toxicity ===\n\nChloride (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>) and magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) are both essential nutrients important for normal plant growth. Too much of either nutrient may harm a plant, although foliar chloride concentrations are more strongly related with foliar damage than magnesium. High concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> ions in the soil may be toxic or change water relationships such that the plant cannot easily accumulate water and nutrients. Once inside the plant, chloride moves through the water-conducting system and accumulates at the margins of leaves or needles, where dieback occurs first. Leaves are weakened or killed, which can lead to the death of the tree.<ref name=\"colostate1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07425.html |title=Publications \u2013 ExtensionExtension |publisher=Ext.colostate.edu |accessdate=2017-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924005210/http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07425.html |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Locomotive boiler problem==\nThe presence of dissolved magnesium chloride in the well water ([[Water well#Drilled wells|bore water]]) used in locomotive boilers on the [[Trans-Australian Railway]] caused serious and expensive maintenance problems during the steam era.

Namely, in 1989 a study was done by John H. Caruso in which 21 specimens of Chaunacid fish were collected off the western coast of Australia, many of which were collected at approximately -30\u00b0 latitude, and approximately 90\u00b0 longitude. These specimen were from the genus Bathychaunax, which before this study only contained 2 other species: ''B. coloratus'' of the Eastern Pacific, and ''B. roseus'' from the Western Atlantic. The new species of Bathychaunax was found at depths between 1320m and 1760 m.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Caruso|first=John H.|date=November 1989|title=A Review of the Indo-Pacific Members of the Deep-Water Chaunacid Anglerfish Genus Bathychaunax, with the Description of a New Species from the Eastern Indian Ocean (Pisces: Lophiiformes)|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1989/00000045/00000003/art00003#|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|volume=45(3)|pages=574\u2013579|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, in 2015 an article was published indicating that new specemins from the genus Chaunacops were found off the coasts of Australia and New Caledonia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn addition, it was found that the ''Chaunacops coloratus'' are also often found near \"manganese-encrusted volcanic talus slopes\". The fish were observed to often have one of their pectoral fins in sediment and another one on a rock in order to make it seem as though they were wedged between two substrates. The average oxygen concentration was found to be about 1.59 ml/L at the depths they were found and the average temperature was about 1.68&nbsp;\u00b0C. Salinity in their habitats did not change much and was found to be an average of 34.64 psu.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Anatomy ==\n\n==== ''Chaunocops spinosis'' ====\nUpon collection and examination of this species, it is observed to have several distinct physical attributes. One trait is the fine dermal spinules, along with simple and bifurcate dermal spinules, covering the body. It also has four pectoral lateral-line neuromasts, which are sensory organs characteristic to fish and aquatic organisms. It has a greyish mouth, and semi-transparent, light-greyish skin. Inside the mouth are several rows of teeth. There are three or four rows of small canine teeth on the upper jaw, and three rows of the same on the lower jaw. The skin of the head, belly, and most of gill chamber is dark blue, and it has a relatively short tail. As for the overall body structure, body is resemblant of a tadople, with a more globular shape in the anterior which tapers in the posterior. The eyes are covered by transparent skin and are very small.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== ''Chaunacops melanostomus'' ====\nAnother species in the same genus was collected with similar traits to the above species, but some noticable differences. The spinules are distributed widely throughout the body, similar to ''C. spinosis'', but are simple with a large base (different from that of ''C. spinosis'' which has simple as well as bifurcate dermal spindles). They also differ slightly in color. The inside of the mouth, the head, the gill chamber, and the anterior portion of the body are dark brown to black. The dorsal side of the body, and the caudal fin are light brown, and becomes more lightly colored going towards the posterior end. Also, instead of having three or four rows of teeth, ''C. melanostomus'' has two rows on both jaws. The general body plan, however, is virtually the same, resembling a tadpole, with a more globular shape in the anterior which tapers in the posterior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== ''Chaunacops coloratus'' ====\nThe ''Chaunacops coloratus'' are another species that were discovered and are known for their bright red and blue colors. It was found that the blue ''C. coloratus'' often had an average length of about 110&nbsp;mm, whereas the red specimen had an average length of 184&nbsp;mm. It was observed that the specimen begin in a transparent larval form, then become blue, and eventually reach their adult red color. As for predation, it is hypothesized that the specimen turning red is advantageous for ambushing predators that use bioluminescent light to attract possible prey, since the red coloration of this specimen would conceal the predator and make it invisible.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Movement ==\n\n==== ''C. coloratus'' ====\nThrough observations made by an ROV, it was found that the ''C. coloratus'' swim vertically with their head oriented upwards. While in rapid ascent, the specimen will use their dorsal, caudal, and anal fins to propel themselves upwards and tuck the rest of their fins in close to their body. The observation collected found that the specimen had average velocities of 0.036&nbsp;m/s and 0.021&nbsp;m/s while ascending. As for maneuvering across the ocean floor, observations found that the specimen use their pectoral and pelvic fins. In order to perform this \"walking,\" they use their dorsal fin from one side to side, then thrust their caudal fin repeatedly, and then maneuver using their pectoral and pelvic fins. It was also observed that these specimen are capable of walking backwards using their pectoral and pelvic fins.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Breathing ==\nFish of the family Chaunacidae have been shown to have slow ventilatory cycles in which the fish exhales 20-30% of their body volume of water. Upon inhalation, Chaunacidae can endure long periods of time maintaining a fully inflated gill chamber, sometimes up to 245 seconds which confers many potential advantages for fish of this family. Chaunacidae have been found to contain a specialized apparatus containing adductor muscles that can maintain its ventilatory cycle, and control the volume of water entering and exiting. These muscles are cross-hatched, and function to not only inhale and exhale, but to prevent any leakage out of the gills.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nDue to the high-volume and slow ventilatory cycle, Chaunacidae are able to be majorly energy efficient as it requires less energy to push water across the surface of their gills. Because of this, Chaunacidae are able to go without prey for long periods of time, and remain mostly sedentary.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThere are many other hypotheses of advantages conferred by the breathing cycle of Chaunacidae. Due to the long periods of high-volume inhalation, Chaunacidae makes little disturbance of lateral line systems, allowing for better hunting and avoidance of predators. In addition, the maximally filled mouth of the Chaunacidae is often intimidating to predators, making it a defense mechanism that the fish can use much like the Pufferfish.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Diet ==\nChaunacidae are known to be mostly sedentary fish, and spend most of their time dormant on the seafloor. Because of their energy efficient way of ventilation, Chaunacidae are able to go long periods of time with little food. In a diet study, ''Chaunax fimbriatus'' was found to contain a stomach that contained many different prey, showing that Chaunacidae are opportunistic hunters that will eat most anything it can on the seafloor.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nChaunacidae are also steady hunters, as they are able to maintain relatively low movement. Due to their gill chambers, Chaunacidae are able to remain still enough until their prey is within distance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nChaunacidae are a family of fish that arise from the order Lophiiformes and of the class Actinopterygii. Chaunacidae contain the genera of both ''Chaunacops'' and ''Chaunax''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nAs of recent years, sea toads have become the target of a viral meme, particularly popular on Twitter and Reddit. The meme is a pun on the word 'despacito', which was brought to the limelight after the release of a song with the same name by Luis Fonsi.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1472882}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sea Toad}}\n[[Category:Chaunacidae| ]]\n[[Category:Deep sea fish]]\n", "text_old": "{{Automatic_taxobox\n| image = Sea toad (Chaunacops cf. melanostomus).jpg\n| image_caption = ''Chaunacops cf. melanostomus''\n| taxon = Chaunacidae\n| authority = \n| subdivision_ranks = Genera\n| subdivision = ''[[Chaunacops]]''<br/>\n''[[Chaunax]]''\n}}\nThe '''sea toads''' and '''coffinfishes''' are a family of deep-sea [[anglerfish]]es known as the '''Chaunacidae'''.<ref>{{FishBase family | family = Chaunacidae | month = February | year = 2006}}</ref>\n\nThese are bottom-dwelling fishes found on the [[continental slope]]s of the [[Atlantic]], [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], and [[Pacific Ocean]]s,<ref name=EoF>{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N.|author1=Bertelsen, E.  |author2=Pietsch, T.W. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 140|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}</ref> at depths to at least {{convert|2460|m|abbr=on}}.

Namely, in 1989 a study was done by John H. Caruso in which 21 specimens of Chaunacid fish were collected off the western coast of Australia, many of which were collected at approximately -30\u00b0 latitude, and approximately 90\u00b0 longitude. These specimen were from the genus Bathychaunax, which before this study only contained 2 other species: ''B. coloratus'' of the Eastern Pacific, and ''B. roseus'' from the Western Atlantic. The new species of Bathychaunax was found at depths between 1320m and 1760 m.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Caruso|first=John H.|date=November 1989|title=A Review of the Indo-Pacific Members of the Deep-Water Chaunacid Anglerfish Genus Bathychaunax, with the Description of a New Species from the Eastern Indian Ocean (Pisces: Lophiiformes)|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1989/00000045/00000003/art00003#|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|volume=45(3)|pages=574\u2013579|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, in 2015 an article was published indicating that new specemins from the genus Chaunacops were found off the coasts of Australia and New Caledonia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn addition, it was found that the ''Chaunacops coloratus'' are also often found near \"manganese-encrusted volcanic talus slopes\". The fish were observed to often have one of their pectoral fins in sediment and another one on a rock in order to make it seem as though they were wedged between two substrates. The average oxygen concentration was found to be about 1.59 ml/L at the depths they were found and the average temperature was about 1.68&nbsp;\u00b0C. Salinity in their habitats did not change much and was found to be an average of 34.64 psu.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Anatomy ==\n\n==== ''Chaunocops spinosis'' ====\nUpon collection and examination of this species, it is observed to have several distinct physical attributes. One trait is the fine dermal spinules, along with simple and bifurcate dermal spinules, covering the body. It also has four pectoral lateral-line neuromasts, which are sensory organs characteristic to fish and aquatic organisms. It has a greyish mouth, and semi-transparent, light-greyish skin. Inside the mouth are several rows of teeth. There are three or four rows of small canine teeth on the upper jaw, and three rows of the same on the lower jaw. The skin of the head, belly, and most of gill chamber is dark blue, and it has a relatively short tail. As for the overall body structure, body is resemblant of a tadople, with a more globular shape in the anterior which tapers in the posterior. The eyes are covered by transparent skin and are very small.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== ''Chaunacops melanostomus'' ====\nAnother species in the same genus was collected with similar traits to the above species, but some noticable differences. The spinules are distributed widely throughout the body, similar to ''C. spinosis'', but are simple with a large base (different from that of ''C. spinosis'' which has simple as well as bifurcate dermal spindles). They also differ slightly in color. The inside of the mouth, the head, the gill chamber, and the anterior portion of the body are dark brown to black. The dorsal side of the body, and the caudal fin are light brown, and becomes more lightly colored going towards the posterior end. Also, instead of having three or four rows of teeth, ''C. melanostomus'' has two rows on both jaws. The general body plan, however, is virtually the same, resembling a tadpole, with a more globular shape in the anterior which tapers in the posterior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== ''Chaunacops coloratus'' ====\nThe ''Chaunacops coloratus'' are another species that were discovered and are known for their bright red and blue colors. It was found that the blue ''C. coloratus'' often had an average length of about 110&nbsp;mm, whereas the red specimen had an average length of 184&nbsp;mm. It was observed that the specimen begin in a transparent larval form, then become blue, and eventually reach their adult red color. As for predation, it is hypothesized that the specimen turning red is advantageous for ambushing predators that use bioluminescent light to attract possible prey, since the red coloration of this specimen would conceal the predator and make it invisible.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Movement ==\n\n==== ''C. coloratus'' ====\nThrough observations made by an ROV, it was found the the ''C. coloratus'' swim vertically with their head oriented upwards. While in rapid ascent, the specimen will use their dorsal, caudal, and anal fins to propel themselves upwards and tuck the rest of their fins in close to their body. The observation collected found that the specimen had average velocities of 0.036&nbsp;m/s and 0.021&nbsp;m/s while ascending. As for maneuvering across the ocean floor, observations found that the specimen use their pectoral and pelvic fins. In order to perform this \"walking,\" they use their dorsal fin from one side to side, then thrust their caudal fin repeatedly, and then maneuver using their pectoral and pelvic fins. It was also observed that these specimen are capable of walking backwards using their pectoral and pelvic fins.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Breathing ==\nFish of the family Chaunacidae have been shown to have slow ventilatory cycles in which the fish exhales 20-30% of their body volume of water. Upon inhalation, Chaunacidae can endure long periods of time maintaining a fully inflated gill chamber, sometimes up to 245 seconds which confers many potential advantages for fish of this family. Chaunacidae have been found to contain a specialized apparatus containing adductor muscles that can maintain its ventilatory cycle, and control the volume of water entering and exiting. These muscles are cross-hatched, and function to not only inhale and exhale, but to prevent any leakage out of the gills.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nDue to the high-volume and slow ventilatory cycle, Chaunacidae are able to be majorly energy efficient as it requires less energy to push water across the surface of their gills. Because of this, Chaunacidae are able to go without prey for long periods of time, and remain mostly sedentary.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThere are many other hypotheses of advantages conferred by the breathing cycle of Chaunacidae. Due to the long periods of high-volume inhalation, Chaunacidae makes little disturbance of lateral line systems, allowing for better hunting and avoidance of predators. In addition, the maximally filled mouth of the Chaunacidae is often intimidating to predators, making it a defense mechanism that the fish can use much like the Pufferfish.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Diet ==\nChaunacidae are known to be mostly sedentary fish, and spend most of their time dormant on the seafloor. Because of their energy efficient way of ventilation, Chaunacidae are able to go long periods of time with little food. In a diet study, ''Chaunax fimbriatus'' was found to contain a stomach that contained many different prey, showing that Chaunacidae are opportunistic hunters that will eat most anything it can on the seafloor.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nChaunacidae are also steady hunters, as they are able to maintain relatively low movement. Due to their gill chambers, Chaunacidae are able to remain still enough until their prey is within distance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nChaunacidae are a family of fish that arise from the order Lophiiformes and of the class Actinopterygii. Chaunacidae contain the genera of both ''Chaunacops'' and ''Chaunax''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nAs of recent years, sea toads have become the target of a viral meme, particularly popular on Twitter and Reddit. The meme is a pun on the word 'despacito', which was brought to the limelight after the release of a song with the same name by Luis Fonsi.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1472882}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sea Toad}}\n[[Category:Chaunacidae| ]]\n[[Category:Deep sea fish]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word reworded", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_toad"}
