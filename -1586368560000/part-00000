There are several known varieties of banthas in existence, including the common bantha (Bantha majorus), the smaller, shy dwarf bantha, and the rangier, slender dune bantha. One specific subtype of bantha is the [[Kashyyyk]] greyclimber, which differs in that the greyclimber has massive cranial bone plates in place of horns; it has also adapted to climbing through the evolution of articulated toes that can grip wroshyr trees. Banthas can be seen in video games and the movie ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''. They were commonly used on Tatooine by the Tusken Raiders. The Tusken raiders form symbiotic bonds with banthas. When the Tusken Raiders reach the age of 7, a bantha of the same gender is ceremoniously given to the youngling, as its partner in life. When Tusken Raiders marry, the couple's banthas mate. When the Tusken Raiders have offspring, the banthas often produce an offspring of the same gender at the same time.

This large beast has [[phosphorescent]] skin, streaked with brown, and has a cluster of several eyes on one end.\n\n===Woolamander===\nA '''woolamander''' is an [[ape]]-like animal native to [[Yavin IV]].  It has a blue furred body, a long, multi-colored tail, a prominent belly, and a multi-colored face. Its chief enemy is the syntaril.\n\n===Wolf===\n====Garral====\n'''Garrals''' are [[wolf]]-like creatures that live in the forests of [[Wayland (Star Wars)|Wayland]] and [[Cholganna]].\n====Loth-wolf====\nThe '''Loth-wolf''' is a near-legendary, [[the Force|Force]]-sensitive large canid native to [[Lothal]], known since prehistoric times on that world by its inhabitants.

The worms are blind, but can detect motion. They appear in Jedi Knight and Jedi Academy games.\n\n====Conduit worm====\nThe '''conduit worm''' is a long [[worm]] that lives in the [[electrical wiring]] channels of underground [[Coruscant]] and thrives on the [[electrical current]]s sent through them. They may also be attracted to the electric activity in brains, if they do not find a stronger electrical power source to feed on.

They feed by absorbing an asteroid's minerals through their roots. Smaller space slugs also devour [[#Mynock|mynocks]] (in large space slugs, consumed mynocks are not digested and instead become parasites within the space slug). Large space slugs may also consume starships and have been known to eat sections of [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] [[Star Destroyers]] that flew too close. The burrow of a space slug is called a \"caysh\".<ref name=\"jedidictionary\"/> They first appeared in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).<ref>{{Star Wars Databank|subject=space-slug|text=Space Slug}}</ref>\n===Worrt===\n'''Worrts''' are [[frog]]-like creatures native to [[Tatooine]]. They feed on mostly insects and rodents and catch prey by sitting stationary in the sand and using their long tongues to catch and wrap around passing animals. Jabba the Hutt kept a number of worrts for [[pest control]]. One is briefly seen in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' outside [[Jabba the Hutt|Jabba]]'s palace. It catches an animal with its tongue, swallows it, and [[burp]]s. Many consider this to be the first major introduction of [[George Lucas]]'s childish humor into Star Wars movies, and a prelude to [[Jar Jar Binks]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} They are sometimes confused with [[frog-dog]]s.\n\n===Wraid===\n'''Wraids''' are large, [[lizard]]-like creatures that live and are hunted for their armored head plates on the desert planet of [[Tatooine]]. There is also a subspecies on Korriban.\n\n===Wyrwulves===\n'''Wyrwulves''' are six-legged, [[Canidae|canine]] animals that were in fact the children of the [[List of Star Wars races (A-E)#Codru-Ji|Codru-Ji]] race. When a wyrwulf reaches [[puberty]], it encases itself in a [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]], from which a Codru-Ji adult emerges several weeks later. They can be found on [[Munto Codru]].\n\n==Y==\n\n===Yeltz===\n'''Yeltz''' is an amphibious species that resides in the artificial outpost planets of the Lupania ring. No one but [[Yaddle]] has seen the creature, and thus it is still regarded as a legend. They are thought to possess the ability to turn transparent under water. When submerged, they are fearsome predators, but when on-land, they are shy and tamable.\n\n===Yeomet===\n'''Yeomets''' are trash-eating [[quadruped]]s that live on artificial habitats, like space stations or large [[capital ship]]s. They are able to eat almost any form of [[matter]], thanks to a special digestive [[enzyme]] triggered by strong [[electromagnetic radiation]]. They carry [[disease]]. <ref name=\"CotG\" />\n\n===Yorik coral===\n'''Yorik coral''' was the primary shipbuilding material of the [[Yuuzhan Vong]]. It was grown on-planet in the shape of a ship. Later, [[symbiotic]] creatures were implanted or grown within it to form the ship's functions. The completed yorik ship had a [[nervous system]] that controlled and coordinated the various functions, and a [[circulatory system]] that sustained them.\n\n===Ysalamiri===\n'''Ysalamiri''' are furry [[salamander|salamander-like]] beings that live on [[Myrkr]]. They have the unique property of repelling [[the Force]], rendering all Force powers within their [[sphere of influence]] void; for this reason, they are prominently used by [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]] in his campaigns against the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]]. The supposed reason for the Force bubble is that it acts as a way to hide from the other unique carnivores of Myrkr that use the Force to hunt down prey, such as the [[#Vornskr|vornskr]]. The term \"bubble\" is particularly apt because, like water bubbles underwater, multiple ysalamiri's bubbles reinforce each other instead of overlapping. Because of this, large sections of Myrkr are completely removed from the Force.\n\n==Z==\n\n===Zakkeg===\n'''Zakkegs''' are large beasts that reside on [[Dxun]]. They are relatively solitary creatures, with thick hides, and covered in spikes and horns. Along with their tough hide for defense, they are also immune to most Force powers. Zakkeg are tough, and are a good challenge for [[Mandalorian]]s.\n\n===Zillo Beast===\nThe '''Zillo Beast''' is a lengthy creature sporting the unique feature of five limbs, the fifth protruding from behind its shoulder blades. It first appeared in the second season of the popular Cartoon Network series [[Star Wars]]: [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]], toward the end of the season. It was the dominant predator on [[Malastare]] before the Dugs wiped them out using various methods, including drilling for fuel that poisons them. Though they were rendered extinct, rumors spread of a surviving Zillo that would bring about their apocalypse. While the Republic engaged in a battle against droids on the planet, they tested a new weapon (a type of E.M.P) over the hollow ground concealing the last Zillo Beast in its cave. Destroying the droids and accidentally opening up the ground leading below, the Dugs immediately wanted to kill the five-story high creature, the last of its kind. Seeing its armour was resistant to most projectiles, including lightsabres, the Republic tricked the Dugs into thinking that the beast perished and instead transported it to [[Coruscant]] for study. Before study was over, Palpatine ordered the beast to be killed anyway, but the Zillo Beast broke from its prison to hunt Palpatine down in the nearby Senate building. Because of this and the danger it posed to the citizens of Coruscant, the beast was, shortly after escaping, killed using a toxin gas converted from Malastare fuel. At the end of the episode, [[Palpatine]] informs doctor Sionver Boll he wants the beast cloned.\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>\n  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how\n  to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags, and the template below\n</nowiki>-->\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n{{cite book|title=The Illustrated Star Wars Universe|last=Anderson|first=Kevin J.|authorlink=Kevin J.

There are several known varieties of banthas in existence, including the common bantha (Bantha majorus), the smaller, shy dwarf bantha, and the rangier, slender dune bantha. One specific subtype of bantha is the [[Kashyyyk]] greyclimber, which differs in that the greyclimber has massive cranial bone plates in place of horns; it has also adapted to climbing through the evolution of articulated toes that can grip wroshyr trees. Banthas can be seen in video games and the movie ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''. They were commonly used on Tatooine by the Tusken Raiders. The Tusken raiders form symbiotic bonds with banthas. When the Tusken Raiders reach the age of 7, a bantha of the same gender is ceremoniously given to the youngling, as its partner in life. When Tusken Raiders marry, the couple's banthas mate. When the Tusken Raiders have offspring, the banthas often produce an offspring of the same gender at the same time.

Their white fur allows wampas to blend-in with Hoth's blinding [[blizzards]], enabling them to catch their prey completely unaware. Once they have made their kill, wampas drag the carcasses back to their icy lair, where they suspend them from the ceiling until ready to eat them. Due to the extreme temperatures of Hoth and the [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] nature of the wampa, the creatures are difficult to track on radar. A similar species is believed to inhabit the planet [[Gall (Star Wars)|Gall]], in the Outer Rim.\n\nThe wampa made its first appearance in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), as a predator that attacks Luke and eats his tauntaun.

Many space slugs have been found in [[Hoth]]'s asteroid field,{{sfn|Anderson|1995|pp=108\u20139}} some reaching thousands of meters (feet) in length, up to a recorded maximum around {{convert|1000|m}}, although most are much smaller at around {{convert|10|m}}. They feed by absorbing an asteroid's minerals through their roots. Smaller space slugs also devour [[#Mynock|mynocks]] (in large space slugs, consumed mynocks are not digested and instead become parasites within the space slug). Large space slugs may also consume starships and have been known to eat sections of [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] [[Star Destroyers]] that flew too close.

They feed on mostly insects and rodents and catch prey by sitting stationary in the sand and using their long tongues to catch and wrap around passing animals. Jabba the Hutt kept a number of worrts for [[pest control]]. One is briefly seen in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' outside [[Jabba the Hutt|Jabba]]'s palace. It catches an animal with its tongue, swallows it, and [[burp]]s. Many consider this to be the first major introduction of [[George Lucas]]'s childish humor into Star Wars movies, and a prelude to [[Jar Jar Binks]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} They are sometimes confused with [[frog-dog]]s.\n\n===Wraid===\n'''Wraids''' are large, [[lizard]]-like creatures that live and are hunted for their armored head plates on the desert planet of [[Tatooine]]. There is also a subspecies on Korriban.\n\n===Wyrwulves===\n'''Wyrwulves''' are six-legged, [[Canidae|canine]] animals that were in fact the children of the [[List of Star Wars races (A-E)#Codru-Ji|Codru-Ji]] race. When a wyrwulf reaches [[puberty]], it encases itself in a [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]], from which a Codru-Ji adult emerges several weeks later. They can be found on [[Munto Codru]].\n\n==Y==\n\n===Yeltz===\n'''Yeltz''' is an amphibious species that resides in the artificial outpost planets of the Lupania ring. No one but [[Yaddle]] has seen the creature, and thus it is still regarded as a legend. They are thought to possess the ability to turn transparent under water. When submerged, they are fearsome predators, but when on-land, they are shy and tamable.\n\n===Yeomet===\n'''Yeomets''' are trash-eating [[quadruped]]s that live on artificial habitats, like space stations or large [[capital ship]]s. They are able to eat almost any form of [[matter]], thanks to a special digestive [[enzyme]] triggered by strong [[electromagnetic radiation]]. They carry [[disease]]. <ref name=\"CotG\" />\n\n===Yorik coral===\n'''Yorik coral''' was the primary shipbuilding material of the [[Yuuzhan Vong]]. It was grown on-planet in the shape of a ship. Later, [[symbiotic]] creatures were implanted or grown within it to form the ship's functions. The completed yorik ship had a [[nervous system]] that controlled and coordinated the various functions, and a [[circulatory system]] that sustained them.\n\n===Ysalamiri===\n'''Ysalamiri''' are furry [[salamander|salamander-like]] beings that live on [[Myrkr]]. They have the unique property of repelling [[the Force]], rendering all Force powers within their [[sphere of influence]] void; for this reason, they are prominently used by [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]] in his campaigns against the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]]. The supposed reason for the Force bubble is that it acts as a way to hide from the other unique carnivores of Myrkr that use the Force to hunt down prey, such as the [[#Vornskr|vornskr]]. The term \"bubble\" is particularly apt because, like water bubbles underwater, multiple ysalamiri's bubbles reinforce each other instead of overlapping. Because of this, large sections of Myrkr are completely removed from the Force.\n\n==Z==\n\n===Zakkeg===\n'''Zakkegs''' are large beasts that reside on [[Dxun]]. They are relatively solitary creatures, with thick hides, and covered in spikes and horns. Along with their tough hide for defense, they are also immune to most Force powers. Zakkeg are tough, and are a good challenge for [[Mandalorian]]s.\n\n===Zillo Beast===\nThe '''Zillo Beast''' is a lengthy creature sporting the unique feature of five limbs, the fifth protruding from behind its shoulder blades. It first appeared in the second season of the popular Cartoon Network series [[Star Wars]]: [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]], toward the end of the season. It was the dominant predator on [[Malastare]] before the Dugs wiped them out using various methods, including drilling for fuel that poisons them. Though they were rendered extinct, rumors spread of a surviving Zillo that would bring about their apocalypse. While the Republic engaged in a battle against droids on the planet, they tested a new weapon (a type of E.M.P) over the hollow ground concealing the last Zillo Beast in its cave. Destroying the droids and accidentally opening up the ground leading below, the Dugs immediately wanted to kill the five-story high creature, the last of its kind. Seeing its armour was resistant to most projectiles, including lightsabres, the Republic tricked the Dugs into thinking that the beast perished and instead transported it to [[Coruscant]] for study. Before study was over, Palpatine ordered the beast to be killed anyway, but the Zillo Beast broke from its prison to hunt Palpatine down in the nearby Senate building. Because of this and the danger it posed to the citizens of Coruscant, the beast was, shortly after escaping, killed using a toxin gas converted from Malastare fuel. At the end of the episode, [[Palpatine]] informs doctor Sionver Boll he wants the beast cloned.\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>\n  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how\n  to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags, and the template below\n</nowiki>-->\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n{{cite book|title=The Illustrated Star Wars Universe|last=Anderson|first=Kevin J.|authorlink=Kevin J.

The place was then known as Pilot Knob or Waintown. The settlement gradually acquired a few amenities in the late 1800s: a school in 1875, a [[Baptist]] church in 1876, and a [[post office]] in 1878. The community was formally founded and renamed Argyle in 1881, after the Texas and Pacific [[railroad]] built a track through the area. Some believe a railroad surveyor named the town after a garden in [[France]]. However, others believe the town to be named after the region of [[Argyll]] in [[Scotland]]. Also around this time was when [[Sam Bass (outlaw)|Sam Bass]], an infamous outlaw who stole $60,000 in gold coins from the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], was rumored to have stashed the gold in a cave. Sam Bass died when he was 27, and it was rumored he never lived to retrieve the gold.\n\nGrowth was very slow during the nineteenth century, and by 1890 Argyle only had a population of 148. The town did boast several agriculture-related industries, such as [[grist mill]]s, general stores, and a [[cotton gin]]. In 1885 Argyle built a two-story brick school, and population grew until it reached 238 in 1930. A bank was also established in 1906, a little red brick building with a drugstore in the front. The bank wasn't around long before it was robbed in 1912. The robbers made away with $1700 and were never caught. Electricity and telephone service became available in the mid-1930s.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] took its toll on the Argyle area, and the population declined to only ninety in 1950. Argyle incorporated as a separate city on September 19, 1960, with M.H. Wilson as the first mayor. Gradually the town grew in population as more people from the [[Dallas-Fort Worth]] area discovered its rural charm. By the 1970s a number of retail establishments were located in Argyle, and the population reached 1,575 in 1990, and doubled from that figure to 3,282 at the 2010 census. The high rate of growth is expected to continue as part of the general development of northern areas in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\n==Geography==\nArgyle is located at {{coord|33|6|59|N|97|11|8|W|type:city}} (33.116422, -97.185461).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|29.6|km2|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|29.5|km2|disp=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqkm|disp=flip|2}}, or 0.41%, is water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 12, 2020 |title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Argyle city, Texas |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder |accessdate=June 28, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 443\n|1980= 1111\n|1990= 1575\n|2000= 2365\n|2010= 3282\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=4204\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |archivedate=April 26, 2015 }}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 3,282 people, 1,083 households, and 925 families residing in the town.

The place was then known as Pilot Knob or Waintown. The settlement gradually acquired a few amenities in the late 1800s: a school in 1875, a [[Baptist]] church in 1876, and a [[post office]] in 1878. The community was formally founded and renamed Argyle in 1881, after the Texas and Pacific [[railroad]] built a track through the area. Some believe a railroad surveyor named the town after a garden in [[France]]. However, others believe the town to be named after the region of [[Argyll]] in [[Scotland]]. Also around this time was when [[Sam Bass (outlaw)|Sam Bass]], an infamous outlaw who stole $60,000 in gold coins from the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], was rumored to have stashed the gold in a cave. Sam Bass died when he was 27, and it was rumored he never lived to retrieve the gold.\n\nGrowth was very slow during the nineteenth century, and by 1890 Argyle only had a population of 148. The town did boast several agriculture-related industries, such as [[grist mill]]s, general stores, and a [[cotton gin]]. In 1885 Argyle built a two-story brick school, and population grew until it reached 238 in 1930. A bank was also established in 1906, a little red brick building with a drugstore in the front. The bank wasn't around long before it was robbed in 1912. The robbers made away with $1700 and were never caught. Electricity and telephone service became available in the mid-1930s.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] took its toll on the Argyle area, and the population declined to only ninety in 1950. Argyle incorporated as a separate city on September 19, 1960, with M.H. Wilson as the first mayor. Gradually the town grew in population as more people from the [[Dallas-Fort Worth]] area discovered its rural charm. By the 1970s a number of retail establishments were located in Argyle, and the population reached 1,575 in 1990, and doubled from that figure to 3,282 at the 2010 census. The high rate of growth is expected to continue as part of the general development of northern areas in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\n==Geography==\nArgyle is located at {{coord|33|6|59|N|97|11|8|W|type:city}} (33.116422, -97.185461).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|29.6|km2|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|29.5|km2|disp=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqkm|disp=flip|2}}, or 0.41%, is water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 12, 2020 |title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Argyle city, Texas |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder |accessdate=June 28, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 443\n|1980= 1111\n|1990= 1575\n|2000= 2365\n|2010= 3282\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=4204\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |archivedate=April 26, 2015 }}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 3,282 people, 1,083 households, and 925 families residing in the town.
