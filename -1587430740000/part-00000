The brigade was first formed in early 1912 following the introduction of the [[Conscription in Australia|compulsory training scheme]]. Later, as part of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] and saw action during [[World War I]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as part of the [[First Australian Imperial Force]]. In the interwar years, the brigade was re-raised with its headquarters in Brisbane. During [[World War II]], it undertook garrison and defensive duties in north Queensland before deploying to [[Dutch New Guinea]] in 1943. In 1944\u20131945, the brigade took part in the fighting against the Japanese on [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]]. In the postwar era, the 11th Brigade was raised and disbanded several times, before being raised in Townsville in 1987, where its headquarters is currently located. It forms part of the [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]], and consists of units based across Queensland and New South Wales. \n\n==History==\nThe 11th Brigade traces its origins to 1912, when it was formed as a Militia brigade as part of the introduction of the [[Conscription in Australia|compulsory training scheme]], assigned to the [[2nd Military District (Australia)|2nd Military District]]. The brigade's constituent units were spread across various locations in New South Wales including [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]], [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]], [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Parkes, New South Wales|Parkes]], [[Dubbo, New South Wales|Dubbo]], [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], [[Wagga Wagga]] and [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]].{{sfn|Australian Military Forces|1912|p=19}} During World War I, the 11th Brigade was raised in early 1916 as part of the [[First Australian Imperial Force]]. Forming part of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]],{{sfn|Palazzo|2002|p=1}} the brigade was formed in Australia during the period shortly after the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] when the AIF was being expanded prior to its commitment to the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. On formation, the brigade consisted of four infantry battalions: the [[41st Battalion (Australia)|41st]], [[42nd Battalion (Australia)|42nd]], [[43rd Battalion (Australia)|43rd]] and [[44th Battalion (Australia)|44th]].{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=42}} Of these, the first two were drawn from Queensland, while the 43rd was recruited mainly from South Australia and the 44th came from Western Australia. In addition to these battalions, the brigade was supported by the 11th Field Ambulance, the 11th Trench Mortar Battery and the 11th Machine Gun Company (later part of the [[3rd Machine Gun Battalion (Australia)|3rd Machine Gun Battalion]]).<ref name=Digger>{{cite web |url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-conflicts-periods/ww1/1aif/3div/11bde/11th_brigade_aif.htm |title=11th Brigade |author=Harris, Ted |work=Digger History |accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hamel (AWM E02690).jpg|thumb|left|Australian troops from the 11th Brigade, with US troops, during the Battle of Hamel, July 1918]]\n\nFollowing the brigade's establishment, a brief period of training was undertaken in Queensland until May 1916 when the formation embarked for the United Kingdom where they concentrated with other elements of the 3rd Division on [[Salisbury Plain]] for further training after July 1916.

The first store opened on 24 November 1979 in [[Munich]]. By 1985, nine other stores had opened near Munich. \n\nIn 1988 Kaufhof Warenhaus AG acquired a 54 percent majority in the holding company of the media stores founded in 1979. In 1989 expansion began in neighboring countries. Media Markt took over the competing retail chain Saturn in 1990, in which [[Kaufhof]] was already involved. In 1996 Kaufhof Holding, [[Metro Cash & Carry]], Deutsche SB-Kauf AG and the German department store Asko AG (where a Metro holding company had previously each held shares) merged and formed Metro AG. Since the merger into the MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group, Media Markt and Saturn have been managed as independent brands in a centrally controlled group.\n\nIn January 2013, Metro had around 78% of the shares.

With chain of stores Saturn it constitutes Media-Saturn Holding, owned by the retail trade company Ceconomy, which was demerged from [[Metro AG|Metro Group]] in 2017.\n\n==History==\n\nMedia Markt was founded by entrepreneurs Leopold Stiefel, Walter Gunz, Erich Kellerhals, and Helga Kellerhals. The first store opened on 24 November 1979 in [[Munich]]. By 1985, nine other stores had opened near Munich. \n\nIn 1988 Kaufhof Warenhaus AG acquired a 54 percent majority in the holding company of the media stores founded in 1979. In 1989 expansion began in neighboring countries. Media Markt took over the competing retail chain Saturn in 1990, in which [[Kaufhof]] was already involved. In 1996 Kaufhof Holding, [[Metro Cash & Carry]], Deutsche SB-Kauf AG and the German department store Asko AG (where a Metro holding company had previously each held shares) merged and formed Metro AG. Since the merger into the MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group, Media Markt and Saturn have been managed as independent brands in a centrally controlled group.\n\nIn January 2013, Metro had around 78% of the shares. The Kellerhals family owned 21.67% through their indirectly held holding company Convergenta Invest.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/handel/a-879986.html |title=Media-Saturn-Mitgr\u00fcnder verkauft an Metro |publisher=manager-magazin.de |date=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nSince 2017 Media-Saturn Holding which consisting of Media Markt and [[Saturn (store)|Saturn]] chains is owned by [[Ceconomy]], an company formed through a demerger from [[Metro AG|Metro Group]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://archiv.metrogroup.de/en/press-releases/2017/07/12/demerger-of-metro-group-completed|title=Demerger of METRO Group completed - New METRO and CECONOMY commence trading at the stock exchange tomorrow|publisher=METRO AG|date=2017-07-12|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Operations ==\n[[File:Media_Markt_Weiterstadt.JPG|thumb|350px|Media Markt store in Weiterstadt, Germany]]\n\nIn 2012, the company launched its online shop, starting with Germany in January.\n\nIn Italy is used Media World brand instead of Media Markt.\n\n=== Franchise model ===\nEvery store is 10% owned by the store manager.

It is generally difficult to provide concrete evidence of such cases, since consumer protection groups do not have access to the delivery dates of the companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/lockvogel-angebote-gericht-knoepft-sich-media-markt-werbung-vor-a-481788.html |title=Gericht kn\u00f6pft sich Media-Markt-Werbung vor |publisher=spiegel.de |date=9 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Price Guarantee  ====\nIn 2005, samples from the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] in the Munich area showed that Media Markt or Saturn stores were more expensive in 15 out of 21 cases than local competitors. In Berlin they were 11 out of 21 cases. The MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group countered the allegations with a \"price guarantee\" that promised buyers a refund of the price difference if they found the product at a cheaper price in another shop.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/einzelhandel-die-trickser-vom-media-markt-1303977.html |title=Die Trickser vom Media-Markt |publisher=faz.net |date=9 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== 0 -% - financing ====\nIn 2013, 0% financing from the Spanish bank [[Banco Santander]] was criticized. A credit loss insurance that costs 10% is taken out only on a note in the small print.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://helpv2.orf.at/stories/1714801/index.html |title=Kreditversicherung wider Willen |publisher=orf.at |date=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The exclusive sale of Intel PCs ===\nAccording to research published by the [[Financial Times]] Germany in 2008, the MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group committed to [[Intel]] in 1999 to only sell PCs with Intel processors. The holding company received 85 million euros in purchase discounts and advertising grants from Intel in 2007 alone. The European antitrust authorities investigated the distortion of competition. Intel was fined 1.06 billion euros in May 2009 by the European Competition Commission for these and other antitrust violations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/wettbewerbsverstoesse-intels-praktiken-schockieren-kartellrechtler-a-624575.html |title=Intels Praktiken schockieren Kartellrechtler |publisher=spiegel.de |date=13 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe retail chain was moved by Intel's discount system to have only insignificant or no computers with [[AMD]] processors in the range. According to the [[European Commission]], Intel has made direct and indirect payments to MSH since 1997. The payments were subject to the condition that, if possible, only offer Intel systems.\n\n=== Body searches ===\n\nIn 2014, in [[Krems an der Donau]] in [[Lower Austria]], theft of the Media Markt, which is said to have been committed by employees, not only carried out bag checks, as is common in many companies, but also body searches on all employees. The unions see this as a violation of [[human dignity]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://noe.orf.at/v2/news/stories/2624102/ |title=Leibesvisitation bei Mitarbeitern |publisher=orf.at |date=7 January 2014}}</ref> As a consequence, employees of other branches in Austria reported this procedure.

She had three patrols, her first training patrol in 1943, and then two patrols in 1944.\n\n==Design==\n[[German Type IX submarine#Type IXC/40|German Type IXC/40 submarines]] were slightly larger than the original [[German Type IX submarine#Type IXC|Type IXC]]s. ''U-866'' had a displacement of {{convert|1144|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|1257|t|LT}} while submerged.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1991|p=68}} The U-boat had a total length of {{convert|76.76|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[pressure hull]] length of {{convert|58.75|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.86|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a height of {{convert|9.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|4.67|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The submarine was powered by two [[MAN SE|MAN]] M 9 V 40/46 [[supercharged]] four-stroke, nine-cylinder [[diesel engine]]s producing a total of {{convert|4400|PS|kW shp|-1}} for use while surfaced, two [[Siemens-Schuckert]] 2 GU 345/34 [[Motor\u2013generator|double-acting electric motors]] producing a total of {{convert|1000|shp|PS kW|-1}} for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two {{convert|1.92|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[propeller]]s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to {{convert|230|m}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1991|p=68}}\n\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|18.3|kn}} and a maximum submerged speed of {{convert|7.3|kn}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1991|p=68}} When submerged, the boat could operate for {{convert|63|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|13850|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}. ''U-866'' was fitted with six {{convert|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 [[torpedo]]es, one [[10.5 cm SK C/32 naval gun|{{convert|10.5|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} SK C/32 naval gun]], 180 rounds, and a [[3.7 cm Flak 18/36/37/43|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak M42]] as well as two twin [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} C/30]] anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a [[Ship's company|complement]] of forty-eight.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1991|p=68}}\n\n==Service history==\nHer commander from 17 November 1943 to December 1944 was ''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'' [[Walter Pommerehne]], followed by ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' [[Peter Rogowsky]], who commanded her from December 1944 to 18 March 1945.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url=http://uboat.net/boats/u866.htm\n |title=The Type IXC/40 boat U-866\n |last=Helgason\n |first=Gu\u00f0mundur\n |website=German U-boats of WWII - uboat.net\n |accessdate=7 December 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile under command of Rogowsky, on 16 March, {{USS|Lowe|DE-325|6}} acquired ''U-866'' on [[sonar]] and commenced a [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog attack]]. This attack missed the U-boat, which then settled on the ocean floor, attempting to hide from the attacking surface ships. Unfortunately for the U-boat, the seabed in the area was ideal for the surface ship's sonar and USS ''Lowe'', {{USS|Menges|DE-320|6}}, {{USS|Mosley|DE-321|6}}, and {{USS|Pride|DE-323|6}}, all [[destroyer escort]]s, continued to attack with [[depth charge]]s, until the U-boat was judged destroyed.<ref>[http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/U866.asp U.S. Coast Guard History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.desausa.org/sinking_of_u_866.htm Sinking of U 866<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nShe did not sink or damage any ships while on patrol.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book | last1 = Busch | first1 = Rainer | last2 = R\u00f6ll | first2 = Hans-Joachim | translator-last = Brooks | translator-first = Geoffrey | title = German U-boat commanders of World War II : a biographical dictionary | publisher = Greenhill Books, Naval Institute Press | location = London, Annapolis, Md | year = 1999 | isbn = 1-55750-186-6 | ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book\n|last1=Busch\n|first1=Rainer\n|last2=R\u00f6ll\n|first2=Hans-Joachim\n|title=Deutsche U-Boot-Verluste von September 1939 bis Mai 1945\n|trans-title=German U-boat losses from September 1939 to May 1945\n|work=Der U-Boot-Krieg\n|volume=IV\n|publisher=Mittler\n|location=Hamburg, Berlin, Bonn\n|year=1999\n|isbn=3-8132-0514-2\n|language=German\n|ref=harv\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last1=Gr\u00f6ner\n|first1=Erich\n|author-link1=\n|author-mask1=\n|last2=Jung\n|first2=Dieter\n|display-authors=\n|last-author-amp=\n|last3=Maass\n|first3=Martin\n|translator-last1=Thomas\n|translator-first1=Keith\n|translator-last2=Magowan\n|translator-first2=Rachel\n|year=1991\n|title=U-boats and [[Naval mine|Mine]] Warfare Vessels\n|volume=2\n|work=German Warships 1815\u20131945\n|location=London\n|publisher=Conway Maritime Press\n|isbn=0-85177-593-4\n|ref=CITEREFGr\u00f6ner1991\n}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Cite web\n |url=http://uboat.net/boats/u866.htm\n |title=The Type IXC/40 boat U-866\n |last=Helgason\n |first=Gu\u00f0mundur\n |website=German U-boats of WWII - uboat.net\n |accessdate=7 December 2014\n}}\n\n{{German Type IXC/40 submarines}}\n{{March 1945 shipwrecks}}\n{{Subject bar\n| portal1=Military of Germany\n| portal2=World War II\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2014}}\n\n{{coord|43.18|N|61.08|W|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:U0866}}\n[[Category:German Type IX submarines]]\n[[Category:U-boats commissioned in 1943]]\n[[Category:1943 ships]]\n[[Category:World War II submarines of Germany]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Bremen (state)]]\n[[Category:U-boats sunk in 1945]]\n[[Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean]]\n[[Category:U-boats sunk by depth charges]]\n[[Category:U-boats sunk by US warships]]\n[[Category:Ships lost with all hands]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in March 1945]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "date format audit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-866"}
