It was written by Keys, [[Jermaine Dupri]], and Joshua Thompson for her debut album, ''[[Songs in A Minor]]'' (2001), while production was helmed by Durpi and Keys. The song is built around an [[interpolation (music)|interpolation]] from [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]'s 1995 song \"[[Brooklyn Zoo (song)|Brooklyn Zoo]]\". Due to the inclusion of the sample, [[RZA|Robert Diggs]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard|Russell Jones]] are also credited as songwriters. \n\nThe track released as the album's fourth and final single outside the United States, where it charted at number eighty-two on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|''Billboard'' Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart due to moderate airplay. Although \"Girlfriend\" managed to outpeak previous single \"[[How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?|How Come You Don't Call Me]]\" in the United Kingdom and Australia, it failed to make impact elsewhere. The song's KrucialKeys Sista Girl Mix, which appears on the re-release ''Songs in A Minor: Remixed & Unplugged'', is used in the video, directed by Patrick Hoelck, and was serviced to radio instead of its album version.\n\n==Background==\nLyrically, in \"Girlfriend\", Keys cannot help but think that her boyfriend is having a relationship with his close female friend. She says she knows that the woman is only a friend of him, but she cannot stop thinking that her boyfriend may leave her. Keys then proceeds to say that she thinks she is jealous of his \"girlfriend\". Musically, the song contains an [[interpolation (music)|interpolation]] from [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]'s 1995 song \"[[Brooklyn Zoo (song)|Brooklyn Zoo]]\".<ref name=\"PopMatters\">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/k/keysalicia-songs.shtml|title=Alicia Keys: Songs in A Minor|last=Neal|first=Mark Anthony|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for \"Girlfriend\" was directed by Patrick Hoelck and shot on location in [[East End of London|East London]], [[United Kingdom]], the video uses the Krucialkeys Sista Girl Mix.

While walking, she sees her boyfriend also on a walk with his female friend across the street. Keys then walks into a clothing store, performing in the fitting room. Strolling through clothing aisles, she spots a pair of red leather pants\u2014at the same time the female friend had seen them. Keys yanks the hanger into her own hands. After the second verse is performed, the video shifts to a large, empty basement where she plays a musical piece on the piano. The video then goes back to the store, where Keys leaves out of to perform choreography with three other dancers at the corner of a street.

He was the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of [[Polish People's Republic|post-war Poland]] until 1948. Following the [[Polish October]] he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomu\u0142ka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \"Polish way to [[socialism]]\";<ref name=time>{{cite news | title = Rebellious Compromiser | publisher = Time Magazine | date = 10 December 1956 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808728-1,00.html | accessdate = 2006-10-14 }}</ref> and giving rise to the period known as \"[[Gomu\u0142ka's thaw]]\". During the 1960s, however, he became more rigid and authoritarian\u2014afraid of destabilizing the system, he was not inclined to introduce or permit changes. In the 1960s he supported the persecution of the [[Catholic Church]], intellectuals and the anti-communist opposition.\n\nIn 1967\u201368 Gomu\u0142ka allowed outbursts of [[1968 Polish political crisis|\"anti-Zionist\" political propaganda]],<ref>Judt, Tony (2005). ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945''. New York, The Penguin Press, pp. 434\u201335</ref> which turned into an [[anti-Semitic]] campaign, pursued primarily by others in the Party, but utilized by Gomu\u0142ka to retain power by shifting the attention from the stagnating economy. Many of the remaining [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] left the country. At that time he was also responsible for persecuting protesting students and toughening censorship of the media. Gomu\u0142ka supported Poland's participation in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|treaty with West Germany]], signed in December 1970 at the end of Gomulka's period in office, Germany recognized the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line|post-World War II borders]], which established a foundation for future peace, stability and cooperation in [[Central Europe]]. In the same month, economic difficulties led to price rises and subsequent [[Polish 1970 protests|bloody clashes]] with [[shipyard]] workers on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic coast]], in which several dozen workers were fatally shot. The tragic events forced Gomu\u0142ka's resignation and retirement. In a generational replacement of the ruling elite, [[Edward Gierek]] took over the Party leadership and tensions eased.\n\n==Childhood and education==\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka was born on 6 February 1905 in Bia\u0142obrzegi Franciszka\u0144skie village on the outskirts of [[Krosno]], into a worker's family living in the [[Austrian Partition]] (the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] region). His parents had met and married in the [[United States]], where each had emigrated in search of work in the late 19th century, but returned to occupied Poland in the early 20th century because W\u0142adys\u0142aw's father Jan was unable to find gainful employment in America. Jan Gomu\u0142ka then worked as a laborer in the [[Polish Subcarpathia|Subcarpathian]] oil industry. W\u0142adys\u0142aw's older sister J\u00f3zefa, born in the US, returned there upon turning eighteen to join her extended family, most of whom had emigrated, and to preserve her US citizenship. W\u0142adys\u0142aw and his two other siblings experienced a childhood of the [[Poverty in Austrian Galicia|proverbial Galician poverty]]: they lived in a dilapidated hut and ate mostly potatoes.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 174\u2013175\"/> W\u0142adys\u0142aw received only rudimentary education before being employed in the oil industry of the region.\n\nGomu\u0142ka attended schools in Krosno for six or seven years, until the age of thirteen, when he had to start an apprenticeship in a metalworks shop. Throughout his life Gomu\u0142ka was an avid reader and accomplished a great deal of self-education, but remained a subject of jokes because of his lack of formal education and demeanor.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 174\u2013175\"/> In 1922, Gomu\u0142ka passed his apprenticeship exams and began working at a local refinery.\n\n==Early revolutionary activities==\n\n===Involvement with labor unions and first imprisonment===\nThe re-established Polish state of Gomu\u0142ka's teen years was a scene of growing political polarization and radicalization. The young worker developed connections with the radical [[Left-wing politics|Left]], joining the ''Si\u0142a'' (Power) youth organization in 1922 and the Independent Peasant Party in 1925. Gomu\u0142ka was known for his activism in the metal workers and, from 1922, chemical industry unions. He was involved in union-organized strikes and in 1924, during a protest gathering in Krosno, participated in a polemical debate with [[Herman Lieberman]]. He published radical texts in leftist newspapers. In May 1926 the young Gomu\u0142ka was for the first time arrested, but soon released because of worker demands. The incident was the subject of a [[interpellation (politics)|parliamentary intervention]] by the Peasant Party. In October 1926, Gomu\u0142ka became a secretary of the managing council in the Chemical Industry Workers Union for the [[Drohobych]] District and remained involved with that communist-dominated union until 1930. He around this time learned on his own basic [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/><ref name=\"Werblan Gomu\u0142ka 20\u201325\"/>\n\nIn late 1926, while in Drohobych, Gomu\u0142ka became a member of the illegal-but-functioning [[Communist Party of Poland]] (''Komunistyczna Partia Polski'', KPP) and was arrested for political agitation. Technically, at this time he was a member of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, which was an autonomous branch of the Communist Party of Poland. He was interested primarily in social issues, including the trade and labor movement, and concentrated on practical activities.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 174\u2013175\"/><ref name=\"Werblan Gomu\u0142ka 25\u201344\"/> In mid-1927, Gomu\u0142ka was brought to [[Warsaw]], where he remained active until drafted for military service at the end of the year. After several months, the military released him because of a health problem with his right leg. Gomu\u0142ka returned to communist party work, organizing strike actions and speaking at gatherings of workers at all major industrial centers of Poland. During this period he was arrested several times and lived under police supervision.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/><ref name=\"Werblan Gomu\u0142ka 25\u201344\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka was an activist in the leftist labor unions from 1926 and in the Central Trade Department of the KPP [[Central Committee]] from 1931. In the summer of 1930, Gomu\u0142ka illegally embarked on his first foreign trip with the intention of participating in the [[Profintern|Red International of Labor Unions]] Fifth Congress held in Moscow from 15 to 30 July. Traveling from [[Upper Silesia]] to [[Berlin]], he had to wait there for the issuance of Soviet documents and arrived in Moscow too late participate in the deliberations of the Congress. He stayed in Moscow for a couple of weeks and then went to [[Leningrad]], from where he took a ship to [[Hamburg]], stayed in Berlin again and through Silesia returned to Poland.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/>\n\nIn August 1932, he was arrested by the [[Sanation]] police while participating in a conference of [[textile industry|textile]] worker delegates in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. When he later tried to escape, Gomu\u0142ka sustained a gunshot wound in the left thigh which ultimately left him with a permanent walking impairment.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/>\n\n===Journey to the Soviet Union and second imprisonment===\nDespite being sentenced to a four-year prison term on 1 June 1933, he was temporarily released for surgery on his injured leg in March 1934. Following his release, Gomulka requested that the KPP send him to the Soviet Union for medical treatment and further political training.  He arrived in the Soviet Union in June and went to the [[Crimea]] for several weeks, where he underwent therapeutic baths. Gomu\u0142ka then spent more than a year in Moscow, where he attended the Lenin School under the name Stefan Kowalski.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/> The ideology-oriented classes were arranged separately for a small group of Polish students (one of them was [[Roman Romkowski]] (Natan Gr\u00fcnspan [Grinszpan]-Kikiel), who would later persecute Gomu\u0142ka in Stalinist Poland) and included a military training course conducted by [[Karol \u015awierczewski]]. In a written opinion issued by the school Gomu\u0142ka was characterized in highly positive terms, but his extended stay in the Soviet Union caused him to become disillusioned with the realities of Stalinist communism and highly critical of the agrarian [[collectivization]] practice. In November 1935 he illegally returned to Poland.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka resumed his communist and labor conspiratorial activities and kept advancing within the KPP organization until, as the secretary of the Party's Silesian branch, he was arrested in [[Chorz\u00f3w]] in April 1936. He was then tried by the District Court in [[Katowice]] and sentenced to seven years in prison where he remained jailed until the beginning of [[World War II]]. Ironically, this internment most likely saved Gomulka's life, because the majority of the KPP leadership would be murdered in the Soviet Union in the late 1930s, caught up in the [[Great Purge]] under Jozef Stalin's orders.\n\nGomu\u0142ka's experiences turned him into an extremely suspicious and distrustful person and contributed to his lifelong conviction that [[Sanation]] Poland was a [[fascist]] state, even if Polish prisons were the most safe places for Polish Communists.<ref>[Caviar and Ashes: A Warsaw Generation's Life and Death in Marxism, 1918\u20131968, p. 149]</ref> He differentiated this belief from his positive feelings toward the country and its people, especially members of the [[working class]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/>\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Invasion of Poland===\n\nThe outbreak of the war with Nazi Germany freed Gomu\u0142ka from his prison confinement. On 7 September 1939 he arrived in Warsaw, where he stayed for a few weeks, working in the [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|besieged capital]] on the construction of defensive fortifications. From there, like many other Polish communists, Gomu\u0142ka fled to eastern Poland which was [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded by the Soviet Union]] on 17 September 1939. In [[Bia\u0142ystok]] he ran a home for former political prisoners arriving from other parts of Poland. To be reunited with his luckily found wife, at the end of 1939 Gomu\u0142ka moved to Soviet-controlled [[Lviv]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nLike other members of the dissolved Communist Party of Poland, Gomu\u0142ka sought a membership in the Soviet [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]]. The Soviet authorities allowed such membership transfers only from March 1941 and in April of that year Gomu\u0142ka received his party card in [[Kiev]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nThe circumstances of the Polish communists' lives changed dramatically after the 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet positions in eastern Poland]]. Reduced to penury in now German-occupied Lviv, the Gomu\u0142kas managed to join W\u0142adys\u0142aw's family in [[Krosno]] by the end of 1941. However, a momentous development soon took place in the sphere of communist political activity: in January 1942, [[Joseph Stalin]] reestablished in Warsaw a Polish communist party under the name of the [[Polish Workers' Party]] (PPR).<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nIn 1942, Gomulka participated in the reformation of a Polish communist party (the KPP was destroyed in [[Great Purge|Stalin's purges]] in the late 1930s) under the name [[Polish Workers' Party]] (''Polska Partia Robotnicza'', PPR). Gomu\u0142ka became involved in the creation of party structures in the [[Polish Subcarpathia|Subcarpathian]] region and began using his wartime conspiratorial pseudonym \"Wies\u0142aw\". In July 1942, [[Pawe\u0142 Finder]] brought Gomu\u0142ka to occupied Warsaw. In August, the secretary of the PPR's regional Warsaw Committee was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and \"Wies\u0142aw\" was entrusted with his job. In September Gomu\u0142ka became a member of the PPR's Temporary Central Committee.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nIn late 1942 and early 1943, the PPR experienced a severe crisis because of the murder of its first secretary [[Marceli Nowotko]]. Gomu\u0142ka participated in the party investigation directed against another member of the leadership, [[Boles\u0142aw Mo\u0142ojec]], that resulted in Mo\u0142ojec's execution. Together with the promoted to secretary Finder and Franciszek J\u00f3\u017awiak, \"Wies\u0142aw\" (Gomulka) was included in the Party's new inner leadership, established in January 1943. The Central Committee was enlarged in the following months to include [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]], among others.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nIn February 1943, Gomu\u0142ka led the communist side in a series of important meetings in Warsaw between the PPR and the [[Government Delegation for Poland|Government Delegation]] of the London-based [[Polish government-in-exile]] and the [[Home Army]]. The talks produced no results because of the divergent interests of the parties involved and a mutual lack of confidence. The Delegation officially discontinued the negotiations on April 28, three days after the Soviet government broke diplomatic relations with the Polish government.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/> He became the Party's main ideologist. He wrote the \"What do we fight for?\" (''O co walczymy?'') publication dated 1 March 1943, and the much more comprehensive declaration that emerged under the same title in November. \"Wies\u0142aw\" supervised the Party's main editorial and publishing undertaking.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka made efforts, largely unsuccessful, to secure for the PPR cooperation of other political forces in occupied Poland. Bierut was indifferent to any such attempts and counted simply on compulsion provided by a future presence of the [[Red Army]] in Poland. The different strategies resulted in a sharp conflict between the two communist politicians.<ref name=\"Brzoza 362\u2013363\"/>\n\n===State National Council, Polish Committee of National Liberation===\nIn the fall of 1943, the PPR leadership began discussing the creation of a Polish quasi-parliamentary, communist-led body, to be named the [[State National Council]] (''Krajowa Rada Narodowa'', KRN). After the [[Battle of Kursk]] the expectation was of a Soviet victory and liberation of Poland and the PPR wanted to be ready to assume power. Gomu\u0142ka came up with the idea of a national council and imposed his point of view on the rest of the leadership. The PPR intended to obtain consent from the [[Cominterm]] leader and their Soviet contact [[Georgi Dimitrov]]. However, in November the [[Gestapo]] arrested Finder and [[Ma\u0142gorzata Fornalska]], who possessed the secret codes for communication with Moscow and the Soviet response remained unknown. In the absence of Finder, on 23 November Gomu\u0142ka was elected general secretary (chief) of the PPR and Bierut joined the three-person inner leadership.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 182\u2013185\"/>\n\nThe founding meeting of the State National Council took place in the late evening of 31 December 1943. The new body's chairman Bierut was becoming Gomu\u0142ka's main rival. In mid-January 1944 Dimitrov was finally informed of the KRN's existence, which surprised both him and the Polish communist leaders in Moscow, increasingly led by [[Jakub Berman]], who had other, competing ideas concerning the establishment of a Polish communist ruling party and government.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 182\u2013185\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka felt that the Polish communists in occupied Poland had a better understanding of Polish realities than their brethren in Moscow and that the State National Council should determine the shape of the future executive government of Poland. Nevertheless, to gain a Soviet approval and to clear any misunderstandings a KRN delegation left Warsaw in mid-March heading for Moscow, where it arrived two months later. By that time Stalin concluded that the existence of the KRN was a positive development and the Poles arriving from Warsaw were received and greeted by him and other Soviet dignitaries. The [[Union of Polish Patriots]] and the [[Central Bureau of Polish Communists]] in Moscow were now under pressure to recognize the primacy of the PPR, the KRN and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, which they ultimately did only in mid-July.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 182\u2013185\"/>\n\nOn 20 July, the Soviet forces under Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] forced their way across the [[Bug River]] and on that same day the combined meeting of Polish communists from the Moscow and Warsaw factions finalized the arrangements regarding the establishment (on 21 July) of the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (PKWN), a temporary government headed by [[Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski]], a socialist allied with the communists. Gomu\u0142ka and other PPR leaders left Warsaw and headed for the Soviet-controlled territory, arriving in [[Lublin]] on 1 August, the day the [[Warsaw Uprising]] erupted in the Polish capital.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 182\u2013185\"/>\n\n==Post-war political career==\n===Role in communist takeover of Poland===\nGomu\u0142ka was a deputy prime minister in the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland]] (''Rz\u0105d Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej''), from January to June 1945, and in the [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] (''Tymczasowy Rz\u0105d Jedno\u015bci Narodowej''), from 1945 to 1947. As a minister of [[Recovered Territories]] (1945\u201348), he exerted great influence over the rebuilding, integration and economic progress of Poland within its new borders, by supervising the settlement, development and administration of the lands acquired from Germany. Using his position in the PPR and government, Gomu\u0142ka led the [[leftist]] social transformations in Poland and participated in the crushing of the resistance to the communist rule during the post-war years. He also helped the communists in winning the [[1946 Polish people's referendum|3 x Tak]] (3 Times Yes) referendum of 1946. A year later, he played a key role in the [[1947 Polish legislative election|1947 parliamentary elections]], which were fraudulently arranged to give the communists and their allies an overwhelming victory. After the elections, all remaining legal opposition in Poland was effectively destroyed. In June 1948, because of the impending unification of the PPR and PPS, Gomu\u0142ka delivered a talk on the subject of the history of the Polish worker movement.\n\nGomu\u0142ka's already well-developed antisemitic tendencies were expressed in a memo written to Stalin in 1948, in which he argued that \"some of the Jewish comrades don\u2019t feel any link to the Polish nation or to the Polish working class\u2026or they maintain a stance which might be described as \u2018national nihilism\u2019\".<ref name=\"Applebaum, Anne 2013, p. 156\">Applebaum, Anne. ''Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944\u201356.'' London: Penguin, 2013, p. 156</ref> As a result, he considered it \"absolutely necessary not only to stop any further growth in the percentage of Jews in the state as well as the party apparatus, but also to slowly lower that percentage, especially at the highest levels of the apparatus\".<ref name=\"Applebaum, Anne 2013, p. 156\"/>\n\n===Temporary withdrawal from politics===\nIn the late 1940s, Poland's communist government was split by a rivalry between Gomu\u0142ka and President [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]]. Gomu\u0142ka led a home national group while Bierut headed a group reared by Stalin in the Soviet Union. The struggle ultimately led to Gomu\u0142ka's removal from power in 1948.  While Bierut advocated a policy of complete subservience to Moscow, Gomu\u0142ka wanted to adopt the Communist blueprint to Polish circumstances. Among other things, he opposed forced collectivization, and was skeptical of the [[Cominform]]. The Bierut faction had Stalin's ear, and on Stalin's orders, Gomu\u0142ka was sacked as party leader for \"rightist-nationalist deviation,\" replaced by Bierut. In December, soon after the PPR and [[Polish Socialist Party]] merged to form [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) (which was essentially the PPR under a new name), Gomu\u0142ka was dropped from the merged party's Politburo. He was stripped of his remaining government posts in January 1949, and expelled from the party altogether in November. For the next eight years, he performed no official functions and was subjected to persecution, including almost four years of imprisonment from 1951 to 1954.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Boleslaw-Bierut Boleslaw Bierut] at [[Encyclopedia Britannica]]</ref><ref name=GBritannica>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wladyslaw-Gomulka W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka] at [[Encyclopedia Britannica]]</ref><ref name=HistDic>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2O2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1887&lpg=PA1887&dq=Poland+Communist+dominated+list&source=bl&ots=LMU3qK7q4g&sig=v_0ywKaa-XoVmBi-skZE_JSSym4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPpMX8-_bRAhVozoMKHdTHASwQ6AEISDAI#v=onepage&q=Poland%20Communist%20dominated%20list&f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of Poland 1945-1996|last=Wrobel|first=Piotr|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=2014|isbn=9781135927011}}</ref><ref name=\"Werblan Gomu\u0142ka 5\"/>\n\nBierut died in March 1956, during a period of [[de-Stalinization]] in Poland which gradually developed after Stalin's death.

Gomu\u0142ka insisted that he be given real power to implement further reforms. He wanted a replacement of some of the Party leaders, including the pro-Soviet Minister of Defense [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]].\n\nThe Soviet leadership viewed events in Poland with alarm. Simultaneously with Soviet troop movements deep into Poland, a high-level Soviet delegation flew to Warsaw. It was led by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and included [[Anastas Mikoyan|Mikoyan]], [[Nikolai Bulganin|Bulganin]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]], [[Ivan Konev|Marshal Konev]] and others. Ochab and Gomu\u0142ka made it clear that Polish forces would resist if Soviet troops advanced, but reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning the communist bloc or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets yielded.<ref>{{cite web | title = Notes from the Minutes of the CPSU CC Presidium Meeting with Satellite Leaders, October 24, 1956 | work = The 1956 Hungarian Revolution, A History in Documents | publisher = George Washington University: The National Security Archive | date = November 4, 2002 | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/doc5.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-09-02}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the wishes of the majority of the [[Politburo]] members, First Secretary Ochab conceded and on 20 October the [[Central Committee]] brought Gomu\u0142ka and several associates into the Politburo, removed others, and elected Gomu\u0142ka as first secretary of the Party. Gomu\u0142ka, the former prisoner of the Stalinists, enjoyed wide popular support across the country, expressed by the participants of a massive street demonstration in Warsaw on 24 October. Seeing that Gomu\u0142ka was popular with the Polish people, and given his insistence that he wanted to maintain the alliance with the Soviet Union and the presence of the [[Red Army in Poland]], Khrushchev decided that Gomu\u0142ka was a leader that Moscow could live with.<ref name=\"Granville pages 521-563\"/>\n\n==Leadership of the Polish People's Republic==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0121-0010-023, Berlin, VI.

Many of the remaining [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] left the country. At that time he was also responsible for persecuting protesting students and toughening censorship of the media. Gomu\u0142ka supported Poland's participation in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|treaty with West Germany]], signed in December 1970 at the end of Gomulka's period in office, Germany recognized the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line|post-World War II borders]], which established a foundation for future peace, stability and cooperation in [[Central Europe]]. In the same month, economic difficulties led to price rises and subsequent [[Polish 1970 protests|bloody clashes]] with [[shipyard]] workers on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic coast]], in which several dozen workers were fatally shot. The tragic events forced Gomu\u0142ka's resignation and retirement. In a generational replacement of the ruling elite, [[Edward Gierek]] took over the Party leadership and tensions eased.\n\n==Childhood and education==\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka was born on 6 February 1905 in Bia\u0142obrzegi Franciszka\u0144skie village on the outskirts of [[Krosno]], into a worker's family living in the [[Austrian Partition]] (the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] region). His parents had met and married in the [[United States]], where each had emigrated in search of work in the late 19th century, but returned to occupied Poland in the early 20th century because W\u0142adys\u0142aw's father Jan was unable to find gainful employment in America. Jan Gomu\u0142ka then worked as a laborer in the [[Polish Subcarpathia|Subcarpathian]] oil industry. W\u0142adys\u0142aw's older sister J\u00f3zefa, born in the US, returned there upon turning eighteen to join her extended family, most of whom had emigrated, and to preserve her US citizenship. W\u0142adys\u0142aw and his two other siblings experienced a childhood of the [[Poverty in Austrian Galicia|proverbial Galician poverty]]: they lived in a dilapidated hut and ate mostly potatoes.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 174\u2013175\"/> W\u0142adys\u0142aw received only rudimentary education before being employed in the oil industry of the region.\n\nGomu\u0142ka attended schools in Krosno for six or seven years, until the age of thirteen, when he had to start an apprenticeship in a metalworks shop. Throughout his life Gomu\u0142ka was an avid reader and accomplished a great deal of self-education, but remained a subject of jokes because of his lack of formal education and demeanor.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 174\u2013175\"/> In 1922, Gomu\u0142ka passed his apprenticeship exams and began working at a local refinery.\n\n==Early revolutionary activities==\n\n===Involvement with labor unions and first imprisonment===\nThe re-established Polish state of Gomu\u0142ka's teen years was a scene of growing political polarization and radicalization. The young worker developed connections with the radical [[Left-wing politics|Left]], joining the ''Si\u0142a'' (Power) youth organization in 1922 and the Independent Peasant Party in 1925. Gomu\u0142ka was known for his activism in the metal workers and, from 1922, chemical industry unions. He was involved in union-organized strikes and in 1924, during a protest gathering in Krosno, participated in a polemical debate with [[Herman Lieberman]]. He published radical texts in leftist newspapers. In May 1926 the young Gomu\u0142ka was for the first time arrested, but soon released because of worker demands. The incident was the subject of a [[interpellation (politics)|parliamentary intervention]] by the Peasant Party. In October 1926, Gomu\u0142ka became a secretary of the managing council in the Chemical Industry Workers Union for the [[Drohobych]] District and remained involved with that communist-dominated union until 1930. He around this time learned on his own basic [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/><ref name=\"Werblan Gomu\u0142ka 20\u201325\"/>\n\nIn late 1926, while in Drohobych, Gomu\u0142ka became a member of the illegal-but-functioning [[Communist Party of Poland]] (''Komunistyczna Partia Polski'', KPP) and was arrested for political agitation. Technically, at this time he was a member of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, which was an autonomous branch of the Communist Party of Poland. He was interested primarily in social issues, including the trade and labor movement, and concentrated on practical activities.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 174\u2013175\"/><ref name=\"Werblan Gomu\u0142ka 25\u201344\"/> In mid-1927, Gomu\u0142ka was brought to [[Warsaw]], where he remained active until drafted for military service at the end of the year. After several months, the military released him because of a health problem with his right leg. Gomu\u0142ka returned to communist party work, organizing strike actions and speaking at gatherings of workers at all major industrial centers of Poland. During this period he was arrested several times and lived under police supervision.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/><ref name=\"Werblan Gomu\u0142ka 25\u201344\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka was an activist in the leftist labor unions from 1926 and in the Central Trade Department of the KPP [[Central Committee]] from 1931. In the summer of 1930, Gomu\u0142ka illegally embarked on his first foreign trip with the intention of participating in the [[Profintern|Red International of Labor Unions]] Fifth Congress held in Moscow from 15 to 30 July. Traveling from [[Upper Silesia]] to [[Berlin]], he had to wait there for the issuance of Soviet documents and arrived in Moscow too late participate in the deliberations of the Congress. He stayed in Moscow for a couple of weeks and then went to [[Leningrad]], from where he took a ship to [[Hamburg]], stayed in Berlin again and through Silesia returned to Poland.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/>\n\nIn August 1932, he was arrested by the [[Sanation]] police while participating in a conference of [[textile industry|textile]] worker delegates in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. When he later tried to escape, Gomu\u0142ka sustained a gunshot wound in the left thigh which ultimately left him with a permanent walking impairment.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/>\n\n===Journey to the Soviet Union and second imprisonment===\nDespite being sentenced to a four-year prison term on 1 June 1933, he was temporarily released for surgery on his injured leg in March 1934. Following his release, Gomulka requested that the KPP send him to the Soviet Union for medical treatment and further political training.  He arrived in the Soviet Union in June and went to the [[Crimea]] for several weeks, where he underwent therapeutic baths. Gomu\u0142ka then spent more than a year in Moscow, where he attended the Lenin School under the name Stefan Kowalski.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/> The ideology-oriented classes were arranged separately for a small group of Polish students (one of them was [[Roman Romkowski]] (Natan Gr\u00fcnspan [Grinszpan]-Kikiel), who would later persecute Gomu\u0142ka in Stalinist Poland) and included a military training course conducted by [[Karol \u015awierczewski]]. In a written opinion issued by the school Gomu\u0142ka was characterized in highly positive terms, but his extended stay in the Soviet Union caused him to become disillusioned with the realities of Stalinist communism and highly critical of the agrarian [[collectivization]] practice. In November 1935 he illegally returned to Poland.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka resumed his communist and labor conspiratorial activities and kept advancing within the KPP organization until, as the secretary of the Party's Silesian branch, he was arrested in [[Chorz\u00f3w]] in April 1936. He was then tried by the District Court in [[Katowice]] and sentenced to seven years in prison where he remained jailed until the beginning of [[World War II]]. Ironically, this internment most likely saved Gomulka's life, because the majority of the KPP leadership would be murdered in the Soviet Union in the late 1930s, caught up in the [[Great Purge]] under Jozef Stalin's orders.\n\nGomu\u0142ka's experiences turned him into an extremely suspicious and distrustful person and contributed to his lifelong conviction that [[Sanation]] Poland was a [[fascist]] state, even if Polish prisons were the most safe places for Polish Communists.<ref>[Caviar and Ashes: A Warsaw Generation's Life and Death in Marxism, 1918\u20131968, p. 149]</ref> He differentiated this belief from his positive feelings toward the country and its people, especially members of the [[working class]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 175\u2013178\"/>\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Invasion of Poland===\n\nThe outbreak of the war with Nazi Germany freed Gomu\u0142ka from his prison confinement. On 7 September 1939 he arrived in Warsaw, where he stayed for a few weeks, working in the [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|besieged capital]] on the construction of defensive fortifications. From there, like many other Polish communists, Gomu\u0142ka fled to eastern Poland which was [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded by the Soviet Union]] on 17 September 1939. In [[Bia\u0142ystok]] he ran a home for former political prisoners arriving from other parts of Poland. To be reunited with his luckily found wife, at the end of 1939 Gomu\u0142ka moved to Soviet-controlled [[Lviv]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nLike other members of the dissolved Communist Party of Poland, Gomu\u0142ka sought a membership in the Soviet [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]]. The Soviet authorities allowed such membership transfers only from March 1941 and in April of that year Gomu\u0142ka received his party card in [[Kiev]].<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nThe circumstances of the Polish communists' lives changed dramatically after the 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet positions in eastern Poland]]. Reduced to penury in now German-occupied Lviv, the Gomu\u0142kas managed to join W\u0142adys\u0142aw's family in [[Krosno]] by the end of 1941. However, a momentous development soon took place in the sphere of communist political activity: in January 1942, [[Joseph Stalin]] reestablished in Warsaw a Polish communist party under the name of the [[Polish Workers' Party]] (PPR).<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nIn 1942, Gomulka participated in the reformation of a Polish communist party (the KPP was destroyed in [[Great Purge|Stalin's purges]] in the late 1930s) under the name [[Polish Workers' Party]] (''Polska Partia Robotnicza'', PPR). Gomu\u0142ka became involved in the creation of party structures in the [[Polish Subcarpathia|Subcarpathian]] region and began using his wartime conspiratorial pseudonym \"Wies\u0142aw\". In July 1942, [[Pawe\u0142 Finder]] brought Gomu\u0142ka to occupied Warsaw. In August, the secretary of the PPR's regional Warsaw Committee was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and \"Wies\u0142aw\" was entrusted with his job. In September Gomu\u0142ka became a member of the PPR's Temporary Central Committee.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nIn late 1942 and early 1943, the PPR experienced a severe crisis because of the murder of its first secretary [[Marceli Nowotko]]. Gomu\u0142ka participated in the party investigation directed against another member of the leadership, [[Boles\u0142aw Mo\u0142ojec]], that resulted in Mo\u0142ojec's execution. Together with the promoted to secretary Finder and Franciszek J\u00f3\u017awiak, \"Wies\u0142aw\" (Gomulka) was included in the Party's new inner leadership, established in January 1943. The Central Committee was enlarged in the following months to include [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]], among others.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nIn February 1943, Gomu\u0142ka led the communist side in a series of important meetings in Warsaw between the PPR and the [[Government Delegation for Poland|Government Delegation]] of the London-based [[Polish government-in-exile]] and the [[Home Army]]. The talks produced no results because of the divergent interests of the parties involved and a mutual lack of confidence. The Delegation officially discontinued the negotiations on April 28, three days after the Soviet government broke diplomatic relations with the Polish government.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/> He became the Party's main ideologist. He wrote the \"What do we fight for?\" (''O co walczymy?'') publication dated 1 March 1943, and the much more comprehensive declaration that emerged under the same title in November. \"Wies\u0142aw\" supervised the Party's main editorial and publishing undertaking.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 178\u2013182\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka made efforts, largely unsuccessful, to secure for the PPR cooperation of other political forces in occupied Poland. Bierut was indifferent to any such attempts and counted simply on compulsion provided by a future presence of the [[Red Army]] in Poland. The different strategies resulted in a sharp conflict between the two communist politicians.<ref name=\"Brzoza 362\u2013363\"/>\n\n===State National Council, Polish Committee of National Liberation===\nIn the fall of 1943, the PPR leadership began discussing the creation of a Polish quasi-parliamentary, communist-led body, to be named the [[State National Council]] (''Krajowa Rada Narodowa'', KRN). After the [[Battle of Kursk]] the expectation was of a Soviet victory and liberation of Poland and the PPR wanted to be ready to assume power. Gomu\u0142ka came up with the idea of a national council and imposed his point of view on the rest of the leadership. The PPR intended to obtain consent from the [[Cominterm]] leader and their Soviet contact [[Georgi Dimitrov]]. However, in November the [[Gestapo]] arrested Finder and [[Ma\u0142gorzata Fornalska]], who possessed the secret codes for communication with Moscow and the Soviet response remained unknown. In the absence of Finder, on 23 November Gomu\u0142ka was elected general secretary (chief) of the PPR and Bierut joined the three-person inner leadership.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 182\u2013185\"/>\n\nThe founding meeting of the State National Council took place in the late evening of 31 December 1943. The new body's chairman Bierut was becoming Gomu\u0142ka's main rival. In mid-January 1944 Dimitrov was finally informed of the KRN's existence, which surprised both him and the Polish communist leaders in Moscow, increasingly led by [[Jakub Berman]], who had other, competing ideas concerning the establishment of a Polish communist ruling party and government.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 182\u2013185\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka felt that the Polish communists in occupied Poland had a better understanding of Polish realities than their brethren in Moscow and that the State National Council should determine the shape of the future executive government of Poland. Nevertheless, to gain a Soviet approval and to clear any misunderstandings a KRN delegation left Warsaw in mid-March heading for Moscow, where it arrived two months later. By that time Stalin concluded that the existence of the KRN was a positive development and the Poles arriving from Warsaw were received and greeted by him and other Soviet dignitaries. The [[Union of Polish Patriots]] and the [[Central Bureau of Polish Communists]] in Moscow were now under pressure to recognize the primacy of the PPR, the KRN and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, which they ultimately did only in mid-July.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 182\u2013185\"/>\n\nOn 20 July, the Soviet forces under Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] forced their way across the [[Bug River]] and on that same day the combined meeting of Polish communists from the Moscow and Warsaw factions finalized the arrangements regarding the establishment (on 21 July) of the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (PKWN), a temporary government headed by [[Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski]], a socialist allied with the communists. Gomu\u0142ka and other PPR leaders left Warsaw and headed for the Soviet-controlled territory, arriving in [[Lublin]] on 1 August, the day the [[Warsaw Uprising]] erupted in the Polish capital.<ref name=\"Eisler siedmiu 182\u2013185\"/>\n\n==Post-war political career==\n===Role in communist takeover of Poland===\nGomu\u0142ka was a deputy prime minister in the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland]] (''Rz\u0105d Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej''), from January to June 1945, and in the [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] (''Tymczasowy Rz\u0105d Jedno\u015bci Narodowej''), from 1945 to 1947. As a minister of [[Recovered Territories]] (1945\u201348), he exerted great influence over the rebuilding, integration and economic progress of Poland within its new borders, by supervising the settlement, development and administration of the lands acquired from Germany. Using his position in the PPR and government, Gomu\u0142ka led the [[leftist]] social transformations in Poland and participated in the crushing of the resistance to the communist rule during the post-war years. He also helped the communists in winning the [[1946 Polish people's referendum|3 x Tak]] (3 Times Yes) referendum of 1946. A year later, he played a key role in the [[1947 Polish legislative election|1947 parliamentary elections]], which were fraudulently arranged to give the communists and their allies an overwhelming victory. After the elections, all remaining legal opposition in Poland was effectively destroyed. In June 1948, because of the impending unification of the PPR and PPS, Gomu\u0142ka delivered a talk on the subject of the history of the Polish worker movement.\n\nGomu\u0142ka's already well-developed antisemitic tendencies were expressed in a memo written to Stalin in 1948, in which he argued that \"some of the Jewish comrades don\u2019t feel any link to the Polish nation or to the Polish working class\u2026or they maintain a stance which might be described as \u2018national nihilism\u2019\".<ref name=\"Applebaum, Anne 2013, p. 156\">Applebaum, Anne. ''Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944\u201356.'' London: Penguin, 2013, p. 156</ref> As a result, he considered it \"absolutely necessary not only to stop any further growth in the percentage of Jews in the state as well as the party apparatus, but also to slowly lower that percentage, especially at the highest levels of the apparatus\".<ref name=\"Applebaum, Anne 2013, p. 156\"/>\n\n===Temporary withdrawal from politics===\nIn the late 1940s, Poland's communist government was split by a rivalry between Gomu\u0142ka and President [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]]. Gomu\u0142ka led a home national group while Bierut headed a group reared by Stalin in the Soviet Union. The struggle ultimately led to Gomu\u0142ka's removal from power in 1948.  While Bierut advocated a policy of complete subservience to Moscow, Gomu\u0142ka wanted to adopt the Communist blueprint to Polish circumstances. Among other things, he opposed forced collectivization, and was skeptical of the [[Cominform]]. The Bierut faction had Stalin's ear, and on Stalin's orders, Gomu\u0142ka was sacked as party leader for \"rightist-nationalist deviation,\" replaced by Bierut. In December, soon after the PPR and [[Polish Socialist Party]] merged to form [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) (which was essentially the PPR under a new name), Gomu\u0142ka was dropped from the merged party's Politburo. He was stripped of his remaining government posts in January 1949, and expelled from the party altogether in November. For the next eight years, he performed no official functions and was subjected to persecution, including almost four years of imprisonment from 1951 to 1954.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Boleslaw-Bierut Boleslaw Bierut] at [[Encyclopedia Britannica]]</ref><ref name=GBritannica>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wladyslaw-Gomulka W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka] at [[Encyclopedia Britannica]]</ref><ref name=HistDic>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2O2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1887&lpg=PA1887&dq=Poland+Communist+dominated+list&source=bl&ots=LMU3qK7q4g&sig=v_0ywKaa-XoVmBi-skZE_JSSym4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPpMX8-_bRAhVozoMKHdTHASwQ6AEISDAI#v=onepage&q=Poland%20Communist%20dominated%20list&f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of Poland 1945-1996|last=Wrobel|first=Piotr|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=2014|isbn=9781135927011}}</ref><ref name=\"Werblan Gomu\u0142ka 5\"/>\n\nBierut died in March 1956, during a period of [[de-Stalinization]] in Poland which gradually developed after Stalin's death. [[Edward Ochab]] became the new first secretary of the Party. Soon afterward, Gomu\u0142ka was partially rehabilitated when Ochab conceded that Gomu\u0142ka should not have been jailed, while reiterating the charges of \"rightist-nationalist deviation\" against him.<ref name=GBritannica/>\n\n===Rise to power===\n[[File:Gomulka speech.jpg|thumb|right|Gomu\u0142ka's speech on 24 October 1956 in Warsaw]]\nIn June 1956, violent [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|worker protests]] broke out in [[Pozna\u0144]]. The worker riots were harshly suppressed and dozens of workers were killed. However, the Party leadership, which now included many reform-minded officials, recognized to some degree the validity of the protest participants' demands and took steps to placate the workers.<ref name=swiatlo>{{cite web | title = The defection of Jozef Swiatlo and the Search for Jewish Scapegoats in the Polish United Workers' Party, 1953\u20131954 | work = Fourth Convention of the Association for the Study of Nationalities | publisher = Harriman Institute, Columbia University, New York City | date = April 15\u201317, 1999 | url = http://www.ciaonet.org/olj/int/int_0302c.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-10-27}}</ref><ref>Rothschild and Wingfield: ''Return to Diversity, A Political History of East Central Europe Since World War II'' OUP 2000</ref>\n\nThe reformers in the Party wanted a [[political rehabilitation]] of Gomu\u0142ka and his return to the Party leadership. Gomu\u0142ka insisted that he be given real power to implement further reforms. He wanted a replacement of some of the Party leaders, including the pro-Soviet Minister of Defense [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]].\n\nThe Soviet leadership viewed events in Poland with alarm. Simultaneously with Soviet troop movements deep into Poland, a high-level Soviet delegation flew to Warsaw. It was led by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and included [[Anastas Mikoyan|Mikoyan]], [[Nikolai Bulganin|Bulganin]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]], [[Ivan Konev|Marshal Konev]] and others. Ochab and Gomu\u0142ka made it clear that Polish forces would resist if Soviet troops advanced, but reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning the communist bloc or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets yielded.<ref>{{cite web | title = Notes from the Minutes of the CPSU CC Presidium Meeting with Satellite Leaders, October 24, 1956 | work = The 1956 Hungarian Revolution, A History in Documents | publisher = George Washington University: The National Security Archive | date = November 4, 2002 | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/doc5.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-09-02}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the wishes of the majority of the [[Politburo]] members, First Secretary Ochab conceded and on 20 October the [[Central Committee]] brought Gomu\u0142ka and several associates into the Politburo, removed others, and elected Gomu\u0142ka as first secretary of the Party. Gomu\u0142ka, the former prisoner of the Stalinists, enjoyed wide popular support across the country, expressed by the participants of a massive street demonstration in Warsaw on 24 October. Seeing that Gomu\u0142ka was popular with the Polish people, and given his insistence that he wanted to maintain the alliance with the Soviet Union and the presence of the [[Red Army in Poland]], Khrushchev decided that Gomu\u0142ka was a leader that Moscow could live with.<ref name=\"Granville pages 521-563\"/>\n\n==Leadership of the Polish People's Republic==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0121-0010-023, Berlin, VI.
