Winter also starred in the lead role. All three were involved in the short-lived [[MTV]] sketch comedy show ''[[The Idiot Box (TV series)|The Idiot Box]]'', and ''Freaked'' retains the same brand of surrealistic and absurdist humor as seen in the show. ''Freaked'' was Alex Winter's last feature film before he shifted to cameo and television films for many years until 2013's ''[[Grand Piano (film)|Grand Piano]]''.\n\nOriginally conceived as a low-budget horror film featuring the band [[Butthole Surfers]],<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\">{{cite video|people =Stern, Tom; Winter, Alex|title=DVD Commentary for 'Freaked'|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=Anchor Bay}}</ref> ''Freaked'' went through a number of rewrites, eventually developing into a [[black comedy]] set within a [[sideshow]], which was picked up by [[20th Century Fox]] for a feature film. After several poor test screenings and a change in studio executives who then found the film too \"weird\", the movie was pulled from a wide distribution (except for [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]) and only played on a handful of screens in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nSkye Daley ([[Brooke Shields]]) is interviewing former child star Ricky Coogin ([[Alex Winter]]). Skye asks how Ricky so quickly went from one of America's sweethearts to a name that makes children scream in terror. Ricky, completely in silhouette, begins his story.\n\nRicky is shown accepting an endorsement contract from slimy mega-corporation E.E.S. (Everything Except Shoes) to promote \"Zygrot 24\", a toxic fertilizer, in South America. Although hesitant at first, the greedy, self-centered Coogin caves in after CEO ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) offers him $5,000,000. Ricky travels to the South American town of \"Santa Flan\" with his friend Ernie ([[Michael Stoyanov]]). During their flight, the duo have a run-in with Ricky's 12-year-old fan Stuey Gluck (Alex Zuckerman). Stuey begs Ricky not to promote Zygrot 24 only to accidentally fall out of the plane.\n\nOnce Ricky and Ernie arrive in Santa Flan, they cross paths with a group of environmentalists protesting Zygrot 24 and Ricky. In the group is Julie ([[Megan Ward]]), who Ricky becomes instantly smitten with. The two con Julie into thinking they're also environmentalists, with Ricky posing as a highly injured accident victim, his face covered in bandages, and she agrees to join them on a trip to another protest. However, she soon finds out their true identities and the three are stuck with each other for the rest of the drive. They decide to take a detour to see Freek Land, a local [[freak show]], only to wind up in the clutches of demented proprietor and mad scientist Elijah C. Skuggs ([[Randy Quaid]]) and his henchman, Toad ([[Jaime Cardriche]]). Utilizing his \"Testy Freeks Machine\", he merges Julie and Ernie into a single body and turns Ricky into a hideous green mutation. As Elijah has run out of Zygrot, only half of Ricky's body is mutated.\n\nRicky meets the other freaks, including Ortiz the [[Fedor Jeftichew|Dog Boy]] ([[Keanu Reeves]]), Worm ([[Derek McGrath]]) a giant arthropod, Cowboy ([[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]]) a literal anthropomorphic cow, the [[Bearded Lady]] ([[Mr. T]] in a dress) and Sockhead ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]), who has a [[sock puppet]] for a head. Ricky has trouble adjusting to his new life as a freak, though he opens up when some of the other freaks recount how they were captured and disfigured by Elijah. During his first performance, Ricky foregoes his act performs a Shakespearean monologue which captivates the audience. Spotting his agent in the crowd, Ricky jumps off the stage hoping to be rescued, but flies into a murderous rage when the agent makes fun of him. Ricky tears his agent's head off and the crowd runs screaming into the night, with Elijah simply noting \"that's what I call entertainment.\"\n\nThe next day, Ricky discovers to his horror that he is seeing a floating specter of Stuey. He angrily shoos Stuey's astral form away, but Cowboy states that only a pair of soulmates can have such a strong telepathic bond. After multiple failed attempts to sell the story to newspapers Stuey manages to sell Ricky's story to the [[Weekly World News|''Weekly World News'']], but ends up being captured by a group of businessmen that work for E.E.S.\n\nRicky tries to escape by stealing the outfit of a milkman, only to be captured by Skuggs's gun-toting Rastafarian eyeball henchmen and brought before Elijah. Skuggs tells Ricky he plans to have him fully-mutated into a blood-thirsty monster who will kill all the other freaks at the next show. On his way back to the freaks shed, he runs into the other freaks also making an escape attempt, all dressed as milkmen. Ricky butts heads with Ortiz and the two fight until Ortiz is distracted by a squirrel and runs off, the Rasta eyeballs in pursuit. With Ortiz gone, Ricky is named the new freaks leader. Ricky and the freaks break into Skuggs's lab to create a serum that will complete Ricky's mutation and have him kill Skuggs instead of the freaks. Ricky accidentally leaves the concoction in the lab, but finds a bag of macaroons which the freaks enjoy.\n\nRicky eventually finds out that E.E.S. has been supplying Elijah's with Zygrot, and they arrive at Freek Land with new shipment and an imprisoned Stuey Gluck. As they discuss their plans to mutate the world's population into a race of E.E.S. workers and consumers, Stuey follows a telepathic tip from Ricky and manages to escape, grabbing the coffee can of mutation goo left behind by Ricky along the way.\n\nOn the night of the show, Stuey appears with the batch of Zygrot only to have an annoyed biker dump it onto him, which turns him into a grotesque seven-foot monster. Stuey kills the biker and prepares to storm the stage and save Ricky. The Rasta eyeballs attempt to kill Stuey but he kicks dust into their eyes, blinding them. Toad tries to swallow Stuey only for Julie and Ernie to throw an M80 onto Toad's tongue which he swallows and promptly explodes. In response, Elijah infects Ricky with his own Zygrot, turning him into an equally grotesque seven-foot monster. As Ricky and Stuey battle to the death onstage, Elijah notices the E.E.S. executives trying to steal his equipment. Elijah stops them by soaking them with a Zygrot bazooka, mutating and merging them all into a giant, fleshy shoe.\n\nRight before Ricky is about to destroy Stuey, Cowboy reminds him that Stuey is his soulmate. A wave of compassion comes over him, and he gives Stuey a hug. Enraged, Elijah unsuccessfully tries to fight Ricky, who bashes him in the head, breaking his spine. Skuggs tries to get Ricky not to kill him by offering him the antidote for his mutation, telling him it was a time-delayed serum baked into a batch of macaroons. Ricky comments that he skimped on the sugar and punches Skuggs, tossing him into the vat of Zygrot 24. An FBI task force arrives to save Ricky after having learned of Stuey's article. Skuggs suddenly reemerges from the Vat, having taken the form of Skye Daley. The FBI task force guns Skuggs/Skye down.\n\nBack at the interview, it's revealed that Ricky has returned to normal (along with most of the other freaks, except for Worm, who hates Macaroons). They are then joined by Ortiz who has finally caught the squirrel and Stuey, still a giant super-freak. Skye comments on Elijah mutating to look like her, and Ricky realizes that Skye actually is Elijah. Skuggs lunges after Ricky with a [[machete]], only to be gunned down by the now normal Julie. As she embraces Ricky, Skye rises again, this time to be gunned down by Ernie. Ricky and Julie kiss and everyone waves farewell to the audience until the film ends on a frozen shot of Skuggs once again rising up to attack Ricky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Alex Winter]] as Ricky Coogin\n*[[Michael Stoyanov]] as Ernie\n*[[Megan Ward]] as Julie\n*[[Randy Quaid]] as Elijah C.

Winter, Stern and Surfers frontman [[Gibby Haynes]] began work on the first draft of the script, envisioning it as an obscene, ultra-violent horror film once again featuring the Butthole Surfers, costing around $100,000.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The idea was, as Alex Winter put it, \"''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' meets ''[[The Evil Dead]]''\".<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web|url=http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |title=The Official Freekland Website |accessdate=2007-09-21 |author=Freekland.com |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924112458/http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2010 }}</ref> The two fished the script around to various studios for years, but to no avail.\n\nFollowing the end of production on Stern and Winter's MTV sketch comedy show ''[[The Idiot Box (TV series)|The Idiot Box]]'', staff writer Tim Burns was recruited to join the two in a number of rewrites. The film was completely revisioned, dropping the aspect of the Butthole Surfers entirely and turning it into a full comedy in the vein of the ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' and ''[[MAD Magazine]]''-inspired humour that was present in ''The Idiot Box''.<ref name=\"Conversation\">{{cite video|people=Burns,Tim|title=A Conversation with Tim Burns|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=Anchor Bay}}</ref>\n\nWinter and Stern pitched the idea to [[20th Century Fox]]. [[Joe Roth]], the head of the studio at that time, loved the idea and offered the two a twelve million dollar deal to direct it, despite the fact that neither of them had any experience directing a major Hollywood film and had never even shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] before. The only condition was that the film had to be rewritten and toned down to fit a [[PG-13]] rating; therefore, most of the profanity was written out of the final draft to fit MPAA standards. Within a month of being picked up, the film began production.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nThe makeup effects requirements for the film were so substantial, and the lead time before filming was so short, the makeup effects characters for the film were designed and created by three different companies: [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner's]] company [[Alterian, Inc.]], Steve Johnson's XFX, Inc., and Screaming Mad George's Studio.\n\n20th Century Fox had such high expectations for the film that they released a number of products based on it, including a line of action figures, a novelization and, most notably, a comic book released by Hamilton Comics (however, since the comic was drawn before most of the casting was completed, none of its characters look anything like their real-life counterparts).<ref name=officialsite/>\n\n===Complications===\nDuring filming, Joe Roth was fired as studio head by [[Rupert Murdoch]] and replaced with [[Peter Chernin]], who didn't like the film nor the fact that twelve million dollars was being invested in it.<ref name=officialsite/> Chernin cut the film's post-production budget, thus forcing a lot of the soundtrack (including a demo song that [[Iggy Pop]] had recorded for the closing credits) and special effects to be greatly cut down or eliminated altogether.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The film's title was changed, as well, from the poorly received \"''Hideous Mutant Freekz''\" to the supposedly more accessible \"''Freaked''\", a title neither Winter nor Stern much cared for.\n\nAfter several poor test screenings, Fox chose to pull the film from a nationwide release and cut its advertising budget, leaving no money for commercials or newspaper ads.<ref name=\"Conversation\"/> ''Freaked'' had its official premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 1993. Despite initial positive critical response, the film opened October 3, 1993 in the United States on only two screens, making a mere $6,957 in its first weekend.<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109838/business|title=IMDb Business Statistics for 'Freaked'|accessdate=2007-09-21|author=IMDb.com|year=2005|publisher=}}</ref> It quickly dropped out of theatres, making less than $30,000 and becoming a failure at the box-office, and was released on [[VHS]] on April 20, 1994.\n\n==Reception==\n''Freaked'' received a mostly mixed response from critics.

The film was also nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Make-up.\n\n==Home media==\nOn July 12, 2005, [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] and 20th Century Fox released a special-edition two-disc DVD, featuring extra material, including deleted scenes, audio commentary, behind-the-scenes footage and two short films from Alex Winter and Tom Stern, the 15-minute film noir parody ''Squeal Of Death'' and a black-and-white skit titled ''NYU Sight & Sound Project''. This DVD has since gone out of print.\n\nOn August 6, 2013, Anchor Bay and [[Starz Inc.]] re-released the movie on DVD and Blu-ray.

Winter, Stern and Surfers frontman [[Gibby Haynes]] began work on the first draft of the script, envisioning it as an obscene, ultra-violent horror film once again featuring the Butthole Surfers, costing around $100,000.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The idea was, as Alex Winter put it, \"''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' meets ''[[The Evil Dead]]''\".<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web|url=http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |title=The Official Freekland Website |accessdate=2007-09-21 |author=Freekland.com |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924112458/http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2010 }}</ref> The two fished the script around to various studios for years, but to no avail.\n\nFollowing the end of production on Stern and Winter's MTV sketch comedy show ''[[The Idiot Box (TV series)|The Idiot Box]]'', staff writer Tim Burns was recruited to join the two in a number of rewrites. The film was completely revisioned, dropping the aspect of the Butthole Surfers entirely and turning it into a full comedy in the vein of the ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' and ''[[MAD Magazine]]''-inspired humour that was present in ''The Idiot Box''.<ref name=\"Conversation\">{{cite video|people=Burns,Tim|title=A Conversation with Tim Burns|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=Anchor Bay}}</ref>\n\nWinter and Stern pitched the idea to [[20th Century Fox]]. [[Joe Roth]], the head of the studio at that time, loved the idea and offered the two a twelve million dollar deal to direct it, despite the fact that neither of them had any experience directing a major Hollywood film and had never even shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] before. The only condition was that the film had to be rewritten and toned down to fit a [[PG-13]] rating; therefore, most of the profanity was written out of the final draft to fit MPAA standards. Within a month of being picked up, the film began production.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nThe makeup effects requirements for the film were so substantial, and the lead time before filming was so short, the makeup effects characters for the film were designed and created by three different companies: [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner's]] company [[Alterian, Inc.]], Steve Johnson's XFX, Inc., and Screaming Mad George's Studio.\n\n20th Century Fox had such high expectations for the film that they released a number of products based on it, including a line of action figures, a novelization and, most notably, a comic book released by Hamilton Comics (however, since the comic was drawn before most of the casting was completed, none of its characters look anything like their real-life counterparts).<ref name=officialsite/>\n\n===Complications===\nDuring filming, Joe Roth was fired as studio head by [[Rupert Murdoch]] and replaced with [[Peter Chernin]], who didn't like the film nor the fact that twelve million dollars was being invested in it.<ref name=officialsite/> Chernin cut the film's post-production budget, thus forcing a lot of the soundtrack (including a demo song that [[Iggy Pop]] had recorded for the closing credits) and special effects to be greatly cut down or eliminated altogether.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The film's title was changed, as well, from the poorly received \"''Hideous Mutant Freekz''\" to the supposedly more accessible \"''Freaked''\", a title neither Winter nor Stern much cared for.\n\nAfter several poor test screenings, Fox chose to pull the film from a nationwide release and cut its advertising budget, leaving no money for commercials or newspaper ads.<ref name=\"Conversation\"/> ''Freaked'' had its official premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 1993. Despite initial positive critical response, the film opened October 3, 1993 in the United States on only two screens, making a mere $6,957 in its first weekend.<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109838/business|title=IMDb Business Statistics for 'Freaked'|accessdate=2007-09-21|author=IMDb.com|year=2005|publisher=}}</ref> It quickly dropped out of theatres, making less than $30,000 and becoming a failure at the box-office, and was released on [[VHS]] on April 20, 1994.\n\n==Reception==\n''Freaked'' received a mostly mixed response from critics.

{"title_page": "Amanda Morgan (Dorsai)", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{notability|books|date=June 2014}}\n{{in-universe|date=June 2014}}\n{{unreferenced|article|date=June 2014}}\n}}\n\n'''Amanda Morgan''' (also ''ap Morgan'' for generations after the First Amanda -- \"ap\" is a [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[Patronymic]] similar to \"Mac\" in [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]) is the name of several [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[Gordon R. Dickson]]'s  [[Childe Cycle]] series of novels and stories. This includes the protagonist of the novella \"[[Amanda Morgan]]\" in ''[[The Spirit of Dorsai]]'' and ''[[The Dorsai Companion]]''.\n\nWithin the [[Childe Cycle]] there are several characters that have a triple nature which manifests itself in different ways (see: [[Welsh Triads]])  Amanda Morgan is one of them, and as a unique character she is a single character written as three entirely separate people.  The three characters are referred to as  The First Amanda, The Second Amanda, and The Third Amanda.  The Third Amanda is also sometimes referred to as Hal's Amanda.  \"Amanda\" as a name is appropriate, as its definition is \"One fit to be loved.\"\n\nUnlike the [[Donal Graeme]] - [[Paul Formain]] - [[Hal Mayne]] trinity  (all of whom are actually one person),  the three Amanda Morgans do not comprise one entity  or can be considered [[reincarnation]]s.  Each of the characters has a subtly different personality and motivation, while sharing a common name, appearance, and family.  In addition, each of their personal stories can be considered important to the overall narrative while at the same time being background or color.  Only the Third Amanda is a main character in the [[Childe Cycle]] proper.\n\nEach of the Three Amandas can also be looked at as an evolution of the previous character.  This evolution can be equated with that of The [[Dorsai]] culture.  The first Amanda's responsibility is directly related to her family and immediate community.  The Second Amanda's responsibility is for The Dorsai as a whole.  The Third Amanda's responsibility transcends the other two and encompasses the whole of humanity.  Paralleling this, The Dorsai as a people begin as simple mercenary soldiers interested in making a living.  By the Second Amanda's life they have developed a moral code and reputation as a society that protects them as a whole. Finally, as embodied by the Third Amanda, The Dorsai become the protectors of all humanity and its potentiality.\n\nAll three Amandas are at some time in their lives members of the Grey Captains.  (The First Amanda belonged to a proto-group that does not share this name, but is clearly the predecessor of the Grey Captains.) This informal group of important individuals are what amounts to government on The Dorsai.  The fact that the Third Amanda and to a certain extent the Second Amanda are significantly younger than most of the Grey Captains is some insight into the importance of the Morgan family on The Dorsai as a whole.  As a final evolution of the character The Third Amanda becomes what amounts to the single leader of a very individualistic culture.  Something that Donal Graeme never wanted or managed to do.\n\n==The Amandas==\n===The First Amanda===\n\nThis poem begins \"[[Amanda Morgan]]\", one of a series of stories referred to as \"illuminations\" that are not part of the [[Childe Cycle]] proper.  It was written specifically for The First Amanda by her son James.  All of her descendants were musically talented. \n \n<blockquote>\nStone are my walls, and my roof is of timber;<br/>\nBut the hands of my builder are stronger by far.<br/>\nThe roof may be burned and my stones may be scattered<br/>\nNever her light be defeated in war...<br/>\n: (Song of the house called \"Fal Morgan\")\n</blockquote>\n\nThe First Amanda was born in [[Caernarfon]], [[Wales]] on Earth, around the same time as the novel ''[[Necromancer (novel)|Necromancer]]''.  Apparently married young, she had one child while on Earth before her husband died.   After his death, her in-laws used legal means and influence to remove the child from her custody.  The First Amanda here shows the signs of her indomitable character by physically stealing the child back from them, and then emigrating immediately from the Earth to the new colony of Newton.  Unfortunately the process caused much psychological damage to the child,  who was thereafter prone to uncontrollable fits of rage.  Much of the rest of The First Amanda's life is devoted to caring for this child and founding the Morgan Family, though a second husband on Newton and her final husband on The Dorsai.  In spite of these two husbands, the ap Morgan family is descended entirely from The First Amanda through her first child, James.\n\nLater in her life The First Amanda played the role of Matriarch for both her family and the community as a whole.   This role culminated in her key position in the defense of The Dorsai against Dow deCastries and the combined Earth expeditionary forces, at the age of 93.   This accomplishment could be considered secondary to her influence on the culture and morals of The Dorsai as a whole, were it not that this single incident was instrumental in the evolution of that people.  These events are chronicled in the novella, \"[[Amanda Morgan]]\", and the novel, ''[[Tactics of Mistake]]''.\n\n===The Second Amanda===\n\nBorn a generation after the death of the First Amanda, The Second Amanda was named [[Elaine (legend)]] (See also: [[Elaine of Astolat]].)  Due to the importance and strong character of the First Amanda, none of her decedents dared to name a girl child after her.  However, by the time The Second Amanda was six years old people were already referring to her as \"The Second Amanda\" due to her uncanny resemblance to her ancestor.   That name stuck, and Elaine was thereafter only a footnote in family histories.\n\nThe Second Amanda is known chiefly as an expert in contracts and legality for The [[Dorsai]].  While this makes her important to The [[Dorsai]] of her time, her real influence is in her relationship with the Graeme family.   The Second Amanda is the one that both of the twins, Ian and Kensie Graeme were in love with, yet she was in love with only one.  This unlikely love triangle led by stages to several important consequences.   Ian, knowing his brother was passionately interested in Amanda, refused to pursue her and married another woman.  The Second Amanda, however, was not interested in Kensie at all.  Her interest was entirely for Ian, who was then unavailable.\n\nThis untenable position caused all three individuals to be unhappy, and in the end led indirectly to the death of Kensie.  This would not normally be an event of note, except that it released Ian to be of use to his nephew [[Donal Graeme]] in uniting the known worlds.  The Second Amanda never married, but much later in her life managed a relationship with Ian Graeme after his first wife had died.  As heads of their respective families they maintained continuity of tradition and responsibility amongst The Dorsai. These events are chronicled in the stories ''Lost Dorsai'', ''Brothers'', and [[Soldier, Ask Not]].  Further background is  provided in [[The Final Encyclopedia]] and the interludes of [[The Spirit of Dorsai]].\n\n===The Third Amanda===\nThe Second Amanda, knowing the family's tradition against naming girl children Amanda, made sure that when a suitable girl was born the name was passed on.  The Third Amanda grew up under the tutelage of her namesake, and grew in her own time to be an expert in contracts and also a head of her family.   Perhaps the most important moment in her life is when she meets [[Hal Mayne]].  This leads her  eventually  to be one of his chief advisors, part of The [[Dorsai]] forces defending Earth, and eventually his lover and de facto wife.\n\nThe Third Amanda's support for Hal Mayne is part of another trilogy of characters that combine the three parts of humanity as [[Gordon R. Dickson]] envisions.   She is the strength, the courage, and the competence that complements the other two muses in his life.  [[Rukh Tamani]], who embodies Faith, and [[Ajela]] who embodies Understanding being these other two components based on the [[Childe Cycle]] splinter cultures.  The interesting thing is that each of these three characters embodies all three of the important philosophies: Courage, Faith, Understanding.   The only difference is their emphasis of one over the other two.  The Third Amanda certainly possesses both Faith and Understanding, but it is her Courage and Personal Responsibility that are paramount to her character.\n\nAs part of this collection of three interconnected characters the Third Amanda represents The [[Dorsai]], which in many ways each of the Amandas represents for their era.  All of the novels are filled with  these triple representations of the three splinter cultures in different forms.  The Amanda character is probably the most well defined and rounded of these, with the possible exception of the  [[Donal Graeme]] - [[Paul Formain]] - [[Hal Mayne]] trinity.  She is also one of a select few characters to appear in several stories, and like Ian Graeme to have an illumination story directly focused on her.  In this she has become one of the classic characters in [[Science Fiction]].\n\n==External links==\n*{{isfdb title|id=2081|title=Dorsai!}}\n*{{isfdb title|id=3732|title=Necromancer}}\n*{{isfdb title|id=3734|title=Soldier Ask Not}}\n*{{isfdb title|id=1056|title=Tactics of Mistake}}\n*{{isfdb title|id=3733|title=The Spirit of Dorsai}} (collection containing \"Amanda Morgan\" and \"Brothers\")\n*{{isfdb title|id=39253|title=Lost Dorsai}} (collection containing \"Lost Dorsai\" and \"Warrior\")\n*{{isfdb title|id=3736|title=The Final Encyclopedia}}\n*{{isfdb title|id=3738|title=The Chantry Guild}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in written science fiction|Morgan, Amanda]]\n[[Category:Gordon R.

As a result, the U.S. GDP per capita converged on and eventually surpassed that of the UK, as well as other nations that it previously trailed economically. The economy maintained high wages, attracting immigrants by the millions from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn the early 1800s, the United States was largely agricultural with more than 80 percent of the population in farming. Most of the manufacturing centered on the first stages of transformation of raw materials with lumber and saw mills, textiles and boots and shoes leading the way. The rich resource endowments contributed to the rapid economic expansion during the nineteenth century. Ample land availability allowed the number of farmers to keep growing, but activity in manufacturing, services, transportation and other sectors grew at a much faster pace. Thus, by 1860 the share of the farm population in the U.S. had fallen from over 80 percent to roughly 50 percent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s.

Yet, even in the United States, the wars meant sacrifice. During the peak of Second World War activity, nearly 40 percent of U.S. GDP was devoted to war production. Decisions about large swaths of the economy were largely made for military purposes and nearly all relevant inputs were allocated to the war effort. Many goods were rationed, prices and wages controlled and many durable consumer goods were no longer produced. Large segments of the workforce were inducted into the military, paid half wages, and roughly half of those were sent into harm's way.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The government provides insurance coverage for approximately 53 million elderly via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], 62 million lower-income persons via [[Medicaid]], and 15 million military veterans via the [[Veteran's Administration]]. About 178 million employed by companies receive subsidized health insurance through their employer, while 52 million other persons directly purchase insurance either via the subsidized marketplace exchanges developed as part of the [[Affordable Care Act]] or directly from insurers. The private sector delivers healthcare services, with the exception of the Veteran's Administration, where doctors are employed by the government.<ref name=\"Census2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html|title=Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2016|first=US Census|last=Bureau|website=census.gov}}</ref>\n\nMultiple surveys indicate the number of uninsured fell between 2013 and 2016 due to expanded [[Medicaid]] eligibility and health insurance exchanges established due to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known as the \"ACA\" or \"Obamacare\". According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], in 2012 there were 45.6 million people in the US (14.8% of the under-65 population) who were without health insurance. Following the implementation of major ACA provisions in 2013, this figure fell by 18.3 million or 40%, to 27.3 million by 2016 or 8.6% of the under-65 population.<ref name=\"Census_HistTable\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hic.html|title=Health Insurance Historical Tables \u2013HIC Series|first=US Census|last=Bureau|publisher=Census}}</ref>\n\nHowever, under President Trump these gains in healthcare coverage have begun to reverse. The [[Commonwealth Fund]] estimated in May 2018 that the number of uninsured increased by 4 million from early 2016 to early 2018. The rate of those uninsured increased from 12.7% in 2016 to 15.5%. The impact was greater among lower-income adults, who had a higher uninsured rate than higher-income adults. Regionally, the South and West had higher uninsured rates than the North and East.

Regulation falls into two general categories.\n\nSome efforts seek, either directly or indirectly, to control prices. Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated [[monopoly|monopolies]] such as electric utilities while allowing prices in the level that would ensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great Depression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural goods, which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply and demand. A number of other industries\u2014trucking and, later, airlines\u2014successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful price-cutting, a process called [[regulatory capture]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Regulation and Control in the U.S. Economy: About.com</ref>\n\nAnother form of economic regulation, [[Competition law|antitrust law]], seeks to strengthen market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary. The government\u2014and, sometimes, private parties\u2014have used antitrust law to prohibit practices or mergers that would unduly limit competition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Bank regulation in the United States]] is highly fragmented compared to other [[Group of Ten (economic)|G10]] countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level. The U.S. also has one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-[[usury]] lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.\n\nSince the 1970s, government has also exercised control over private companies to achieve social goals, such as improving the public's health and safety or maintaining a healthy environment. For example, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] provides and enforces standards for workplace safety, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides standards and regulations to maintain air, water, and land resources. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates what drugs may reach the market, and also provides standards of disclosure for food products.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAmerican attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the final three decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, policy makers grew increasingly convinced that economic regulation protected companies at the expense of consumers in industries such as airlines and trucking. At the same time, technological changes spawned new competitors in some industries, such as telecommunications, that once were considered natural monopolies. Both developments led to a succession of laws easing regulation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhile leaders of America's two most influential political parties generally favored economic [[deregulation]] during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there was less agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals. Social regulation had assumed growing importance in the years following the Depression and World War II, and again in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, the government relaxed labor, consumer and environmental rules based on the idea that such regulation interfered with [[free enterprise]], increased the costs of doing business, and thus contributed to inflation. The response to such changes is mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about specific events or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations in some areas, including environmental protection.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhere legislative channels have been unresponsive, some citizens have turned to the courts to address social issues more quickly. For instance, in the 1990s, individuals, and eventually the government itself, sued tobacco companies over the health risks of cigarette smoking. The 1998 [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]] provided states with long-term payments to cover medical costs to treat smoking-related illnesses.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBetween 2000 and 2008, economic regulation in the United States saw the most rapid expansion since the early 1970s. The number of new pages in the Federal Registry, a proxy for economic regulation, rose from 64,438 new pages in 2001 to 78,090 in new pages in 2007, a record amount of regulation. Economically significant regulations, defined as regulations which cost more than $100 million a year, increased by 70%. Spending on regulation increased by 62% from $26.4 billion to $42.7 billion.<ref name=\"bushregulation\">{{cite magazine|title=Bush's Regulatory Kiss-Off \u2013 Obama's assertions to the contrary, the 43rd president was the biggest regulator since Nixon|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/130328.html|magazine=Reason magazine|date=January 2009|access-date=February 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902085717/http://www.reason.com/news/show/130328.html|archive-date=September 2, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Taxation===\n{{Main|Taxation in the United States}}\n\n[[Taxation in the United States]] is a complex system which may involve payment to at least four different levels of government and many methods of taxation.

In the early 20th century, the research developed through informal cooperation between U.S. industry and academia grew rapidly and by the late 1930s exceeded the size of that taking place in Britain (although the quality of U.S. research was not yet on par with British and German research at the time). After World War II, federal spending on defense R&D and antitrust policy played a significant role in U.S. innovation.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Walker, William|title=National innovation systems : a comparative analysis|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195076172|editor1-last=Nelson|editor1-first=Richard R.|location=New York|pages=61\u201364|chapter=National Innovation Systems: Britain|ref=Walker1993|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFDGjgxc2CYC&pg=PA61}}<!-- Author profile: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/intrel/people/index.php/wbw.html--></ref>\n\nThe United States is rich in mineral resources and fertile farm soil, and it is fortunate to have a moderate climate.

[[Consumer spending]] in the U.S. rose to about 62% of GDP in 1960, where it stayed until about 1981, and has since risen to 71% in 2013.<ref name=consumerecon/> Throughout its history, the United States has experienced steady growth in the labor force, a phenomenon that is both cause and effect of almost constant economic expansion. Until shortly after World War I, most workers were immigrants from Europe, their immediate descendants, or African Americans who were mostly slaves taken from Africa, or their descendants.<ref>\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EB29BrnCMm4C&pg=PA280 Trends in International Migration 2002: Continuous Reporting System on Migration]''\".

When immigrants flooded labor markets on the East Coast, many workers moved inland, often to farmland waiting to be tilled. Similarly, economic opportunities in industrial, northern cities attracted black Americans from [[Southern United States|southern]] farms in the first half of the 20th century, in what was known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].\n\nIn the United States, the corporation has emerged as an association of owners, known as stockholders, who form a business enterprise governed by a complex set of rules and customs. Brought on by the process of [[mass production]], corporations, such as [[General Electric]], have been instrumental in shaping the United States. Through the [[stock market]], American banks and investors have grown their economy by investing and withdrawing capital from profitable corporations. Today in the era of [[globalization]], American investors and corporations have influence all over the world. The American government is also included among the major investors in the American economy. Government investments have been directed towards public works of scale (such as from the [[Hoover Dam]]), military-industrial contracts, and the financial industry.\n\n===Aging===\nThe U.S. population is aging, which has significant economic implications for GDP growth, productivity, innovation, inequality, and national debt, according to several studies. The average worker in 2019 was aged 42, vs. 38 in 2000. By 2030, about 59% of adults over 16 will be in the labor force, vs. 62% in 2015. One study estimated that aging since 2000 has reduced productivity between 0.25% and 0.7% per year. Since GDP growth is a function of productivity (output per worker) and the number of workers, both trends slow the GDP growth rate. Older workers save more, which pushes interests rates down, offsetting some of the GDP growth reduction but reducing the Federal Reserve's ability to address a recession by lowering interest rates. Means of addressing the aging trend include immigration (which theoretically brings in younger workers) and higher fertility rates, which can be encouraged by incentives to have more children (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, and more generous paid leave).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/sunday-review/work-age-economy.html?|title=This Economy Is Not Aging Gracefully |last=Porter |first=Eduardo |date=June 15, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated in May 2019 that mandatory spending (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) will continue growing relative to the size of the economy (GDP) as the population ages.

The economic recession of 2008\u20132009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R&D largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the U.S. recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business 'deaths' began overtaking the number of business 'births' and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1\u20132% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R&D spending were in agriculture production: \u22123.5% compared to the average R&D to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R&D to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R&D spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R&D had recovered.

California supplies 13.7% of all jobs in science and engineering across the country, more than any other state. Some 5.7% of Californians are employed in these fields. This high share reflects a potent combination of academic excellence and a strong business focus on R&D: the prestigious Stanford University and University of California rub shoulders with Silicon Valley, for instance. In much the same way, Route 128 around Boston in the state of Massachusetts is not only home to numerous high-tech firms and corporations but also hosts the renowned Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNew Mexico's high research intensity can be explained by the fact that it hosts the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Maryland's position may reflect the concentration of federally funded research institutions there. Washington State has a high concentration of high-tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon and Boeing and the engineering functions of most automobile manufacturers are located in the state of Michigan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Research spending by multinational corporations ===\nThe federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer tax credits to particular industries and companies to encourage them to engage in research and development (R&D). Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years. According to a survey by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making decisions about investing in R&D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2014, four U.S. multinational corporations figured in the Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&D: Microsoft, Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Google. Several have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included in this table for the first time in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Global top 50 companies by R&D volume and intensity, 2014'''\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> R&D intensity is defined as R&D expenditure divided by net sales.\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Although incorporated in the Netherlands, Airbus's principal manufacturing facilities are located in France, Germany, Spain and the UK.\nSource: ''UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030'' (2015), Table 9.3, based on Hern\u00e1ndez ''et. al'' (2014) ''EU R&D Scoreboard: the 2014 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard''.

Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 5.10, based on Comtrade database]]\nThe United States has lost its world leadership for high-tech goods. Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere. Until 2010, the United States was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals but, since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods.\n\nThe United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Notable companies and markets==\n{{See also|Forbes 500|Fortune 500}}\n[[File:Walmart exterior.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Walmart discount department store (location: [[Laredo, Texas]]).]]\nIn 2011, the 20 [[List of companies by revenue|largest U.S.-based companies by revenue]] were [[Walmart]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[ConocoPhillips]], [[Fannie Mae]], [[General Electric]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]], [[Cargill]], [[McKesson Corporation]], [[Bank of America]], [[Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Verizon]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], and [[Cardinal Health]].\n\nIn 2013, eight of the world's ten [[List of corporations by market capitalization|largest companies by market capitalization]] were American: [[Apple Inc.]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[Walmart]], [[General Electric]], [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], and [[Chevron Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/indepth/ft500|title=FT 500 2013|work=ft.com}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Fortune Global 500]] 2011, the [[List of largest employers|ten largest U.S. employers]] were [[Walmart]], [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]], [[IBM]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[McDonald's]], [[Target Corporation]], [[Kroger]], [[The Home Depot]], [[General Electric]], and [[Sears Holdings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/global500/2011/|title=Global 500 |work=Fortune}}</ref>\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Microsoft]] are the world's five most valuable brands in an index published by Millward Brown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-brand-idUSTRE74800D20110509|title=Apple usurps Google as world's most valuable brand|date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2017|via=Reuters}}</ref>\n\nA 2012 Deloitte report published in ''STORES'' magazine indicated that of the world's top 250 largest retailers by retail sales revenue in fiscal year 2010, 32% of those retailers were based in the United States, and those 32% accounted for 41% of the total retail sales revenue of the top 250.<ref>Deloitte, ''Switching Channels: Global Powers of Retailing 2012'', ''STORES'', January 2012, G20.</ref>\n[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] is the world's largest online retailer.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2013/07/24/alibaba-a-threat-to-amazon-ebay-walmart-and-everyone-else/ |title=Alibaba Is A Threat To Amazon, eBay, Walmart And Everyone Else |magazine=Forbes.com |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |first=Walter |last=Loeb}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/04/23/wal-mart-vs-amazon-worlds-biggest-e-commerce-battle-could-boil-down-to-vegetables/ |title=Wal-Mart Vs.

In the long run, the U.S. stock market is profoundly affected by shocks that reallocate the rewards of a given level of production between workers and shareholders. Productivity shocks, however, play a small role in historical stock market fluctuations at all horizons in the U.S. stock market.<ref>[http://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/ludvigsons/osf.pdf Origins of Stock Market Fluctuations].

Over the same period, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New York City's finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by 2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in the U.S., and over 1,800 with more.\n\nTop ten U.S. banks by assets<ref name=\"money.msn.com\">[http://money.msn.com/ Stock quotes, investing & personal finance, news \u2013 MSN Money] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506025118/http://money.msn.com/ |date=May 6, 2013 }}.

Most of the manufacturing centered on the first stages of transformation of raw materials with lumber and saw mills, textiles and boots and shoes leading the way. The rich resource endowments contributed to the rapid economic expansion during the nineteenth century. Ample land availability allowed the number of farmers to keep growing, but activity in manufacturing, services, transportation and other sectors grew at a much faster pace. Thus, by 1860 the share of the farm population in the U.S. had fallen from over 80 percent to roughly 50 percent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s.

Yet, even in the United States, the wars meant sacrifice. During the peak of Second World War activity, nearly 40 percent of U.S. GDP was devoted to war production. Decisions about large swaths of the economy were largely made for military purposes and nearly all relevant inputs were allocated to the war effort. Many goods were rationed, prices and wages controlled and many durable consumer goods were no longer produced. Large segments of the workforce were inducted into the military, paid half wages, and roughly half of those were sent into harm's way.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

In most cases, this has been due to moving the manufacture of goods formerly made in the U.S. to countries where they could be made for sufficiently less money to cover the cost of shipping plus a higher profit. In other cases, some countries have gradually learned to produce the same products and services that previously only the U.S. and a few other countries could produce.

Homeowners were borrowing against their bubble-priced homes to fuel consumption, driving up their debt levels while providing an unsustainable boost to GDP. When housing prices began falling in 2006, the value of securities backed by mortgages fell dramatically, causing the equivalent of a [[bank run]] in the essentially unregulated [[shadow banking|non-depository]] banking system, which had outgrown the traditional, regulated depository banking system.

The government provides insurance coverage for approximately 53 million elderly via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], 62 million lower-income persons via [[Medicaid]], and 15 million military veterans via the [[Veteran's Administration]]. About 178 million employed by companies receive subsidized health insurance through their employer, while 52 million other persons directly purchase insurance either via the subsidized marketplace exchanges developed as part of the [[Affordable Care Act]] or directly from insurers. The private sector delivers healthcare services, with the exception of the Veteran's Administration, where doctors are employed by the government.<ref name=\"Census2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html|title=Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2016|first=US Census|last=Bureau|website=census.gov}}</ref>\n\nMultiple surveys indicate the number of uninsured fell between 2013 and 2016 due to expanded [[Medicaid]] eligibility and health insurance exchanges established due to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known as the \"ACA\" or \"Obamacare\". According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], in 2012 there were 45.6 million people in the US (14.8% of the under-65 population) who were without health insurance. Following the implementation of major ACA provisions in 2013, this figure fell by 18.3 million or 40%, to 27.3 million by 2016 or 8.6% of the under-65 population.<ref name=\"Census_HistTable\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hic.html|title=Health Insurance Historical Tables \u2013HIC Series|first=US Census|last=Bureau|publisher=Census}}</ref>\n\nHowever, under President Trump these gains in healthcare coverage have begun to reverse. The [[Commonwealth Fund]] estimated in May 2018 that the number of uninsured increased by 4 million from early 2016 to early 2018. The rate of those uninsured increased from 12.7% in 2016 to 15.5%. The impact was greater among lower-income adults, who had a higher uninsured rate than higher-income adults. Regionally, the South and West had higher uninsured rates than the North and East. Further, those 18 states that have not expanded Medicaid had a higher uninsured rate than those that did.<ref>[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2018/apr/health-coverage-erosion Commonwealth Fund \u2013 First Look at Health Insurance Coverage in 2018 Finds ACA Gains Beginning to Reverse]</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Physicians for a National Health Program]], this lack of insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths per year.<ref name=uninsureddeaths>{{cite web |last= Woolhandler |first= S. |date= September 12, 2012 |title= Despite slight drop in uninsured, last year's figure points to 48,000 preventable deaths |publisher= Physicians for a National Health Program |url= http://www.pnhp.org/news/2012/september/despite-slight-drop-in-uninsured-last-year%E2%80%99s-figure-points-to-48000-preventable- |accessdate= September 26, 2012 |display-authors= etal |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120924021844/http://www.pnhp.org/news/2012/september/despite-slight-drop-in-uninsured-last-year%E2%80%99s-figure-points-to-48000-preventable- |archive-date= September 24, 2012 |url-status= dead }}</ref> The group's methodology has been criticized by [[John C.

Regulation falls into two general categories.\n\nSome efforts seek, either directly or indirectly, to control prices. Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated [[monopoly|monopolies]] such as electric utilities while allowing prices in the level that would ensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great Depression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural goods, which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply and demand. A number of other industries\u2014trucking and, later, airlines\u2014successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful price-cutting, a process called [[regulatory capture]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Regulation and Control in the U.S. Economy: About.com</ref>\n\nAnother form of economic regulation, [[Competition law|antitrust law]], seeks to strengthen market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary. The government\u2014and, sometimes, private parties\u2014have used antitrust law to prohibit practices or mergers that would unduly limit competition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Bank regulation in the United States]] is highly fragmented compared to other [[Group of Ten (economic)|G10]] countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level. The U.S. also has one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-[[usury]] lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.\n\nSince the 1970s, government has also exercised control over private companies to achieve social goals, such as improving the public's health and safety or maintaining a healthy environment. For example, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] provides and enforces standards for workplace safety, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides standards and regulations to maintain air, water, and land resources. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates what drugs may reach the market, and also provides standards of disclosure for food products.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAmerican attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the final three decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, policy makers grew increasingly convinced that economic regulation protected companies at the expense of consumers in industries such as airlines and trucking. At the same time, technological changes spawned new competitors in some industries, such as telecommunications, that once were considered natural monopolies. Both developments led to a succession of laws easing regulation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhile leaders of America's two most influential political parties generally favored economic [[deregulation]] during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there was less agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals. Social regulation had assumed growing importance in the years following the Depression and World War II, and again in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, the government relaxed labor, consumer and environmental rules based on the idea that such regulation interfered with [[free enterprise]], increased the costs of doing business, and thus contributed to inflation. The response to such changes is mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about specific events or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations in some areas, including environmental protection.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhere legislative channels have been unresponsive, some citizens have turned to the courts to address social issues more quickly.

When immigrants flooded labor markets on the East Coast, many workers moved inland, often to farmland waiting to be tilled. Similarly, economic opportunities in industrial, northern cities attracted black Americans from [[Southern United States|southern]] farms in the first half of the 20th century, in what was known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].\n\nIn the United States, the corporation has emerged as an association of owners, known as stockholders, who form a business enterprise governed by a complex set of rules and customs. Brought on by the process of [[mass production]], corporations, such as [[General Electric]], have been instrumental in shaping the United States. Through the [[stock market]], American banks and investors have grown their economy by investing and withdrawing capital from profitable corporations. Today in the era of [[globalization]], American investors and corporations have influence all over the world. The American government is also included among the major investors in the American economy. Government investments have been directed towards public works of scale (such as from the [[Hoover Dam]]), military-industrial contracts, and the financial industry.\n\n===Aging===\nThe U.S. population is aging, which has significant economic implications for GDP growth, productivity, innovation, inequality, and national debt, according to several studies. The average worker in 2019 was aged 42, vs. 38 in 2000. By 2030, about 59% of adults over 16 will be in the labor force, vs. 62% in 2015. One study estimated that aging since 2000 has reduced productivity between 0.25% and 0.7% per year. Since GDP growth is a function of productivity (output per worker) and the number of workers, both trends slow the GDP growth rate. Older workers save more, which pushes interests rates down, offsetting some of the GDP growth reduction but reducing the Federal Reserve's ability to address a recession by lowering interest rates. Means of addressing the aging trend include immigration (which theoretically brings in younger workers) and higher fertility rates, which can be encouraged by incentives to have more children (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, and more generous paid leave).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/sunday-review/work-age-economy.html?|title=This Economy Is Not Aging Gracefully |last=Porter |first=Eduardo |date=June 15, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated in May 2019 that mandatory spending (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) will continue growing relative to the size of the economy (GDP) as the population ages.

However, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1,799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1,005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the state of California, which alone concentrates 28% of U.S. research.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=United States of America.

Other countries are given for comparison. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030]]\nThe United States of America invests more funds in research and development (R&D) in absolute terms than the other G7 nations combined: 17.2% more in 2012. Since 2000, gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) in the USA has increased by 31.2%, enabling it to maintain its share of GERD among the G7 nations at 54.0% (54.2% in 2000).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Impact of recession on research spending ===\nGenerally speaking, U.S. investment in R&D rose with the economy in the first years of the century before receding slightly during the economic recession then rising again as growth resumed. At its peak in 2009, GERD amounted to US$ 406 billion (2.82% of GDP). Despite the recession, it was still at 2.79% in 2012 and will slide only marginally to 2.73% in 2013, according to provisional data, and should remain at a similar level in 2014.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe federal government is the primary funder of basic research, at 52.6% in 2012; state governments, universities and other non-profits funded 26%. Experimental development, on the other hand, is primarily funded by industry: 76.4% to the federal government's 22.1% in 2012.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:World shares of GDP, GERD, researchers and publications for the G20, 2009 and 2013.svg|thumb|World shares of GDP, research spending, researchers and scientific publications, 2009 and 2013.

American supremacy is eroding in this respect, even as other nations\u2014China, in particular\u2014are carrying their own investment in R&D to new heights. Between 2009 and 2012, the United States' world share of research expenditure receded slightly from 30.5% to 28.1%. Several countries now devote more than 4% of GDP to R&D (Israel, Japan and the Republic of Korea) and others plan to raise their own GERD/GDP ratio to 4% by 2020 (Finland and Sweden).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Business spending on research ===\nBusiness enterprises contributed 59.1 % of U.S. GERD in 2012, down from 69.0 % in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute a small fraction of total R&D, 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:R&D budget by US agency, 1994\u20132014.svg|thumb|US research and development budget by government agency, 1994\u20132014.

The economic recession of 2008\u20132009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R&D largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the U.S. recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business 'deaths' began overtaking the number of business 'births' and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1\u20132% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R&D spending were in agriculture production: \u22123.5% compared to the average R&D to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R&D to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R&D spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R&D had recovered. Whether this continues will be contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal research funding and the general business climate.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Research spending at the state level ===\n{{See also|List of U.S. states by research and development spending}}\nThe level of research spending varies considerably from one state to another. Six states (New Mexico, Maryland, Massachusetts, Washington, California and Michigan) each devoted 3.9% or more of their GDP to R&D in 2010, together contributing 42% of national research expenditure. In 2010, more than one quarter of R&D was concentrated in California (28.1%), ahead of Massachusetts (5.7%), New Jersey (5.6%), Washington State (5.5%), Michigan (5.4%), Texas (5.2%), Illinois (4.8%), New York (3.6%) and Pennsylvania (3.5%). Seven states (Arkansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, Louisiana, South Dakota and Wyoming) devoted less than 0.8% of GDP to R&D.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Science and engineering in the USA by state, 2010.svg|thumb|Science and engineering in the United States of America by state. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 5.6, based on data from American Association for the Advancement of Science]]\nCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley, the name given to the area hosting the leading corporations and start-ups in information technology. This state also hosts dynamic biotechnology clusters in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego. The main biotechnology clusters outside California are the cities of Boston/Cambridge, Massachusetts, Maryland, suburban Washington, DC, New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Chicago. California supplies 13.7% of all jobs in science and engineering across the country, more than any other state. Some 5.7% of Californians are employed in these fields. This high share reflects a potent combination of academic excellence and a strong business focus on R&D: the prestigious Stanford University and University of California rub shoulders with Silicon Valley, for instance. In much the same way, Route 128 around Boston in the state of Massachusetts is not only home to numerous high-tech firms and corporations but also hosts the renowned Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNew Mexico's high research intensity can be explained by the fact that it hosts the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Maryland's position may reflect the concentration of federally funded research institutions there. Washington State has a high concentration of high-tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon and Boeing and the engineering functions of most automobile manufacturers are located in the state of Michigan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Research spending by multinational corporations ===\nThe federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer tax credits to particular industries and companies to encourage them to engage in research and development (R&D). Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years. According to a survey by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making decisions about investing in R&D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2014, four U.S. multinational corporations figured in the Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&D: Microsoft, Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Google. Several have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included in this table for the first time in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Global top 50 companies by R&D volume and intensity, 2014'''\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> R&D intensity is defined as R&D expenditure divided by net sales.\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Although incorporated in the Netherlands, Airbus's principal manufacturing facilities are located in France, Germany, Spain and the UK.\nSource: ''UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030'' (2015), Table 9.3, based on Hern\u00e1ndez ''et. al'' (2014) ''EU R&D Scoreboard: the 2014 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard''.

Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere. Until 2010, the United States was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals but, since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods.\n\nThe United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Notable companies and markets==\n{{See also|Forbes 500|Fortune 500}}\n[[File:Walmart exterior.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Walmart discount department store (location: [[Laredo, Texas]]).]]\nIn 2011, the 20 [[List of companies by revenue|largest U.S.-based companies by revenue]] were [[Walmart]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[ConocoPhillips]], [[Fannie Mae]], [[General Electric]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]], [[Cargill]], [[McKesson Corporation]], [[Bank of America]], [[Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Verizon]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], and [[Cardinal Health]].\n\nIn 2013, eight of the world's ten [[List of corporations by market capitalization|largest companies by market capitalization]] were American: [[Apple Inc.]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[Walmart]], [[General Electric]], [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], and [[Chevron Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/indepth/ft500|title=FT 500 2013|work=ft.com}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Fortune Global 500]] 2011, the [[List of largest employers|ten largest U.S. employers]] were [[Walmart]], [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]], [[IBM]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[McDonald's]], [[Target Corporation]], [[Kroger]], [[The Home Depot]], [[General Electric]], and [[Sears Holdings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/global500/2011/|title=Global 500 |work=Fortune}}</ref>\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Microsoft]] are the world's five most valuable brands in an index published by Millward Brown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-brand-idUSTRE74800D20110509|title=Apple usurps Google as world's most valuable brand|date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2017|via=Reuters}}</ref>\n\nA 2012 Deloitte report published in ''STORES'' magazine indicated that of the world's top 250 largest retailers by retail sales revenue in fiscal year 2010, 32% of those retailers were based in the United States, and those 32% accounted for 41% of the total retail sales revenue of the top 250.<ref>Deloitte, ''Switching Channels: Global Powers of Retailing 2012'', ''STORES'', January 2012, G20.</ref>\n[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] is the world's largest online retailer.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2013/07/24/alibaba-a-threat-to-amazon-ebay-walmart-and-everyone-else/ |title=Alibaba Is A Threat To Amazon, eBay, Walmart And Everyone Else |magazine=Forbes.com |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |first=Walter |last=Loeb}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/04/23/wal-mart-vs-amazon-worlds-biggest-e-commerce-battle-could-boil-down-to-vegetables/ |title=Wal-Mart Vs.

To provide immediate employment for its considerable workforce, the Bristol Aeroplane Company undertook the manufacture of a light car (the Bristol Monocar), the construction of car bodies for Armstrong Siddeley and bus bodies for their sister company, [[Bristol Tramways]].\n\nOn the outbreak of [[World War II]], [[Sir George Stanley White, 2nd Baronet|Sir George Stanley White]], managing director of the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] from 1911\u20131954, was determined not to suffer the same difficulties a second time. The company now employed 70,000 and he knew he must plan for the time when the voracious wartime demand for Bristol aircraft and aircraft engines would suddenly end. The company began working with AFN Ltd, makers of [[Frazer Nash]] cars and British importer of [[BMW]]s before the war, on plans for a joint venture in automotive manufacture.{{sfnp|Lawrence|1991|p=58}}\n\n[[File:Sir George Stanley Middleton White with Bristol the Bristol 450 Le Mans cars.jpg|thumb|[[Sir George Stanley White, 2nd Baronet|Sir George Stanley White]] with the Bristol 450 Le Mans cars]]\nAs early as 1941, a number of papers were written or commissioned by [[George Stanley Midelton White|George S. M. White]], Sir Stanley's son, proposing a post-war car manufacturing division. It was decided to purchase an existing manufacturer for this purpose. [[Alvis Car and Engineering Company|Alvis]], [[Aston Martin]], [[Lagonda]], [[English Racing Automobiles|ERA]] and [[Lea-Francis]] were considered.<ref name=\"Bristol Cars Website\">{{cite web |url= http://www.bristolcars.co.uk/Past/Cars-Past/ |title=The Bristol Cars Story |publisher=Bristolcars.co.uk |accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Beginning===\nA chance discussion took place in May 1945, between D. A. Aldington, a director of Frazer Nash then serving as an inspector for the wartime [[Ministry of Aircraft Production]] (MAP), and Eric Storey, an assistant of George White at the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]]. It led to the immediate take-over of Frazer Nash by the Aeroplane Company.\n\nAldington and his two brothers had marketed the Frazer Nash BMW before the war, and proposed to build an updated version after demobilisation. This seemed the perfect match for the aeroplane company's own ambitions to manufacture a high quality sports car. With the support of the War Reparations Board, H. J. Aldington travelled to [[Munich]] and purchased the rights to manufacture three BMW models and the [[BMW 328|328]] engine.\n\nBy July 1945, BAC had created a car division and bought a controlling stake in AFN.<ref name=book>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAm-H04hAGQC&lpg=PA64&dq=HJ%20Aldington%20Bristol%20cars&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Encyclopaedia of Classic Cars: Sports Cars 1945-1975 |author=Rob de la Rive Box |page=64 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}</ref> A factory was established at [[Bristol Filton Airport|Filton Aerodrome]], near Bristol.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=233}} [[File:1952 Bristol 401 in Holland Park, Kensington, London.JPG|thumb|1952 [[Bristol 401]]]]\n[[File:Bristol Britannia car at Filton, England 18July2010 arp.jpg|left|thumb|The Bristol Britannia (seen here) was produced from 1982 to 1993 and was replaced by the Blenheim.]]\nGeorge White and Reginald Verdon-Smith of the Aeroplane Company joined the new Frazer Nash Board, but in January 1947, soon after the first cars had been produced, differences between the Aldingtons and Bristol led to the resale of Frazer Nash. The Bristol Car Division became an independent entity.\n\n===Independence===\nBristol Cars was sold after its parent joined with other British aircraft companies in 1960 to create the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC), which later became part of [[British Aerospace]].<ref name=\"Bristol Cars Website\"/>\n\nThe car division originally merged with [[Bristol Siddeley|Bristol Siddeley Engines]], and was marked for closure, but was bought in September 1960 by George S.M. White the chairman and effective founder. White retained the direction of the company, but sold a forty per cent shareholding to [[Tony Crook (racing driver)|Tony Crook]], a leading Bristol agent. Crook became sole distributor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Farewell Tony Crook: Racing driver and ex-Bristol Cars owner dies at 93|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Farewell-Tony-Racing-driver-ex-Bristol-Cars-owner/story-20655608-detail/story.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=Bristol Post|date=19 February 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121701/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Farewell-Tony-Racing-driver-ex-Bristol-Cars-owner/story-20655608-detail/story.html|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===New ownership===\nIn September 1969, only a month before the unveiling of the new [[Bristol 411]] at the [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl's Court Motor Show]], Sir George White (as he had become) suffered a serious accident in his Bristol 410. The car was only superficially damaged, but he suffered severe trauma.\n\nAs time passed it became clear that he would never regain his health sufficiently to return to full-time work. To safeguard the future of his workforce, he decided in 1973 to sell his majority shareholding to Crook. As the ties with the White family were severed, British Aerospace (successors to the Bristol Aeroplane Company) requested the company to move its factory from Filton Aerodrome and it found new premises in nearby [[Patchway]]. The showroom on Kensington High Street became the head office, with Crook shuttling between the two in Bristol's light aircraft.\n\nUnder Crook's direction the company produced at least six types, the names of which were largely borrowed from Bristol's distinguished aeronautical past: the [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]], [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim]], [[Bristol Britannia|Britannia]] and [[Bristol Brigand|Brigand]].\n\n===End of the second era===\nIn February 1997, Crook, then aged 77, sold a fifty per cent holding in Bristol Cars to Toby Silverton, with an option to take full control within four years. Silverton, then son-in-law of Joe Lewis of the [[Tavistock Group]] and son of Arthur Silverton of [[Overfinch]], joined the board with his father.\n\nCrook and Toby Silverton produced the Speedster, Bullet and 411 Series 6, though 2002 saw the transfer of Bristol Cars fully into the ownership of Silverton and the Tavistock Group, with Silverton in the chair and Crook remaining as managing director. Together they developed a two-seater V10 named after the first Sir George White's world-famous First World War two-seater aircraft, the [[Bristol Fighter (automobile)|Bristol Fighter]].\n\nCrook finally relinquished his connection with Bristol Cars in August 2007. In March 2011, it was announced that Bristol Cars Limited had been placed into administration; it was that company that was renamed and subsequently dissolved by the administrator.\n\n==Pre-war BMW designs, Aldington brothers and early cars==\n[[File:Bristol 400.JPG|thumb|[[Bristol 400]], 1946\u201350]]\nHJ Aldington, a director of the Bristol Aeroplane Company affiliated AFN (BMW's pre-war concessionaire in the UK), used his [[British Army]] connections to visit the bombed [[BMW]] factory in [[Munich]] several times post-war. In 1945 he took plans for BMW cars back to Britain,<ref name=\"book\"/> and BMW chief engineer, Dr. [[Fritz Fiedler]] was also employed. Its first car was the [[Bristol 400]], prototyped in 1946 and introduced at the 1947 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. Derived from immediately pre-WW2 BMW products (thanks to a connection to BMW through Frazer Nash), the [[chassis]] was based on the [[BMW 326]], the engine on the [[BMW 328|328]],{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=232}} and the body on the [[BMW 327|327]]. Even a variation on the famous double-kidney BMW grille was retained. Bristol, however, did a thorough examination of the car's handling and ended up with performance \"only matched by outright purpose-built competition cars\".{{sfnp|Setright|1978|pp=232\u20133}} Seven hundred of the Bristol 400 were built, 17 of which received \"handsome\" [[Convertible|drophead]] bodywork from [[Pininfarina]].{{sfnp|Lawrence|1991|p=58}}\n\nIn 1949, the 400 was joined by the five-place [[Bristol 401|401]]. Bodied by [[Carrozzeria Touring|Touring]], it was [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamically]] sleeker, accelerated better, and had higher top speed. It was joined by the drophead [[Bristol 401|402]], of which just 24 examples were built.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=233}}\n\nThe [[Bristol 403|403]] followed in 1953,{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=233}} which featured improved brakes, [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]], [[Shock absorber|damper]]s, heater, and engine (a detuned racing motor, in fact).{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=233}} Bristol would use this same engine in the [[Bristol 450|450]], entered at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] in 1953; it broke its experimental crankshaft, but despite being less than aerodynamically ideal proved fully five seconds a lap quicker than the competition.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|pp=233\u20134}} Bristol withdrew from racing two years later.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=234}}\n\nAlong with the 403 was the [[Bristol 404 and 405|404]], on a shorter [[wheelbase]], with a more powerful engine and styling reminiscent of the 450. The 404 introduced a concealed front [[Fender (vehicle)|wing]]-mounted spare wheel and battery. It was built to extremely exacting standards, and the price reflected it; this, plus newly introduced \"punitive taxation\", meant only 40 were produced.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=234}}\n\n[[File:Spare wheel of 1968 Bristol 410.jpg|thumb|upright|Bristol's traditional wing-mounted spare wheel on a [[Bristol 410]]]]\nThe [[Bristol 404 and 405|405]], which entered production in 1954, was much more successful, not least for being Bristol's only four-door. It remained in production until 1958, with 297 [[Sedan (automobile)|saloons]] and 43 drophead [[coup\u00e9]]s produced in all.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=234}}\n\nBristol debuted the [[Bristol 406|406]] in 1958, and it remained in production until 1961.\n\n===V8 cars===\nThe 406's replacement, the [[Bristol 407|407]], was powered by a 5.2-litre [[V8 engine|V8]] provided by [[Chrysler of Canada]].{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=235}}\n\nIt was followed in 1963 by the [[Bristol 408|408]], with drastic restyling as well as improved suspension. This was succeeded by the [[Bristol 409|409]]. Many buyers preferred the crisp steering and gearbox of the earlier six-cylinder cars.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=235}}\n\nThe [[Bristol 410|410]], introduced in 1966, was a return to the high-performance touring tradition, offering the same top speed as the 409, and superior acceleration, with the same powerplant. It also saw Bristol become a private company and marked a return to quality to the exclusion of output: no more than three cars a week were to be made.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=235}}\n[[File:1968 Bristol 410.JPG|thumb|1968 [[Bristol 410]]]]\n\nIn 1969, the [[Bristol 411]] appeared, with a new 6.2-litre Chrysler V8 (still rebuilt and modified by Bristol, as before) delivering higher top speed and even better acceleration.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=235}}\n[[File:1970 Bristol 411 Series 1.JPG|thumb|1970 [[Bristol 411]] Series 1]]\n\n===Engines===\nUntil 1961 all Bristol cars used Bristol-built derivatives of the [[BMW M328]] 2-litre six-cylinder engine. These engines also powered a number of sports and racing cars, including all post-war Frazer Nashes (apart from a few prototypes), some [[AC Cars|AC]]s, some [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] and [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] racing cars, and several others.\n\nIn 1961, with the launch of the [[Bristol 407]], the company switched to larger [[Chrysler LA engine|Chrysler V8]] engines, which were more powerful than Bristols own, BMW derived 2.25 lite 6cylincer engine. The Chrysler V8s  could be bought off the shelf from Canadian Chrysler without the startup costs of Bristols own 3.65 litre all alloy 6 then in development. All post-1961 Bristols, including the later Blenheim and Fighter models, used Chrysler engines.\n==Kamkorp era (2011\u2013present)==\n===Administration and purchase===\nOn 3 March 2011 it was announced that Bristol Cars had gone into [[Administration (law)|administration]], with the immediate loss of 22 jobs when the factory at Filton, Bristol was shut down.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12641665 |title=Bristol Cars goes into administration |accessdate=3 March 2011 |work=BBC News |date=3 March 2011}}</ref>\nOn 21 April 2011 another new company was formed to sell the assets of the former dissolved company, and it was this company that was purchased by [[Kamkorp]], which also owns Frazer-Nash Research, a technology manufacturer of electric power systems.\n\n===Bristol Bullet===\n{{Main|Bristol Bullet (car)}}\nIn 2015 Bristol Cars announced the development of a new model codenamed \"Project Pinnacle\".

In July, the car was shown undisguised, technical details were announced, and its name given as Bristol Bullet. However, since that date there has been no further news about the car's homologation, and many members of the sales and marketing team have recently left the company.

To provide immediate employment for its considerable workforce, the Bristol Aeroplane Company undertook the manufacture of a light car (the Bristol Monocar), the construction of car bodies for Armstrong Siddeley and bus bodies for their sister company, [[Bristol Tramways]].\n\nOn the outbreak of [[World War II]], [[Sir George Stanley White, 2nd Baronet|Sir George Stanley White]], managing director of the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] from 1911\u20131954, was determined not to suffer the same difficulties a second time. The company now employed 70,000 and he knew he must plan for the time when the voracious wartime demand for Bristol aircraft and aircraft engines would suddenly end. The company began working with AFN Ltd, makers of [[Frazer Nash]] cars and British importer of [[BMW]]s before the war, on plans for a joint venture in automotive manufacture.{{sfnp|Lawrence|1991|p=58}}\n\n[[File:Sir George Stanley Middleton White with Bristol the Bristol 450 Le Mans cars.jpg|thumb|[[Sir George Stanley White, 2nd Baronet|Sir George Stanley White]] with the Bristol 450 Le Mans cars]]\nAs early as 1941, a number of papers were written or commissioned by [[George Stanley Midelton White|George S. M. White]], Sir Stanley's son, proposing a post-war car manufacturing division. It was decided to purchase an existing manufacturer for this purpose. [[Alvis Car and Engineering Company|Alvis]], [[Aston Martin]], [[Lagonda]], [[English Racing Automobiles|ERA]] and [[Lea-Francis]] were considered.<ref name=\"Bristol Cars Website\">{{cite web |url= http://www.bristolcars.co.uk/Past/Cars-Past/ |title=The Bristol Cars Story |publisher=Bristolcars.co.uk |accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Beginning===\nA chance discussion took place in May 1945, between D. A. Aldington, a director of Frazer Nash then serving as an inspector for the wartime [[Ministry of Aircraft Production]] (MAP), and Eric Storey, an assistant of George White at the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]]. It led to the immediate take-over of Frazer Nash by the Aeroplane Company.\n\nAldington and his two brothers had marketed the Frazer Nash BMW before the war, and proposed to build an updated version after demobilisation. This seemed the perfect match for the aeroplane company's own ambitions to manufacture a high quality sports car. With the support of the War Reparations Board, H. J. Aldington travelled to [[Munich]] and purchased the rights to manufacture three BMW models and the [[BMW 328|328]] engine.\n\nBy July 1945, BAC had created a car division and bought a controlling stake in AFN.<ref name=book>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAm-H04hAGQC&lpg=PA64&dq=HJ%20Aldington%20Bristol%20cars&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Encyclopaedia of Classic Cars: Sports Cars 1945-1975 |author=Rob de la Rive Box |page=64 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}</ref> A factory was established at [[Bristol Filton Airport|Filton Aerodrome]], near Bristol.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=233}} [[File:1952 Bristol 401 in Holland Park, Kensington, London.JPG|thumb|1952 [[Bristol 401]]]]\n[[File:Bristol Britannia car at Filton, England 18July2010 arp.jpg|left|thumb|The Bristol Britannia (seen here) was produced from 1982 to 1993 and was replaced by the Blenheim.]]\nGeorge White and Reginald Verdon-Smith of the Aeroplane Company joined the new Frazer Nash Board, but in January 1947, soon after the first cars had been produced, differences between the Aldingtons and Bristol led to the resale of Frazer Nash. The Bristol Car Division became an independent entity.\n\n===Independence===\nBristol Cars was sold after its parent joined with other British aircraft companies in 1960 to create the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC), which later became part of [[British Aerospace]].<ref name=\"Bristol Cars Website\"/>\n\nThe car division originally merged with [[Bristol Siddeley|Bristol Siddeley Engines]], and was marked for closure, but was bought in September 1960 by George S.M. White the chairman and effective founder. White retained the direction of the company, but sold a forty per cent shareholding to [[Tony Crook (racing driver)|Tony Crook]], a leading Bristol agent. Crook became sole distributor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Farewell Tony Crook: Racing driver and ex-Bristol Cars owner dies at 93|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Farewell-Tony-Racing-driver-ex-Bristol-Cars-owner/story-20655608-detail/story.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=Bristol Post|date=19 February 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121701/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Farewell-Tony-Racing-driver-ex-Bristol-Cars-owner/story-20655608-detail/story.html|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===New ownership===\nIn September 1969, only a month before the unveiling of the new [[Bristol 411]] at the [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl's Court Motor Show]], Sir George White (as he had become) suffered a serious accident in his Bristol 410. The car was only superficially damaged, but he suffered severe trauma.\n\nAs time passed it became clear that he would never regain his health sufficiently to return to full-time work. To safeguard the future of his workforce, he decided in 1973 to sell his majority shareholding to Crook. As the ties with the White family were severed, British Aerospace (successors to the Bristol Aeroplane Company) requested the company to move its factory from Filton Aerodrome and it found new premises in nearby [[Patchway]]. The showroom on Kensington High Street became the head office, with Crook shuttling between the two in Bristol's light aircraft.\n\nUnder Crook's direction the company produced at least six types, the names of which were largely borrowed from Bristol's distinguished aeronautical past: the [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]], [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim]], [[Bristol Britannia|Britannia]] and [[Bristol Brigand|Brigand]].\n\n===End of the second era===\nIn February 1997, Crook, then aged 77, sold a fifty per cent holding in Bristol Cars to Toby Silverton, with an option to take full control within four years. Silverton, then son-in-law of Joe Lewis of the [[Tavistock Group]] and son of Arthur Silverton of [[Overfinch]], joined the board with his father.\n\nCrook and Toby Silverton produced the Speedster, Bullet and 411 Series 6, though 2002 saw the transfer of Bristol Cars fully into the ownership of Silverton and the Tavistock Group, with Silverton in the chair and Crook remaining as managing director. Together they developed a two-seater V10 named after the first Sir George White's world-famous First World War two-seater aircraft, the [[Bristol Fighter (automobile)|Bristol Fighter]].\n\nCrook finally relinquished his connection with Bristol Cars in August 2007. In March 2011, it was announced that Bristol Cars Limited had been placed into administration; it was that company that was renamed and subsequently dissolved by the administrator.\n\n==Pre-war BMW designs, Aldington brothers and early cars==\n[[File:Bristol 400.JPG|thumb|[[Bristol 400]], 1946\u201350]]\nHJ Aldington, a director of the Bristol Aeroplane Company affiliated AFN (BMW's pre-war concessionaire in the UK), used his [[British Army]] connections to visit the bombed [[BMW]] factory in [[Munich]] several times post-war. In 1945 he took plans for BMW cars back to Britain,<ref name=\"book\"/> and BMW chief engineer, Dr. [[Fritz Fiedler]] was also employed. Its first car was the [[Bristol 400]], prototyped in 1946 and introduced at the 1947 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. Derived from immediately pre-WW2 BMW products (thanks to a connection to BMW through Frazer Nash), the [[chassis]] was based on the [[BMW 326]], the engine on the [[BMW 328|328]],{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=232}} and the body on the [[BMW 327|327]]. Even a variation on the famous double-kidney BMW grille was retained. Bristol, however, did a thorough examination of the car's handling and ended up with performance \"only matched by outright purpose-built competition cars\".{{sfnp|Setright|1978|pp=232\u20133}} Seven hundred of the Bristol 400 were built, 17 of which received \"handsome\" [[Convertible|drophead]] bodywork from [[Pininfarina]].{{sfnp|Lawrence|1991|p=58}}\n\nIn 1949, the 400 was joined by the five-place [[Bristol 401|401]]. Bodied by [[Carrozzeria Touring|Touring]], it was [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamically]] sleeker, accelerated better, and had higher top speed. It was joined by the drophead [[Bristol 401|402]], of which just 24 examples were built.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=233}}\n\nThe [[Bristol 403|403]] followed in 1953,{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=233}} which featured improved brakes, [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]], [[Shock absorber|damper]]s, heater, and engine (a detuned racing motor, in fact).{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=233}} Bristol would use this same engine in the [[Bristol 450|450]], entered at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] in 1953; it broke its experimental crankshaft, but despite being less than aerodynamically ideal proved fully five seconds a lap quicker than the competition.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|pp=233\u20134}} Bristol withdrew from racing two years later.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=234}}\n\nAlong with the 403 was the [[Bristol 404 and 405|404]], on a shorter [[wheelbase]], with a more powerful engine and styling reminiscent of the 450. The 404 introduced a concealed front [[Fender (vehicle)|wing]]-mounted spare wheel and battery. It was built to extremely exacting standards, and the price reflected it; this, plus newly introduced \"punitive taxation\", meant only 40 were produced.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=234}}\n\n[[File:Spare wheel of 1968 Bristol 410.jpg|thumb|upright|Bristol's traditional wing-mounted spare wheel on a [[Bristol 410]]]]\nThe [[Bristol 404 and 405|405]], which entered production in 1954, was much more successful, not least for being Bristol's only four-door. It remained in production until 1958, with 297 [[Sedan (automobile)|saloons]] and 43 drophead [[coup\u00e9]]s produced in all.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=234}}\n\nBristol debuted the [[Bristol 406|406]] in 1958, and it remained in production until 1961.\n\n===V8 cars===\nThe 406's replacement, the [[Bristol 407|407]], was powered by a 5.2-litre [[V8 engine|V8]] provided by [[Chrysler of Canada]].{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=235}}\n\nIt was followed in 1963 by the [[Bristol 408|408]], with drastic restyling as well as improved suspension. This was succeeded by the [[Bristol 409|409]]. Many buyers preferred the crisp steering and gearbox of the earlier six-cylinder cars.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=235}}\n\nThe [[Bristol 410|410]], introduced in 1966, was a return to the high-performance touring tradition, offering the same top speed as the 409, and superior acceleration, with the same powerplant. It also saw Bristol become a private company and marked a return to quality to the exclusion of output: no more than three cars a week were to be made.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=235}}\n[[File:1968 Bristol 410.JPG|thumb|1968 [[Bristol 410]]]]\n\nIn 1969, the [[Bristol 411]] appeared, with a new 6.2-litre Chrysler V8 (still rebuilt and modified by Bristol, as before) delivering higher top speed and even better acceleration.{{sfnp|Setright|1978|p=235}}\n[[File:1970 Bristol 411 Series 1.JPG|thumb|1970 [[Bristol 411]] Series 1]]\n\n===Engines===\nUntil 1961 all Bristol cars used Bristol-built derivatives of the [[BMW M328]] 2-litre six-cylinder engine. These engines also powered a number of sports and racing cars, including all post-war Frazer Nashes (apart from a few prototypes), some [[AC Cars|AC]]s, some [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] and [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] racing cars, and several others.\n\nIn 1961, with the launch of the [[Bristol 407]], the company switched to larger [[Chrysler LA engine|Chrysler V8]] engines, which were more powerful than Bristols own, BMW derived 2.25 lite 6cylincer engine. The Chrysler V8s  could be bought off the shelf from Canadian Chrysler without the startup costs of Bristols own 3.65 litre all alloy 6 then in development. All post-1961 Bristols, including the later Blenheim and Fighter models, used Chrysler engines.\n==Kamkorp era (2011\u2013present)==\n===Administration and purchase===\nOn 3 March 2011 it was announced that Bristol Cars had gone into [[Administration (law)|administration]], with the immediate loss of 22 jobs when the factory at Filton, Bristol was shut down.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12641665 |title=Bristol Cars goes into administration |accessdate=3 March 2011 |work=BBC News |date=3 March 2011}}</ref>\nOn 21 April 2011 another new company was formed to sell the assets of the former dissolved company, and it was this company that was purchased by [[Kamkorp]], which also owns Frazer-Nash Research, a technology manufacturer of electric power systems.\n\n===Bristol Bullet===\n{{Main|Bristol Bullet (car)}}\nIn 2015 Bristol Cars announced the development of a new model codenamed \"Project Pinnacle\".

In July, the car was shown undisguised, technical details were announced, and its name given as Bristol Bullet. However, since that date there has been no further news about the car's homologation, and many members of the sales and marketing team have recently left the company.
