Like the predecessor, they come with an optical in-display fingerprint sensor. The front camera has a 16 MP sensor. They launched with Android 9.0 Pie and OxygenOS 9.5.0.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/oneplus-8-pro-5g-device-lineup-2020-launch-ceo-pete-lau-2115258|title=OnePlus 8 Series Could Be Launched With 5G, CEO Pete Lau Says|website=NDTV Gadgets 360|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro features a curved edge-to-edge 6.67\" 19.5:9 FLUID AMOLED display with a 3K resolution (3120\u00d71440 pixels) and 90&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. It comes in three variants: 6 GB RAM with 128 GB storage, 8 GB RAM with 256 GB storage and 12 GB RAM option with 256 GB storage. The OnePlus 7 Pro also features a 4000 mA\u22c5h non-removable battery along with Warp Charge 30 technology.<ref>https://www.oneplus.com/ae/7pro#/</ref><ref>https://www.oneplus.com/ae/7</ref>\n\nThe budget OnePlus 7 which was launched with the flagship Pro version, comes in two colours, \"Mirror\" grey and the red. It is available in 6 GB RAM with 128 GB of internal storage, or 8 GB RAM with 128 or 256 GB of internal storage. It features a 6.41 inches FHD+ Optic Amoled Display (2340\u00d71080 pixels resolution). The rear camera has a 48 MP Sony IMX 586 primary sensor along with 5 MP depth sensor.\n\n==== OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro ====\n{{Main|OnePlus 7T}}\n\nThe OnePlus 7T was officially presented in New Delhi on September 26, 2019, and was available to order on September 28. The OnePlus 7T Pro was unveiled two weeks later. The OnePlus 7T is the successor to the 7 that was released 5 months prior for the European and Asian market, and to the 6T for the American market where the OnePlus 7 wasn't sold. It features a new form-factor compared to its predecessors, with a 20:9 aspect ratio instead of 19.5:9. This allowed for OnePlus to make the phone slightly taller than the older 6T and 7, while keeping the same width. OnePlus also included the 90&nbsp;Hz Fluid AMOLED display previously found on the OnePlus 7 Pro. While OnePlus did keep the resolution at 2400\u00d71080 pixels, the screen was one of its primary selling points. While the OnePlus 7T is considered a significant upgrade compared to the 7, the 7T Pro is a subtle upgrade over the 7 Pro. It features the same display, same body, same camera system; the main changes being faster charging, faster processor and a slightly quieter pop-up camera.\n\nBoth phones are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855+ SoC, and feature the same in-display fingerprint scanner found on the OnePlus 7 Series. Only one variant was available for each phone: 8 GB RAM with 128GB storage for the 7T (with another 256 GB storage variant for the Indian market only), and 8 GB RAM with 256 GB storage for the 7T Pro. Both have a slightly superior battery compared to their predecessors, the 7T included a 3800 mA\u22c5h non-removable battery (4085 mA\u22c5h for the 7T Pro) alongside Warp Charge 30T technology, which allows them to be fully charged in just under an hour. The OnePlus 7T had a new camera system, featuring the same primary and [[wide-angle lens]]es, though adding a third 2x telephoto lens (instead of 3x for the 7 Pro and 7T Pro). Both also feature a new macro mode, allowing them to capture pictures up to 2.5&nbsp;cm from to the subject. The more affordable OnePlus 7T is available in 2 colors, \"Frosted\" silver or \"Glacier\" blue, and the 7T Pro in \"Haze\" blue, all being matte glass finishes. Both were the first phones to ship with [[Android 10]] and OxygenOS 10.0 out-of-the-box.\n\n==== OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro ====\n{{Main|OnePlus 8}}\n\nThe OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were unveiled on April 14, 2020, and will be available on April 21 in Europe and April 29 in the United States. The 8 Pro is the first OnePlus phone to have true water resistance (IP68) and wireless charging (Warp Charge 30W). The 8 and 8 Pro have a circular cutout in the upper left-hand corner of the display for the front-facing camera. On the 8 Pro, this was necessary to achieve the IP68 rating, as the pop-up camera on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro did not allow for water resistance. Like the 7T series, both use Fluid [[AMOLED]] displays with a high refresh rate and HDR10+ support. A curved display is now used on both phones, but the 8 Pro has a higher refresh rate. The 8 has a 6.55-inch 1080p 20:9 screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, while the 8 Pro has a larger 6.78-inch 1440p 19.8:9 screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. The 8 Pro is one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth|30-bit]] panel.\n\nBoth phones are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865, and carry over the optical in-display fingerprint scanner from the 7 series and 7T series. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mA\u22c5h on the 8 and 4510 mA\u22c5h on the 8 Pro. Storage and RAM options are identical between the two, with 8 or 12 GB of RAM and 128 or 256 GB of non-expandable UFS 3.0 storage. The 8 has LPDDR4X RAM while the 8 Pro has newer LPDDR5 RAM. The camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera, making this a feature exclusive to the 8 Pro; instead, it has a new macro lens. The 8 Pro's ultrawide sensor receives a boost in resolution from 16 MP to 48 MP, but its telephoto sensor does not receive significant upgrades. The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor. Both will be available in Onyx Black and Glacial Green and will receive their own color. The 8 has an Interstellar Glow finish, while the 8 Pro has an Ultramarine Blue finish. A Polar Silver finish on the 8 is exclusive to the Verizon model. Like the 7T series, they will ship with [[Android 10]] and OxygenOS 10.0 pre-installed.\n\n==== Variants ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Like the predecessor, they come with an optical in-display fingerprint sensor. The front camera has a 16 MP sensor. They launched with Android 9.0 Pie and OxygenOS 9.5.0.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/oneplus-8-pro-5g-device-lineup-2020-launch-ceo-pete-lau-2115258|title=OnePlus 8 Series Could Be Launched With 5G, CEO Pete Lau Says|website=NDTV Gadgets 360|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro features a curved edge-to-edge 6.67\" 19.5:9 FLUID AMOLED display with a 3K resolution (3120\u00d71440 pixels) and 90&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. It comes in three variants: 6 GB RAM with 128 GB storage, 8 GB RAM with 256 GB storage and 12 GB RAM option with 256 GB storage. The OnePlus 7 Pro also features a 4000 mA\u22c5h non-removable battery along with Warp Charge 30 technology.<ref>https://www.oneplus.com/ae/7pro#/</ref><ref>https://www.oneplus.com/ae/7</ref>\n\nThe budget OnePlus 7 which was launched with the flagship Pro version, comes in two colours, \"Mirror\" grey and the red. It is available in 6 GB RAM with 128 GB of internal storage, or 8 GB RAM with 128 or 256 GB of internal storage. It features a 6.41 inches FHD+ Optic Amoled Display (2340\u00d71080 pixels resolution). The rear camera has a 48 MP Sony IMX 586 primary sensor along with 5 MP depth sensor.\n\n==== OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro ====\n{{Main|OnePlus 7T}}\n\nThe OnePlus 7T was officially presented in New Delhi on September 26, 2019, and was available to order on September 28. The OnePlus 7T Pro was unveiled two weeks later. The OnePlus 7T is the successor to the 7 that was released 5 months prior for the European and Asian market, and to the 6T for the American market where the OnePlus 7 wasn't sold. It features a new form-factor compared to its predecessors, with a 20:9 aspect ratio instead of 19.5:9. This allowed for OnePlus to make the phone slightly taller than the older 6T and 7, while keeping the same width. OnePlus also included the 90&nbsp;Hz Fluid AMOLED display previously found on the OnePlus 7 Pro. While OnePlus did keep the resolution at 2400\u00d71080 pixels, the screen was one of its primary selling points. While the OnePlus 7T is considered a significant upgrade compared to the 7, the 7T Pro is a subtle upgrade over the 7 Pro. It features the same display, same body, same camera system; the main changes being faster charging, faster processor and a slightly quieter pop-up camera.\n\nBoth phones are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855+ SoC, and feature the same in-display fingerprint scanner found on the OnePlus 7 Series. Only one variant was available for each phone: 8 GB RAM with 128GB storage for the 7T (with another 256 GB storage variant for the Indian market only), and 8 GB RAM with 256 GB storage for the 7T Pro. Both have a slightly superior battery compared to their predecessors, the 7T included a 3800 mA\u22c5h non-removable battery (4085 mA\u22c5h for the 7T Pro) alongside Warp Charge 30T technology, which allows them to be fully charged in just under an hour. The OnePlus 7T had a new camera system, featuring the same primary and [[wide-angle lens]]es, though adding a third 2x telephoto lens (instead of 3x for the 7 Pro and 7T Pro). Both also feature a new macro mode, allowing them to capture pictures up to 2.5&nbsp;cm from to the subject. The more affordable OnePlus 7T is available in 2 colors, \"Frosted\" silver or \"Glacier\" blue, and the 7T Pro in \"Haze\" blue, all being matte glass finishes. Both were the first phones to ship with [[Android 10]] and OxygenOS 10.0 out-of-the-box.\n\n==== OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro ====\n{{Main|OnePlus 8}}\n\nThe OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were unveiled on April 14, 2020, and will be available on April 21 in Europe and April 29 in the United States. The 8 Pro is the first OnePlus phone to have true water resistance (IP68) and wireless charging (Warp Charge 30W). The 8 and 8 Pro have a circular cutout in the upper left-hand corner of the display for the front-facing camera. On the 8 Pro, this was necessary to achieve the IP68 rating, as the pop-up camera on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro did not allow for water resistance. Like the 7T series, both use Fluid [[AMOLED]] displays with a high refresh rate and HDR10+ support. A curved display is now used on both phones, but the 8 Pro has a higher refresh rate. The 8 has a 6.55-inch 1080p 20:9 screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, while the 8 Pro has a larger 6.78-inch 1440p 19.8:9 screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. The 8 Pro is one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth|30-bit]] panel.\n\nBoth phones are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865, and carry over the optical in-display fingerprint scanner from the 7 series and 7T series. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mA\u22c5h on the 8 and 4510 mA\u22c5h on the 8 Pro. Storage and RAM options are identical between the two, with 8 or 12 GB of RAM and 128 or 256 GB of non-expandable UFS 3.0 storage. The 8 has LPDDR4X RAM while the 8 Pro has newer LPDDR5 RAM. The camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera, making this a feature exclusive to the 8 Pro; instead, it has a new macro lens. The 8 Pro's ultrawide sensor receives a boost in resolution from 16 MP to 48 MP, but its telephoto sensor does not receive significant upgrades. The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor. Both will be available in Onyx Black and Glacial Green and will receive their own color. The 8 has an Interstellar Glow finish, while the 8 Pro has an Ultramarine Blue finish. A Polar Silver finish on the 8 is exclusive to the Verizon model. Like the 7T series, they will ship with [[Android 10]] and OxygenOS 10.0 pre-installed.\n\n==== Variants ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The primary improvements to this 2nd generation are the sound quality (using a 10mm driver instead of a 7.2mm one in the Bullets Wireless v1), better battery life and charging speed (Warp Charge compatible), as well as a new design which removed the need of earhooks, while still fitting comfortably in the ears and not falling on their own.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18622832/oneplus-bullets-wireless-2-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus Bullets Wireless 2 are better and more expensive|last=Savov|first=Vlad|date=2019-05-14|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref>\n\n=== TVs ===\n\n==== OnePlus TV ====\nIn September 2018, the company confirmed<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://eoto.tech/oneplus-tv-wont-sell/|title=Here's why the OnePlus TV won't sell in India - EOTO Tech {{!}} OnePlus TV Price in India|date=17 September 2018|work=EOTO Tech|access-date=25 September 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> it plans to venture into the smart TVs market with the OnePlus TV.

He is the author of more than 80 publications covering [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[astrophysics]], and [[engineering]].\n\n==Background==\nHe studied at the [[Colegio de la Inmaculada (Lima)|Colegio de Lima]], under Pedro A. Labarthe. In 1906 he entered the Faculty of Sciences of the [[National University of San Marcos]], where he received a [[bachelor's degree]] (1909) and later his doctorate degree in Mathematical Sciences (1912), with his thesis on \"Singular points of flat curves\" and \"Resistance of Columns of reinforced concrete\", respectively. Simultaneously, he studied at the School of Engineers of Peru, now called [[National University of Engineering]] (1908-1910), graduating from [[civil engineer]] in 1911.\n\nFrom 1912, he taught at the [[Chorrillos Military School]], where he was in charge of the courses of Flat, Descriptive and Analytical Geometry, [[Infinitesimal Calculus]], [[Rational mechanics|Rational Mechanics]] and [[External ballistics|Exterior Ballistics]]. He was also professor of Rational Mechanics in the Faculty of Sciences of the [[University of San Marcos]] beginning in 1919, and later served as dean (1928-1940). He became Rector (1941-1943). He was also a professor at the School of Engineers corresponding with [[Albert Einstein]].\n\nIn the 1920s he worked with the Polish mathematician [[Alfred_Rosenblatt]] in San Marcos. In 1938, together with Rosenblatt and other San Marcos mathematicians, he founded the [[National Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences of Peru]], an institution that he presided over from 1960 until he died in 1970. He also directed the publication \"[[Actas de la Academia]]\".\n\nHe was awarded the national prize for scientific research, in recognition of his achievements in the field of mathematical sciences and his \"Exact equations and exact solutions to the movement and stresses of viscous fluids\" (1948).\n\nHe organized conferences in Lima with the participation of [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], [[Arthur Compton]] and [[Garrett Birkhoff|Garret Birkhoff]], among others; In each conference, Godofredo Garc\u00eda presented a review of the work of these outstanding scientists. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nHe married Alicia Rend\u00f3n (Ecuadorian), had four children.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Lessons of Rational Mechanics, UNMSM; 1937.\n*On a New Cosmogonic Theory, 1940.\n*Algebraic Analysis, Ed.

He is the author of more than 80 publications covering [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[astrophysics]], and [[engineering]].\n\n==Background==\nHe studied at the [[Colegio de la Inmaculada (Lima)|Colegio de Lima]], under Pedro A. Labarthe. In 1906 he entered the Faculty of Sciences of the [[National University of San Marcos]], where he received a [[bachelor's degree]] (1909) and later his doctorate degree in Mathematical Sciences (1912), with his thesis on \"Singular points of flat curves\" and \"Resistance of Columns of reinforced concrete\", respectively. Simultaneously, he studied at the School of Engineers of Peru, now called [[National University of Engineering]] (1908-1910), graduating from [[civil engineer]] in 1911.\n\nFrom 1912, he taught at the [[Chorrillos Military School]], where he was in charge of the courses of Flat, Descriptive and Analytical Geometry, [[Infinitesimal Calculus]], [[Rational mechanics|Rational Mechanics]] and [[External ballistics|Exterior Ballistics]]. He was also professor of Rational Mechanics in the Faculty of Sciences of the [[University of San Marcos]] beginning in 1919, and later served as dean (1928-1940). He became Rector (1941-1943). He was also a professor at the School of Engineers corresponding with [[Albert Einstein]].\n\nIn the 1920s he worked with the Polish mathematician [[Alfred_Rosenblatt]] in San Marcos. In 1938, together with Rosenblatt and other San Marcos mathematicians, he founded the [[National Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences of Peru]], an institution that he presided over from 1960 until his death in 1970. He also directed the publication \"[[Actas de la Academia]]\".\n\nHe was awarded the national prize for scientific research, in recognition of his achievements in the field of mathematical sciences and his \"Exact equations and exact solutions to the movement and stresses of viscous fluids\" (1948).\n\nHe organized conferences in Lima with the participation of [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], [[Arthur Compton]] and [[Garrett Birkhoff|Garret Birkhoff]], among others; In each conference, Godofredo Garc\u00eda presented a review of the work of these outstanding scientists. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nHe married Alicia Rend\u00f3n (Ecuadorian), had four children.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Lessons of Rational Mechanics, UNMSM; 1937.\n*On a New Cosmogonic Theory, 1940.\n*Algebraic Analysis, Ed.

{"title_page": "Travel class", "text_new": "{{use mdy dates|date=January 2020}}\n[[Image:Asiana Boeing 747-400 Seat Plan.svg|thumb|A typical wide-body jet plane seat plan (Asiana Boeing 747-400)]]\n\nA '''travel class''' is a quality of [[lodging|accommodation]] on [[public transport]]. The accommodation could be a seat or a cabin for example. Higher travel classes are designed to be more comfortable and are typically more expensive.\n\n== Airliners ==\n{{see also|Fare basis code|First class (aviation)|First class travel|Business class|Economy class|Premium economy class}} \n\nTraditionally, an airliner is divided into, from the fore to aft, [[first class (aviation)|first]], [[business class|business]], and [[economy class|economy]] cabins. In recent years, a [[premium economy]] class has been added by some airlines as an intermediate class between economy and business classes.\n\nEach cabin class is further divided into invisible [[fare basis code|booking class]]es, which although booked into the same cabin differ in conditions and benefits outside of the cabin class travelled such as frequent-flyer points, baggage limit, change or refund policy, etc.\n\n==Buses==\n\nIn Mexico, bus services often have designated levels of service, the top of which is ''de lujo'' or ''clase lujo'', followed by ''plus clase'', ''primera clase'', and ''segunda clase''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/965-all-about-buses-in-mexico|title=All About Buses In Mexico| website=Mexconnect}}</ref>\n\n==Ocean liners==\nBefore [[cruise ship]]s dominated the passenger ship trade, [[ocean liner]]s had classes of service, often categorized as First Class, Second Class, and [[Steerage]]. Companies such as [[Cunard Line]] continue this tradition, offering Queen's Grill, Princess Grill and Britannia cabins, each of which have their own allocated lounges and restaurants on board.\n\n==Trains==\nTrains often have first class (the higher class) and second class (known as standard class in the UK). For trains with sleeping accommodations, there may be more levels of luxury.\n\n=== China ===\nTraditional trains commonly offer the following classes: soft sleeper, hard sleeper, soft seat and hard seat, depending on the route.\n\n[[China Railway High-speed|CRH]] EMUs offer the following classes: soft sleeper (available only on few overnight routes), business seat, 1st class seat and 2nd class seat.\n\n===Taiwan===\nPrior to 1949, most railway bureaus (under the direction of the Transport Ministry) had a three-class structure.  As with most contemporary cases, few people could afford first class or even second class, so at times there would be no first class or second class service available in some trains.  Some went as far as offering a fourth class \"service\" with goods wagons.\n\nIn 1949, the first \"Limited Express with Reserved Seating\" (\u7279\u5feb\u5c0d\u865f\u8eca) appeared with the Railway Bureau of Taiwan, and it offered a three-class service, inherited locally from Japanese colonial rule.  This structure was the norm for all trains, normal or express, until 1953.\n\nIn 1953, the \"Equality Express\" was introduced with second class carriages only.  Eventually, all expresses save for the sole Limited Express offered only second class service, and all other, slower trains, offered only third class.  This resulted in the quality of service being associated with the speed of the train.  The Diesel Limited Express was introduced in 1956 with one class only.\n\nIn 1960, with the reforming of Limited Expresses (the Limited Express with Reserved Seating and Diesel Limited Express merged into one fare), all passenger trains officially offered only one class.  Therefore, all expresses had only second class carriages and other trains only third class.  As time passes, more types of carriages were introduced, but these were thought as types instead of classes.\n\n=== Europe ===\n[[Image:Carrozzaz1.jpg|thumb|right|Italian passenger carriage, showing a \"2\" denoting second class]]\n[[File:Gare Metz d\u00e9cor 14-2.jpg|thumb|Travel class illustrations at the beginning of the 20th century. Representations of the station restaurants of the first and second classes (left) and third class (right). [[Reliefs]] of the [[Gare de Metz-Ville|Iml train station]] of [[Metz]], [[France]].]]\n\nAt the very beginning of the railway age in Europe, almost every railway operator offered three classes for passenger services: \"First class\" was the most luxurious and least demanded class, equipped with rich upholstered seats, while \"second class\" was also upholstered, but on a lower level and with less seating space. In contrast, \"third class\" only provided wooden benches. While most passenger trains carried just one or two \"first class\" and \"second class\" carriages, every other carriage was \"third class\" only. \n\nToday there are generally two classes, known as \"first class\" and \"second class or economy class\", or the equivalent in the local language. The three-tier class structure was abolished on most European railways by the end of the 1950s in favor of a two-tier structure conceived by the [[Union internationale des chemins de fer|UIC]]. In fact, the old \"first class\" from the pre-[[World War II|World-War-II]] era was deleted without substitution because of low ridership in postwar times, therefore the old \"second class\" became the new \"first class\" and the \"third class\", with hardly any wooden seatings left, was declared the new \"second class\".\n\nTrains in Great Britain provide a two-tier class structure, with the higher tier called \"first class\". The lower tier was re-branded from \"third class\" to \"second class\" by [[British Rail]] from 3 June 1956, and then to \"standard class\" from 11 May 1987.\n\nA convention used by most European railway companies is that the first-class section of a train is marked in yellow, usually with a yellow band above the doors and/or windows. First-class areas may be complete carriages or at one end of a carriage, the other end being second class. Second-class compartments usually have \"2+2\" seating (2 seats each side of the aisle); first-class compartments are typically \"2+1\". In Britain and France, some short-distance [[Commuter rail|suburban]] trains use \"2+3\" for the lower class and \"2+2\" for first class.\n\n[[Rapid transit|Metro]], [[Commuter rail|suburban]] and [[Regional rail|local trains]] are sometimes second-class-only. First-class-only trains were common up to the 1980s (see [[Trans Europe Express]]) but are now rare. High-speed trains often charge more than slower-speed trains on the same route, but still have first- and second-class seats.\n\nTrains in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] are primarily operated as standard-class only, with only some of the longest distance services having a higher class, called Premier on [[IE 22000 Class]] stock, CityGold on [[Mark 4 (Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann)|Mark 4]] loco-hauled carriages and First Plus on the cross-border [[Enterprise (train service)|Enterprise]] service. No commuter services have premium classes. Premium benefits can be as limited as a reading light and waiter service; but reach to 2+1 recliner seating and enhanced catering options.\n\nIn Germany, there existed a \"fourth class\" (\"4. Klasse\") on almost every local train from the second half of the 19th century to 1928. It provided just a very low travel comfort, the passengers had to sit on even wooden planks with rudimentary backrests. Much of the space in the compartments was left empty to allow country folks to carry their goods and livestock inside the carriage.\n\n=== India ===\nThe [[Indian Railways]] offers six classes of train accommodation in general.\n\n* First Class A/C (1A) is the highest rail travel class and is not available on all trains. It offers air-conditioned cubicles in two-bed and four-bed formats with closing doors. There usually is only one 1A bogie (carriage) on a train.\n* Two Tier A/C (2A) offers air conditioned cubicles in four-bed + two-bed format, but the privacy is provided by curtains instead of the doors found in 1A. There are typically one or two 2A bogies on long-distance trains.\n* Three Tier A/C (3A) offers air conditioned cubicles in six-bed + two-bed format (six beds on one side and two beds on other side of the hallway). Most trains have two to five 3A bogies.\n* A/C Chair Car (CC) is a feature of short-distance trains that cover the journey within a day. The seating is usually in 3x3 format.\n* Sleeper Class (SL) is configured similarly to 3A but is not air conditioned. There are typically ten to fifteen SL bogies in a train.\n* Second Class (Reserved) (2S) similar as CC, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n* Second Class (II) for long-distance trains is similar to the SL cars but has wooden middle berths instead of upper berths.  However, local and suburban trains may offer a different variety of second class, which has an open cabin with rows of wooden seats facing each other in pairs.\n\nSome trains also have one of these classes:\n\n* Third AC Economy (3E). Similar to Three Tier A/C, however this class have an additional middle berth in the side section of the  air conditioned cubicle, making it a six-bed and three-bed format. This type of accommodation is created for less well off people, who desire a comfortable travel at lesser fare.\n* First Class (FC), which is similar in configuration to the 1A class but lacks air conditioning. The class is currently being phased out in favor of the slightly expensive 2A and cheaper 3A classes.  In 2011, it could be found only on Mumbai local train and a few trains across all of India.\n* Executive AC Chair Car (EC), has a 2x2 seat configuration and includes food catering service.  It is available only on the \"Shatabdi Express\" and \"Tejas Express\" trains, which link major cities located within a day-trip distance.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n{{see also|List of named passenger trains of Indonesia}}\n[[Indonesia]]n trains, operated by the [[state-owned]] [[Kereta Api Indonesia|PT Kereta Api Indonesia]] (the Indonesian Railways Co.), have now four classes for long-distance travel. All types of carriages are seating-only (no sleeper cars).\n\n* '''Executive/first class (''eksekutif'')'''\u2013the top and most expensive class, offers the most comfortable means of travel - 2\u20132 reclining seat configuration, on-board TV. Executive-class carriages are classified by the [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Ministry of Transportation]] as '''K1'''. Also, trains having Eksekutif cars are certainly the fastest ones \u2013 see the note below.\n** '''Argo class''' \u2013 this is the top class that all of train names use '''Argo''' brand.\n** '''Fauna class''' \u2013 below the Argos.\n* '''Business/second class (''bisnis'')'''\u2013medium class, the fare is around 60% of executive classes, 2\u20132 seating, fixed 60 degrees seat. Business-class carriages are classified by the Ministry of Transportation as '''K2'''. The Indonesian Railways is phasing out this class.\n* '''[[Premium economy class]]'''\u2013the intermediate level between the business and economy classes, the fare is nearly same as business, 2-2 reclining seat configuration.\n* '''Economy/third class (''ekonomi'')'''\u2013the lowest and cheapest class, below the premium class tickets are around 20% of business classes. Economy-class carriages are classified by the Ministry of Transportation as '''K3'''.\n** '''Commercial economy class''', 2-2 seat configuration\n** '''[[Public service obligation|PSO economy]] class''', 3-2 seat configuration, with split-type [[air conditioner|air conditioned]] (retrofitted from fans)\n\nAll classes are non-smoking and air conditioned. All passengers require a seat reservation, ''except'' for commuter trains. All seats can be reserved from 30\u201390 days before travel date until minutes before departure time when seats are still available.\nMedium and long distance trains have onboard cafeteria, [[flushing toilet]]s (older passenger coaches have [[squatting toilet]]s), onboard customer service representative (Train Manager), onboard security, and onboard cleaning services.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://tiket.kereta-api.co.id/index.php?_it8tnz=MTM=#layanan |title=Situs Resmi PT Kereta Api Indonesia (Persero)| website=Tiket.kereta-api.co.id |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221033/https://tiket.kereta-api.co.id/index.php?_it8tnz=MTM=| archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nExecutive class trains are the fastest and stop only on a few major stations (first priority). Business trains are somewhat slower, but generally do not stop too often as well there may be economy cars in these trains (second priority). Economy trains take significantly more time to reach the destination, as they stop on many smaller stations and have to [[passing loop|pass]] all executive and business class traffic going in the same direction (third priority). Many less important routes lack either business or executive service, or both. Some services have more two or three classes mixed together (executive-business, executive-economy, executive-premium economy, or executive-business-economy).\n\nFor local or commuter trains, single class service is the most common type of service.

By 1960, as conditions improved on second and third class trains, there were few passengers travelling on first class; therefore, the few remaining first class carriages were rebranded \"special\" carriages available for hire, and consequently moved Japan's railway system to a two-class system, of which the original second class became the first, and the original third became second.\n\nIn 1969, the class structure was abolished altogether.  The first class was renamed \"Green\" carriages and the second \"Standard\" carriages.\n\nAll members of the [[Japan Railways Group]] (JR) offer separated classes of travel, with varying levels of availability on any given train.\n\nThe [[Kyushu Railway Company]] (JR Ky\u016bsh\u016b), [[Hokkaido Railway Company]] (JR Hokkaido), and [[East Japan Railway Company]] (JR East) all offer an enhanced service known as the Green Car on nearly all of their intercity trains.  Additionally, the [[Central Japan Railway Company]] (JR Central) and [[Shikoku Railway Company]] (JR Shikoku) offer a Green Car on some trains, and a few [[West Japan Railway Company]] (JR West) trains also have a Green Car.  The alternative to Green Car is the Ordinary Car.  Although Ordinary Car tickets may be purchased with or without reserved seating, all Green Car tickets are reserved seating.  A ticket must be purchased in advance, and a special version of the [[Japan Rail Pass]] allowing travel in Green Cars is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ticket/types.html |title=Types of Tickets &#124; Ticketing |publisher=JR-East |date= |accessdate=2013-03-21}}</ref>\n\nMost JR Group Green Cars seats have increased width and pitch.

From 1875, when the Midland Railway redesignated its second class accommodation as ''third class'', second class (equivalent to either [[premium economy]] or [[business class]]) was gradually abolished, while first class and third class were retained. This was because the [[Railway Regulation Act 1844]] required a third-class service to be offered. In addition to this, British third class was initially of a comparable standard to continental European third class and British first class with European first class (the continent having retained three classes).  This meant that boat trains in Britain still often operated with three classes of accommodation after the abolition of second class in the rest of the country.  From 3 June 1956 [[British Rail]]ways redesignated third class as \"second class\", finally (as British Rail) renaming it \"standard class\" from 11 May 1987, in view of the pejorative overtones of \"second class\".\n\nA coach with accommodation for more than one class is called a \"composite coach\".\n\n=== North America ===\nIn the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], train classes emulate the airlines, although airlines probably took the class levels from trains of the time when they were coming of age (e.g. first, business, coach).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} [[Amtrak]] [[Acela Express]] trains have two classes:  First Class and Business Class.  Amtrak [[Northeast Regional]] trains have Business Class and Coach class. [[Canada]]'s [[Via Rail]] has the same [[Via Rail#Classes of service|classes]] as Amtrak. Trains with sleeper cars have additional levels.  Most [[commuter rail|commuter trains]] in USA and Canada generally have a business class and economy class or standard fare. Although business class is offered it typically is just more spacious seats in a more modern sleek cabin. WiFi is available on commuter trains in the southern Ontario corridor, as well as southern Quebec (Via Rail). Full services, such as food and beverage, may not always be a given.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Transport}}\n*[[First class (aviation)]]\n*[[First class travel]]\n*[[Business class]]\n*[[Premium economy]]\n*[[Economy class]]\n*[[Passenger car (rail)]]\n*[[IATA class codes]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commercial air travel}}\n\n[[Category:Airline tickets]]\n[[Category:Passenger rail transport]]\n[[Category:Pricing]]\n[[Category:Types of travel|Class]]\n[[Category:Travel classes| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{use mdy dates|date=January 2020}}\n[[Image:Asiana Boeing 747-400 Seat Plan.svg|thumb|A typical wide-body jet plane seat plan (Asiana Boeing 747-400)]]\n\nA '''travel class''' is a quality of [[lodging|accommodation]] on [[public transport]]. The accommodation could be a seat or a cabin for example. Higher travel classes are designed to be more comfortable and are typically more expensive.\n\n== Airliners ==\n{{see also|Fare basis code|First class (aviation)|First class travel|Business class|Economy class|Premium economy class}} \n\nTraditionally, an airliner is divided into, from the fore to aft, [[first class (aviation)|first]], [[business class|business]], and [[economy class|economy]] cabins. In recent years, a [[premium economy]] class has been added by some airlines as an intermediate class between economy and business classes.\n\nEach cabin class is further divided into invisible [[fare basis code|booking class]]es, which although booked into the same cabin differ in conditions and benefits outside of the cabin class travelled such as frequent-flyer points, baggage limit, change or refund policy, etc.\n\n==Buses==\n\nIn Mexico, bus services often have designated levels of service, the top of which is ''de lujo'' or ''clase lujo'', followed by ''plus clase'', ''primera clase'', and ''segunda clase''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/965-all-about-buses-in-mexico|title=All About Buses In Mexico| website=Mexconnect}}</ref>\n\n==Ocean liners==\nBefore [[cruise ship]]s dominated the passenger ship trade, [[ocean liner]]s had classes of service, often categorized as First Class, Second Class, and [[Steerage]]. Companies such as [[Cunard Line]] continue this tradition, offering Queen's Grill, Princess Grill and Britannia cabins, each of which have their own allocated lounges and restaurants on board.\n\n==Trains==\nTrains often have first class (the higher class) and second class (known as standard class in the UK). For trains with sleeping accommodations, there may be more levels of luxury.\n\n=== China ===\nTraditional trains commonly offer the following classes: soft sleeper, hard sleeper, soft seat and hard seat, depending on the route.\n\n[[China Railway High-speed|CRH]] EMUs offer the following classes: soft sleeper (available only on few overnight routes), business seat, 1st class seat and 2nd class seat.\n\n===Taiwan===\nPrior to 1949, most railway bureaus (under the direction of the Transport Ministry) had a three-class structure.  As with most contemporary cases, few people could afford first class or even second class, so at times there would be no first class or second class service available in some trains.  Some went as far as offering a fourth class \"service\" with goods wagons.\n\nIn 1949, the first \"Limited Express with Reserved Seating\" (\u7279\u5feb\u5c0d\u865f\u8eca) appeared with the Railway Bureau of Taiwan, and it offered a three-class service, inherited locally from Japanese colonial rule.  This structure was the norm for all trains, normal or express, until 1953.\n\nIn 1953, the \"Equality Express\" was introduced with second class carriages only.  Eventually, all expresses save for the sole Limited Express offered only second class service, and all other, slower trains, offered only third class.  This resulted in the quality of service being associated with the speed of the train.  The Diesel Limited Express was introduced in 1956 with one class only.\n\nIn 1960, with the reforming of Limited Expresses (the Limited Express with Reserved Seating and Diesel Limited Express merged into one fare), all passenger trains officially offered only one class.  Therefore, all expresses had only second class carriages and other trains only third class.  As time passes, more types of carriages were introduced, but these were thought as types instead of classes.\n\n=== Europe ===\n[[Image:Carrozzaz1.jpg|thumb|right|Italian passenger carriage, showing a \"2\" denoting second class]]\n[[File:Gare Metz d\u00e9cor 14-2.jpg|thumb|Travel class illustrations at the beginning of the 20th century. Representations of the station restaurants of the first and second classes (left) and third class (right). [[Reliefs]] of the [[Gare de Metz-Ville|Iml train station]] of [[Metz]], [[France]].]]\n\nAt the very beginning of the railway age in Europe, almost every railway operator offered three classes for passenger services: \"First class\" was the most luxurious and least demanded class, equipped with rich upholstered seats, while \"second class\" was also upholstered, but on a lower level and with less seating space. In contrast, \"third class\" only provided wooden benches. While most passenger trains carried just one or two \"first class\" and \"second class\" carriages, every other carriage was \"third class\" only. \n\nToday there are generally two classes, known as \"first class\" and \"second class or economy class\", or the equivalent in the local language. The three-tier class structure was abolished on most European railways by the end of the 1950s in favor of a two-tier structure conceived by the [[Union internationale des chemins de fer|UIC]]. In fact, the old \"first class\" from the pre-[[World War II|World-War-II]] era was deleted without substitution because of low ridership in postwar times, therefore the old \"second class\" became the new \"first class\" and the \"third class\", with hardly any wooden seatings left, was declared the new \"second class\".\n\nTrains in Great Britain provide a two-tier class structure, with the higher tier called \"first class\". The lower tier was re-branded from \"third class\" to \"second class\" by [[British Rail]] from 3 June 1956, and then to \"standard class\" from 11 May 1987.\n\nA convention used by most European railway companies is that the first-class section of a train is marked in yellow, usually with a yellow band above the doors and/or windows. First-class areas may be complete carriages or at one end of a carriage, the other end being second class. Second-class compartments usually have \"2+2\" seating (2 seats each side of the aisle); first-class compartments are typically \"2+1\". In Britain and France, some short-distance [[Commuter rail|suburban]] trains use \"2+3\" for the lower class and \"2+2\" for first class.\n\n[[Rapid transit|Metro]], [[Commuter rail|suburban]] and [[Regional rail|local trains]] are sometimes second-class-only. First-class-only trains were common up to the 1980s (see [[Trans Europe Express]]) but are now rare. High-speed trains often charge more than slower-speed trains on the same route, but still have first- and second-class seats.\n\nTrains in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] are primarily operated as standard-class only, with only some of the longest distance services having a higher class, called Premier on [[IE 22000 Class]] stock, CityGold on [[Mark 4 (Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann)|Mark 4]] loco-hauled carriages and First Plus on the cross-border [[Enterprise (train service)|Enterprise]] service. No commuter services have premium classes. Premium benefits can be as limited as a reading light and waiter service; but reach to 2+1 recliner seating and enhanced catering options.\n\nIn Germany, there existed a \"fourth class\" (\"4. Klasse\") on almost every local train from the second half of the 19th century to 1928. It provided just a very low travel comfort, the passengers had to sit on even wooden planks with rudimentary backrests. Much of the space in the compartments was left empty to allow country folks to carry their goods and livestock inside the carriage.\n\n=== India ===\nThe [[Indian Railways]] offers six classes of train accommodation in general.\n\n* First Class A/C (1A) is the highest rail travel class and is not available on all trains. It offers air-conditioned cubicles in two-bed and four-bed formats with closing doors. There usually is only one 1A bogie (carriage) on a train.\n* Two Tier A/C (2A) offers air conditioned cubicles in four-bed + two-bed format, but the privacy is provided by curtains instead of the doors found in 1A. There are typically one or two 2A bogies on long-distance trains.\n* Three Tier A/C (3A) offers air conditioned cubicles in six-bed + two-bed format (six beds on one side and two beds on other side of the hallway). Most trains have two to five 3A bogies.\n* A/C Chair Car (CC) is a feature of short-distance trains that cover the journey within a day. The seating is usually in 3x3 format.\n* Sleeper Class (SL) is configured similarly to 3A but is not air conditioned. There are typically ten to fifteen SL bogies in a train.\n* Second Class (Reserved) (2S) similar as CC, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n* Second Class (II) for long-distance trains is similar to the SL cars but has wooden middle berths instead of upper berths.  However, local and suburban trains may offer a different variety of second class, which has an open cabin with rows of wooden seats facing each other in pairs.\n\nSome trains also have one of these classes:\n\n* Third AC Economy (3E). Similar to Three Tier A/C, however this class have an additional middle berth in the side section of the  air conditioned cubicle, making it a six-bed and three-bed format. This type of accommodation is created for less well off people, who desire a comfortable travel at lesser fare.\n* First Class (FC), which is similar in configuration to the 1A class but lacks air conditioning. The class is currently being phased out in favor of the slightly expensive 2A and cheaper 3A classes.  In 2011, it could be found only on Mumbai local train and a few trains across all of India.\n* Executive AC Chair Car (EC), has a 2x2 seat configuration and includes food catering service.  It is available only on the \"Shatabdi Express\" and \"Tejas Express\" trains, which link major cities located within a day-trip distance.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n{{see also|List of named passenger trains of Indonesia}}\n[[Indonesia]]n trains, operated by the [[state-owned]] [[Kereta Api Indonesia|PT Kereta Api Indonesia]] (the Indonesian Railways Co.), have now four classes for long-distance travel. All types of carriages are seating-only (no sleeper cars).\n\n* '''Executive/first class (''eksekutif'')'''\u2013the top and most expensive class, offers the most comfortable means of travel - 2\u20132 reclining seat configuration, on-board TV. Executive-class carriages are classified by the [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Ministry of Transportation]] as '''K1'''. Also, trains having Eksekutif cars are certainly the fastest ones \u2013 see the note below.\n** '''Argo class''' \u2013 this is the top class that all of train names use '''Argo''' brand.\n** '''Fauna class''' \u2013 below the Argos.\n* '''Business/second class (''bisnis'')'''\u2013medium class, the fare is around 60% of executive classes, 2\u20132 seating, fixed 60 degrees seat. Business-class carriages are classified by the Ministry of Transportation as '''K2'''. The Indonesian Railways is phasing out this class.\n* '''[[Premium economy class]]'''\u2013the intermediate level between the business and economy classes, the fare is nearly same as business, 2-2 reclining seat configuration.\n* '''Economy/third class (''ekonomi'')'''\u2013the lowest and cheapest class, below the premium class tickets are 4-5 times cheaper than business classes. Economy-class carriages are classified by the Ministry of Transportation as '''K3'''.\n** '''Commercial economy class''', 2-2 seat configuration\n** '''[[Public service obligation|PSO economy]] class''', 3-2 seat configuration, with split-type [[air conditioner|air conditioned]] (retrofitted from fans)\n\nAll classes are non-smoking and air conditioned. All passengers require a seat reservation, ''except'' for commuter trains. All seats can be reserved from 30\u201390 days before travel date until minutes before departure time when seats are still available.\nMedium and long distance trains have onboard cafeteria, [[flushing toilet]]s (older passenger coaches have [[squatting toilet]]s), onboard customer service representative (Train Manager), onboard security, and onboard cleaning services.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://tiket.kereta-api.co.id/index.php?_it8tnz=MTM=#layanan |title=Situs Resmi PT Kereta Api Indonesia (Persero)| website=Tiket.kereta-api.co.id |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221033/https://tiket.kereta-api.co.id/index.php?_it8tnz=MTM=| archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nExecutive class trains are the fastest and stop only on a few major stations (first priority). Business trains are somewhat slower, but generally do not stop too often as well there may be economy cars in these trains (second priority). Economy trains take significantly more time to reach the destination, as they stop on many smaller stations and have to [[passing loop|pass]] all executive and business class traffic going in the same direction (third priority). Many less important routes lack either business or executive service, or both. Some services have more two or three classes mixed together (executive-business, executive-economy, executive-premium economy, or executive-business-economy).\n\nFor local or commuter trains, single class service is the most common type of service. But in some areas there may be other classes as well which have different seating arrangement and travel time in which the lower classes has more stops than the upper one.

The first, ''The Primal Screamer'', was a fictionalized semi-autobiographical novel with [[Horror fiction|horror]] elements. It was published in 1995 by Spare Change Books and received a second printing in 2002. The book is written as a series of journal entries made by the therapist of \"Nathaniel Snoxell\" (who starts a band which is never named but is similar to Rudimentary Peni in many ways).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9aQmEBVFEYC |title=The Primal Screamer |via=[[Google Books]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref> This book was reprinted in 2011 by [[PM Press]], and collected artwork used for several previous editions under one cover for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipgbook.com/the-primal-screamer-products-9781604863314.php|title=Primal Screamer on Independent Publishers Group|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ipgbook.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref> The 2011 edition was distributed by the [[Alternative Tentacles]] label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativetentacles.com/product.php?product=511|title=Primal Screamer listing on Alternative Tentacles|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=alternativetentacles.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref>\n\nBlinko's second book, ''Haunted Head'', was published in 2009 by [[David Tibet]] via [[Coptic Cat]], in a limited edition of approximately 350 copies. An exclusive micro-edition of 60 copies was also published, featuring an original piece of art, while all copies of the book contained a postcard with a handwritten excerpt from the book. The edition size reflected the number of Blinko's handwritten postcards, from which the text of the book was transcribed, and which were included in the book. The book also included a one-track CD of a song by Rudimentary Peni called \"[[Wilfred Owen]] The Chances\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://copticcat.greedbag.com/buy/the-haunted-head-by-nick-blinko/|title=The Haunted Head by Nick Blinko archived on copticcat.com|publisher=copticcat.com|accessdate=2013-11-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109234840/http://copticcat.greedbag.com/buy/the-haunted-head-by-nick-blinko/|archivedate=9 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brainwashed.com/c93/htdocs/books/thhbook.php?site=c93|title=brainwashed.com listing - Haunted Head|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=brainwashed.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref>\n\nHis third book was titled ''Visions of Pope Adrian 37th''. It was published in 2011, again by Coptic Cat, in two extremely limited editions which both included a small piece of original art by Blinko, drawn directly onto a page of the book. The \"standard edition\" was limited to 370 copies, while the \"special edition\" was limited to 37.  The book included 87 drawings, an introduction by outsider art specialist Colin Rhodes and a brief introduction by Blinko. The artwork in this book was reproduced in its original A5 size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copticcat.com/news/259/56/Nick-Blinko-Visions-of-Pope-Adrian-37th-now-available-for-order|title=Nick-Blinko-Visions-of-Pope-Adrian-37th-now-available-for-order|publisher=copticcat.com|accessdate=2013-11-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110001623/http://www.copticcat.com/news/259/56/Nick-Blinko-Visions-of-Pope-Adrian-37th-now-available-for-order|archivedate=10 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectacularoptical.ca/2011/09/nick-blinko-%E2%80%98visions-of-pope-adrian-37th%E2%80%99-limited-edition-art-book/|title=Visions of Pope Adrian|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=spectacularoptical.ca|accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref>\n\nBlinko also contributed to a collection of punk fiction short stories, ''Gobbing, Pogoing and Gratuitous Bad Language!: An Anthology of Punk Short Stories by Stewart Home (1996-04-06)'', published in 1996 by Spare Change Books. His story, \"Punk Alice\" (a reference to Rudimentary Peni's song \"Alice Crucifies the Paedophiles\"), is written in a sketchbook style of doodles and scribbled phrases referencing the death of [[punk subculture|punk]], [[chess]], Catholicism, depression, [[goth subculture|goth]], Rudimentary Peni lyrics and drug chemicals.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britishoutsiderart.com/artists/nick_blinko.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1|title=Blinko profile at British Outsider Art.net|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=britishoutsiderart.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref>\n\n===Art===\nBlinko has contributed album artwork to several musical projects aside from his own.
