Speaking to a Mexican radio program, the \"Golden Girl\" said that the new material presented many changes. She explained: \"[...] at the same time I remain very loyal to my music; my rancheras, boleros, and simple rhythms like the songs we used to listen to as children\". She also added: \"This new production will have songs by Mario Domm, the leader of [[Camila (band)|Camila]], and Est\u00e9fano, but there are some songs of mine with Coti; it's an album to get out the child within us\".\n\n===Content===\nAccording to her web site, the idea of ''Gran City Pop'' is \"an imaginary and enormous city where Paulina groups in one vision, some of the life and musical experiences lived during the last years in many cities of the world; experiences that have marked her life forever and now she wants to share in ten songs with influences that enrich this new stage of her career. In the album she collaborates with Est\u00e9fano, Chris Rodr\u00edguez, [[Cachorro L\u00f3pez]], L\u00e9ster M\u00e9ndez and Coti\".<ref>[http://www.terra.com.pe/terrastereo/articulo/html/mus6969.htm The City Pop of Paulina Rubio]</ref>\n\nRubio started working on ''Gran City Pop'' in her [[Miami]] house studio in 2008 as a follow-up to her eighth album ''[[Ananda]]'', released in 2006.

Speaking to a Mexican radio program, the \"Golden Girl\" said that the new material presented many changes. She explained: \"[...] at the same time I remain very loyal to my music; my rancheras, boleros, and simple rhythms like the songs we used to listen to as children\". She also added: \"This new production will have songs by Mario Domm, the leader of [[Camila (band)|Camila]], and Est\u00e9fano, but there are some songs of mine with Coti; it's an album to get out the child within us\".\n\n===Content===\nAccording to her web site, the idea of ''Gran City Pop'' is \"an imaginary and enormous city where Paulina groups in one vision, some of the life and musical experiences lived during the last years in many cities of the world; experiences that have marked her life forever and now she wants to share in ten songs with influences that enrich this new stage of her career. In the album she collaborates with Est\u00e9fano, Chris Rodr\u00edguez, [[Cachorro L\u00f3pez]], L\u00e9ster M\u00e9ndez and Coti\".<ref>[http://www.terra.com.pe/terrastereo/articulo/html/mus6969.htm The City Pop of Paulina Rubio]</ref>\n\nRubio started working on ''Gran City Pop'' in her [[Miami]] house studio in 2008 as a follow-up to her eighth album ''[[Ananda]]'', released in 2006.

For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice. In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. holds that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and falsifiability==\n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created within the logical structure constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  Popper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"all men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Yet another example of an unfalsifiable statement is \"all angels have large wings\". It is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n\n===Basic statements===\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 14-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. The logical structure has universal classes. For example, the concept of swans define a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist or will exist. Once we know the universal classes, informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in these classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> However, this agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is then considered in details and, as we discussed [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| before]],  an actual agreement is needed.

In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice. In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. holds that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and falsifiability==\n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created within the logical structure constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  Popper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"all men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Yet another example of an unfalsifiable statement is \"all angels have large wings\". It is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n\n===Basic statements===\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 14-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. The logical structure has universal classes. For example, the concept of swans define a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist or will exist. Once we know the universal classes, informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in these classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> However, this agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principles. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is then considered in details and, as we discussed [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| before]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples).\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

She shares no relationship with Ratan or his family and there is no greed which drives her to do this. Set against the royal canvas of [[Rajasthan]], the show challenges the conventional perception of men being the protector of women. Ratan is constantly being targeted by attackers, and it is up to Diya to find the person behind the attacks who might as well be part of the family.\n\n==Story==\nThe show revolves around a [[Rajput]] Shatrani, Diya Sajjan Singh, who gave up 12 years of her life to protect the heir to the Rajput throne, Ratan Maan Singh. Ratan is 21 and lives in [[London]] after his parents, Harshwardan and Padma, were killed in an accident. He returns to Surajgarh to become the king.\n\nSeveral attempts to kill Ratan occur shortly after his arrival. Diya suspects it to be someone from the family. Padma's sister, Sushma (Choti Thakuranisa) is married to Bhuvan Singh (Chote Thakursa) and has two children Sakshi and Raghu. Sakshi is married to Mohak and Raghu to Priya who has borne him a son, Yash. Bhuvan has a sister, Nithya, whose son, Ayush, is married to Diya's sister, Isha.\n\nRatan and Diya devise a plot that could bring out the attacker by faking their love towards each other. Diya meets with a serious accident. While in the hospital, Priya tries to harm Diya, and the culprit is found. It turns out that Priya, Raghu, and Sushma were working together in trying to assassinate Ratan. Priya is imprisoned and Raghu is killed; Sushma realizes her mistake and begs forgiveness.\n\nSince Diya's duties are over, she decides to marry her fianc\u00e9, Abhay Rathore Singh. But Abhay's sister, Arpita, makes Abhay realize his twelve-year wait for Diya and they leave her stranded at the wedding ''mandap''. Ratan then finds out that his late father wanted him to marry Diya, so he reluctantly marries her. Ratan finds it hard to fulfill his responsibilities to Diya, also due to the nine-year age gap between them. More problems arise when Yash marries Mohana, Arpita's daughter. Ratan decides to divorce Diya, only after helping her win a case against Abhay and Arpita. Diya then realizes her love for Ratan. Another problem arises when a man claims that he is the real Ratan Maan Singh and tries to influence the entire family against Ratan. His truth is revealed, as he tries to assassinate the entire family. Ratan then realizes his love for Diya, and they work together with their family to eliminate the terrorist. The show ends revealing that Diya is pregnant with Ratan's child and Mohana is pregnant with Yash's child.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Tejaswi Prakash]] as Diya Ratan maan Singh, Ratan\u2019s wife\n* [[Rohit Suchanti]] as Ratan Maan Singh, Diya\u2019s husband\n\n===Recurring===\n{{div col}}\n<!--Don't change without references, please.-->\n* [[Puneet Sharma]] as Yash Raghu Singh\n* [[Siddharth Shivpuri]] as Yash Raghu Singh (replaced)\n* [[Ravjeet Singh]] as fake Ratan Maan Singh \n* [[Aditi Deshpande]] as Sushma Bhuvan Singh  \"Choti Thakuranisa\" \n* [[Adarsh Gautam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/video/entertainment/kishwer-merchant-to-make-an-entry-in-rishta-likhenge-hum-naya-422166|title=Adarsh Gautam to make an entry in Rishta Likhenge Hum Naya as Diya's father|date=17 January 2018|website=Indiatvnews.com}}</ref> as Sajjan Singh (Diya's father)\n* [[Anjali Gupta]] as Diya's mother, Jyoti Sajjan Singh\n* [[Jiten Lalwani]] as Bhuvan Singh \"Chote Thakur\"\n* [[Meenu Panchal]] as Sakshi Mohak Singh (n\u00e9e Bhuvan Singh)\n* [[Achherr Bhaardwaj]] as Mohak Pratap Singh\n* [[Kasturi Banerjjee]] as Nitya Singh (Bhuvan's sister)\n* [[Varunn Jain]] as Ayush Banna (Nitya's son/Isha's husband)\n* [[Manisha Saxena]] as Isha Sajjan Singh (Diya's sister/Ayush's wife)\n* [[Suyyash Rai]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/suyyash-rai-roped-in-to-play-tejaswi-prakashs-beau-in-pehredaar-piya-ki/|title=Suyyash Rai roped in to play Tejaswi Prakash\u2019s beau in \u2018Pehredaar Piya Ki\u2019|date=13 May 2017|website=BollywoodLife.com}}</ref> as Abhay Singh Rathore\n* [[Kishwer Merchant|Kishwer Merchant Rai]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/video/entertainment/kishwer-merchant-to-make-an-entry-in-rishta-likhenge-hum-naya-422166|title=Kishwer Merchant to make an entry in Rishta Likhenge Hum Naya|date=17 January 2018|website=Indiatvnews.com}}</ref> as Arpita Singh Rathore (Abhay's sister)\n* [[Garima Parihar]] as Mohana Yash Singh (Yash's wife/Arpita's daughter)\n* [[Gauri Singh]] as Priya Raghu Singh\n* Urvashi Sharma<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tellydhamaal.com/rishta-likhenge-hum-naya-urvashi-sharma-to-enter-as-meethi/|title=Rishta Likhenge Hum Naya \u2013 Urvashi Sharma to enter as Meethi \u2013 serial gossips, TV serial news, upcoming twists, spoilers, written updates|website=www.tellydhamaal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref> as Meethi (dead)\n* [[Aashish Kaul]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yGWZ0xvzZI|title=Episode 49|date=12 January 2018}}</ref> as Raghu Bhuvan Singh (dead)\n* [[Kishori Shahane]] as Padma Maan Singh (dead)\n* [[Khalid Siddiqui]] as Maan Singh (dead)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nThe cast has already been finalised.

She shares no relationship with Ratan or his family and there is no greed which drives her to do this. Set against the royal canvas of [[Rajasthan]], the show challenges the conventional perception of men being the protector of women. Ratan is constantly being targeted by attackers, and it is up to Diya to find the person behind the attacks who might as well be part of the family.\n\n==Story==\nThe show revolves around a [[Rajput]] Shatrani, Diya Sajjan Singh, who gave up 12 years of her life to protect the heir to the Rajput throne, Ratan Maan Singh. Ratan is 21 and lives in [[London]] after his parents, Harshwardan and Padma, were killed in an accident. He returns to Surajgarh to become the king.\n\nSeveral attempts to kill Ratan occur shortly after his arrival. Diya suspects it to be someone from the family. Padma's sister, Sushma (Choti Thakuranisa) is married to Bhuvan Singh (Chote Thakursa) and has 2 children Sakshi and Raghu. Sakshi is married to Mohak and Raghu to Priya who has borne him a son, Yash. Bhuvan has a sister, Nithya, whose son, Ayush, is married to Diya's sister, Isha.\n\nRatan and Diya devise a plot that could bring out the attacker by faking their love towards each other. Diya meets with a serious accident. While in the hospital, Priya tries to harm Diya, and the culprit is found. It turns out that Priya, Raghu, and Sushma were working together in trying to assassinate Ratan. Priya is put in jail and Raghu is killed; Sushma realizes her mistake and begs forgiveness.\n\nSince Diya's duties are over, she decides to get married to her fiancee, Abhay Rathore Singh. But Abhay's sister, Arpita, makes Abhay realize his 12-year wait for Diya and they leave her stranded at the wedding ''mandap''. Ratan then finds out that his late father wanted him to marry Diya, so he reluctantly marries her. Ratan finds it hard to fulfill his responsibilities to Diya, also due to the 9-year age gap between them. More problems arise when Yash marries Mohana, Arpita's daughter. Ratan decides to divorce Diya, only after helping her win a case against Abhay and Arpita. Diya then realizes her love for Ratan. Another problem arises when a man claims that he is the real Ratan Maan Singh and tries to influence the entire family against Ratan. His truth is revealed, as he tries to assassinate the entire family. Ratan then realizes his love for Diya, and they work together with their family to eliminate the terrorist. The show ends revealing that Diya is pregnant with Ratan's child and Mohana is pregnant with Yash's child.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Tejaswi Prakash]] as Diya Ratan maan Singh, Ratan\u2019s wife\n* [[Rohit Suchanti]] as Ratan Maan Singh, Diya\u2019s husband\n\n===Recurring===\n{{div col}}\n<!--Don't change without references, please.-->\n* [[Puneet Sharma]] as Yash Raghu Singh\n* [[Siddharth Shivpuri]] as Yash Raghu Singh (Replaced)\n* [[Ravjeet Singh]] as fake Ratan Maan Singh \n* [[Aditi Deshpande]] as Sushma Bhuvan Singh  \"Choti Thakuranisa\" \n* [[Adarsh Gautam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/video/entertainment/kishwer-merchant-to-make-an-entry-in-rishta-likhenge-hum-naya-422166|title=Adarsh Gautam to make an entry in Rishta Likhenge Hum Naya as Diya's father|date=17 January 2018|website=Indiatvnews.com}}</ref> as Sajjan Singh (Diya's father)\n* [[Anjali Gupta]] as Diya's mother, Jyoti Sajjan Singh\n* [[Jiten Lalwani]] as Bhuvan Singh \"Chote Thakur\"\n* [[Meenu Panchal]] as Sakshi Mohak Singh (nee Bhuvan Singh)\n* [[Achherr Bhaardwaj]] as Mohak Pratap Singh\n* [[Kasturi Banerjjee]] as Nitya Singh (Bhuvan's sister)\n* [[Varunn Jain]] as Ayush Banna (Nitya's son/Isha's husband)\n* [[Manisha Saxena]] as Isha Sajjan Singh (Diya's sister/Ayush's wife)\n* [[Suyyash Rai]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/suyyash-rai-roped-in-to-play-tejaswi-prakashs-beau-in-pehredaar-piya-ki/|title=Suyyash Rai roped in to play Tejaswi Prakash\u2019s beau in \u2018Pehredaar Piya Ki\u2019|date=13 May 2017|website=BollywoodLife.com}}</ref> as Abhay Singh Rathore\n* [[Kishwer Merchant|Kishwer Merchant Rai]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/video/entertainment/kishwer-merchant-to-make-an-entry-in-rishta-likhenge-hum-naya-422166|title=Kishwer Merchant to make an entry in Rishta Likhenge Hum Naya|date=17 January 2018|website=Indiatvnews.com}}</ref> as Arpita Singh Rathore (Abhay's sister)\n* [[Garima Parihar]] as Mohana Yash Singh (Yash's wife/Arpita's daughter)\n* [[Gauri Singh]] as Priya Raghu Singh\n* Urvashi Sharma<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tellydhamaal.com/rishta-likhenge-hum-naya-urvashi-sharma-to-enter-as-meethi/|title=Rishta Likhenge Hum Naya \u2013 Urvashi Sharma to enter as Meethi \u2013 serial gossips, TV serial news, upcoming twists, spoilers, written updates|website=www.tellydhamaal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref> as Meethi (dead)\n* [[Aashish Kaul]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yGWZ0xvzZI|title=Episode 49|date=12 January 2018}}</ref> as Raghu Bhuvan Singh (dead)\n* [[Kishori Shahane]] as Padma Maan Singh (dead)\n* [[Khalid Siddiqui]] as Maan Singh (dead)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nThe cast has already been finalised.

Protein phosphatase 1 is able to catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated enzymes by removing the phosphate group. Earl Sutherland explained in 1950, that the activity of phosphorylase was increased and thus [[glycogenolysis]] stimulated when liver slices were incubated with adrenalin and glucagon. Phosphorylation was considered a specific control mechanism for one metabolic pathway until the 1970s, when Lester Reed discovered that [[Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex|mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] was inactivated by phosphorylation. Also in the 1970s, the term multisite phosphorylation was coined in response to the discovery of proteins that are phosphorylated on two or more residues by two or more kinases. In 1975, it was shown that cAMP-dependent proteins kinases phosphorylate serine residues on specific amino acid sequence motifs. [[Raymond L.

Protein phosphorylation is highly conserved in pathways central to cell survival, such as cell cycle progression relying on Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), but individual phosphorylation sites are often flexible. Targets of CDK phosphorylation often have phosphosites in [[Intrinsically disordered proteins|disordered segments]], which are found in non-identical locations even in close species. Conversely, targets of CDK phosphorylation in structurally defined regions are more highly conserved. While CDK activity is critical for cell growth and survival in all eukaryotes, only very few phosphosites show strong conservation of their precise positions.

Elevated levels of \u03b1-Synuclein are found in patients with Parkinson's disease, and there seems to be a positive correlation between the amount of the \u03b1-Synuclein protein present in the patient and the severity of the disease.\n\nPhosphorylation of the amino acid Ser<sup>129</sup> in the \u03b1-Synuclein protein has a profound effect on the severity of the disease. There seem to be correlation between the total \u03b1-Synuclein concentration (unphosphorylated) and the severity of the symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients. Healthy patients seem to have higher levels of unphosphorylated \u03b1-Synuclein than patients with Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the measurement of the changes in the ratio of concentrations of phosphorylated \u03b1-Synuclein to unphosphorylated \u03b1-Synuclein within a patient could be a potential marker of the disease progression\n\nPhosphorylation of Ser<sup>129</sup> is associated with the aggregation of the protein and further damage to the nervous system. Furthermore, the aggregation of phosphorylated \u03b1-Synuclein can be enhanced if a presynaptic scaffold protein Sept4 is present in insufficient quantities. It is important to note that direct interaction of \u03b1-Synuclein with Sept4 protein inhibits the phosphorylation of Ser<sup>129</sup>.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/grant-detail.php?grant_id=384|title=Parkinson's Disease {{!}} Elucidating the Role of Phosphorylation in modulating alpha-synuclein aggregation and toxicity in Parkinson's disease and related disorders|website=Parkinson's Disease {{!}} The Michael J.

Advanced, highly accurate mass spectrometers are needed for these studies, limiting the technology to labs with high-end mass spectrometers. However, the analysis of phosphorylated peptides by mass spectrometry is still not as straightforward as for \u201cregular\u201d, unmodified peptides.

The origins of protein phosphorylation mechanisms are ancestral and have diverged greatly between different species. In eukaryotes, it is estimated that between 30 - 65% of all proteins may be phosphorylated, with tens or even hundreds of thousands of distinct phosphorylation sites.<ref name=Cohen>{{cite journal | author = Cohen P | title = The regulation of protein function by multisite phosphorylation \u2013 a 25 year update | journal = Trends Biochem.

However, in the case of proteins that must be phosphorylated to be active, it is less clear how they could have emerged from non-phosphorylated ancestors. It has been shown that a subset of serine phosphosites are often replaced by acidic residues such as aspartate and glutamate between different species. These anionic residues can interact with cationic residues such as lysine and arginine to form [[Salt bridge (protein and supramolecular)|salt bridges]], stable non-covalent interactions that alter a protein's structure. These phosphosites often participate in salt bridges, suggesting that some phosphorylation sites evolved as conditional \"on\" switches for salt bridges, allowing these proteins to adopt an active conformation only in response to a specific signal.<ref name=Pearlman>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pearlman SM, Serber Z, Ferrell JE | title = A Mechanism for the Evolution of Phosphorylation Sites | journal = Cell | year=2011 | volume=147 | issue=4 | pages=934\u2013946 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.052| pmid = 22078888 | pmc = 3220604 }}</ref>\n\nThere are ~600 known eukaryotic protein kinases, making them one of the largest gene families. Most phosphorylation is carried out by a single superfamily of protein kinases that share a conserved kinase domain. Protein phosphorylation is highly conserved in pathways central to cell survival, such as cell cycle progression relying on Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), but individual phosphorylation sites are often flexible. Targets of CDK phosphorylation often have phosphosites in [[Intrinsically disordered proteins|disordered segments]], which are found in non-identical locations even in close species. Conversely, targets of CDK phosphorylation in structurally defined regions are more highly conserved. While CDK activity is critical for cell growth and survival in all eukaryotes, only very few phosphosites show strong conservation of their precise positions. Positioning is likely to be highly important for phosphates that allosterically regulate protein structure, but much more flexible for phosphates that interact with phosphopeptide-binding domains to recruit regulatory proteins.<ref name=Holt>{{cite journal |vauthors=Holt LJ, Tuch BB, Vill\u00e9n J, Johnson AD, Gygi SP, Morgan DO | title = Global Analysis of Cdk1 Substrate Phosphorylation Sites Provides Insights into Evolution | journal = Science | year=2009 | volume=325 | issue=5948 | pages=1682\u20131686 | doi = 10.1126/science.1172867 | pmid=19779198 | pmc=2813701| bibcode=2009Sci...325.1682H }}</ref>\n\n===Comparisons between eukaryotes and prokaryotes===\nProtein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification of proteins. In eukaryotes, protein phosphorylation functions in cell signaling, gene expression, and differentiation. It is also involved in DNA replication during the cell cycle, and the mechanisms that cope with stress-induced replication blocks. Compared to eukaryotes, prokaryotes use Hanks-type kinases and phosphatases for signal transduction. Whether or not the phosphorylation of proteins in bacteria can also regulate processes like DNA repair or replication still remains unclear.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Garcia-Garcia|first1=Transito|title=Role Of Protein Phosphorylation In The Regulation Of Cell Cycle And DNA-Related Processes In Bacteria|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=7|date=2016|pages=184|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.00184|pmid=26909079|pmc=4754617}}</ref>\n\nCompared to the protein phosphorylation of prokaryotes, studies of protein phosphorylation in eukaryotes from yeast to human cells have been rather extensive. It is known that eukaryotes rely on the phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group on the side chains of serine, threonine, and tyrosine for cell signaling. These  are the main regulatory post-translational modifications in eukaryotic cells but the protein phosphorylation of prokaryotes are less intensely studied. While serine, threonine, and tyrosine are phosphorylated in eukaryotes, histidine and aspartate is phosphorylated in prokaryotes, plants and non-plant eukaryotes. In bacteria, histidine phosphorylation occurs in the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems (PTSs), which are involved in the process of internalization as well as the phosphorylation of sugars.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Macek|first1=B.|last2=Mijakovic|first2=I.|last3=Olsen|first3=J.|last4=Gnad|first4=F|last5=Kumar|first5=C.|last6=Jensen|first6=P.|title=The serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphoproteome of the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis|journal=Mol.

This protein is coded by the PARRK1 gene and in its native form, \u03b1-Synuclein is involved in the recycling of the synaptic vesicles that carry neurotransmitters and naturally occurs in an unfolded form. Elevated levels of \u03b1-Synuclein are found in patients with Parkinson's disease, and there seems to be a positive correlation between the amount of the \u03b1-Synuclein protein present in the patient and the severity of the disease.\n\nPhosphorylation of the amino acid Ser<sup>129</sup> in the \u03b1-Synuclein protein has a profound effect on the severity of the disease. There seem to be correlation between the total \u03b1-Synuclein concentration (unphosphorylated) and the severity of the symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients. Healthy patients seem to have higher levels of unphosphorylated \u03b1-Synuclein than patients with Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the measurement of the changes in the ratio of concentrations of phosphorylated \u03b1-Synuclein to unphosphorylated \u03b1-Synuclein within a patient could be a potential marker of the disease progression\n\nPhosphorylation of Ser<sup>129</sup> is associated with the aggregation of the protein and further damage to the nervous system. Furthermore, the aggregation of phosphorylated \u03b1-Synuclein can be enhanced if a presynaptic scaffold protein Sept4 is present in insufficient quantities. It is important to note that direct interaction of \u03b1-Synuclein with Sept4 protein inhibits the phosphorylation of Ser<sup>129</sup>.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/grant-detail.php?grant_id=384|title=Parkinson's Disease {{!}} Elucidating the Role of Phosphorylation in modulating alpha-synuclein aggregation and toxicity in Parkinson's disease and related disorders|website=Parkinson's Disease {{!}} The Michael J.

The Season 4.5 DVD and Blu-ray releases for Region 1 feature an extended version of the finale, which not only combines all three parts as a single episode, but also integrates it with new scenes not seen in the aired versions of either part. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 1 is 39,516. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 2 is 39,406. At the end of Part 2, Admiral Adama announces the survivor population at approximately 38,000.\n\nThe episodes portray the ''Galactica'' launching a rescue mission to retrieve [[Hera Agathon]] from the \"colony\", a heavily armed and defended Cylon base located near a [[black hole]]. They manage to rescue Hera, and in the end, the fleet finds a new planet to settle on, which they come to call Earth (revealed to be our [[Earth]]). The final episodes gave ''Battlestar Galactica'' the strongest ratings since its second season, though they received mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part 1===\n[[File:DaybreakPart1.jpg|thumbnail|right|The ''Galactica'' crew members and civilians divide themselves between those joining the rescue attempt, and those staying behind with the fleet.]] The flashback sequences during the course of the first part take place a few years before the Cylon attack on Caprica. [[William Adama]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) is reluctant to undergo a lie detector test in preparation for a civilian desk job. Elsewhere, [[Gaius Baltar]] ([[James Callis]]) is getting tired of his father, Julius, who is abusive to his nurse. However, [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Caprica Six]] ([[Tricia Helfer]]) soon informs Baltar that she took his father into a care home, where he will be happier. [[Laura Roslin]] ([[Mary McDonnell]]) is living happily with her two sisters, one of whom is pregnant. But later, Roslin receives distressing news that both her sisters and father were killed in a car accident. Three months after, she is set up for a blind date and is encouraged to join [[Richard Adar|Mayor Adar's]] presidential campaign. [[Lee Adama]] ([[Jamie Bamber]]) meets [[Kara Thrace]] ([[Katee Sackhoff]]) for the first time while she is seeing his brother, [[Zak Adama|Zak]] ([[Tobias Mehler]]). When Lee arrives home drunk, he notices a [[pigeon]] in his house, and he chases it away. Lastly, the flashbacks focus on [[Samuel Anders|Anders]] ([[Michael Trucco]]), who is interviewed during his sporting career, where he admits to playing for the joy of the pursuit of perfection rather than the winning.\n\nBack in the present, ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)#Battlestar Galactica (2003)|Galactica]]'' is being stripped for parts to be used on other ships, while the military will be transferred to control the Rebel [[Basestar]]. The pictures of the fallen in the memorial hallway are also taken down. Baltar wants his people to have a seat on the quorum, but Lee refuses.

Adama announces a plan to rescue the child Hera at the colony and that it will be a one-way trip for the Galactica, and requires all Galactica personnel to either volunteer for the mission or decline in person.  He and Starbuck lay a line down the center of the landing bay and personnel move to one side to volunteer or the other to remain with the Fleet.  [[Sherman Cottle|Doc Cottle]] ([[Donnelly Rhodes]]) attempts to join in, but is ordered back by Adama as the fleet cannot afford to lose a doctor. Several others join in the operation, including the original Cylon models, and a weakened Roslin. A Raptor is dispatched to the possible location of the \"Colony\", only to find it located very close to a [[black hole]], but despite the circumstance, Adama orders an attack to begin and planning commences.\n\n===Part 2===\nIn flashback sequences, William Adama and [[Saul Tigh]] ([[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]]) celebrate their upcoming retirement, where Tigh convinces Adama to take his new job. Later, as  Adama is questioned in an interview, he complains that no job is worth questioning his loyalty and decides to rejoin the military. Lee has dinner with Zak and [[Kara Thrace|Starbuck]] again. When Zak passes out, drunk, the sexual tension between Kara and Lee nearly erupts before they are interrupted by a stirring Zak. Back home, Lee again encounters the pigeon, but this time he does not chase it. Roslin meets her blind date, who happens to be a former student of hers. After they go back to her apartment, she has second thoughts and ends the date; she then calls Adar's campaign, informing them of her intention to join it. Boomer meets Adama and Tigh for the first time, where she is warned that she is on the verge of ending her career due to her inability to land a Raptor. Given one last chance, Boomer gratefully tells the two that unlike other pilots, she will repay Adama one day. Meanwhile, Baltar, believing that Caprica Six is a corporate spy, allows her access to the military defense mainframe. He says that he is not doing this for her employers, but for her.\n\nBack in the present of the series, Baltar decides to join the mission with Caprica Six at the last minute; she later admits to being proud of him for the first time. At that moment it is revealed that Baltar's Inner Six and Six's Inner Baltar are aware of each other, and the two real-life counterparts see both of them. [[Romo Lampkin]] ([[Mark Sheppard]]) is installed as president, and Hoshi (Brad Dryborough) is given command of the fleet while Adama and ''Galactica'' set off to rescue Hera. A battalion of the self-aware Cylon Centurions who are aligned with the fleet march down the flight deck  - red stripes painted diagonally on their chests to distinguish them from the others.\n\n''Galactica'' jumps right next to the colony, where they are immediately fired upon. Some of the Raptors, which are armed with [[nuclear weapon]]s, make a short jump into the debris field and fly toward the back of the colony; in the process, [[Margaret Edmondson|Racetrack]] ([[Leah Cairns]]) and Skulls (Collin Lawrence) are killed by an asteroid. Anders has been installed into the CIC computers, and disables the Colony hybrids (Tiffany Lyndall-Knight). Starbuck's Raptor, carrying Athena and Helo, lands on the Colony - the only Raptor to make it through - and they enter to search for Hera. ''Galactica'' rams straight into the colony, where a strike team led by Apollo rappels in from ''Galactica'' to search for Hera, eventually meeting with Starbuck's squad. Hera is rescued by Boomer, who kills [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Simon]] ([[Rick Worthy]]) and finds Starbuck's team. Boomer hands Hera over to [[Sharon Agathon|Athena]] ([[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]]) and tells her to \"tell the old man I owed him one.\"  After her daughter is returned, Athena kills Boomer.\n\n''Galactica'' is set upon by Cylon boarding parties arriving in \"platoon strength\", as reported to Tigh and Adama in the CIC. As Starbuck, Apollo, Athena and Helo return to the battlestar and make their way to CIC, they encounter a boarding party composed of Cavil's modern Centurions and original Cylon War models.  Hera runs away in the confusion. She is spotted by Roslin, who had a vision of her while assisting with [[triage]], and is able to hide her from the Cylons, until she disappears again. While Roslin gives chase, Baltar and Caprica Six also spot Hera and give chase as well. The chase parallels the Opera House vision shared between Athena, Roslin and Caprica Six.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Crossroads |episodelink=Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica) |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Michael Rymer]] (director); [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]] (writer) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=3 |number=19}}</ref> The chase ends in the CIC, where [[John Cavil|Cavil]] ([[Dean Stockwell]]) takes her hostage and demands to leave with Hera so she can be dissected and establish a method for Cylons to reproduce.

Tigh provides the final incentive, saying that the Final Five will give the Cylons back resurrection (a solution to the problem of Cylon extinction) if they vow to forever go separate ways from humanity and end their pursuit.  Combined, this convinces Cavil and Adama to end the war, Cavil gives Hera back and will let them leave in peace when the Final Five give the technology for resurrection.\n\n===Part 3===\nCavil calls a cease fire in preparation for the data download and the boarding parties retreat.  Roslin and Adama look on as the Final Five begin the download of the technology for resurrection, with Saul and [[Ellen Tigh]] ([[Kate Vernon]]), Tory Foster ([[Rekha Sharma]]) and [[Galen Tyrol]] ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]) dipping their hands into [[Samuel Anders]]' ([[Michael Trucco]]) tank to transfer the data to the Colony. Ellen warns that during the download they will briefly have full knowledge of each other's memories and experiences.  Tory asks that all bygones be left bygones.  The download commences and the Final Five experience flashbacks to each other's lives on Earth and in the colonies.  Tyrol learns then that Tory murdered his wife, [[Cally Tyrol|Cally]], and kills her in revenge before the downloading is complete. Feeling betrayed, the Cylons resume fighting; after the other Cylons in CIC are killed, Cavil commits [[suicide]]. At the same instant, a chance rock strike in the debris field causes Racetrack's dead hand to fall on the launch button for her Raptor's nuclear weapons, which were primed for launch before the Raptor's crew was lost.  The missiles strike directly into the Colony, knocking it out of orbit.  With ''Galactica'' still tangled in the Colony and being dragged toward the singularity along with it, Adama orders Starbuck to jump the ship away, anywhere. In a flash of inspiration, Starbuck mutters \"[[All Along the Watchtower|there must be some kind of way out of here]]\" and enters coordinates into the computer as if she were playing the [[All Along the Watchtower|mysterious music notes]] which Hera had written. ''Galactica'' jumps away and out of danger, leaving the Colony to fall to its destruction within the black hole.<ref name=\"podcast\">{{cite podcast|url=http://media.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/mp3/421-423/bsg_ep421-423_FULL.mp3 |title=Podcast for \"Daybreak\" (56.3 MB) |website=[scifi.com] |publisher=[[Scifi.com]] |host=Ronald D Moore |accessdate=April 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324221120/http://media.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/mp3/421-423/bsg_ep421-423_FULL.mp3 |archivedate=March 24, 2009 }}</ref>  The war is over, and the Humans and their allies have prevailed.\n\n''Galactica'' arrives at Kara's mysterious coordinates, its final destination as the damage caused in the battle has rendered the ship incapable of surviving any further jumps. Miraculously, the ''Galactica'' finds itself in orbit around a moon, close to a habitable world: our own [[Earth]].\n\nHours later, the rest of the fleet joins Galactica at this new world.  Lee makes the unorthodox suggestion that they abandon their technology and start afresh, while Adama and others discover primitive humans already occupying the planet. Since finding Earth had always been the goal of the Colonial Fleet, Adama suggests they call this new planet \"Earth\". The survivors - ''Galactica's'' crew, the remaining inhabitants of the fleet, and the Cylon Twos, Sixes and Eights - take basic supplies and spread out across the planet - not to colonize and impose cities like the [[Twelve Colonies]], but to blend in with primitive early humans, adding their own human and humanoid Cylon \"genetics\" to the early humans. Anders takes control of their abandoned fleet and pilots it into the Sun, so that the new arrivals \"can give them the best part of ourselves... not the baggage... not the weapons... our hearts (rather than) our science\". The Rebel Cylons decide that their Centurions have earned their freedom, and give them control of the Basestar, which jumps away to parts unknown.  Baltar and Caprica Six are visited by their [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Head/Inner/Messenger Six|Inner messengers]], who inform them that their destinies - to save Hera - have been fulfilled, and the two decide to live out the rest of their lives together.\n\nWhile resting under a tree, Roslin suddenly begins to have difficulty breathing.  Adama quickly places her aboard a Raptor and says a short, final goodbye to Lee and Starbuck before taking off. While admiring the wildlife below and looking for a place to build a cabin for them, Roslin dies peacefully.  While Lee expresses his desire to venture off and explore the planet, Starbuck, her destiny as an Angel fulfilled, literally vanishes without a trace.  Lee promises to never forget her.  Tyrol decides to settle by himself on a remote northern island (implied to be the Scottish highlands). Helo ([[Tahmoh Penikett]]), Athena and Hera are reunited as a family. Tigh and Ellen stay with the rest of the survivors. Adama eventually finds the place where he will build the cabin, and buries Laura on a nearby hillside.\n\n===Epilogue===\n[[New York City]], 150,000 years later: humanity has reached the early 21st century, and the development of robotics and computerization continues unabated.

At the end of Part 2, Admiral Adama announces the survivor population at approximately 38,000.\n\nThe episodes portray the ''Galactica'' launching a rescue mission to retrieve [[Hera Agathon]] from the \"colony\", a heavily armed and defended Cylon base located near a [[black hole]]. They manage to rescue Hera, and in the end, the fleet finds a new planet to settle on, which they come to call Earth (revealed to be our [[Earth]]). The final episodes gave ''Battlestar Galactica'' the strongest ratings since its second season, though they received mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part 1===\n[[File:DaybreakPart1.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Galactica crew members and civilians divide themselves between those joining the rescue attempt, and those staying behind with the fleet.]] The flashback sequences during the course of the first part take place a few years before the Cylon attack on Caprica. [[William Adama]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) is reluctant to undergo a lie detector test in preparation for a civilian desk job. Elsewhere, [[Gaius Baltar]] ([[James Callis]]) is getting tired of his father, Julius, who is abusive to his nurse. However, [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Caprica Six]] ([[Tricia Helfer]]) soon informs Baltar that she took his father into a care home, where he will be happier. [[Laura Roslin]] ([[Mary McDonnell]]) is living happily with her two sisters, one of whom is pregnant. But later, Roslin receives distressing news that both her sisters and father were killed in a car accident. Three months after, she is set up for a blind date and is encouraged to join [[Richard Adar|Mayor Adar's]] presidential campaign. [[Lee Adama]] ([[Jamie Bamber]]) meets [[Kara Thrace]] ([[Katee Sackhoff]]) for the first time while she is seeing his brother, [[Zak Adama|Zak]] ([[Tobias Mehler]]). When Lee arrives home drunk, he notices a [[pigeon]] in his house, and he chases it away. Lastly, the flashbacks focus on [[Samuel Anders|Anders]] ([[Michael Trucco]]), who is interviewed during his sporting career, where he admits to playing for the joy of the pursuit of perfection rather than the winning.\n\nBack in the present, ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)#Battlestar Galactica (2003)|Galactica]]'' is being stripped for parts to be used on other ships, while the military will be transferred to control the Rebel [[Basestar]]. The pictures of the fallen in the memorial hallway are also taken down. Baltar wants his people to have a seat on the quorum, but Lee refuses. Admiral Adama later decides to give [[amnesty]] to those who took part in the attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]],<ref>{{cite episode |title=Blood on the Scales |episodelink=Blood on the Scales |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Wayne Rose]] (director); [[Michael Angeli]] (writer) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=4 |number=16}}</ref> as well as to [[Galen Tyrol|Tyrol]] ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]), who is in the brig for helping [[Sharon Valerii|Boomer]] ([[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]]) escape.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Someone to Watch Over Me |episodelink=Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica) |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Michael Nankin]] (director); [[Bradley Thompson]] & [[David Weddle]] (writers) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=4 |number=19}}</ref> This allows Tyrol to take part in the mission to retrieve [[Hera Agathon|Hera]] (Iliana Gomez-Martinez), who is being studied by the [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylons]] to determine how Cylons can reproduce. Adama announces a plan to rescue the child Hera at the colony and that it will be a one-way trip for the Galactica, and requires all Galactica personnel to either volunteer for the mission or decline in person.  He and Starbuck lay a line down the center of the landing bay and personnel move to one side to volunteer or the other to remain with the Fleet.  [[Sherman Cottle|Doc Cottle]] ([[Donnelly Rhodes]]) attempts to join in, but is ordered back by Adama as the fleet cannot afford to lose a doctor. Several others join in the operation, including the original Cylon models, and a weakened Roslin. A Raptor is dispatched to the possible location of the \"Colony\", only to find it located very close to a [[black hole]], but despite the circumstance, Adama orders an attack to begin and planning commences.\n\n===Part 2===\nIn flashback sequences, William Adama and [[Saul Tigh]] ([[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]]) celebrate their upcoming retirement, where Tigh convinces Adama to take his new job. Later, as  Adama is questioned in an interview, he complains that no job is worth questioning his loyalty and decides to rejoin the military. Lee has dinner with Zak and [[Kara Thrace|Starbuck]] again. When Zak passes out, drunk, the sexual tension between Kara and Lee nearly erupts before they are interrupted by a stirring Zak. Back home, Lee again encounters the pigeon, but this time he does not chase it. Roslin meets her blind date, who happens to be a former student of hers. After they go back to her apartment, she has second thoughts and ends the date; she then calls Adar's campaign, informing them of her intention to join it. Boomer meets Adama and Tigh for the first time, where she is warned that she is on the verge of ending her career due to her inability to land a Raptor. Given one last chance, Boomer gratefully tells the two that unlike other pilots, she will repay Adama one day. Meanwhile, Baltar, believing that Caprica Six is a corporate spy, allows her access to the military defense mainframe. He says that he is not doing this for her employers, but for her.\n\nBack in the present of the series, Baltar decides to join the mission with Caprica Six at the last minute; she later admits to being proud of him for the first time. At that moment it is revealed that Baltar's Inner Six and Six's Inner Baltar are aware of each other, and the two real-life counterparts see both of them. [[Romo Lampkin]] ([[Mark Sheppard]]) is installed as president, and Hoshi (Brad Dryborough) is given command of the fleet while Adama and ''Galactica'' set off to rescue Hera. A battalion of the self-aware Cylon Centurions who are aligned with the fleet march down the flight deck  - red stripes painted diagonally on their chests to distinguish them from the others.\n\n''Galactica'' jumps right next to the colony, where they are immediately fired upon. Some of the Raptors, which are armed with [[nuclear weapon]]s, make a short jump into the debris field and fly toward the back of the colony; in the process, [[Margaret Edmondson|Racetrack]] ([[Leah Cairns]]) and Skulls (Collin Lawrence) are killed by an asteroid. Anders has been installed into the CIC computers, and disables the Colony hybrids (Tiffany Lyndall-Knight). Starbuck's Raptor, carrying Athena and Helo, lands on the Colony - the only Raptor to make it through - and they enter to search for Hera. ''Galactica'' rams straight into the colony, where a strike team led by Apollo rappels in from ''Galactica'' to search for Hera, eventually meeting with Starbuck's squad. Hera is rescued by Boomer, who kills [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Simon]] ([[Rick Worthy]]) and finds Starbuck's team. Boomer hands Hera over to [[Sharon Agathon|Athena]] ([[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]]) and tells her to \"tell the old man I owed him one.\"  After her daughter is returned, Athena kills Boomer.\n\n''Galactica'' is set upon by Cylon boarding parties arriving in \"platoon strength\", as reported to Tigh and Adama in the CIC. As Starbuck, Apollo, Athena and Helo return to the battlestar and make their way to CIC, they encounter a boarding party composed of Cavil's modern Centurions and original Cylon War models.  Hera runs away in the confusion. She is spotted by Roslin, who had a vision of her while assisting with [[triage]], and is able to hide her from the Cylons, until she disappears again. While Roslin gives chase, Baltar and Caprica Six also spot Hera and give chase as well. The chase parallels the Opera House vision shared between Athena, Roslin and Caprica Six.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Crossroads |episodelink=Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica) |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Michael Rymer]] (director); [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]] (writer) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=3 |number=19}}</ref> The chase ends in the CIC, where [[John Cavil|Cavil]] ([[Dean Stockwell]]) takes her hostage and demands to leave with Hera so she can be dissected and establish a method for Cylons to reproduce.

Tigh provides the final incentive, saying that the Final Five will give the Cylons back resurrection (a solution to the problem of Cylon extinction) if they vow to forever go separate ways from humanity and end their pursuit.  Combined, this convinces Cavil and Adama to end the war, Cavil gives Hera back and will let them leave in peace when the Final Five give the technology for resurrection.\n\n===Part 3===\nCavil calls a cease fire in preparation for the data download and the boarding parties retreat.  Roslin and Adama look on as the Final Five begin the download of the technology for resurrection, with Saul and [[Ellen Tigh]] ([[Kate Vernon]]), Tory Foster ([[Rekha Sharma]]) and [[Galen Tyrol]] ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]) dipping their hands into [[Samuel Anders]]' ([[Michael Trucco]]) tank to transfer the data to the Colony. Ellen warns that during the download they will briefly have full knowledge of each other's memories and experiences.  Tory asks that all bygones be left bygones.  The download commences and the Final Five experience flashbacks to each other's lives on Earth and in the colonies.  Tyrol learns then that Tory murdered his wife, [[Cally Tyrol|Cally]], and kills her in revenge before the downloading is complete. Feeling betrayed, the Cylons resume fighting; after the other Cylons in CIC are killed, Cavil commits [[suicide]]. At the same instant, a chance rock strike in the debris field causes Racetrack's dead hand to fall on the launch button for her Raptor's nuclear weapons, which were primed for launch before the Raptor's crew was lost.  The missiles strike directly into the Colony, knocking it out of orbit.  With ''Galactica'' still tangled in the Colony and being dragged toward the singularity along with it, Adama orders Starbuck to jump the ship away, anywhere. In a flash of inspiration, Starbuck mutters \"[[All Along the Watchtower|there must be some kind of way out of here]]\" and enters coordinates into the computer as if she were playing the [[All Along the Watchtower|mysterious music notes]] which Hera had written. ''Galactica'' jumps away and out of danger, leaving the Colony to fall to its destruction within the black hole.<ref name=\"podcast\">{{cite podcast|url=http://media.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/mp3/421-423/bsg_ep421-423_FULL.mp3 |title=Podcast for \"Daybreak\" (56.3 MB) |website=[scifi.com] |publisher=[[Scifi.com]] |host=Ronald D Moore |accessdate=April 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324221120/http://media.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/mp3/421-423/bsg_ep421-423_FULL.mp3 |archivedate=March 24, 2009 }}</ref>  The war is over, and the Humans and their allies have prevailed.\n\n''Galactica'' arrives at Kara's mysterious coordinates, its final destination as the damage caused in the battle has rendered the ship incapable of surviving any further jumps. Miraculously, the ''Galactica'' finds itself in orbit around a moon, close to a habitable world: our own [[Earth]].\n\nHours later, the rest of the fleet joins Galactica at this new world.  Lee makes the unorthodox suggestion that they abandon their technology and start afresh, while Adama and others discover primitive humans already occupying the planet. Since finding Earth had always been the goal of the Colonial Fleet, Adama suggests they call this new planet \"Earth\". The survivors - ''Galactica's'' crew, the remaining inhabitants of the fleet, and the Cylon Twos, Sixes and Eights - take basic supplies and spread out across the planet - not to colonize and impose cities like the [[Twelve Colonies]], but to blend in with primitive early humans, adding their own human and humanoid Cylon \"genetics\" to the early humans. Anders takes control of their abandoned fleet and pilots it into the Sun, so that the new arrivals \"can give them the best part of ourselves... not the baggage... not the weapons... our hearts (rather than) our science\". The Rebel Cylons decide that their Centurions have earned their freedom, and give them control of the Basestar, which jumps away to parts unknown.  Baltar and Caprica Six are visited by their [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Head/Inner/Messenger Six|Inner messengers]], who inform them that their destinies - to save Hera - have been fulfilled, and the two decide to live out the rest of their lives together.\n\nWhile resting under a tree, Roslin suddenly begins to have difficulty breathing.  Adama quickly places her aboard a Raptor and says a short, final goodbye to Lee and Starbuck before taking off. While admiring the wildlife below and looking for a place to build a cabin for them, Roslin dies peacefully.  While Lee expresses his desire to venture off and explore the planet, Starbuck, her destiny as an Angel fulfilled, literally vanishes without a trace.  Lee promises to never forget her.  Tyrol decides to settle by himself on a remote northern island (implied to be the Scottish highlands). Helo ([[Tahmoh Penikett]]), Athena and Hera are reunited as a family. Tigh and Ellen stay with the rest of the survivors. Adama eventually finds the place where he will build the cabin, and buries Laura on a nearby hillside.\n\n===Epilogue===\n[[New York City]], 150,000 years later: humanity has reached the early 21st century, and the development of robotics and computerization continues unabated.

On September 22, on the first-ever ''Raw'' to be broadcast from [[Madison Square Garden]], Hart was giving a speech to the fans in attendance. During his speech, Austin entered the ring with five NYPD officers following and assaulted Hart. As it looked like Austin was going to fight the officers, Vince McMahon ran into the ring to lecture Austin about why he could not be physically able to compete. After telling McMahon that he respects the fact that he and the WWF cared, Austin attacked McMahon with a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving McMahon in shock. Austin was then arrested as part of the storyline. Austin was sidelined until [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]].

Austin flipped off Tyson, which led to Tyson shoving Austin much to McMahon's embarrassment, who began to publicly disapprove of the prospect of Austin as his champion.

Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stone Cold Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to \"play ball\" with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who in the course of the segment proceeded to tear off the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, [[Groin attack|punch]] his boss in the \"[[Testicles|corporate grapefruits]]\" and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain. In April 1998, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at [[Unforgiven: In Your House]], where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair, then the following month they had a rematch at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]] for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the title despite McMahon acting as the referee and his \"Corporate Stooges\" ([[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]]) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. McMahon continued to do everything he could to ruin Austin and he finally scored a big victory for his side at [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]].<ref name=slam/> Austin lost the WWF Championship to [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in a First Blood match after The Undertaker accidentally hit him with a steel chair while the ref was incapacitated, despite Austin having knocked Kane unconscious and thwarted an earlier intervention by Mankind.<ref name=slam/>\n\nAustin further angered McMahon by winning back the championship the next night on ''Raw Is War''.<ref name=slam/> Austin also emerged victorious against The Undertaker at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]]. In response, McMahon set up a Triple Threat match at [[Breakdown: In Your House]], where The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin at the same time. McMahon decided to vacate the WWF Championship<ref name=slam/> and award it based on a match between The Undertaker and Kane, in which Austin was the guest referee on [[Judgment Day: In Your House]]. Austin refused to count for either man and attacked both towards the end of the match. McMahon later fired him, although Austin got revenge by kidnapping McMahon and dragging him to the middle of the ring at \"gunpoint\", which ended up being a toy gun with a scroll that read \"Bang! 3:16\". During that segment, McMahon also learned that Stone Cold was later re-signed by his son, [[Shane McMahon]]. In the semifinals of the [[Survivor Series]] tournament to award the vacant WWF Championship, Austin lost to Mankind after Shane double-crossed Austin. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', [[Mills Lane|Judge Mills Lane]] ruled that The Rock had to defend his newly won WWF Championship against Austin that night, as stipulated in the new contract Austin had signed two weeks earlier with Shane. The Undertaker interfered and hit Austin with a shovel, earning Austin a disqualification victory. However, because the title would not change hands via disqualification, The Rock still kept the championship. At [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]], Austin defeated The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match after Kane performed a Tombstone Piledriver on The Undertaker into the grave. With this victory, Austin qualified for the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 Royal Rumble]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Steve Austin soaks in cheers.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin celebrates with [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] [[Earl Hebner]]]]\nAustin's next definitive chance to exact revenge on Mr. McMahon came during the 1999 Royal Rumble match. On ''Raw Is War'', McMahon drew Austin's entry number with the obvious intention of screwing him over. Austin drew entry number one, while McMahon drew number two thanks to WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels. During the Royal Rumble match, McMahon slipped out of the ring and into the crowd as Austin chased him down. It turned out to be a trap as McMahon led Austin into the lobby restroom where he was ambushed by members of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]. Austin was injured and taken away in an ambulance. With Austin gone and not in the Rumble match, McMahon joined the announcers' table in calling the match. Later on, however, Austin returned in an ambulance and re-entered the Royal Rumble, delivering a Stone Cold Stunner to [[Ray Traylor|Big Boss Man]] and eliminating him. With the assistance of The Corporation and a last-minute interference from The Rock, Austin was eliminated by McMahon himself, who won the 1999 Royal Rumble.<ref name=slam/>\n\nWith McMahon turning down his number-one contender spot against The Rock, WWF Commissioner Michaels awarded Austin the title shot the next night on ''Raw Is War''. At [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], Stone Cold got a one-on-one match against McMahon in a [[Steel Cage match|steel cage match]], with the WWF Championship opportunity at [[WrestleMania XV]] at stake.<ref name=slam/> During the match, [[Big Show|Paul Wight]] made his debut, breaking through from under the ring and attacking Austin. Wight's attack propelled Austin into the side of the cage forcing the cage to give way and dropping Austin to the floor first, making him the victor.<ref name=slam/> Austin defeated The Rock at WrestleMania XV to win his third WWF Championship.<ref name=slam/> Austin faced The Rock in a rematch at [[Backlash: In Your House|Backlash]], in which Shane McMahon was the referee. During the match, Vince McMahon approached the ring, only to hand Austin back his Smoking Skull title belt and take Shane out of the proceedings. Austin won the match when another referee made the count. Austin would lose the title to The Undertaker at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]]. Due to events revolving around Vince McMahon, [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]] and [[Linda McMahon]] made Austin the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company as part of the storyline. Vince and Shane McMahon challenged Austin to a handicap [[ladder match]] at [[King of the Ring#1999|King of the Ring]] with the CEO title on the line, which the duo of father and son won. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin made it clear that while he was the CEO of the company he could have a title shot at any time and place to be determined by himself. Austin made the WWF Championship match that night on ''Raw Is War'' and defeated The Undertaker to win his fourth WWF Championship. However, after he won it The Undertaker came and hit him with the title belt, leading to a First Blood match between the two at [[WWF Fully Loaded 1999|Fully Loaded]], where Mr. McMahon stipulated that if Austin lost he would never be able to wrestle for the WWF Championship again, and if Austin won he would never see McMahon again. Austin won after interference from X-Pac, hitting The Undertaker with a TV camera and gave McMahon a goodbye Stone Cold Stunner.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Rivalry with Triple H and The Alliance (1999\u20132001) ====\n{{main|The Power Trip|The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Alliance (professional wrestling)|l1=Two-Man Power Trip|l2=The Invasion|l3=The Alliance}}\n[[File:Me&austin.jpg|thumb|Austin with a fan]]\nAustin held on to the WWF Championship until [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], when he lost it to Mankind in a triple threat match also featuring [[Triple H]].<ref name=slam/> Triple H was originally scheduled to win his first championship at the event, but Austin refused to drop it to him, believing Triple H was not over enough with the crowd yet, so Mankind would be used as a transitional champion, dropping the title to Triple H the next night on ''Raw Is War''. Austin would get his rematch at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy]] against Triple H, but he lost after The Rock accidentally struck him with a sledgehammer shot meant for Triple H. When [[Survivor Series (1999)|Survivor Series]] rolled around, Triple H was still champion. Austin was booked into a Triple Threat match for the WWF Championship against Triple H and The Rock. However, at the event, Austin was run down by a car in the parking lot.<ref name=slam/> Austin then underwent neck surgery by Dr. [[Lloyd Youngblood]], due to Austin's injury from the piledriver at [[Summerslam (1997)|SummerSlam]] two years prior.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shoop|first1=Stephen A|last2=Falcon|first2=Mike|title=Piledriver slams Austin into surgery|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/health/doctor/lhdoc051.htm|accessdate=August 19, 2014|work=[[USA Today]]|date=December 14, 1999}}</ref> He was away for a nine-month rehabilitation, with the car angle being used to [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#write off|write him off television]].<ref name=slam/>\n\nIn April 2000, Austin appeared at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], attacking Triple H and Vince McMahon to help The Rock reclaim the WWF Championship. After Austin's official return at [[Unforgiven (2000)|Unforgiven]], Commissioner Mick Foley led an investigation to find out who ran Austin down at Survivor Series.<ref name=slam/> [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] admitted to being the driver because \"he did it for The Rock\". Rikishi felt that Austin occupied the top spot in the company and with Austin gone, The Rock, a fellow Samoan, would finally be able to ascend to the top of the company. At [[No Mercy (2000)|No Mercy]], Austin faced Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match. During the match, Austin attempted to drive his truck into Rikishi, who by that time was a bloody mess. Before he could, he was stopped by officials, with the match being deemed no contest. Austin was (kayfabe) arrested and later bailed out by Commissioner Foley. During a handicap match against Rikishi and [[Kurt Angle]], Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin. After clearing the ring, Triple H smashed his sledgehammer over Austin's head and revealed it was actually him behind the whole scheme, devised to shield the WWF Championship from Austin and end his career. At [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series]], Triple H had plotted to run Austin down again during their match but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H's car with a forklift, then let it drop 20 feet. Austin won his third [[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2001,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010128/ai_n9605892|title=Stone Cold rumbles to Houston aiming to sell out Astrodome|author=Blackjack Brown|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=December 6, 2007|date=January 28, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101113130/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010128/ai_n9605892 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=November 1, 2007}}</ref> last eliminating Kane. His rivalry against Triple H ended at [[No Way Out (2001)|No Way Out]] in a Three Stages of Hell match, with Triple H beating Austin two falls to one.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nWith The Rock defeating Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, Austin was set to face The Rock at WrestleMania. In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin's wife, [[Debra Marshall|Debra]], being assigned to be The Rock's manager by Mr. McMahon. At [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], Austin faced The Rock for the second time. Just before the match began, it was announced that the match had been made no disqualification. Midway during the match, Mr. McMahon made his way to ringside. He then prevented The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and provided Austin a steel chair to hit The Rock with. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair and pinned him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time.<ref name=slam/> After the match, Austin shook hands with Mr. McMahon, turning Austin heel.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nHe altered his character considerably over the next few months; in a deliberate turn from the rebellious and anti-establishment character beloved by the fans, Austin became a whiny, temperamental primadonna who complained incessantly when he felt he was not getting the respect that he deserved. He also developed an infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him, even going so far as to hug him and bring him presents. McMahon, though visibly uncomfortable and wary by the attention, was still grateful to have Austin with him instead of against him. During a steel cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the title, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer. After teasing a face turn, Triple H instead turned on The Rock. Together, Austin and Triple H viciously attacked The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on ''SmackDown!'', when, during an interview with [[Jim Ross]] about his actions at WrestleMania, he thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then proceeded to attack and brutally assault Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team and called themselves [[The Power Trip|The Two-Man Power Trip]].<ref name=slam/>\n\nAustin and Triple H ran roughshod over all their opponents, until coming up against The Undertaker and Kane. After defeating Kane and The Undertaker for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] at [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]], they held the tag team titles, the WWF Championship (Austin) and the Intercontinental Championship (Triple H) all at once. At [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]], Triple H lost his Intercontinental title to Kane. The following night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin and Triple H wrestled against [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Chris Benoit]] with the tag team titles on the line. Midway through the match, Triple H tore his quadriceps muscle.<ref name=slam/> As planned, the team lost the tag team titles at the end of the match when Triple H accidentally hit Austin in the stomach with a sledgehammer, but the injury to Triple H, which kept him out for the remainder of the year, forced the WWF to go in another direction. Austin officially broke up The Power Trip on that week's ''SmackDown!'', criticizing Triple H for his injury and for hitting him with the sledgehammer. He continued to align himself with McMahon and began feuding with Jericho and Benoit by himself, with Kurt Angle joining the group as Triple H's replacement. For most of the next month leading to [[King of the Ring (2001)|King of the Ring]], he repeatedly fell victim to a double submission involving Jericho's Walls of Jericho and Benoit's Crippler Crossface. Though he did not wrestle as he was nursing a hand injury, he continued to feud with the reigning tag team champions, eventually costing them the titles on the ''SmackDown!'' preceding King of the Ring against the [[Dudley Boyz]]. At King of the Ring, Austin defeated Jericho and Benoit in a Triple Threat match, despite interference from the debuting [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]. Stone Cold suffered a back injury during the match after Booker T dropped Stone Cold through the announcer's table.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Austinentrance.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin's signature ring entrance at [[WrestleMania XIX]]]]\nAfter King of the Ring, Austin was left without a feud as Benoit was lost for the next year after neck surgery and Jericho moved on to other things. He began a small spat with Angle over who was McMahon's biggest supporter. Meanwhile, [[History of World Championship Wrestling#Acquisition by the World Wrestling Federation and aftermath|the purchase of World Championship Wrestling (WCW)]] by McMahon began to bear fruit as [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] began. McMahon was not able to fight off the invading WCW wrestlers, and when they formed an [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|alliance]] with a group of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) alumni that were signed to the WWF and both Shane and Stephanie McMahon were now aligned against their father, McMahon's empire began to crumble and he had zero help from his two biggest stars at the time. Austin made it known that he was against teaming with Angle, whom Austin saw as both a threat to his WWF Championship, as well as an annoying tag-along. Finally, a frustrated McMahon called Austin out and demanded that he bring \"the old Stone Cold\" back, even going as far as asking Austin to give him a Stone Cold Stunner, so he could effectively captain a team of WWF wrestlers in a ten-man tag team match at the upcoming [[WWF Invasion|InVasion]] pay-per-view in July. A dejected Austin initially refused, but on the following episode of ''Raw Is War'' he returned to his old ways and hit Stunners on every member of the Alliance, turning face again. At InVasion, Austin captained the WWF team consisting of himself, Angle, Jericho, and [[The Brothers of Destruction|The Undertaker and Kane]] against the team of WCW's Booker T and [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and ECW's [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhyno]] and [[The Dudley Boyz]]. Late in the match, however, as Angle had Booker in the ankle lock, Austin turned on Angle by Stunning him and joined the Alliance, turning Austin heel once again.<ref name=\"slam\" /> The reason why Austin did this was that he felt McMahon was grooming Angle to take over his spot, that he was trying to get in touch with The Rock to return, and that he himself was \"unappreciated\" when McMahon insisted that he return to the old Austin. Austin was immediately made the Alliance's new leader and began to feud with Angle over his WWF Championship.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAustin lost his title to Angle at [[Unforgiven (2001)|Unforgiven]] by submitting to the ankle lock, but began badgering Angle for a rematch due to his hand being under the ropes. Austin received that rematch on October 8 episode of ''Raw'' and won the title after WWF Commissioner William Regal betrayed Angle and joined the Alliance.<ref name=\"slam\" /> Austin then began feuding with Alliance member [[Rob Van Dam]], who was the only member of the Alliance to be cheered by the fans despite the villainous tactics of the group. Austin faced Angle and Van Dam at [[No Mercy (2001)|No Mercy]] later that month and won by pinning the latter. On October 29 episode of ''Raw'', Angle joined the Alliance and became the second most powerful wrestler in the group. [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] was coming up<ref name=\"slam\" /> and it was ultimately decided to have a winner-take-all Survivor Series tag match with the winning team becoming the surviving entity. Austin was chosen to captain team Alliance, which consisted of Angle, Shane McMahon, Van Dam, and Booker T, against Team WWF which was captained by The Rock, who had returned the week following Austin's betrayal of the WWF at InVasion. The Rock's team included Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker and [[Big Show]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAt Survivor Series, Austin was one of the last two wrestlers in the match, with The Rock being the other, and was the last remaining hope for the Alliance to survive. Late in the match, Austin attempted to win the match with the Rock Bottom, the Rock's finishing maneuver but failed to earn a three count. He then kicked out of his own Stone Cold Stunner, which the Rock nailed on him, and attacked two referees including Alliance referee Nick Patrick. With the officials down, Angle ran to the ring and picked up Austin's title belt. He then entered the ring and struck Austin with it, betraying the Alliance and enabling The Rock to hit the Rock Bottom on Austin for the pin and the victory. With that, the InVasion ended, the Alliance was forced to disband, and Austin's future in the company was in question. Eventually, McMahon decided he was going to strip Austin of the title and award it to Angle for his actions. Just before he could, [[Ric Flair]] returned to the WWF for the first time since his 1993 departure and announced he was now half owner of the company. Austin returned moments after this announcement and attacked Angle and McMahon for their actions. He was then handed his title belt by Flair and celebrated with him in the ring, turning him face once again.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nFlair then decided that Austin would face off against The Rock, who was still in possession of the former [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] (which was renamed the World Championship), at the upcoming [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance]] pay-per-view in December to unify the titles. However, since Austin was still feuding with Angle and Rock had an unresolved feud with Jericho over his own title, McMahon overruled Flair and said that both men would wrestle their respective rivals for their respective titles at Vengeance, with the winners to face each other and the winner of that match to be crowned [[Undisputed championship|Undisputed]] WWF Champion. Austin won his first match by defeating Angle and faced World Champion Jericho in the [[Championship unification|unification match]].

The show was centered on which show he would sign with, and he ultimately chose Raw. Austin entered a feud with The Undertaker that resulted in a number-one contender's match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at [[Backlash (2002)|Backlash]], which Austin lost despite having his foot on the rope when he was pinned. He would later be betrayed by Big Show, who went on to rejoin the nWo and Ric Flair. Austin then defeated Big Show and Flair in a handicap match at [[Judgment Day (2002)|Judgment Day]]. In a May 2002 interview on WWE's Internet program, ''Byte This!'', Austin stunned the company and fans by launching a verbal attack on the direction the company was heading in and slated the creative team for not using him the way he felt they previously did.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=William|title=WWE Byte This Report \u2013 Stone Cold Steve Austin|url=http://www.twnpnews.com/messages2/6000/6535.shtml|website=TWNP News|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref> The commentators struggled to keep Austin's opinions on a neutral wavelength, leading to the WWE apologizing to fans for the outburst and stated it was not part of Austin's current or upcoming storylines.

McMahon insisted that Austin owed an apology to all the fans across the world, especially those who paid solely to see him that night. McMahon toasted to Austin's career with a beer thanking him for all his hard work nonetheless. The same night, Austin's entrance theme was played during an in-ring segment by Ric Flair, but it was transitioned to Eddie Guerrero's theme and he entered the arena. The Rock also made an appearance on ''Raw'' that night, despite being drafted to ''SmackDown!'', and announced his frustrations towards Austin and threw a can of beer at McMahon.

It was reported, however, by the end of the year, Austin and McMahon met and resolved their differences. He then agreed to return to the company in early 2003. In an interview with ''WWE Raw Magazine'',{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=19}} he announced deep regret over the situation that led to his departure and the way in which he had left, and deeper regret over inaccurate speculation regarding his alleged grudges held against other WWE wrestlers,{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=22}} claiming he had no problem with Scott Hall rejoining the company.

The Rock was offended that the WWE fans voted for Austin in a WWE Magazine poll to determine the 'Superstar of the Decade'. He expressed his frustration at having never defeated Austin at WrestleMania, and challenged Austin to a match at [[WrestleMania XIX]].

In reference to Bischoff firing him on ''Raw'' that week, he said that although firing was for storyline purposes, he admitted the medical problems read out on ''Raw'' were legitimate, and mainly related to his injury sustained at SummerSlam in a match with Owen Hart in August 1997, which had begun to seriously plague him since late 2001.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Sheriff of ''Raw'' (2003\u20132004) ====\n[[File:Stone Cold Steve Austin.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin in [[Iraq]], 2003]]\nThe following month, Austin began his non-wrestling career with WWE and began a fresh storyline when he was brought back by Linda McMahon as the Raw Co-General Manager.

As it looked like Austin was going to fight the officers, Vince McMahon ran into the ring to lecture Austin about why he could not be physically able to compete.

Austin flipped off Tyson, which led to Tyson shoving Austin much to McMahon's embarrassment, who began to publicly disapprove of the prospect of Austin as his champion.

Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stone Cold Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to \"play ball\" with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who in the course of the segment proceeded to tear off the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, [[Groin attack|punch]] his boss in the \"[[Testicles|corporate grapefruits]]\" and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain. In April 1998, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at [[Unforgiven: In Your House]], where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair, then the following month they had a rematch at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]] for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the title despite McMahon acting as the referee and his \"Corporate Stooges\" ([[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]]) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. McMahon continued to do everything he could to ruin Austin and he finally scored a big victory for his side at [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]].<ref name=slam/> Austin lost the WWF Championship to [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in a First Blood match after The Undertaker accidentally hit him with a steel chair while the ref was incapacitated, despite Austin having knocked Kane unconscious and thwarted an earlier intervention by Mankind.<ref name=slam/>\n\nAustin further angered McMahon by winning back the championship the next night on ''Raw Is War''.<ref name=slam/> Austin also emerged victorious against The Undertaker at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]]. In response, McMahon set up a Triple Threat match at [[Breakdown: In Your House]], where The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin at the same time. McMahon decided to vacate the WWF Championship<ref name=slam/> and award it based on a match between The Undertaker and Kane, in which Austin was the guest referee on [[Judgment Day: In Your House]]. Austin refused to count for either man and attacked both towards the end of the match. McMahon later fired him, although Austin got revenge by kidnapping McMahon and dragging him to the middle of the ring at \"gunpoint\", which ended up being a toy gun with a scroll that read \"Bang! 3:16\". During that segment, McMahon also learned that Stone Cold was later re-signed by his son, [[Shane McMahon]]. In the semifinals of the [[Survivor Series]] tournament to award the vacant WWF Championship, Austin lost to Mankind after Shane double-crossed Austin. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', [[Mills Lane|Judge Mills Lane]] ruled that The Rock had to defend his newly won WWF Championship against Austin that night, as stipulated in the new contract Austin had signed two weeks earlier with Shane. The Undertaker interfered and hit Austin with a shovel, earning Austin a disqualification victory. However, because the title would not change hands via disqualification, The Rock still kept the championship. At [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]], Austin defeated The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match after Kane performed a Tombstone Piledriver on The Undertaker into the grave. With this victory, Austin qualified for the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 Royal Rumble]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Steve Austin soaks in cheers.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin celebrates with [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] [[Earl Hebner]]]]\nAustin's next definitive chance to exact revenge on Mr. McMahon came during the 1999 Royal Rumble match. On ''Raw Is War'', McMahon drew Austin's entry number with the obvious intention of screwing him over. Austin drew entry number one, while McMahon drew number two thanks to WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels. During the Royal Rumble match, McMahon slipped out of the ring and into the crowd as Austin chased him down. It turned out to be a trap as McMahon led Austin into the lobby restroom where he was ambushed by members of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]. Austin was injured and taken away in an ambulance. With Austin gone and not in the Rumble match, McMahon joined the announcers' table in calling the match. Later on, however, Austin returned in an ambulance and re-entered the Royal Rumble, delivering a Stone Cold Stunner to [[Ray Traylor|Big Boss Man]] and eliminating him. With the assistance of The Corporation and a last-minute interference from The Rock, Austin was eliminated by McMahon himself, who won the 1999 Royal Rumble.<ref name=slam/>\n\nWith McMahon turning down his number-one contender spot against The Rock, WWF Commissioner Michaels awarded Austin the title shot the next night on ''Raw Is War''. At [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], Stone Cold got a one-on-one match against McMahon in a [[Steel Cage match|steel cage match]], with the WWF Championship opportunity at [[WrestleMania XV]] at stake.<ref name=slam/> During the match, [[Big Show|Paul Wight]] made his debut, breaking through from under the ring and attacking Austin. Wight's attack propelled Austin into the side of the cage forcing the cage to give way and dropping Austin to the floor first, making him the victor.<ref name=slam/> Austin defeated The Rock at WrestleMania XV to win his third WWF Championship.<ref name=slam/> Austin faced The Rock in a rematch at [[Backlash: In Your House|Backlash]], in which Shane McMahon was the referee. During the match, Vince McMahon approached the ring, only to hand Austin back his Smoking Skull title belt and take Shane out of the proceedings. Austin won the match when another referee made the count. Austin would lose the title to The Undertaker at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]]. Due to events revolving around Vince McMahon, [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]] and [[Linda McMahon]] made Austin the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company as part of the storyline. Vince and Shane McMahon challenged Austin to a handicap [[ladder match]] at [[King of the Ring#1999|King of the Ring]] with the CEO title on the line, which the duo of father and son won. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin made it clear that while he was the CEO of the company he could have a title shot at any time and place to be determined by himself. Austin made the WWF Championship match that night on ''Raw Is War'' and defeated The Undertaker to win his fourth WWF Championship. However, after he won it The Undertaker came and hit him with the title belt, leading to a First Blood match between the two at [[WWF Fully Loaded 1999|Fully Loaded]], where Mr. McMahon stipulated that if Austin lost he would never be able to wrestle for the WWF Championship again, and if Austin won he would never see McMahon again. Austin won after interference from X-Pac, hitting The Undertaker with a TV camera and gave McMahon a goodbye Stone Cold Stunner.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Rivalry with Triple H and The Alliance (1999\u20132001) ====\n{{main|The Power Trip|The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Alliance (professional wrestling)|l1=Two-Man Power Trip|l2=The Invasion|l3=The Alliance}}\n[[File:Me&austin.jpg|thumb|Austin with a fan]]\nAustin held on to the WWF Championship until [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], when he lost it to Mankind in a triple threat match also featuring [[Triple H]].<ref name=slam/> Triple H was originally scheduled to win his first championship at the event, but Austin refused to drop it to him, believing Triple H was not over enough with the crowd yet, so Mankind would be used as a transitional champion, dropping the title to Triple H the next night on ''Raw Is War''. Austin would get his rematch at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy]] against Triple H, but he lost after The Rock accidentally struck him with a sledgehammer shot meant for Triple H. When [[Survivor Series (1999)|Survivor Series]] rolled around, Triple H was still champion. Austin was booked into a Triple Threat match for the WWF Championship against Triple H and The Rock. However, at the event, Austin was run down by a car in the parking lot.<ref name=slam/> Austin then underwent neck surgery by Dr. [[Lloyd Youngblood]], due to Austin's injury from the piledriver at [[Summerslam (1997)|SummerSlam]] two years prior.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shoop|first1=Stephen A|last2=Falcon|first2=Mike|title=Piledriver slams Austin into surgery|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/health/doctor/lhdoc051.htm|accessdate=August 19, 2014|work=[[USA Today]]|date=December 14, 1999}}</ref> He was away for a nine-month rehabilitation, with the car angle being used to [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#write off|write him off television]].<ref name=slam/>\n\nIn April 2000, Austin appeared at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], attacking Triple H and Vince McMahon to help The Rock reclaim the WWF Championship. After Austin's official return at [[Unforgiven (2000)|Unforgiven]], Commissioner Mick Foley led an investigation to find out who ran Austin down at Survivor Series.<ref name=slam/> [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] admitted to being the driver because \"he did it for The Rock\". Rikishi felt that Austin occupied the top spot in the company and with Austin gone, The Rock, a fellow Samoan, would finally be able to ascend to the top of the company. At [[No Mercy (2000)|No Mercy]], Austin faced Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match. During the match, Austin attempted to drive his truck into Rikishi, who by that time was a bloody mess. Before he could, he was stopped by officials, with the match being deemed no contest. Austin was (kayfabe) arrested and later bailed out by Commissioner Foley. During a handicap match against Rikishi and [[Kurt Angle]], Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin. After clearing the ring, Triple H smashed his sledgehammer over Austin's head and revealed it was actually him behind the whole scheme, devised to shield the WWF Championship from Austin and end his career. At [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series]], Triple H had plotted to run Austin down again during their match but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H's car with a forklift, then let it drop 20 feet. Austin won his third [[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2001,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010128/ai_n9605892|title=Stone Cold rumbles to Houston aiming to sell out Astrodome|author=Blackjack Brown|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=December 6, 2007|date=January 28, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101113130/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010128/ai_n9605892 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=November 1, 2007}}</ref> last eliminating Kane. His rivalry against Triple H ended at [[No Way Out (2001)|No Way Out]] in a Three Stages of Hell match, with Triple H beating Austin two falls to one.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nWith The Rock defeating Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, Austin was set to face The Rock at WrestleMania. In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin's wife, [[Debra Marshall|Debra]], being assigned to be The Rock's manager by Mr. McMahon. At [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], Austin faced The Rock for the second time. Just before the match began, it was announced that the match had been made no disqualification. Midway during the match, Mr. McMahon made his way to ringside. He then prevented The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and provided Austin a steel chair to hit The Rock with. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair and pinned him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time.<ref name=slam/> After the match, Austin shook hands with Mr. McMahon, turning Austin heel.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nHe altered his character considerably over the next few months; in a deliberate turn from the rebellious and anti-establishment character beloved by the fans, Austin became a whiny, temperamental primadonna who complained incessantly when he felt he was not getting the respect that he deserved. He also developed an infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him, even going so far as to hug him and bring him presents. McMahon, though visibly uncomfortable and wary by the attention, was still grateful to have Austin with him instead of against him. During a steel cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the title, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer. After teasing a face turn, Triple H instead turned on The Rock. Together, Austin and Triple H viciously attacked The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on ''SmackDown!'', when, during an interview with [[Jim Ross]] about his actions at WrestleMania, he thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then proceeded to attack and brutally assault Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team and called themselves [[The Power Trip|The Two-Man Power Trip]].<ref name=slam/>\n\nAustin and Triple H ran roughshod over all their opponents, until coming up against The Undertaker and Kane. After defeating Kane and The Undertaker for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] at [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]], they held the tag team titles, the WWF Championship (Austin) and the Intercontinental Championship (Triple H) all at once. At [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]], Triple H lost his Intercontinental title to Kane. The following night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin and Triple H wrestled against [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Chris Benoit]] with the tag team titles on the line. Midway through the match, Triple H tore his quadriceps muscle.<ref name=slam/> As planned, the team lost the tag team titles at the end of the match when Triple H accidentally hit Austin in the stomach with a sledgehammer, but the injury to Triple H, which kept him out for the remainder of the year, forced the WWF to go in another direction. Austin officially broke up The Power Trip on that week's ''SmackDown!'', criticizing Triple H for his injury and for hitting him with the sledgehammer. He continued to align himself with McMahon and began feuding with Jericho and Benoit by himself, with Kurt Angle joining the group as Triple H's replacement. For most of the next month leading to [[King of the Ring (2001)|King of the Ring]], he repeatedly fell victim to a double submission involving Jericho's Walls of Jericho and Benoit's Crippler Crossface. Though he did not wrestle as he was nursing a hand injury, he continued to feud with the reigning tag team champions, eventually costing them the titles on the ''SmackDown!'' preceding King of the Ring against the [[Dudley Boyz]]. At King of the Ring, Austin defeated Jericho and Benoit in a Triple Threat match, despite interference from the debuting [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]. Stone Cold suffered a back injury during the match after Booker T dropped Stone Cold through the announcer's table.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Austinentrance.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin's signature ring entrance at [[WrestleMania XIX]]]]\nAfter King of the Ring, Austin was left without a feud as Benoit was lost for the next year after neck surgery and Jericho moved on to other things. He began a small spat with Angle over who was McMahon's biggest supporter. Meanwhile, [[History of World Championship Wrestling#Acquisition by the World Wrestling Federation and aftermath|the purchase of World Championship Wrestling (WCW)]] by McMahon began to bear fruit as [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] began. McMahon was not able to fight off the invading WCW wrestlers, and when they formed an [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|alliance]] with a group of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) alumni that were signed to the WWF and both Shane and Stephanie McMahon were now aligned against their father, McMahon's empire began to crumble and he had zero help from his two biggest stars at the time. Austin made it known that he was against teaming with Angle, whom Austin saw as both a threat to his WWF Championship, as well as an annoying tag-along. Finally, a frustrated McMahon called Austin out and demanded that he bring \"the old Stone Cold\" back, even going as far as asking Austin to give him a Stone Cold Stunner, so he could effectively captain a team of WWF wrestlers in a ten-man tag team match at the upcoming [[WWF Invasion|InVasion]] pay-per-view in July. A dejected Austin initially refused, but on the following episode of ''Raw Is War'' he returned to his old ways and hit Stunners on every member of the Alliance, turning face again. At InVasion, Austin captained the WWF team consisting of himself, Angle, Jericho, and [[The Brothers of Destruction|The Undertaker and Kane]] against the team of WCW's Booker T and [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and ECW's [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhyno]] and [[The Dudley Boyz]]. Late in the match, however, as Angle had Booker in the ankle lock, Austin turned on Angle by Stunning him and joined the Alliance, turning Austin heel once again.<ref name=\"slam\" /> The reason why Austin did this was that he felt McMahon was grooming Angle to take over his spot, that he was trying to get in touch with The Rock to return, and that he himself was \"unappreciated\" when McMahon insisted that he return to the old Austin. Austin was immediately made the Alliance's new leader and began to feud with Angle over his WWF Championship.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAustin lost his title to Angle at [[Unforgiven (2001)|Unforgiven]] by submitting to the ankle lock, but began badgering Angle for a rematch due to his hand being under the ropes. Austin received that rematch on October 8 episode of ''Raw'' and won the title after WWF Commissioner William Regal betrayed Angle and joined the Alliance.<ref name=\"slam\" /> Austin then began feuding with Alliance member [[Rob Van Dam]], who was the only member of the Alliance to be cheered by the fans despite the villainous tactics of the group. Austin faced Angle and Van Dam at [[No Mercy (2001)|No Mercy]] later that month and won by pinning the latter. On October 29 episode of ''Raw'', Angle joined the Alliance and became the second most powerful wrestler in the group. [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] was coming up<ref name=\"slam\" /> and it was ultimately decided to have a winner-take-all Survivor Series tag match with the winning team becoming the surviving entity. Austin was chosen to captain team Alliance, which consisted of Angle, Shane McMahon, Van Dam, and Booker T, against Team WWF which was captained by The Rock, who had returned the week following Austin's betrayal of the WWF at InVasion. The Rock's team included Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker and [[Big Show]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAt Survivor Series, Austin was one of the last two wrestlers in the match, with The Rock being the other, and was the last remaining hope for the Alliance to survive. Late in the match, Austin attempted to win the match with the Rock Bottom, the Rock's finishing maneuver but failed to earn a three count. He then kicked out of his own Stone Cold Stunner, which the Rock nailed on him, and attacked two referees including Alliance referee Nick Patrick. With the officials down, Angle ran to the ring and picked up Austin's title belt. He then entered the ring and struck Austin with it, betraying the Alliance and enabling The Rock to hit the Rock Bottom on Austin for the pin and the victory. With that, the InVasion ended, the Alliance was forced to disband, and Austin's future in the company was in question. Eventually, McMahon decided he was going to strip Austin of the title and award it to Angle for his actions. Just before he could, [[Ric Flair]] returned to the WWF for the first time since his 1993 departure and announced he was now half owner of the company. Austin returned moments after this announcement and attacked Angle and McMahon for their actions. He was then handed his title belt by Flair and celebrated with him in the ring, turning him face once again.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nFlair then decided that Austin would face off against The Rock, who was still in possession of the former [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] (which was renamed the World Championship), at the upcoming [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance]] pay-per-view in December to unify the titles. However, since Austin was still feuding with Angle and Rock had an unresolved feud with Jericho over his own title, McMahon overruled Flair and said that both men would wrestle their respective rivals for their respective titles at Vengeance, with the winners to face each other and the winner of that match to be crowned [[Undisputed championship|Undisputed]] WWF Champion. Austin won his first match by defeating Angle and faced World Champion Jericho in the [[Championship unification|unification match]]. Austin lost the match and his title after McMahon and Booker T interfered. Immediately after, Austin and Booker T began feuding which led to various fights in strange venues, such as a [[Confession (religion)|church confessional]], a [[bingo hall]] and a [[supermarket]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Final feuds and retirement (2002\u20132003) ====\nIn the [[Royal Rumble (2002)|2002 Royal Rumble]] on January 20, Austin entered at number nineteen and lasted until the final four, but was eliminated by Kurt Angle.

I think Hogan probably would have been a step or two behind that. That wasn't acceptable to me, and I didn't want to slow myself down.

McMahon claimed his actions caused fury among fans who had paid to see him that night. Austin returned on April 1, 2002 episode of ''Raw'', the first of the new \"[[WWE brand extension|brand extension]]\" era. The show was centered on which show he would sign with, and he ultimately chose Raw. Austin entered a feud with The Undertaker that resulted in a number-one contender's match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at [[Backlash (2002)|Backlash]], which Austin lost despite having his foot on the rope when he was pinned. He would later be betrayed by Big Show, who went on to rejoin the nWo and Ric Flair. Austin then defeated Big Show and Flair in a handicap match at [[Judgment Day (2002)|Judgment Day]]. In a May 2002 interview on WWE's Internet program, ''Byte This!'', Austin stunned the company and fans by launching a verbal attack on the direction the company was heading in and slated the creative team for not using him the way he felt they previously did.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=William|title=WWE Byte This Report \u2013 Stone Cold Steve Austin|url=http://www.twnpnews.com/messages2/6000/6535.shtml|website=TWNP News|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref> The commentators struggled to keep Austin's opinions on a neutral wavelength, leading to the WWE apologizing to fans for the outburst and stated it was not part of Austin's current or upcoming storylines. McMahon responded a week later on the same show playing down the outburst, claiming that Austin was merely the type of wrestler who was occasionally difficult to work with.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe WWE rehired [[Eddie Guerrero]] for Austin to feud with, while also prepping Austin for a feud with [[Brock Lesnar]]. However, Austin balked at the proposition that he lose a King of the Ring qualifying match on ''Raw'' to Lesnar, and ultimately walked out of the company.<ref name=trip/> Austin later explained that he thought hot-shotting a rookie made Austin look weak, and airing the match on free TV with no build-up did not give Lesnar a proper stage for such a big win over a star of Austin's magnitude. Further fanning the flames amongst Austin's growing number of detractors was a well-publicized domestic dispute incident between Austin and his wife Debra ([[#Domestic violence cases|see below]]).<ref name=trip/>\n\nAfter Austin again [[List of professional wrestling terms#no show|no-showed]] June 10 episode of ''Raw'', his storylines were dropped.<ref name=trip>{{cite news|url=http://rattlesnake.amp-productions.com/groupfiles/Articles/2002_10_00.html|title=Austin's power trip|author=Alex Gordon|publisher=Wrestling Digest|accessdate=June 10, 2016|date=October 2002}}</ref> Austin walked out again, publicly stating he felt bad storylines were presented to him by the creative team. This time his departure was for good.<ref name=trip/> McMahon, along with longtime Austin supporter and real-life friend Jim Ross, [[Bury (professional wrestling)|buried]] Austin on WWE programming, referring to him as \"taking his ball and going home\" because he was not getting his way, whilst also explaining to the fans that neither he nor Ross was able to persuade Austin to change his mind. McMahon insisted that Austin owed an apology to all the fans across the world, especially those who paid solely to see him that night. McMahon toasted to Austin's career with a beer thanking him for all his hard work nonetheless. The same night, Austin's entrance theme was played during an in-ring segment by Ric Flair, but it was transitioned to Eddie Guerrero's theme and he entered the arena. The Rock also made an appearance on ''Raw'' that night, despite being drafted to ''SmackDown!'', and announced his frustrations towards Austin and threw a can of beer at McMahon. Austin's merchandise continued to sell greatly in the weeks following his departure, however; with no sign of a return likely to be seen, the company stopped marketing his character and his merchandise and removed his profile from WWE.com.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nFor the remainder of 2002, Austin kept a low profile and did not make any public appearances. It was reported, however, by the end of the year, Austin and McMahon met and resolved their differences. He then agreed to return to the company in early 2003. In an interview with ''WWE Raw Magazine'',{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=19}} he announced deep regret over the situation that led to his departure and the way in which he had left, and deeper regret over inaccurate speculation regarding his alleged grudges held against other WWE wrestlers,{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=22}} claiming he had no problem with Scott Hall rejoining the company. However, he admitted he still held strong reservations about his singles match with Hall at WrestleMania only lasting seven minutes and felt the build-up to the match did not live up to the expectations of his fans or Hall's, and was angered by speculation suggesting he disagreed with [[Kevin Nash]] re-joining the company, insisting he and Nash have always been good friends.{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=20}} He however maintained his displeasure with the storylines and creative changes the WWE had imposed around the time of his departure.{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=21}}{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=26}} In an interview with Vince McMahon on his podcast in 2014, Austin revealed for the first time that McMahon had fined him $650,000 upon his return, but he was able to lower the amount to $250,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/51937-vince-mcmahon-addresses-cm-punk-on-stone-cold-podcast|title=Vince McMahon addresses CM Punk on Stone Cold Podcast|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 2, 2014|publisher=WrestleView}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rockaustinxix.jpg|left|thumb|Austin (left) faces off against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] at [[WrestleMania XIX]] in Austin's last match]]\nAustin confessed he had a major rift with Triple H's role in the company upon his return in 2002 but insisted as of 2003 they resolved their issues.{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=23}} In addition, he claimed a brief dispute with The Rock was resolved quickly upon his return, and that none of his disputes with the talent roster continued or played the major part in his departure.{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=23}} In February, Austin returned at [[No Way Out (2003)|No Way Out]] by defeating Eric Bischoff. Austin would wrestle only one match between then and WrestleMania, in another short match against Bischoff on ''Raw''. He entered a feud with The Rock, who returned about the same time as a smug, Hollywood sell-out heel. The Rock was offended that the WWE fans voted for Austin in a WWE Magazine poll to determine the 'Superstar of the Decade'. He expressed his frustration at having never defeated Austin at WrestleMania, and challenged Austin to a match at [[WrestleMania XIX]]. Austin was then defeated by The Rock at WrestleMania XIX, in Austin's final match.<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Powell|title=WWE shines at WrestleMania XIX|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/03/31/55003.html|accessdate=December 25, 2010|work=Slam!

The next day, Austin gave an interview on WWE.com officially announcing his retirement from wrestling, although he stated that he and Vince McMahon had reached an agreement which would see Austin appear in a non-wrestling role on a weekly basis. In reference to Bischoff firing him on ''Raw'' that week, he said that although firing was for storyline purposes, he admitted the medical problems read out on ''Raw'' were legitimate, and mainly related to his injury sustained at SummerSlam in a match with Owen Hart in August 1997, which had begun to seriously plague him since late 2001.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Sheriff of ''Raw'' (2003\u20132004) ====\n[[File:Stone Cold Steve Austin.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin in [[Iraq]], 2003]]\nThe following month, Austin began his non-wrestling career with WWE and began a fresh storyline when he was brought back by Linda McMahon as the Raw Co-General Manager. He continued this storyline for the remainder of the year, still showing wrestling moves including the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' and several exchanges of punches and kicks, although limiting regularity of these being performed. On November 17, 2003, episode of ''Raw'', Austin was \"fired\" from ''Raw'' as the result of a stipulation in a match at [[Survivor Series (2003)|Survivor Series]] where Austin's hand-picked team of wrestlers failed to beat Bischoff's team of wrestlers. After Survivor Series, [[Mick Foley]] would become the new Co-General Manager of ''Raw'', and began a ([[kayfabe]]) petition to have Austin re-instated. Austin quickly returned to WWE television before the end of 2003 when he was part of the ''[[WWE Tribute to the Troops#2003|Tribute to the Troops]]'' taped live in front of U.S. troops in [[Iraq]], posing and attacking Mr. McMahon. He returned to ''Raw'' on December 29 as its \"Sheriff\", giving a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' to Eric Bischoff and rehiring Shawn Michaels, who had just been \"fired\" by Bischoff.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAustin appeared on-and-off as 2004 began, culminating in him being the special guest referee for the Brock Lesnar vs. [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] match at [[WrestleMania XX]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Sporadic appearances (2005\u2013present) ====\nAustin made his first appearance on WWE programming in a year at [[WrestleMania 21]] where he was confronted by [[Roddy Piper]] in ''[[Piper's Pit]]'', until [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]] interrupted to insult both.

The segment ended with Austin and Piper celebrating with beer until Austin gave Piper a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' as well. Austin was involved in the concluding segment at [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] in which he had a beer bash with the ECW locker room and brawled with the anti-ECW invaders, led by Eric Bischoff.
