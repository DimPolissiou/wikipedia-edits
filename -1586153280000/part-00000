Steel is the weapon of war used by the nation that had chosen \"guns before butter\" and unleashed its lightning [[blitzkrieg]] attacks on Europe.\n\nThe [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] nations realized that only steel could challenge steel, and in the United Kingdom and Canada, industrial workers responded with total energy and efficiency. On the [[home front]], industrial production soared with factories converting to munitions in 100 Canadian cities and towns, with committed Canadians entering the workforce in large numbers.\n\nPrecision and standardization allowed for rapid production of steel products. As the epitome of a new mechanized steel weapon, the light and simple to use [[Bren gun]] was manufactured in Canada in a complex operation that involved 2,800 smaller processes employing 18,000 tools and jigs. Steel is also used in thin sheets to create the submarine chasers coming from Canadian shipyards, in the trucks, armour and ambulances rolling out of factories that were formerly manufacturing automotive products, even in steel ball bearings, critical parts for mechanized warfare.\n\nOn the \"front of steel\", it is \"soldiers in dungarees\" that will make the difference between winning and losing in modern warfare and Canada is playing its part.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] as Himself (archive footage)\n* [[Adolf Hitler]] as Himself (archive footage)\n* [[Wilhelm Keitel]] as Himself (archive footage)\n* Joe Gilchuck, welder  as Himself\n* Jim McLaren, foundry man, as Himself\n* Matt Johnson, sheet worker as Himself\n* Louis Gagnion, master rivetter, as Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nTypical of the NFB's Second World War documentary [[short film]]s in the ''Canada Carries On'' series, ''The Front of Steel'' was made in cooperation with the Director of Public Information, Herbert Lash.<ref name=\"Tribune\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/37352863/ \"Recognize leadership of Winnipeg women.\"]''The Winnipeg Tribune'', April 18, 1941.

The film was produced by [[Stuart Legg]].<ref>Lerner 1987, p. 75.</ref> ''Zero Hour'' describes the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasions that have taken place during the [[World War II|Second World War]].{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nDuring the Second World War, the [[Axis powers]] employed joint or combined operations to launch invasions in Europe and Asia. In [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|Norway]], [[Nazi Germany]] launched an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious invasion]] while the island of [[Battle of Crete|Crete]] was overwhelmed by an [[Airborne forces|airborne invasion]]. [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan]] also had been successful in its [[Imperialism#Japan|Japanese imperialist war]]s in Asia. In all instances, the invading forces were able to strike quickly using small lightweight weaponry and use the elements of surprise and combined forces to achieve victory.\n\nBy 1940, the Allies, who had been reeling from the many defeats, had learned the hard tactical lessons with England being the first to react. After creating the [[Combined operations|Combined Operations Command]], [[British Commandos]], a small, highly mobile raiding and [[reconnaissance]] forces began to be used.  The [[British Commandos|commando]] carried all they needed and operated in the field, to cause disruption and small-scale attacks on communication systems and enemy strongpoints. Larger raids such as the [[Dieppe Raid]] in 1942 were preludes to massive invasion operations later.\n\nWith Nazi Germany bogged down in [[Operation Barbarossa]], an attack on the [[Soviet Union]], a second [[Front (military)|front]] was possible, but first, [[Operation Torch|Allied]] operations in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] with the objective of driving the Axis powers from North Africa, was launched. Next was an assault on [[Axis powers|Axis]]-held Italy. Fighting on many fronts, the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' was under great pressure.\n\nIn 1944, as Allied arsenals built a vast array of weaponry, a massive invasion force was created to invade [[Fortress Europe]], the Axis-controlled areas of Northwest Europe. The preparation, strategy and over-all campaign planning that went into this gigantic task involved a host of nations, including Canada. In the [[Pacific War]], similar preparations for combined amphibious invasions were taking place, with the U.S. [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island-hopping campaign]] successfully begun to wrest back occupied territory, despite desperate Japanese resistance.\n\nOn June 6, 1944, supported by an immense naval armada, Allied troops launch an amphibious invasion of [[Normandy]], France. The first on the beaches were the \"storm troops\": French commandos, U.S. Rangers, British Marines backed up by Canadian and U.S. paratroopers. At \"Zero Hour\", the strategic and tactical air attacks combine to provide cover for the invasion forces.  Although facing a fierce resistance by [[Nazi]] forces, the Allied armies, [[Invasion of Normandy|establish]]ed a [[beachhead]] on the Normandy coast, and move inland in a combined infantry and armour attack.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adolf Hitler]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Neville Chamberlain]]  as Himself (archival footage)\n\n==Production==\n''Zero Hour'' was the part of the wartime ''Canada Carries On'' and ''The World in Action'' [[propaganda film|propaganda]] [[short film]] series, produced with financial backing from the [[Wartime Information Board]] for the Director of Public Information, Herbert Lash.<ref name=\"Tribune\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/37352863/ \"Recognize leadership of Winnipeg women.\"]''The Winnipeg Tribune'', April 18, 1941.

In [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|Norway]], [[Nazi Germany]] launched an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious invasion]] while the island of [[Battle of Crete|Crete]] was overwhelmed by an [[Airborne forces|airborne invasion]]. [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan]] also had been successful in its [[Imperialism#Japan|Japanese imperialist war]]s in Asia. In all instances, the invading forces were able to strike quickly using small lightweight weaponry and use the elements of surprise and combined forces to achieve victory.\n\nBy 1940, the Allies, who had been reeling from the many defeats, had learned the hard tactical lessons with England being the first to react. After creating the [[Combined operations|Combined Operations Command]], [[British Commandos]], a small, highly mobile raiding and [[reconnaissance]] forces began to be used.  The [[British Commandos|commando]] carried all they needed and operated in the field, to cause disruption and small-scale attacks on communication systems and enemy strongpoints. Larger raids such as the [[Dieppe Raid]] in 1942 were preludes to massive invasion operations later.\n\nWith Nazi Germany bogged down in [[Operation Barbarossa]], an attack on the [[Soviet Union]], a second [[Front (military)|front]] was possible, but first, [[Operation Torch|Allied]] operations in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] with the objective of driving the Axis powers from North Africa, was launched. Next was an assault on [[Axis powers|Axis]]-held Italy. Fighting on many fronts, the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' was under great pressure.\n\nIn 1944, as Allied arsenals built a vast array of weaponry, a massive invasion force was created to invade [[Fortress Europe]], the Axis-controlled areas of Northwest Europe. The preparation, strategy and over-all campaign planning that went into this gigantic task involved a host of nations, including Canada. In the [[Pacific War]], similar preparations for combined amphibious invasions were taking place, with the U.S. [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island-hopping campaign]] successfully begun to wrest back occupied territory, despite desperate Japanese resistance.\n\nOn June 6, 1944, supported by an immense naval armada, Allied troops launch an amphibious invasion of [[Normandy]], France. The first on the beaches were the \"storm troops\": French commandos, U.S. Rangers, British Marines backed up by Canadian and U.S. paratroopers. At \"Zero Hour\", the strategic and tactical air attacks combine to provide cover for the invasion forces.  Although facing a fierce resistance by [[Nazi]] forces, the Allied armies, [[Invasion of Normandy|establish]]ed a [[beachhead]] on the Normandy coast, and move inland in a combined infantry and armour attack.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adolf Hitler]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Neville Chamberlain]]  as Himself (archival footage)\n\n==Production==\n''Zero Hour'' was the part of the wartime ''Canada Carries On'' and ''The World in Action'' [[propaganda film|propaganda]] [[short film]] series, produced with financial backing from the [[Wartime Information Board]] for the Director of Public Information, Herbert Lash.<ref name=\"Tribune\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/37352863/ \"Recognize leadership of Winnipeg women.\"]''The Winnipeg Tribune'', April 18, 1941.

Not only in Canada were the strengths and talents of women being harnessed in a \"total war\" that had reached global proportions.\n\nIn Great Britain when the war began, military authorities soon realized the importance of mobilizing all their citizens. Entering the industrial workforce, women supplemented men in many positions at munitions factories. Through the civilian [[Royal Voluntary Service|Women's Volunteer Service]] women became nurses, ambulance drivers and Air Raid Wardens. Following in the wake of the volunteer organizations were the specialized [[Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps|Women's Auxiliary]], dedicated to freeing men for other military service. The Women's Auxiliaries included the women in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) with women as orderlies, drivers, postal workers, ammunition inspectors and operating searchlight units. The women pilots in the [[RAF Ferry Command]] took on the important but dangerous role of ferrying aircraft from factories or repair depots to the front line [[Royal Air Force]] operational units.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], the strength of one hundred million women is being seen in many ways. Women have taken on great responsibilities from running the collective farms, working in industrial production, and serving in the military units on the front lines. In the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Soviet Supreme Council]], 227 women deputies also were elected.\n\nCanada also saw women becoming involved in the war effort.  As Canadian men are being mobilized to serve in the military, three million women are also mobilized to serve in the \"home front\".  The largest contribution by Canadian women was through unpaid volunteer work, participating in recycling programs, creating [[Red Cross]] packages, hosting dances for servicemen and other related domestic activities. The other important role that women took on was at munitions factories, turning out the tools of war.\n\nCanadian women also served in the military with the [[Canadian Women's Army Corps]] taking over 21 types of army duties, enabling men to be released for combat service. The [[Canadian women in the World Wars|Canadian Nursing Sisters]] have gone overseas. In the [[Royal Canadian Air Force Women's Division|Woman's Division]] in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) women became clerks, drivers, photographers, air photo interpreters, weather observers, instrument mechanics, parachute riggers as well as many administrative and technical positions in the RCAF. Most women served at [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] stations across Canada.{{#tag:ref|Their motto was: \"We serve that men may fly.\"<ref>Ziegler 1973, p. 6.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nCanadian women will also play a part after the war, in building a new world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Stella Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading|Lady Reading]]\n* Mary Johnston, RAF Ferry pilot\n* [[Josef Stalin]]\n* Guerna Bak, Soviet [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Collective farm]] [[commissar]]\n* Nadia Suplikava, Soviet Union farm worker\n* Kama Najidova, Soviet Union Petroleum Engineer\n* Klatika Kosina, Soviet Union, locomotive drive \n* Inidia Trokikya, Soviet Union railway director\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nTypical of the NFB's Second World War documentary short films in the ''Canada Carries On'' series, ''Women Are Warriors'' was created as a morale boosting [[propaganda film]], originally with the working title of \"Work for Women\".<ref>Halpern Martineau, Barbara. \"Before the Guerilli\u00e8res: Women's Films at the NFB During World War II.\" [Transcript of a speech).

But just as the implications of Jane Marsh's original title, 'Work for Women', were suppressed in favour of 'Women Are Warriors', so the implications of the film's structure and commentary are suppressed by the use of a male narrator - the same patriotic, reassuring voice heard in so many films showing men at war.\"<ref>Feldman and Nelson 1977, p. 65.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Home Front (film)|The Home Front]]'' (1940), a NFB documentary on the role of women on the home front in the [[World War II|Second World War]]\n* ''[[Wings on her Shoulder]]'' (1943), a NFB documentary on the [[Royal Canadian Air Force Women's Division]]\n* ''[[Rosies of the North]]'' (1999), a NFB documentary on the women who worked at the [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] building fighter and bomber aircraft in the Second World War\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Armatage, Kay, Kass Banning, [[Brenda Longfellow]] and [[Janine Marchessault]], eds.

The film, directed by [[Jane Marsh Beveridge|Jane Marsh]], depicts the role of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force Women's Division|Woman's Division]] in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) during the [[World War II|Second World War]], who freed up men for flying duties. {{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n== Synopsis ==\nAs the Second World War continues, the Canadian contribution to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing campaign over occupied Europe requires more aviators. The government responds by creating the [[Royal Canadian Air Force Women's Division]] in 1941. By 1943, 9,000 recruits, women from all backgrounds, are taking over a wide range of jobs.\n\nWomen in the RCAF, or WDs as they were called, were clerks, drivers, photographers, air photo interpreters, weather observers, instrument mechanics, parachute riggers as well as many administrative and technical positions in the RCAF. While most WDs were located at [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] stations across Canada, many others served overseas with [[RCAF Overseas Headquarters]] and [[No. 6 Group RCAF|No. 6 (Bomber) Group]] in England. The skills they learned would also serve the women well as they would eventually enter a postwar world.<ref name=\"Women\">[https://www.nfb.ca/film/wings_on_her_shoulder \"Wings on her Shoulder.\"] ''[[National Film Board]]'', 1943.

The film incorporated stock footage shot over a period of time from 1941\u20131943.

Each film was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada. The NFB also had an arrangement with [[United Artists]] to ensure that newsreels would get a wider release in North America.<ref name=\"Ellis\">Ellis and McLane  2005, p. 122.</ref>\n\nAfter the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16&nbsp;mm, to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two. They were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities. Available from the National Film Board either online or as a DVD, ''Wings on her Shoulder'' is one of the few wartime NFB films that explored the role of women at war.<ref name=\"Ohayon\">Ohayon, Albert.

The film, directed by [[Jane Marsh Beveridge|Jane Marsh]], depicts the role of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force Women's Division|Woman's Division]] in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) during the [[World War II|Second World War]], who freed up men for flying duties. {{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n== Synopsis ==\nAs the Second World War continues, the Canadian contribution to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing campaign over occupied Europe requires more aviators. The government responds by creating the [[Royal Canadian Air Force Women's Division]] in 1941. By 1943, 9,000 recruits, women from all backgrounds, are taking over a wide range of jobs.\n\nWomen in the RCAF, or WDs as they were called, were clerks, drivers, photographers, air photo interpreters, weather observers, instrument mechanics, parachute riggers as well as many administrative and technical positions in the RCAF. While most WDs were located at [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] stations across Canada, many others served overseas with [[RCAF Overseas Headquarters]] and [[No. 6 Group RCAF|No. 6 (Bomber) Group]] in England. The skills they learned would also serve the women well as they would eventually enter a postwar world.<ref name=\"Women\">[https://www.nfb.ca/film/wings_on_her_shoulder \"Wings on her Shoulder.\"] ''[[National Film Board]]'', 1943.

The film incorporated stock footage shot over a period of time from 1941\u20131943.

The film describes the formation and operational use of the [[Saskatchewan Air Ambulance]] service. The NFB production was later re-edited into a shorter, 11-miinute film, ''Mercy Flight'', released in 1948.<ref name=\"NFB\">[http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/en/our-collection/?idfilm=17522 \"Our Collection: 'Wings of Mercy'.\"] ''NFB''. Retrieved: January 27, 2017.</ref>{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn 1946, the fledgling Saskatchewan Air Ambulance Service became the first government-operated [[Air medical services|air ambulance service]] in the world. The initial operation had former [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilots flying a [[Noorduyn Norseman]] [[bush plane|bush aircraft]] with a crew composed of a pilot, an [[flight engineer|engineer]] and a nurse. The aircraft could accommodate a stretcher and at least one other passenger. The Norseman could switch between wheels, floats and skis to deal with different terrains and seasons, which meant that it was often possible to airlift patients from difficult-to-reach locations. Shortly after flight operations began, a second Norseman was obtained, and later, a [[Fairchild Husky]]. The goal of 24-hour, year-round service was achieved within the first few years.\n\nTransport from remote locations in Saskatchewan had previously relied on road and rail facilities, but often meant a long, uncomfortable and difficult trip over unprepared roadways. The air ambulance service, with its main base at [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], could make the difference between life and death for a critical patient, serving to connect to thousands of residents in rural Saskatchewan and answer emergency calls over 160 million acres of farmland. A second base located at [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] covered the northern region, dotted with waterways where logging camps and mining operations predominated.\n\nFrom its dispatch centres, the aircraft were directed to ferry patients with pneumonia, tuberculosis, polio, perforated ulcers and heart failure, to name some of the cases that called for expedient transport to hospitals. Flying at {{convert|1000|ft}} altitude (or less) allowed patients to be carried without drastic changes in air pressure. When the patient was picked up, the pilot could radio ahead to ensure that an ambulance is waiting at the airport for rapid transport to a hospital in Regina, [[Saskatoon]] or Prince Albert. In the first month, 42 patients were evacuated, and in the first two years of service, 1,000 patients were flown to city hospitals.\n[[File:CF-SAM.jpg|thumb|left|Noorduyn Norseman \"CF-SAM\" was featured in ''Wings of Mercy'' and was the first aircraft used by the Saskatchewan Air Ambulance; now at the [[Saskatchewan Western Development Museum|Western Development Museum]] in [[Moose Jaw]], Saskatchewan.<ref>Bitner, Ruth.

It is 4&nbsp;kilometres east of the [[Sydney central business district]] and is part of the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of [[Municipality of Woollahra|Woollahra Council]].<ref>Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007</ref>\n\nDarling Point is bounded by [[Sydney Harbour]] to the north, [[Double Bay, New South Wales|Double Bay]] to the east, [[Edgecliff, New South Wales|Edgecliff]] to the south and [[Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales|Rushcutters Bay]] to the west. Darling Point, renowned for its desirable and expensive real estate, is mostly residential and regarded as one of the most exclusive and prestigious suburbs in Australia.\n\n== History ==\nWhat is now the Darling Point area was originally known as Eurambi, Yarranabbi, Yarrandabbi and Yaranabe by the local Aboriginal people. It was named Darling Point in recognition of Elizabeth Darling, the wife of New South Wales Governor [[Ralph Darling]].<ref>''The Book of Sydney Suburbs'', Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia {{ISBN|0-207-14495-8}}, page 79</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Sydney 2000 Olympics]], Darling Point hosted the sailing events.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[Darling Point Road]] follows the ridge of the headland that is Darling Point. Mona Road and Greenoaks Avenue act as two other main access roads to the suburb. New Beach Road runs between the western boundary of the suburb and Rushcutters Bay Park. The 327 bus service used to go through Darling Point but it has been reduced to a lesser route, now called 328. [[Darling Point ferry wharf]] provides access to [[Double Bay ferry services]]. Darling Point is also serviced by the nearby [[Edgecliff railway station]].\n\n== Parks ==\nMcKell Park was originally the site of the now-demolished Canonbury House, but is now a public park. Situated at the northern end of Darling Point Road, it has panoramic views of Sydney Harbour and is a popular location for picnics and weddings. It also provides access to Darling Point's ferry stop.\n\n\"The Drill Hall\" forms part of the Sir David Martin Reserve and was previously part of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] base, [[HMAS Rushcutter (naval base)|HMAS Rushcutter]]. The [[Drill hall]] is one of the oldest-surviving Australian military buildings and was originally located on [[Bennelong Point]], now the location of the [[Sydney Opera House]].\n\n== Places of worship ==\n[[St Mark's Church, Darling Point|Saint Mark's Anglican Church]] in Darling Point Road was designed by [[Edmund Blacket]] in 1852 and is now a popular wedding venue. It has hosted weddings such as [[Elton John]]'s first wedding and the fictional wedding in the film ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]''.

In 1948, the property was acquired by the [[United States|US]] government as the official residence of the Consul-General. It has since returned to the private sector. In 1975, it served as the shooting location for the villain's lair in the [[Hong Kong]] / Australian co-production ''[[The Man from Hong Kong]]''.

It is 4&nbsp;kilometres east of the [[Sydney central business district]] and is part of the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of [[Municipality of Woollahra|Woollahra Council]].<ref>Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007</ref>\n\nDarling Point is bounded by [[Sydney Harbour]] to the north, [[Double Bay, New South Wales|Double Bay]] to the east, [[Edgecliff, New South Wales|Edgecliff]] to the south and [[Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales|Rushcutters Bay]] to the west. Darling Point, renowned for its desirable and expensive real estate, is mostly residential and regarded as one of the most exclusive and prestigious suburbs in Australia.\n\n== History ==\nWhat is now the Darling Point area was originally known as Eurambi, Yarranabbi, Yarrandabbi and Yaranabe by the local Aboriginal people. It was named Darling Point in recognition of Elizabeth Darling, the wife of New South Wales Governor [[Ralph Darling]].<ref>''The Book of Sydney Suburbs'', Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia {{ISBN|0-207-14495-8}}, page 79</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Sydney 2000 Olympics]], Darling Point hosted the sailing events.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[Darling Point Road]] follows the ridge of the headland that is Darling Point. Mona Road and Greenoaks Avenue act as two other main access roads to the suburb. New Beach Road runs between the western boundary of the suburb and Rushcutters Bay Park. The 327 bus service used to go through Darling Point but it has been reduced to a lesser route, now called 328. [[Darling Point ferry wharf]] provides access to [[Double Bay ferry services]]. Darling Point is also serviced by the nearby [[Edgecliff railway station]].\n\n== Parks ==\nMcKell Park was originally the site of the now-demolished Canonbury House, but is now a public park. Situated at the northern end of Darling Point Road, it has panoramic views of Sydney Harbour and is a popular location for picnics and weddings. It also provides access to Darling Point's ferry stop.\n\n\"The Drill Hall\" forms part of the Sir David Martin Reserve and was previously part of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] base, [[HMAS Rushcutter (naval base)|HMAS Rushcutter]]. The [[Drill hall]] is one of the oldest-surviving Australian military buildings and was originally located on [[Bennelong Point]], now the location of the [[Sydney Opera House]].\n\n== Places of worship ==\n[[St Mark's Church, Darling Point|Saint Mark's Anglican Church]] in Darling Point Road was designed by [[Edmund Blacket]] in 1852 and is now a popular wedding venue. It has hosted weddings such as [[Elton John]]'s first wedding and the fictional wedding in the film ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]''. The rectory, also designed by Blacket, is listed on the local government heritage register.<ref name=SHR>{{cite NSW HD|2711081|St Marks Anglican church|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite NSW HD|2711077|Rectory of St Marks church|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite NSW HD|2711082|St Marks Cottage - building, sandstone retaining walls|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Landmarks ==\n=== ''Craigend'' ===\nSituated close to McKell Park, Craigend is a mansion constructed in the [[Moorish]] and [[Art Deco]] styles in 1935, including a pair of doors from an ancient [[mosque]] in [[Zanzibar]] and a traditional Japanese garden. In 1948, the property was acquired by the [[United States|US]] government as the official residence of the Consul-General. It has since returned to the private sector. In 1975, it served as the shooting location for the villain's lair in the [[Hong Kong]] / Australian co-production ''[[The Man from Hong Kong]]''.

It is based on his play of the same name. The film stars [[R. Muthuraman|Muthuraman]] and [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]], with [[M. R. R. Vasu]], [[Thengai Srinivasan]], [[Sreekanth]], [[Venniradai Moorthy|Moorthy]], [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]], [[Rama Prabha]] and [[Jayakumari]] in supporting roles. It focuses on a young man (Muthuraman) planning to steal money from his domineering stepmother (Manorama), and hiring his friend (Srinivasan) to aid him.\n\n''Kasethan Kadavulada'' is the [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] of Chitralaya Gopu. Muthuraman and Moorthy reprise their roles from the play. The film was released on 19 May 1972, and became a commercial success, with Srinivasan's role as a fake [[Godman (India)|godman]] becoming immensely popular.\n\n== Plot ==\nLakshmi is the extremely domineering second wife of Sivaswamy and controls all his money, treating him with scorn and disdain. When Ramu, the son of Sivaswamy's first wife, requires a sum of {{INRConvert|3000|year=1972}} for his sister's husband, she instantly refuses. Ramu and his cousin Mali hatch a plot with their tea vendor friend Appaswamy, who pretends to be a [[Godman (India)|godman]] named Badrinath Swamy Sukranada to get to her money safe and steal a sum of {{INRConvert|50000|year=1972}}. Meanwhile, Rama is an orphan whose only friend is the doctor of a mental institution. When Rama wants a conduct certificate, the doctor bungles and hands over the certificate of an insane girl also named Rama who gets angry when somebody refuses to give her what she wants.\n\n[[Deputy superintendent of police|D. S. P.]] Paramantham, who previously put Appaswamy in jail comes to the house to see the priest. Appaswamy tells the D. S. P. to not handle any cases at this time. An incident occurs when Rama encounters Appaswamy without a beard, but much to his surprise she does not recognize the difference. The house receives a telegram that says that the real Badrinath Swamy Sukranada is arriving in two days, which means that Appaswamy has to loot his sum within that times frame. Latha's brother, Mani, wants money to buy jewelry for his girlfriend, Latha, and needs money after being exposed by his girlfriend's brother. Mani steals Appaswamy's money {{INRConvert|5001|year=1972}} that he received as a donation from Lakshmi (the 1 extra rupee came from Chettiar). Luckily, Rama catches Mani red-handed.\n\nThe sane Rama arrives at Lakshmi's house to work as a secretary. Lakshmi sees the certificate, but decides to keep her at her house since the certificate mentions that Rama becomes violent whenever refused something. Rama falls in love with Ramu. The insane Rama and her father also come there to work coincidentally. More complications arise (the insane Rama's father overhears Ramu and Appaswamy's theft plan and subsequently the insane Ramu lets her anger out on Appaswamy leading to a deal in which Ramu and Appaswamy will not tell anybody that the sane Rama is insane as nobody knows and that the insane Rama's father will not tell anybody about the theft plan), leading to more incidents.\n\nLakshmi tells the \"godman\" about the cash she has stashed in her secret hideout, and shows him how to access it. Appaswamy and Ramu try to rob it later that night. They almost succeed but are exposed after they place the money in the flower pot. The insane Rama's father, the sane Rama, and Mani all encounter the money. Mani throws the money outside to his Latha's brother. Yet again, Rama catches him red handed. The money is in Latha's brothers' coat. To prove that the other Rama is truly insane, the sane Rama tells the insane Rama that the coat will look good on her. When Latha's brother refuses to give her his coat, the insane Rama shows her insanity. As a result, all problems are solved, Lakshmi is pacified, and agrees to Ramu and her secretary Rama's marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Col-begin|width=70%}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n; Actors<ref name=\"credits\" />\n* [[R.

It is based on his play of the same name. The film stars [[R. Muthuraman|Muthuraman]] and [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]], with [[M. R. R. Vasu]], [[Thengai Srinivasan]], [[Sreekanth]], [[Venniradai Moorthy|Moorthy]], [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]], [[Rama Prabha]] and [[Jayakumari]] in supporting roles. It focuses on a young man (Muthuraman) planning to steal money from his domineering stepmother (Manorama), and hiring his friend (Srinivasan) to aid him.\n\n''Kasethan Kadavulada'' is the [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] of Chitralaya Gopu. Muthuraman and Moorthy reprise their roles from the play. The film was released on 19 May 1972, and became a commercial success, with Srinivasan's role as a fake [[Godman (India)|godman]] becoming immensely popular.\n\n== Plot ==\nLakshmi is the extremely domineering second wife of Sivaswamy and controls all his money, treating him with scorn and disdain. When Ramu, the son of Sivaswamy's first wife, requires a sum of {{INRConvert|3000|year=1972}} for his sister's husband, she instantly refuses. Ramu and his cousin Mali hatch a plot with their tea vendor friend Appaswamy, who pretends to be a [[Godman (India)|godman]] named Badrinath Swamy Sukranada to get to her money safe and steal a sum of {{INRConvert|50000|year=1972}}. Meanwhile, Rama is an orphan whose only friend is the doctor of a mental institution. When Rama wants a conduct certificate, the doctor bungles and hands over the certificate of an insane girl also named Rama who gets angry when somebody refuses to give her what she wants.\n\n[[Deputy superintendent of police|D. S. P.]] Paramantham, who previously put Appaswamy in jail comes to the house to see the priest. Appaswamy tells the D. S. P. to not handle any cases at this time. An incident occurs when Rama encounters Appaswamy without a beard, but much to his surprise she does not recognize the difference. The house receives a telegram that says that the real Badrinath Swamy Sukranada is arriving in two days, which means that Appaswamy has to loot his sum within that times frame. Latha's brother, Mani, wants money to buy jewelry for his girlfriend, Latha, and needs money after being exposed by his girlfriend's brother. Mani steals Appaswamy's money {{INRConvert|5001|year=1972}} that he received as a donation from Lakshmi (the 1 extra rupee came from Chettiar). Luckily, Rama catches Mani red-handed.\n\nThe sane Rama arrives at Lakshmi's house to work as a secretary. Lakshmi sees the certificate, but decides to keep her at her house since the certificate mentions that Rama becomes violent whenever refused something. Rama falls in love with Ramu. The insane Rama and her father also come there to work coincidentally. More complications arise (the insane Rama's father overhears Ramu and Appaswamy's theft plan and subsequently the insane Ramu lets her anger out on Appaswamy leading to a deal in which Ramu and Appaswamy will not tell anybody that the sane Rama is insane as nobody knows and that the insane Rama's father will not tell anybody about the theft plan), leading to more incidents.\n\nLakshmi tells the \"godman\" about the cash she has stashed in her secret hideout, and shows him how to access it. Appaswamy and Ramu try to rob it later that night. They almost succeed but are exposed after they place the money in the flower pot. The insane Rama's father, the sane Rama, and Mani all encounter the money. Mani throws the money outside to his Latha's brother. Yet again, Rama catches him red handed. The money is in Latha's brothers' coat. To prove that the other Rama is truly insane, the sane Rama tells the insane Rama that the coat will look good on her. When Latha's brother refuses to give her his coat, the insane Rama shows her insanity. As a result, all problems are solved, Lakshmi is pacified, and agrees to Ramu and her secretary Rama's marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Col-begin|width=70%}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n; Actors<ref name=\"credits\">{{Cite AV media |title=Kasethan Kadavulada |type=motion picture |language=ta |publisher=[[AVM Productions]] |year=1972 |time=1:55 to 4:38 |time-caption=opening credits from}}</ref>\n* [[R.

The film is narrated by broadcaster [[Lorne Greene]]. ''When Asia Speaks'' describes the disparity between the riches of Asia and the poverty of the masses during the [[World War II|Second World War]] that have led to nationalist movements in Asia. The film's [[Canadian French|French]] version title is ''Le R\u00e9veil de l'Asie''.{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Synopsis== \nIn 1944, during the Second World War, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces are beginning to occupy [[Axis powers|Axis]]-occupied Asia. The vast area represents 1/2 of the world's population and unlimited natural resources.\n\nAlthough the [[Empire of Japan]] in attempting to establish the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], had ruled the occupied Asian populations with a heavy hand for years, the Japanese government and military reversed its policies in an attempt to sway cooperation. At the same time, great forces are also at work in the Indian sub-continent, [[Indo-Pacific|Indo-Asia Pacific]] and China as nationalist movements vie for self-determination.\n\nAn obstacle to ruling Asia is the wide divide between East and West. The administrators of the [[British Empire in World War II|British Empire]] on the Indian sub-continent realize that [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] speak for a massive disaffected populace. In China, the nationalist movement begun by visionary leader [[Sun Yat-sen]] has galvanized the occupied people in their struggle against Japan. Despite recruiting efforts to enlist the Asian population, except for isolated examples, Asians have rejected the Axis propaganda.\n\nThe great riches of the region are coveted by both the Axis and Allied powers. Although urban areas have made progress, and industries have employed millions, the impoverished people in rural areas still labour in the fields. With the end of [[World War II]] in sight,  Asia looks forward to the day when they can fulfill their own hopes for a better future in a postwar world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Franklin D.
