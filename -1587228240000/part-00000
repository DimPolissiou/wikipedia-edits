The Gaming Control Board recommended that Engelstad lose his gaming license and be fined $200,000 for reflecting poorly on the reputation of the Nevada gaming industry.

In 1988, several employees, angry about being placed on leave as punishment for talking to the plaintiff attorney, began speaking to the [[Nevada Gaming Control Board|Gaming Control Board]] and local media about two [[Nazi]]-themed parties Engelstad had held at the Imperial Palace.

A national controversy ensued. Engelstad claimed the collection was purely of historical interest, and not meant to glorify the Nazis. The Gaming Control Board recommended that Engelstad lose his gaming license and be fined $200,000 for reflecting poorly on the reputation of the Nevada gaming industry.

Some of there groups have established their own orthographies and standardised languages.<ref name=\"Junttila10\"/>  [[V\u00f5ro language|V\u00f5ro]] and [[Seto dialect|Seto]], which are spoken in southeastern [[Estonia]] and in some parts of [[Russia]], have been considered dialects of Estonian in the past but modern day linguistics consider them their own languages.

There is now wide agreement that Proto-Finnic was probably spoken at the coasts of the Gulf of Finland.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kallio |first1=Petri |editor1-last=Ahola |editor1-first=Joonas |editor2-last=Frog |title=Fibula, Fabula, Fact: The Viking Age in Finland (Studia Fennica Historica 18) |date=2014 |publisher=Finno-Ugric Society |location=Helsinki, Finland |page=163f. |url=https://www.academia.edu/10172149/The_Diversification_of_Proto-Finnic |accessdate=27 December 2019 |chapter=The Diversification of Proto-Finnic}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n{{main|Finno-Samic languages}}\nThe Finnic languages are located at the western end of the Uralic language family. A close affinity to their northern neighbors, the [[Sami languages]], has long been assumed, though many of the similarities (particularly lexical ones) can be shown to result from common influence from [[Germanic languages]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Baltic languages]]. Innovations are also shared between Finnic and the [[Mordvinic languages]], and in recent times Finnic, Samic and Mordvinic are frequently considered together.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==General characteristics==\n{{see also|Estonian grammar|Finnish grammar}}\n\nThere is no [[grammatical gender]] in any of the Finnic languages, nor are there articles or definite or indefinite forms.<ref name=\"UL\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TM2NQ78dP2wC&printsec |via=Google Books |title=The Uralic Languages: Description, History and Foreign Influences |first=Denis |last=Sinor |ISBN=90-04-07741-3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[morphophonology]] (the way the grammatical function of a [[morpheme]] affects its production) is complex. Morphological elements found in the Finnic languages include [[grammatical case]] suffixes, verb tempus, mood and person markers (singular and plural, the Finnic languages don't have [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]]) as well as participles and several infinitive forms, possessive suffixes, clitics and more. The number of grammatical cases tends to be high while the number of verb infinitive forms varies more by language.\n\nOne of the more important processes is the characteristic [[consonant gradation]]. Two kinds of gradation occur: radical gradation and suffix gradation. They both affect the [[plosive]]s {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/p/}},<ref name=\"UL\"/> and involve the process known as [[lenition]], in which the consonant is changed into a \"weaker\" form. This occurs in some (but not all)  of the [[oblique case]] forms. For [[geminate]]s, the process is simple to describe: they become simple stops, e.g. ''ku'''pp'''i'' + ''-n'' \u2192 ''ku'''p'''in'' (Finnish: \"cup\"). For simple consonants, the process complicates immensely and the results vary by the environment. For example, ''ha'''k'''a'' + ''-n'' \u2192 ''haan'', ''ky'''k'''y'' + ''-n'' \u2192 ''ky'''v'''yn'', ''j\u00e4r'''k'''i'' + ''-n'' \u2192 ''j\u00e4r'''j'''en'' (Finnish: \"pasture\", \"ability\", \"intellect\"). The specifics of consonants gradation vary by language (see the separate article for more details). [[Apocope]] (strongest in Livonian, V\u00f5ro and Estonian) has, in some cases, left a phonemic status to the phonological variation in the stem (variation caused by the now historical morphological elements), which results in three [[Vowel length#Phonemic vowel length|phonemic lengths]] in these languages.\n\n[[Vowel harmony]] is also characteristic of the Finnic languages, despite having been lost in Livonian, Estonian and Veps. \n\nThe original Uralic [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] was lost in proto-Finnic,<ref name=\"Kallio\">{{cite journal |last=Kallio |first=Petri |year=2007 |title=Kantasuomen konsonanttihistoriaa |journal=M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Finno-Ougrienne |volume=253 |pages=229\u2013250 |issn=0355-0230 |url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust253/sust253_kallio.pdf |language=Finnish |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-05-28 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> but most of the diverging dialects reacquired it.

In particular, South Estonian and Livonian show many similarities with the Central Finnic group that must be attributed to later contact, due to the influence of literary North Estonian.{{sfn|Viitso|1998|p=101}} Thus, contemporary \"Southern Finnic\" is a sprachbund that includes these languages, while diachronically they are not closely related.\n\nThe genetic classification of the Finnic dialects that can be extracted from Viitso (1998) is:\n\n* Finnic\n** Livonian ([[Gulf of Riga]] Finnic)\n** [[South Estonian]] (Inland Finnic)\n** [[Gulf of Finland]] Finnic\n*** Northern Finnic\n**** West Ladoga\n***** Western Finnish\n***** Eastern Finnic\n****** Eastern Finnish\n****** Northern Karelian\n****** Northeastern coastal Estonian\n***** Ingrian\n***** Kukkuzi dialect\n**** East Ladoga\n***** Southern Karelian\n***** Livvi\u2013Ludic\u2013Veps\n*** Central Finnic\n**** (North/Standard) [[Estonian language|Estonian]]\n**** East Central Finnic\n***** Eastern Estonian\n***** [[Votic language|Votic]]\n\nViitso (2000)<ref>{{cite conference |author=Viitso, Tiit-Rein |title=Finnic Affinity |conference=Congressus Nonus Internationalis Fenno-Ugristarum I: Orationes plenariae & Orationes publicae |location=Tartu |year=2000}}</ref> surveys 59&nbsp;isoglosses separating the family into 58&nbsp;dialect areas (finer division is possible), finding that an unambiguous perimeter can be set up only for South Estonian, Livonian, Votic, and Veps. In particular, no isogloss exactly coincides with the geographical division into 'Estonian' south of the Bay of Finland and 'Finnish' north of it. Despite this, standard Finnish and Estonian are not mutually intelligible.\n\n===Southern Finnic===\nThe Southern Finnic languages consist of North and South Estonian (excluding the Coastal Estonian dialect group), Livonian and Votic (except the highly Ingrian-influenced Kukkuzi Votic). These languages are not closely related genetically, as noted above; it is a [[paraphyletic]] grouping, consisting of all Finnic languages except the Northern Finnic languages.{{sfn|Viitso|1998|p=101}} The languages regardless share a number of features, such as the presence of a ninth vowel phoneme ''\u00f5'', usually a [[close-mid back unrounded vowel|close-mid back unrounded]] {{IPA|/\u0264/}} (but a [[close central unrounded vowel|close central unrounded]] {{IPA|/\u0268/}} in Livonian), as well as loss of ''*n'' before ''*s'' with [[compensatory lengthening]].\n\n(North) Estonian-Votic has been suggested to possibly constitute an actual genetic subgroup (called varyingly '''Maa''' by Viitso (1998, 2000) or '''Central Finnic''' by Kallio (2014)<ref name=\"Kallio14\"/>), though the evidence is weak: almost all innovations shared by Estonian and Votic have also spread to South Estonian and/or Livonian. A possible defining innovation is the loss of ''*h'' after sonorants (''*n, *l, *r'').<ref name=\"Kallio14\"/>\n\n===Northern Finnic===\nThe Northern Finnic group has more evidence for being an actual historical/genetic subgroup. Phonetical innovations would include two changes in unstressed syllables: *ej > *ij{{cn|date=October 2019}}, and *o > ''\u00f6'' after front-harmonic vowels. The lack of ''\u00f5'' in these languages as an innovation rather than a retention has been proposed, and recently resurrected.<ref name=\"Kallio14\"/> Germanic loanwords found throughout Northern Finnic but absent in Southern are also abundant, and even several Baltic examples of this are known.\n\nNorthern Finnic in turn divides into two main groups. The most Eastern Finnic group consists of the [[East Finnish]] dialects as well as Ingrian, Karelian and Veps; the proto-language of these was likely spoken in the vicinity of [[Lake Ladoga]].<ref name=\"Sammallahti77\"/> The Western Finnic group consists of the West Finnish dialects, originally spoken on the western coast of Finland, and within which the oldest division is that into Southwestern, Tavastian and Southern Ostrobothnian dialects. Among these, at least the Southwestern dialects have later come under Estonian influence.\n\nNumerous new dialects have also arisen through contacts of the old dialects: these include e.g. the more northern Finnish dialects (a mixture of West and East Finnish), and the [[Livvi-Karelian language|Livvi]] and [[Ludic language|Ludic]] varieties (probably originally Veps dialects but heavily influenced by Karelian).\n\nSalminen (2003){{citation needed|date=March 2016}} present the following list of Finnic languages and their respective number of speakers.\n<section begin=\"Finnic languages\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Later, the same process occurred also between vowels (e.g. *m\u00ebxi 'land' > ''maa'').\n** Semivowels *j, *w were usually lost when a root ended in *i and contained a preceding front (in the case of *j, e.g. *t\u00e4ji 'tick' > ''t\u00e4i'') or rounded vowel (in the case of *w, e.g. *suwi 'mouth' > ''suu'').\n** The [[velar nasal]] *\u014b was vocalized everywhere except before *k, leading to its elimination as a phoneme. Depending on the position, the results included semivowels (e.g. *jo\u014bsi 'bow' > ''jousi'', *su\u014bi 'summer'> ''suvi'') and full vocalization (e.g. *j\u00e4\u014bi 'ice' > ''j\u00e4\u00e4'', *m\u00fc\u014b\u00e4 'backside' > Estonian ''m\u00f6\u00f6-'', Finnish ''my\u00f6-'').\n* The development of an alternation between word-final *i and word-internal *e, from a Proto-Uralic second syllable vowel variously reconstructed as *i (as used in this article), *e or *\u0259.\n* Elimination of all Proto-Uralic palatalization contrasts: *\u0107, *\u03b4\u0301, *\u0144, *\u015b > *c, *\u03b4, *n, *s.\n* Elimination of the affricate *\u010d, merging with *\u0161 or *t, and the spirant *\u03b4, merging with *t (e.g. *mu\u03b4\u0301a 'earth' > ''muta'').

Innovations are also shared between Finnic and the [[Mordvinic languages]], and in recent times Finnic, Samic and Mordvinic are frequently considered together.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==General characteristics==\n{{see also|Estonian grammar|Finnish grammar}}\n\nThere is no [[grammatical gender]] in any of the Finnic languages, nor are there articles or definite or indefinite forms.<ref name=\"UL\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TM2NQ78dP2wC&printsec |via=Google Books |title=The Uralic Languages: Description, History and Foreign Influences |first=Denis |last=Sinor |ISBN=90-04-07741-3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[morphophonology]] (the way the grammatical function of a [[morpheme]] affects its production) is complex. Morphological elements found in the Finnic languages include [[grammatical case]] suffixes, verb tempus, mood and person markers (singular and plural, the Finnic languages don't have [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]]) as well as participles and several infinitive forms, possessive suffixes, clitics and more. The number of grammatical cases tends to be high while the number of verb infinitive forms varies more by language.\n\nOne of the more important processes is the characteristic [[consonant gradation]]. Two kinds of gradation occur: radical gradation and suffix gradation. They both affect the [[plosive]]s {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/p/}},<ref name=\"UL\"/> and involve the process known as [[lenition]], in which the consonant is changed into a \"weaker\" form. This occurs in some (but not all)  of the [[oblique case]] forms. For [[geminate]]s, the process is simple to describe: they become simple stops, e.g. ''ku'''pp'''i'' + ''-n'' \u2192 ''ku'''p'''in'' (Finnish: \"cup\"). For simple consonants, the process complicates immensely and the results vary by the environment. For example, ''ha'''k'''a'' + ''-n'' \u2192 ''haan'', ''ky'''k'''y'' + ''-n'' \u2192 ''ky'''v'''yn'', ''j\u00e4r'''k'''i'' + ''-n'' \u2192 ''j\u00e4r'''j'''en'' (Finnish: \"pasture\", \"ability\", \"intellect\"). The specifics of consonants gradation vary by language (see the separate article for more details). [[Apocope]] (strongest in Livonian, V\u00f5ro and Estonian) has, in some cases, left a phonemic status to the phonological variation in the stem (variation caused by the now historical morphological elements), which results in three [[Vowel length#Phonemic vowel length|phonemic lengths]] in these languages.\n\n[[Vowel harmony]] is also characteristic of the Finnic languages, despite having been lost in Livonian, Estonian and Veps. \n\nThe original Uralic [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] was lost in proto-Finnic,<ref name=\"Kallio\">{{cite journal |last=Kallio |first=Petri |year=2007 |title=Kantasuomen konsonanttihistoriaa |journal=M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Finno-Ougrienne |volume=253 |pages=229\u2013250 |issn=0355-0230 |url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust253/sust253_kallio.pdf |language=Finnish |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-05-28 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> but most of the diverging dialects reacquired it. Palatalization is a part of the Estonian literary language and is an essential feature in [[V\u00f5ro language|V\u00f5ro]], as well as [[Veps language|Veps]], [[Karelian language|Karelian]], and other eastern Finnic languages. It is also found in East Finnish dialects, and is only missing from West Finnish dialects and Standard Finnish.<ref name=\"UL\"/>\n\nA special characteristic of the languages is the large number of [[diphthong]]s. There are 16&nbsp;diphthongs in Finnish and 25 in Estonian; at the same time the frequency of diphthong use is greater in Finnish than in Estonian due to certain historical long vowels having diphthongised in Finnish but not in Estonian.<ref name=\"UL\"/> On a global scale the Finnic languages have a high number of vowels.<ref name=\"WALS\">[https://wals.info/feature/2A#2/19.3/152.8 Feature 2A: Vowel Quality Inventories] at [[World Atlas of Language Structures]]</ref>\n\n==Subgrouping==\nThe Finnic languages form a complex [[dialect continuum]] with few clear-cut boundaries.{{sfn|Laakso|2001|p=207}} Innovations have often spread through a variety of areas,{{sfn|Laakso|2001|p=180}} even after variety-specific changes.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n{{quote |text=[W]hat can be classified are not the Fennic languages, but the Fennic dialects. |author=Tiit-Rein Viitso{{sfn|Viitso|1998|p=101}}}}\n\nA broad twofold conventional division of the Finnic varieties recognizes the Southern Finnic and Northern Finnic groups (though the position of some varieties within this division is uncertain):{{sfn|Viitso|1998|p=101}}\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* '''Southern Finnic'''\n** North Estonian (including [[Estonian language|Standard Estonian]])\n*** Central Estonian\n*** Eastern Estonian\n*** Insular Estonian\n*** Western Estonian\n** [[South Estonian]]\n*** Kraasna \u2020\n*** Leivu \u2020\n*** Lutsi \u2020\n*** Mulgi\n*** [[Seto language|Seto]]\n*** Tartu\n*** [[V\u00f5ro language|V\u00f5ro]]\n** [[Livonian language|Livonian]]\n*** Courland Livonian (\u2020)\n*** Salaca Livonian \u2020\n** [[Votic language|Votic]]\n*** Eastern Votic \u2020\n*** Western Votic\n*** [[Krevinian dialect|Krevinian]] \u2020\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* '''Northern Finnic'''\n** ?

In particular, South Estonian and Livonian show many similarities with the Central Finnic group that must be attributed to later contact, due to the influence of literary North Estonian.{{sfn|Viitso|1998|p=101}} Thus, contemporary \"Southern Finnic\" is a sprachbund that includes these languages, while diachronically they are not closely related.\n\nThe genetic classification of the Finnic dialects that can be extracted from Viitso (1998) is:\n\n* Finnic\n** Livonian ([[Gulf of Riga]] Finnic)\n** [[South Estonian]] (Inland Finnic)\n** [[Gulf of Finland]] Finnic\n*** Northern Finnic\n**** West Ladoga\n***** Western Finnish\n***** Eastern Finnic\n****** Eastern Finnish\n****** Northern Karelian\n****** Northeastern coastal Estonian\n***** Ingrian\n***** Kukkuzi dialect\n**** East Ladoga\n***** Southern Karelian\n***** Livvi\u2013Ludic\u2013Veps\n*** Central Finnic\n**** (North/Standard) [[Estonian language|Estonian]]\n**** East Central Finnic\n***** Eastern Estonian\n***** [[Votic language|Votic]]\n\nViitso (2000)<ref>{{cite conference |author=Viitso, Tiit-Rein |title=Finnic Affinity |conference=Congressus Nonus Internationalis Fenno-Ugristarum I: Orationes plenariae & Orationes publicae |location=Tartu |year=2000}}</ref> surveys 59&nbsp;isoglosses separating the family into 58&nbsp;dialect areas (finer division is possible), finding that an unambiguous perimeter can be set up only for South Estonian, Livonian, Votic, and Veps. In particular, no isogloss exactly coincides with the geographical division into 'Estonian' south of the Bay of Finland and 'Finnish' north of it. Despite this, standard Finnish and Estonian are not mutually intelligible.\n\n===Southern Finnic===\nThe Southern Finnic languages consist of North and South Estonian (excluding the Coastal Estonian dialect group), Livonian and Votic (except the highly Ingrian-influenced Kukkuzi Votic). These languages are not closely related genetically, as noted above; it is a [[paraphyletic]] grouping, consisting of all Finnic languages except the Northern Finnic languages.{{sfn|Viitso|1998|p=101}} The languages regardless share a number of features, such as the presence of a ninth vowel phoneme ''\u00f5'', usually a [[close-mid back unrounded vowel|close-mid back unrounded]] {{IPA|/\u0264/}} (but a [[close central unrounded vowel|close central unrounded]] {{IPA|/\u0268/}} in Livonian), as well as loss of ''*n'' before ''*s'' with [[compensatory lengthening]].\n\n(North) Estonian-Votic has been suggested to possibly constitute an actual genetic subgroup (called varyingly '''Maa''' by Viitso (1998, 2000) or '''Central Finnic''' by Kallio (2014)<ref name=\"Kallio14\"/>), though the evidence is weak: almost all innovations shared by Estonian and Votic have also spread to South Estonian and/or Livonian. A possible defining innovation is the loss of ''*h'' after sonorants (''*n, *l, *r'').<ref name=\"Kallio14\"/>\n\n===Northern Finnic===\nThe Northern Finnic group has more evidence for being an actual historical/genetic subgroup. Phonetical innovations would include two changes in unstressed syllables: *ej > *ij{{cn|date=October 2019}}, and *o > ''\u00f6'' after front-harmonic vowels. The lack of ''\u00f5'' in these languages as an innovation rather than a retention has been proposed, and recently resurrected.<ref name=\"Kallio14\"/> Germanic loanwords found throughout Northern Finnic but absent in Southern are also abundant, and even several Baltic examples of this are known.\n\nNorthern Finnic in turn divides into two main groups. The most Eastern Finnic group consists of the [[East Finnish]] dialects as well as Ingrian, Karelian and Veps; the proto-language of these was likely spoken in the vicinity of [[Lake Ladoga]].<ref name=\"Sammallahti77\"/> The Western Finnic group consists of the West Finnish dialects, originally spoken on the western coast of Finland, and within which the oldest division is that into Southwestern, Tavastian and Southern Ostrobothnian dialects. Among these, at least the Southwestern dialects have later come under Estonian influence.\n\nNumerous new dialects have also arisen through contacts of the old dialects: these include e.g. the more northern Finnish dialects (a mixture of West and East Finnish), and the [[Livvi-Karelian language|Livvi]] and [[Ludic language|Ludic]] varieties (probably originally Veps dialects but heavily influenced by Karelian).\n\nSalminen (2003){{citation needed|date=March 2016}} present the following list of Finnic languages and their respective number of speakers.\n<section begin=\"Finnic languages\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Later, the same process occurred also between vowels (e.g. *m\u00ebxi 'land' > ''maa'').\n** Semivowels *j, *w were usually lost when a root ended in *i and contained a preceding front (in the case of *j, e.g. *t\u00e4ji 'tick' > ''t\u00e4i'') or rounded vowel (in the case of *w, e.g. *suwi 'mouth' > ''suu'').\n** The [[velar nasal]] *\u014b was vocalized everywhere except before *k, leading to its elimination as a phoneme. Depending on the position, the results included semivowels (e.g. *jo\u014bsi 'bow' > ''jousi'', *su\u014bi 'summer'> ''suvi'') and full vocalization (e.g. *j\u00e4\u014bi 'ice' > ''j\u00e4\u00e4'', *m\u00fc\u014b\u00e4 'backside' > Estonian ''m\u00f6\u00f6-'', Finnish ''my\u00f6-'').\n* The development of an alternation between word-final *i and word-internal *e, from a Proto-Uralic second syllable vowel variously reconstructed as *i (as used in this article), *e or *\u0259.\n* Elimination of all Proto-Uralic palatalization contrasts: *\u0107, *\u03b4\u0301, *\u0144, *\u015b > *c, *\u03b4, *n, *s.\n* Elimination of the affricate *\u010d, merging with *\u0161 or *t, and the spirant *\u03b4, merging with *t (e.g. *mu\u03b4\u0301a 'earth' > ''muta'').

After working as a [[demo (music)|demo]] singer in the mid 1980s, he signed with [[Epic Records]]' Nashville division in 1990. Between then and 2004, Diffie charted 35 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, five of which peaked at number one: his debut release \"[[Home (Joe Diffie song)|Home]]\", \"[[If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)]]\", \"[[Third Rock from the Sun (song)|Third Rock from the Sun]]\", \"[[Pickup Man]]\" (his longest-lasting number-one song, at four weeks) and \"[[Bigger Than the Beatles]]\". In addition to these singles, he had 12 others reach the top 10 and ten more reach the top 40 on the same chart. He also co-wrote singles for [[Holly Dunn]], [[Tim McGraw]], and [[Jo Dee Messina]], and recorded with [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[George Jones]], and [[Marty Stuart]].\n\nDiffie released seven studio albums, a Christmas album, and a greatest-hits package under the Epic label. He also released one studio album each through [[Monument Records]], [[Broken Bow Records]], and [[Rounder Records]]. Among his albums, 1993's ''[[Honky Tonk Attitude]]'' and 1994's ''[[Third Rock from the Sun]]'' are [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], while 1992's ''[[Regular Joe (album)|Regular Joe]]'' and 1995's ''[[Life's So Funny]]'' are both certified gold. His album, ''[[Homecoming: The Bluegrass Album]]'', was released in late 2010 through Rounder. His style is defined by a [[neotraditionalist country]] influence with a mix of novelty songs and ballads.\n\n==Early life==\nJoe Diffie was born into a musical family in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 1958.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> His first musical performance came at age 14, when he performed in his Aunt Dawn Anita's country music band.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-diffie-mn0000787960/biography |title=Joe Diffie biography |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Diffie's father, Joe R., played guitar and banjo, and his mother sang.

Although he initially earned credits toward medical school, he decided against a medical profession after marrying for the first time in 1977 and ultimately dropped out before graduation.<ref name=\"stambler\" /> Diffie first worked in oil fields, then drove a truck that pumped concrete in the oilfield in [[Alice, Texas]], before he moved back to Duncan to work in a [[foundry]]. During this period, he worked as a musician on the side, first in a gospel group called Higher Purpose, and then in a bluegrass band called Special Edition.<ref name=\"stambler\" /> Diffie then built a recording studio, began touring with Special Edition in adjacent states, and sent [[demo (music)|demonstration]] recordings to publishers in [[Nashville]].

After working as a [[demo (music)|demo]] singer in the mid 1980s, he signed with [[Epic Records]]' Nashville division in 1990. Between then and 2004, Diffie charted 35 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, five of which peaked at number one: his debut release \"[[Home (Joe Diffie song)|Home]]\", \"[[If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)]]\", \"[[Third Rock from the Sun (song)|Third Rock from the Sun]]\", \"[[Pickup Man]]\" (his longest-lasting number-one song, at four weeks) and \"[[Bigger Than the Beatles]]\". In addition to these singles, he had 12 others reach the top 10 and ten more reach the top 40 on the same chart. He also co-wrote singles for [[Holly Dunn]], [[Tim McGraw]], and [[Jo Dee Messina]], and recorded with [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[George Jones]], and [[Marty Stuart]].\n\nDiffie released seven studio albums, a Christmas album, and a greatest-hits package under the Epic label. He also released one studio album each through [[Monument Records]], [[Broken Bow Records]], and [[Rounder Records]]. Among his albums, 1993's ''[[Honky Tonk Attitude]]'' and 1994's ''[[Third Rock from the Sun]]'' are [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], while 1992's ''[[Regular Joe (album)|Regular Joe]]'' and 1995's ''[[Life's So Funny]]'' are both certified gold. His album, ''[[Homecoming: The Bluegrass Album]]'', was released in late 2010 through Rounder. His style is defined by a [[neotraditionalist country]] influence with a mix of novelty songs and ballads.\n\n==Early life==\nJoe Diffie was born into a musical family in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 1958.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> His first musical performance came at age 14, when he performed in his Aunt Dawn Anita's country music band.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-diffie-mn0000787960/biography |title=Joe Diffie biography |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Diffie's father, Joe R., played guitar and banjo, and his mother sang.

As all my Catholic and traditional upbringing swept away instantly, I fell into a state of doubt and uncertainty, as ever the more pungent as I, a naturally religious spirit, had been born to believe placidly and obey without effort to an unknown rule.

If to this I add a burning imagination, with which Nature had blessed me in excess, the awakening of the loving passions known to early manhood, turbulence and petulance, the enthusiasms and discouragements of a meridional temperament, a lot of good faith and good will but a severe lack of patience and method, and the portrait of my qualities and defects with which I, at 18 years old, penetrated in the vast world of thought and poetry, shall be drawn.<ref>{{cite book|first=Antero de|last=Quental|title=Cartas In\u00e9ditas de Antero de Quental a Wilhelm Storck|trans-title=Unedited letters of Antero de Quental to Wilhelm Storck|year=1931}}</ref>}}\n\nHe soon distinguished himself for his oral and written talents, as well as turbulent and eccentric nature.

Four years later, he published ''Odes Modernas'', influenced by the [[Socialist realism|Socialist Experimentalism]] of [[Proudhon]], who championed an intellectual revolution. During that year a conflict (which would later be known as  ''Quest\u00e3o Coimbr\u00e3'') would develop between the traditionalist poets, championed by [[Ant\u00f3nio Feliciano de Castilho]] (at that time the chief living poet of the elder generation), and a group of students (which included Antero Quintal, [[Te\u00f3filo Braga]], [[Viera de Castro]], [[Ramalho Ortig\u00e3o]], [[Guerra Junqueiro]], [[E\u00e7a de Queiros]], [[Joaquim Pedro de Oliveira Martins|Oliveira Martins]], [[Jaime Batalha Reis]] and [[Guilherme de Azevedo]],  among others).<ref name=TAP/>  The contact with the nation's cultural and literary elite, the liberal and progressives in academia, did not identify with the aesthetic formalism in the literature of the day.<ref name=TAP/> Accusing this modernist group of poetic exhibitionism, obscurity, and generally a lack of good sense and taste, Castilho attacked the modernist poets for instigating the intellectual revolution.

This gave rise to the 1865 controversy known as the ''\"Coimbra Question\"'', and his groups reference as the ''70s Generation'' which opposed the ultra-romantic group of Ant\u00f3nio Feliciano de Castilho.<ref name=TAP/>\n\n[[File:Columbano Retrato de Antero de Quental 1889.jpg|thumb|left|A late portrait of Antero de Quental by [[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro]]]]\n\n===Unquiet maturity===\nHe then traveled, engaged in political and socialist agitation, and found his way through a series of disappointments to a mild pessimism.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>  Strangely, it animated his latest poetry.

In 1869, he founded the newspaper, ''A Rep\u00fablica - Jornal da Democracia Portuguesa'' with Oliveira Martins, and in 1872, along with Jos\u00e9 Fontana, he began to edit the magazine ''O Pensamento Social''. In the year of the Paris Commune (1871) he organized the famous ''Confer\u00eancias do Casino'' ({{lang-en|[[Censorship in Portugal|Casino Conferences]]}}), which marked the beginning of the spread of Socialist and Anarchist ideas in Portugal, distinguishing himself as a crusader for republican ideals.<ref name=TAP/>\n\nIn 1873, he inherited a sizable amount of money, which allowed him to live reasonably. Owing to tuberculosis in the following year, he rested, but returned to re-edit his ''Odes Modernas''.  He moved to Oporto in 1879, and in 1886 he published his best poetic work, ''Sonetos Completos'',  which included many passages considered autobiographical and symbolistic.\n\nIn 1880, he adopted the two daughters of his friend, Germano Meireles, who died in 1877.  During a trip to Paris he became seriously ill, and in September 1881, under counsel from his medic, he began residing in [[Vila do Conde]], where he remained until May 1891 (with a few intervals in the [[Azores]] and [[Lisbon]]).  His time in Vila do Conde was considered by the author the best of his life.

After one month in Lisbon he returned once again to [[Ponta Delgada]] around June 1891.

The purely introspective sonnets are less attractive, but equally finely wrought, interesting as psychological studies, and impressive from their sincerity.

He had learned much, and half-learned more, which he was unable to assimilate, and his mind became a chaos of conflicting ideas, settling down into a condition of gloomy negation, save for the one conviction of the vanity of existence, which ultimately destroyed him. A healthy participation in public affairs might have saved him, but he seemed incapable of entering upon any course that did not lead to delusion and disappointment.\n\nAs a prose writer Quental displayed high talents, though he wrote little. His most important prose is the ''Considera\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a philosophia da historia literaria Portugueza'', but he earned fame by his pamphlets on the Coimbra question, ''Bom senso e bom gosto'', a letter to Castilho, and ''A dignidade das lettras e litteraturas officiaes''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>}}\n\nHis friend [[Joaquim Pedro de Oliveira Martins|Oliveira Martins]] edited the Sonnets (Oporto, 1886), supplying an introductory essay; and an interesting collection of studies on the poet by the leading Portuguese writers appeared in a volume entitled ''Anthero de Quental.

In the essay titled ''Videopoetry'', he writes, \"Whereas I consider a line the unit of poem-making, like bricklaying, in video we substitute visual lines for printed lines and proceed to \"layer\" a poem: spoken words (the poet-performer); words heard (taped, dubbed); and seen (signs, subtitles, printed, painted). Naturally, a poem written with these three forms of word-smithing is never 'itself' until it is meshed with visual imagery... the end-product demonstrates a \"judicious\" mix of the two.\" (p.83)\n\nBetween 1978 and 2010, he produced 17 works in the genre.\n\nIn 2008, to develop a course in visual poetry at the University of the Fraser Valley, Konyves began researching videopoetry by visiting archives in Vancouver, San Francisco, Berlin, Budapest, Buenos Aires, Toronto, New York and Chicago.\n\nOn Sept. 6, 2011, he published ''Videopoetry: A Manifesto''.<ref>https://issuu.com/tomkonyves/docs/manifesto_pdf</ref> In the manifesto, he claimed it was necessitated by \"the underlying dichotomy (that) opposes videopoetry \u2013 I envision the measured integration of narrative, non-narrative and anti-narrative juxtapositions of text, image and sound as resulting in a poetic experience \u2013 to works which publish poems (voiced or displayed on-screen) in video format.\" (p.&nbsp;3)\n\nThe manifesto addresses 3 aspects of videopoetry: its definition, its constraints and its categories.\nVideopoetry is defined as \"a genre of poetry displayed on a screen, distinguished by its time-based, poetic juxtaposition of images with text and sound. In the measured blending of these three elements, it produces in the viewer the realization of a poetic experience.\" (p.&nbsp;4)\n\nOf its constraints, Konyves writes, \"Text, displayed on-screen or voiced, is an essential element of the videopoem. A work which does not contain visible or audible text could be described as poetic, as an art film or video art, but not as a videopoem.\nImagery in a videopoem \u2013 including on-screen text \u2013 does not illustrate the voiced text.\" (p.&nbsp;4)\n\nBased on a work's use of text, he describes 5 categories of videopoetry: Kinetic Text, Visual Text, Sound Text, Performance and Cin(e)poetry. (p.&nbsp;6)\n\nIn addition, Konyves distinguishes between the various uses of text in a videopoem. \"Text is typically written for the videopoem, not for print; in some cases it is found \u2013 in books or on signs \u2013 and repurposed for the videopoem.\nUsed in a videopoem, a previously composed/published poem represents only one element of the resulting poem, the text element. The \u201cpoetry\u201d in videopoetry is the result of the judicious juxtaposition of text with image and sound.\" (p.8)\n\n==A M Productions==\n\nArriving in Vancouver in 1983, Tom Konyves established A M PRODUCTIONS,<ref>http://www.amproductions.com/</ref> a video production facility. From 1983 to 2003, the company produced numerous educational, industrial, corporate and music videos, including ''To Return: The John Walkus Story'',<ref>http://www.amproductions.com/videos/artsandsci/johnwalkus/toreturn.html</ref> the award-winning documentary<ref>http://www.telefilm.gc.ca/upload/expresso/ExprVanen2.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.islandnet.com/mm/first02/annie.htm</ref>  on belonging, acceptance and loss of culture. This powerful one-hour documentary witnesses and celebrates young Kwakwaka'wakw artist John Walkus Green's journey home to the village he was forcefully adopted out of as a child. This story is also an investigation into the BC Provincial Government's Adoption policies which had tragic consequences for the children it was meant to protect.\nThe film received a humanitarian award from the American Indian Film Festival in San Francisco. Stephen Hume of the Vancouver Sun described the film as \u201cone of the most disturbing, illuminating and deeply troubling documentaries I\u2019ve seen in years.\u201d<ref>http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/marxism/2000w18/msg00192.html</ref>\nIn 2003, a fire destroyed the AM space and production ceased. To date, the company continues to distribute the hundreds of videos in its catalogue of educational videos in the fields of mining, remote sensing, GIS, as well as the performance art videos produced under the title of Art Montreal.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n*''Love Poems'', Asylum Press, 1974<ref>http://catalog.jewishpubliclibrary.org:9011/lib/item?id=chamo:89464&theme=JPL</ref>\n*''Proverbsi'' (with Ken Norris), Asylum Press, 1978.  {{ISBN|0-920320-01-5}}\n*''No Parking'', V\u00e9hicule Press, 1978.  {{ISBN|978-0-919890-15-2}}\n*''Poetry in Performance'', The Muses\u2019 Company, 1982.  {{ISBN|9780919754027}}\n*''Ex Perimeter'', Caitlin Press, 1988.  {{ISBN|978-0920576205}}\n*''Sleepwalking Among The Camels: New and Selected Poems'', The Muses\u2019 Company, 1998. {{ISBN|0-919754-58-9}}\n*''OOSOOM (Out of Sight Out of Mind)'', Bookthug, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-897388-03-7}}\n*\"Perfect Answers to Silent Questions\", Ekstasis Editions, 2015. {{ISBN|978-1-77171-107-4}}\n\n==Videopoems==\n\n*''Sympathies of War'' (1978) 10 Min.\n*''Mummypoem (Sympathies of War - A Postscript)'' (1978) 6 Min.\n*''See/Saw (with Ken Norris)''(1978) 15 Min.\n*''Ubu\u2019s Blues'' (1979) 22 Min.\n*''No Parking'' (1979) 5 Min.\n*''Yellow Light Blues'' (1980) 15 Min.\n*''And Once They Have Tasted Freedom'' (1981) 3 Min.\n*''Not Before Nor After'' (1982) 3 Min.

Konyves, the ringleader, is the most avant-gardist, Dadaist, surrealist, multi-media-prone. You must put your reason and sanity aside to read him.\n<br>- LOUIS DUDEK, The Montreal Gazette, Feb. 16, 1980\n\n===On Poetry In Performance===\n\nThe most experimental by far is Konyves. He's taken the poem off the page and turned it into visual performance. He has, in effect, made the \"writing\" of poetry into a creative act. He is also the most articulate defender of this type of poetry and his ''Poetry in Performance'' is crammed with explanatory notes, reasons why he does what he does and essays that anticipate criticism.\n<br>- MICHAEL MIROLLA, The Montreal Gazette, Dec. 24, 1982\n\nTom Konyves acknowledges both the surrealists and the dadaists as major influences on his performance poetry. ''Poetry in Performance'' is a collection of the scripts of his video and performance poems, along with introductory essays and footnotes to each of them, accounts of his collaborations with The V\u00e9hicule Poets, Konyves' concrete poems, and some short essays on poetry. The introductions serve to document the extraordinarily energetic literary activity in Montreal over the past decade, and specifically Konyves' movement towards video poetry. Reflecting political as well as aesthetic interests, the scripts are witty and lively, and two of them, \"''Sympathies of War''\" and \"''No Parking'',\" moved me especially. Like the essays, they raise questions about the nature and function of poetry and poets.\nKonyves' first \"tribe\" was the other V\u00e9hicule poets. But beyond this kind of collaboration, he is after larger collaborations: between sight and sound, form and content, environment and art, poetry and technology, conception and performance, the audience and the poet. Removing words from a linear context is part of the poet's war of imagination against rationalism: war against any hard line, political or artistic, which is exclusive or divisive.\n<br>- ANN MANDEL, Books In Review, Canadian Literature, Issue 101, summer 1984 (p.&nbsp;149-153)\n\n===On Ex Perimeter===\n\nAs his title suggests, in ''Ex Perimeter'', Tom Konyves explores boundaries \u2014 between poetry and prose, and between art and life. Like American poet Frank O'Hara, Konyves views the poem as a \"temporary object,\" which must be \"true/ to the moment.\" The economy of language here, the proselike cadence, the focus on the \"real\" world, and on human mortality, are all features of Konyves' writing in this volume.\n<br>- SUSAN SCHENK \u2013 Unmapped Territory, Journal of Canadian Literature, Issue #130 (Autumn 1991)\n\nFascinating, encouraging, delightful. Here is honesty, genuineness of mind and of poetic delivery. Several of these poems are little masterpieces.\n<br>-LOUIS DUDEK\n\nKonyves relays an authentic voice in well-carpentered passages... short, from the heart epiphanies one finds marked with peculiarly urban tenderness; back alley kind of poems that cue on the localized imagery of a Montreal lane, a cemetery, a lover's bed. Konyves has a precise eye for detail and he strives for meaning in his observations. There is contentment with the ordinary, tribute to birth and death, to change of landscape.\n<br>- TREVOR CAROLAN, The Vancouver Sun, May 13, 1989\n\nThe poems in Ex Perimeter are sparse, clear, direct and full of delicate and precise insight. Whenever I read them I say to myself, \"Yes, that is it, exactly.\" In this life of mine which is too often out of control and beyond reflection, these poems bring me to a sudden stop. \"Pay attention,\" they say, \"to the moment, to experience, to what is.\"\n<br>- LIONEL KEARNS\n\n===On Sleepwalking Among The Camels===\nTom Konyves\u2019 strong experimental impulses and wide range of technical skills produce some remarkably successful poems... both his selections from ''Ex Perimeter'' (1988) and his most recent material in the section ''Into This Space'' represent the work of a skilled poet who is finally coming into his own. The diversity of this material stands out even to the casual reader. Konyves displays an extraordinary sensitivity to rhythm... Allusions to poets... are woven into meditations that are both fresh and vulnerable. In short, these final fifty pages come close fulfilling Konyves\u2019 own declared desire to create \u201ca temporary object / through which a thought flows / searching for a vantage point / to view the human soul.\u201d\n<br>- JOURNAL OF CANADIAN POETRY\n\nKonyves\u2019 poems are beyond poems, mouthfuls with a surprising aftertaste, and difficult to explain.\n<br>- rob mclennan\n\n===On The Vehicule Poets_Now===\n\nKonyves... was always the one most involved in the history and course of the central European avant garde. Tom Konyves, for example, became fascinated with the possibilities of videotape when that medium was new. He made something he called \"videopoetry,\" and is now a west coast video-arts doyen. Konyves is witty, terse and cynical. He chose his surrealist roots, and they, along with his years as a video artist, have led him away from exposition.\n<br>- George Bowering, Introduction, The Vehicule Poets_Now, The Muses Company, 2004\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Konyves, Tom}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1947 births]]\n[[Category:Writers from Budapest]]\n[[Category:Hungarian expatriates in Canada]]\n[[Category:Concordia University alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century Canadian poets]]\n[[Category:Canadian male poets]]\n[[Category:University of the Fraser Valley]]\n[[Category:Hungarian emigrants to Canada]]\n[[Category:20th-century Canadian male writers]]\n", "text_old": "'''Tom Konyves''' (born July 13, 1947) is a Canadian poet, video producer, educator and a pioneer in the field of videopoetry.

The project, the first of its kind in Canada,<ref>http://robmclennan.blogspot.com/2006/02/transpoetry-part-2-sponsored-by-arc.html</ref> was launched on Thursday, December 13, 1979, with all major media present in a bus provided by the MUCTC in front of the old bus terminal on St. Antoine St. The Consultant for the English poems was Louis Dudek; the Consultant for the French poems was Claude Beausoleil.\n\nInfluenced by performance art, Konyves performed [[Ezra Pound]]'s poem, In A Station Of The Metro at the Berri Metro Station, bowing with the last word, ''bough''; other performances included ''Motions and Marie The Poem'', performed with black electric tape on a white wall, accompanied by a recording of the day's radio programming, edited by manually changing stations.<ref>Poetry in Performance, The Muses\u2019 Company, 1982 SBN 9780919754027 (p.123)</ref><ref>Vehicule Days: An Unorthodox History of Montr\u00e9al's Vehicule Poets, NuAge Editions 1993 {{ISBN|0-921833-11-3}} (p.125)</ref>\n\nHe initiated collaborative performances, first with Ken Norris on the video See/Saw<ref>Poetry in Performance, The Muses\u2019 Company, 1982 (p.18)</ref><ref>http://www.amproductions.com/images/fineArts/18.jpg</ref>  (including Konyves' 7-year-old son, [[Michael Konyves]]), followed by ''Drummer Boy Raga: Red Light, Green Light'',<ref>Poetry in Performance, The Muses\u2019 Company, 1982 (p.1)</ref><ref>Vehicule Days: An Unorthodox History of Montr\u00e9al's Vehicule Poets, NuAge Editions 1993 (p.90)</ref> based on ''To Dawn'',<ref>Poetry in Performance, The Muses\u2019 Company, 1982 (p.163)</ref>  a poem written by Tom Konyves, performed by Konyves, Ken Norris, Endre Farkas, Stephen Morrissey, John McAuley and Opal L.

The theatre group ''Step dans Fuego'' performed poems by the poets, which was followed by videopoems by Tom Konyves and readings by the poets. Artie Gold, one of the original group, was too ill to attend; his poems were read by Ruth Taylor. Within 2 years, Ruth<ref>[[Ruth Taylor (poet)]]</ref> died, followed a year later, on Valentine's Day, by Artie Gold himself.<ref>http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=2c92f98d-27ef-4d0c-bb1e-8f7cc51bad1c&k=58845&p=2</ref>\n\n==Videopoetry==\n\nIn 1982, Tom Konyves coined the term 'videopoetry' in \"The Insecurity of Art\",<ref>{{Cite book |isbn = 9780919890435|title = The Insecurity of art: Essays on poetics|last1 = Norris|first1 = Ken|last2 = Toorn|first2 = Peter Van|year = 1982}}</ref><ref>Vehicule Days: An Unorthodox History of Montr\u00e9al's Vehicule Poets, NuAge Editions 1993 (p.90)</ref><ref>http://12or20questions.blogspot.com/2007/11/12-or-20-questions-with-tom-konyves.html</ref> a book of essays on poetics published by Vehicule Press. In the essay titled ''Videopoetry'', he writes, \"Whereas I consider a line the unit of poem-making, like bricklaying, in video we substitute visual lines for printed lines and proceed to \"layer\" a poem: spoken words (the poet-performer); words heard (taped, dubbed); and seen (signs, subtitles, printed, painted). Naturally, a poem written with these three forms of word-smithing is never 'itself' until it is meshed with visual imagery... the end-product demonstrates a \"judicious\" mix of the two.\" (p.83)\n\nBetween 1978 and 2010, he produced 17 works in the genre.\n\nIn 2008, to develop a course in visual poetry at the University of the Fraser Valley, Konyves began researching videopoetry by visiting archives in Vancouver, San Francisco, Berlin, Budapest, Buenos Aires, Toronto, New York and Chicago.\n\nOn Sept. 6, 2011, he published ''Videopoetry: A Manifesto''.<ref>https://issuu.com/tomkonyves/docs/manifesto_pdf</ref> In the manifesto, he claimed it was necessitated by \"the underlying dichotomy (that) opposes videopoetry \u2013 I envision the measured integration of narrative, non-narrative and anti-narrative juxtapositions of text, image and sound as resulting in a poetic experience \u2013 to works which publish poems (voiced or displayed on-screen) in video format.\" (p.&nbsp;3)\n\nThe manifesto addresses 3 aspects of videopoetry: its definition, its constraints and its categories.\nVideopoetry is defined as \"a genre of poetry displayed on a screen, distinguished by its time-based, poetic juxtaposition of images with text and sound. In the measured blending of these three elements, it produces in the viewer the realization of a poetic experience.\" (p.&nbsp;4)\n\nOf its constraints, Konyves writes, \"Text, displayed on-screen or voiced, is an essential element of the videopoem. A work which does not contain visible or audible text could be described as poetic, as an art film or video art, but not as a videopoem.\nImagery in a videopoem \u2013 including on-screen text \u2013 does not illustrate the voiced text.\" (p.&nbsp;4)\n\nBased on a work's use of text, he describes 5 categories of videopoetry: Kinetic Text, Visual Text, Sound Text, Performance and Cin(e)poetry. (p.&nbsp;6)\n\nIn addition, Konyves distinguishes between the various uses of text in a videopoem. \"Text is typically written for the videopoem, not for print; in some cases it is found \u2013 in books or on signs \u2013 and repurposed for the videopoem.\nUsed in a videopoem, a previously composed/published poem represents only one element of the resulting poem, the text element. The \u201cpoetry\u201d in videopoetry is the result of the judicious juxtaposition of text with image and sound.\" (p.8)\n\n==A M Productions==\n\nArriving in Vancouver in 1983, Tom Konyves established A M PRODUCTIONS,<ref>http://www.amproductions.com/</ref> a video production facility. From 1983 to 2003, the company produced numerous educational, industrial, corporate and music videos, including ''To Return: The John Walkus Story'',<ref>http://www.amproductions.com/videos/artsandsci/johnwalkus/toreturn.html</ref> the award-winning documentary<ref>http://www.telefilm.gc.ca/upload/expresso/ExprVanen2.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.islandnet.com/mm/first02/annie.htm</ref>  on belonging, acceptance and loss of culture. This powerful one-hour documentary witnesses and celebrates young Kwakwaka'wakw artist John Walkus Green's journey home to the village he was forcefully adopted out of as a child. This story is also an investigation into the BC Provincial Government's Adoption policies which had tragic consequences for the children it was meant to protect.\nThe film received a humanitarian award from the American Indian Film Festival in San Francisco. Stephen Hume of the Vancouver Sun described the film as \u201cone of the most disturbing, illuminating and deeply troubling documentaries I\u2019ve seen in years.\u201d<ref>http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/marxism/2000w18/msg00192.html</ref>\nIn 2003, a fire destroyed the AM space and production ceased. To date, the company continues to distribute the hundreds of videos in its catalogue of educational videos in the fields of mining, remote sensing, GIS, as well as the performance art videos produced under the title of Art Montreal.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n*''Love Poems'', Asylum Press, 1974<ref>http://catalog.jewishpubliclibrary.org:9011/lib/item?id=chamo:89464&theme=JPL</ref>\n*''Proverbsi'' (with Ken Norris), Asylum Press, 1978.  {{ISBN|0-920320-01-5}}\n*''No Parking'', Vehicule Press, 1978.  {{ISBN|978-0-919890-15-2}}\n*''Poetry in Performance'', The Muses\u2019 Company, 1982.  {{ISBN|9780919754027}}\n*''Ex Perimeter'', Caitlin Press, 1988.  {{ISBN|978-0920576205}}\n*''Sleepwalking Among The Camels: New and Selected Poems'', The Muses\u2019 Company, 1998. {{ISBN|0-919754-58-9}}\n*''OOSOOM (Out of Sight Out of Mind)'', Bookthug, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-897388-03-7}}\n*\"Perfect Answers to Silent Questions\", Ekstasis Editions, 2015. {{ISBN|978-1-77171-107-4}}\n\n==Videopoems==\n\n*''Sympathies of War'' (1978) 10 Min.\n*''Mummypoem (Sympathies of War - A Postscript)'' (1978) 6 Min.\n*''See/Saw (with Ken Norris)''(1978) 15 Min.\n*''Ubu\u2019s Blues'' (1979) 22 Min.\n*''No Parking'' (1979) 5 Min.\n*''Yellow Light Blues'' (1980) 15 Min.\n*''And Once They Have Tasted Freedom'' (1981) 3 Min.\n*''Not Before Nor After'' (1982) 3 Min.

Konyves, the ringleader, is the most avant-gardist, Dadaist, surrealist, multi-media-prone. You must put your reason and sanity aside to read him.\n<br>- LOUIS DUDEK, The Montreal Gazette, Feb. 16, 1980\n\n===On Poetry In Performance===\n\nThe most experimental by far is Konyves. He's taken the poem off the page and turned it into visual performance. He has, in effect, made the \"writing\" of poetry into a creative act. He is also the most articulate defender of this type of poetry and his ''Poetry in Performance'' is crammed with explanatory notes, reasons why he does what he does and essays that anticipate criticism.\n<br>- MICHAEL MIROLLA, The Montreal Gazette, Dec. 24, 1982\n\nTom Konyves acknowledges both the surrealists and the dadaists as major influences on his performance poetry. ''Poetry in Performance'' is a collection of the scripts of his video and performance poems, along with introductory essays and footnotes to each of them, accounts of his collaborations with The V\u00e9hicule Poets, Konyves' concrete poems, and some short essays on poetry. The introductions serve to document the extraordinarily energetic literary activity in Montreal over the past decade, and specifically Konyves' movement towards video poetry. Reflecting political as well as aesthetic interests, the scripts are witty and lively, and two of them, \"''Sympathies of War''\" and \"''No Parking'',\" moved me especially. Like the essays, they raise questions about the nature and function of poetry and poets.\nKonyves' first \"tribe\" was the other V\u00e9hicule poets. But beyond this kind of collaboration, he is after larger collaborations: between sight and sound, form and content, environment and art, poetry and technology, conception and performance, the audience and the poet. Removing words from a linear context is part of the poet's war of imagination against rationalism: war against any hard line, political or artistic, which is exclusive or divisive.\n<br>- ANN MANDEL, Books In Review, Canadian Literature, Issue 101, summer 1984 (p.&nbsp;149-153)\n\n===On Ex Perimeter===\n\nAs his title suggests, in ''Ex Perimeter'', Tom Konyves explores boundaries \u2014 between poetry and prose, and between art and life. Like American poet Frank O'Hara, Konyves views the poem as a \"temporary object,\" which must be \"true/ to the moment.\" The economy of language here, the proselike cadence, the focus on the \"real\" world, and on human mortality, are all features of Konyves' writing in this volume.\n<br>- SUSAN SCHENK \u2013 Unmapped Territory, Journal of Canadian Literature, Issue #130 (Autumn 1991)\n\nFascinating, encouraging, delightful. Here is honesty, genuineness of mind and of poetic delivery. Several of these poems are little masterpieces.\n<br>-LOUIS DUDEK\n\nKonyves relays an authentic voice in well-carpentered passages... short, from the heart epiphanies one finds marked with peculiarly urban tenderness; back alley kind of poems that cue on the localized imagery of a Montreal lane, a cemetery, a lover's bed. Konyves has a precise eye for detail and he strives for meaning in his observations. There is contentment with the ordinary, tribute to birth and death, to change of landscape.\n<br>- TREVOR CAROLAN, The Vancouver Sun, May 13, 1989\n\nThe poems in Ex Perimeter are sparse, clear, direct and full of delicate and precise insight. Whenever I read them I say to myself, \"Yes, that is it, exactly.\" In this life of mine which is too often out of control and beyond reflection, these poems bring me to a sudden stop. \"Pay attention,\" they say, \"to the moment, to experience, to what is.\"\n<br>- LIONEL KEARNS\n\n===On Sleepwalking Among The Camels===\nTom Konyves\u2019 strong experimental impulses and wide range of technical skills produce some remarkably successful poems\u2026 both his selections from ''Ex Perimeter'' (1988) and his most recent material in the section ''Into This Space'' represent the work of a skilled poet who is finally coming into his own. The diversity of this material stands out even to the casual reader. Konyves displays an extraordinary sensitivity to rhythm\u2026 Allusions to poets\u2026 are woven into meditations that are both fresh and vulnerable. In short, these final fifty pages come close fulfilling Konyves\u2019 own declared desire to create \u201ca temporary object / through which a thought flows / searching for a vantage point / to view the human soul.\u201d\n<br>- JOURNAL OF CANADIAN POETRY\n\nKonyves\u2019 poems are beyond poems, mouthfuls with a surprising aftertaste, and difficult to explain.\n<br>- rob mclennan\n\n===On The Vehicule Poets_Now===\n\nKonyves\u2026 was always the one most involved in the history and course of the central European avant garde. Tom Konyves, for example, became fascinated with the possibilities of videotape when that medium was new. He made something he called \"videopoetry,\" and is now a west coast video-arts doyen. Konyves is witty, terse and cynical. He chose his surrealist roots, and they, along with his years as a video artist, have led him away from exposition.\n<br>- George Bowering, Introduction, The Vehicule Poets_Now, The Muses Company, 2004\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Konyves, Tom}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1947 births]]\n[[Category:Writers from Budapest]]\n[[Category:Hungarian expatriates in Canada]]\n[[Category:Concordia University alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century Canadian poets]]\n[[Category:Canadian male poets]]\n[[Category:University of the Fraser Valley]]\n[[Category:Hungarian emigrants to Canada]]\n[[Category:20th-century Canadian male writers]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "replaced: Consultant \u2192 consultant (2), Commission \u2192 commission, 1957\u20131983 \u2192 1957 to 1983,typo(s) fixed: Vehicule Press \u2192 V\u00e9hicule Press (3), \u2026 \u2192 ...
