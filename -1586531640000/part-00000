The Roman Curia can be loosely compared to [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]] in governments of countries with a Western form of governance, but the only sections that can be directly compared with specific ministries of a civil government are the Second Section of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], known also as the Section for Relations with States, the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]] (established in 1939 by [[Pius XII]]), and the [[Congregation for Catholic Education]], \n\nIt is normal for every Latin Catholic [[diocese]] to have its own ''curia'' for its administration. For the [[Diocese of Rome]], these functions are ''not'' handled by the Roman Curia, but by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicariate General of His Holiness for the City of Rome]], as provided by the apostolic constitution ''[[Ecclesia in Urbe]]''. The pope has, going back to [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]], been the bishop of Rome. There is also the The [[Vicar General of Rome]], traditionally a cardinal, and his deputy the vicegerent, who holds the personal title of archbishop, supervise the governance of the diocese by reference to the Pope himself, but with no more dependence on the Roman Curia, as such, than other Catholic dioceses throughout the world. A distinct office, the [[Vicar General for Vatican City]], administers the portion of the Diocese of Rome in [[Vatican City]].\n\nUntil recently, there still existed [[hereditary officers of the Roman Curia]], holding titles denominating functions that had ceased to be a reality when the [[Papal States]] were lost to the papacy. A reorganization, ordered by [[Pope Pius X]], was incorporated into the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]]. Further steps toward reorganization were begun by [[Pope Paul VI]] in the 1960s. Among the goals of this curial reform were the modernization of procedures and the internationalization of the curial staff. These reforms are reflected in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507667/Roman-Curia |title=Roman Curia (Roman Catholicism) \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref> The offices of the Vatican City State are not part of the Roman Curia, which is composed only of offices of the [[Holy See]].

{"title_page": "Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller", "text_new": "'''Hagaon Harav Gershon Shaul Yom-Tov Lipmann ben Nathan ha-Levi Heller''' (c. 1579 in [[Wallerstein, Bavaria]] \u2013 19 August 1654 in [[Krak\u00f3w]]), was a [[Bohemia]]n [[rabbi]] and [[Talmudist]], best known for writing a commentary on the [[Mishnah]] called the ''Tosefet Yom-Tov'' (1614\u20131617). Heller was one of the major [[Talmud]]ic scholars in Prague and in Poland during the \"Golden Age\" before 1648.\n\n==Education and rabbinic career==\nAfter Heller was born, he was raised by his grandfather, Rabbi Moses Ha-Levi Heller in Wallerstein, now in Germany.  As a teenager Heller was sent to Friedberg, near Wallerstein, where he studied in the [[yeshiva]] of Rabbi [[Jacob G\u00fcnzburg]]. From there he moved to [[Prague]], where he became a disciple of the [[Maharal]], head of the yeshiva of [[Prague]]. In 1597, when Heller was scarcely 18 years old, he received a [[semicha]] (appointment) as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayan]] in that city.\n\nIn October 1624 Heller was called to the rabbinate of [[Mikulov]], [[Moravia]], and in March 1625, became rabbi of [[Vienna]]. [[Leopoldstadt]] was then a suburb of Vienna. When he arrived, the Jews of Vienna were scattered throughout the city, not having a central community. Heller obtained the right for the Jews to establish a central Jewish community in Leopoldstadt. He was instrumental in reorganizing the community and drew up its constitution.\n\nFrom 1627 until 1629, he was [[Chief Rabbi|chief rabbi]] of Prague.\n\nIn 1631, he moved to the Ukraine, where he served as rabbi of [[Nemirov]] for three years. In 1634, he moved to the larger city of [[Ludmir]] ([[Volodymyr-Volynskyi|Volodymyr]]) in [[Volhynia]]. During his years in Volhynia and Poland, Heller was among the rabbinic leaders of the [[Council of Four Lands]]. In 1640, he worked to obtain the renewal of the [[synod]]\u2019s decrees against [[simony]] in the rabbinate.\n\nFinally, in 1643 he was elected head of the rabbinical court of Krak\u00f3w, one of the two chief rabbis of that community. Rabbi [[Avraham Yehoshua Heschel|Yehoshua Heschel of Crakow]], the author of ''Maginei Shelomo'', was head of the yeshiva there. Four years later, Heschel died, and Heller succeeded him and also directed the yeshiva as well. Heller was chief rabbi of Krak\u00f3w during the [[Chmielnicki uprising]] of 1648, and until his death in 1654.\n\n==Imprisonment==\nIn the summer of 1629, Heller was arrested at the order of the imperial court of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II]]. Heller was accused of insulting Christianity and imprisoned in Vienna. A commission was quickly appointed to inquire into Heller's guilt. He defended himself adroitly, but the commission's verdict was that Heller be sentenced to hard labor in prison. It was an influential court Jew, [[Jacob Bassevi von Treuenberg]], who appeared before the emperor to plead the rabbi's cause. He paid 12,000 [[thaler]]s for his release on the condition that Heller resign the post of chief rabbi of Prague and leave the country. After spending more than a month in prison, Heller was released. He then spent two years paying off the fine. In 1631, Heller left Prague and spent the second part of his career in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nSeveral factors account for Heller's imprisonment. His arrest marked the beginning of a brief [[Habsburg]] anti-Jewish campaign, encouraged by the Papacy. Heller also had enemies within the Prague Jewish community. On account of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the government had imposed heavy taxes on the Jewish communities of [[Bohemia]], including that of Prague, which had to pay a yearly tax of 40,000 thalers. A commission headed by Chief Rabbi Heller unanimously voted to tax each Jewish family in Prague. The richer the family, the higher the tax. The burden fell mostly upon the rich merchants who could well afford to pay their assessments. However, they complained and demanded a reexamination of the decision. Rabbi Heller and his committee reviewed the problem and concluded that this approach was fair. The committee met with representatives of the merchants' association to explain the sensitive situation facing the Jewish community of Prague. The irate merchants refused to deal with the [[Qahal]] which was responsible for delivering the money to the government. Instead, they decided to appeal to the government. In their petition they charged the Chief Rabbi with being an enemy of Christianity. Their proof: \"His writings are filled with allegations against the religion of the country.\" Rabbi Heller was associated with the wealthy leader of the Prague community at that time, [[Jacob Bassevi]]. He was an ally of the great general [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]], who also had enemies at the Habsburg court. Heller's relationship with Bassevi and Heller's arrest played a part in larger political machinations there.\n\n==Family==\nYom-Tov Heller founded a long line of rabbis. His father, Nathan, who died days before he was born, was the son of Rabbi Moses. Heller was married to Rachel, a daughter of a wealthy Prague merchant, Aaron Moses Ashkenazi (Munk). Through his wife he was related to the [[Horowitz]] family. On his mother's side, he was related to the [[G\u00fcnzburg]] family; on his father's side, to the Frankel family of Vienna.\n\nDespite his father dying at age 18, Yom-Tov is believed to have had three siblings: brother Joseph d. 1659, sister Perel and another unknown sister. It is possible but unclear whether the addition of Oettingen and Wallerstein to their names means his ancestors had connections by marriage with the noble families of the [[House of Oettingen-Wallerstein]]. <!--[No, it is neither unclear nor possible that the addition of Oettingen and Wallerstein to their names means his ancestors had connections by marriage with the noble families of the House of Oettingen-Wallerstein. Instead, in those days which precede the existence of official permanent surnames for Jewish families by over one hundred years, in lieu of a surname, it was common for Jews to be referred to (and to refer to themselves) by the name of the building (house), town, city, region or country from which they came.]-->\n\nYom-Tov and Rachel probably had 16 children, at least six sons and at least eight daughters. Sons whom he mentions in his works, were: Moses of Prague, Samuel of Nemirow (now Nemirov, Ukraine), Abraham of Lublin (now in Poland), and Leb of Brest-Litovsk (now Brest, Belarus). The daughters of whom we definitely know were: Nechle, Nisel, Doberish, Esther, Rebecca, and Reizel.\n\nProbably his most famous descendant was [[Aryeh Leib Heller]] (b. 1745), known as the K'tzos (after his greatest work, ''K'tzos Hachoshen''). His brother [[Yehuda Heller Kahana]] (b. 1738), known as the Kuntras Ha'Sfeikos, often appeared with the K'tzos Hachoshen. Other noted relatives are [[Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport]] (b. 1790), religious scholar, poet, writer whose grandson, Arnold Edler von Porada Rapoport (b. 1840) was a lawyer, parliamentarian, coal mining entrepreneur, and philanthropist.\n\nIn commemoration of his imprisonment and his release from prison, Heller established two special days of remembrance for his family and descendants. He established the 5th of [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]], the day on which his troubles began, as an annual fast-day, and the 1st of [[Adar]] as a day of celebration on the anniversary of his nomination to the rabbinate of Krak\u00f3w. The reading of the Megillah that Heller wrote, called ''Megilat Eivah'' (Scroll of Hostility), that tells the story of his imprisonment and release, became a tradition for the descendants of Rabbi Heller. To this day, they celebrate the story of his life in a special [[Purim]] celebration.\n\nIn 1984 on the 330th anniversary ''Yahrzeit'' of Rabbi Heller's death his autobiographical story of his imprisonment ''Megillat Eivah'' and a detailed family tree were published in English by Rabbi C.U. Lipschitz and Dr. Neil Rosenstein under the title, ''The Feast and The Fast'' by Moznaim Publishing Corporation, New York and Jerusalem. The book contains 40 pages of charts detailing the family tree and the hundreds of families descended from Rabbi Heller.\n\n==Works and opinions==\nBetween 1614 and 1617 Rabbi Heller published a [[Mishnah]] commentary, in three volumes. It was initially entitled ''Tosefet Yom Tov'',<ref>The name ''Tosefet Yom Tov'' is visible in the title page and forward of the 3rd printing [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/42254 here] and in the [http://beta.nli.org.il/he/books/NNL_ALEPH001762106/NLI Hebrew National Library catalog].

Heller was one of the major [[Talmud]]ic scholars in Prague and in Poland during the \"Golden Age\" before 1648.\n\n==Education and rabbinic career==\nAfter Heller was born, he was raised by his grandfather, Rabbi Moses Ha-Levi Heller in Wallerstein, now in Germany.  As a teenager Heller was sent to Friedberg, near Wallerstein, where he studied in the [[yeshiva]] of Rabbi [[Jacob G\u00fcnzburg]]. From there he moved to [[Prague]], where he became a disciple of the [[Maharal]], head of the yeshiva of [[Prague]]. In 1597, when Heller was scarcely 18 years old, he received a [[semicha]] (appointment) as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayan]] in that city.\n\nIn October 1624 Heller was called to the rabbinate of [[Mikulov]], [[Moravia]], and in March 1625, became rabbi of [[Vienna]]. [[Leopoldstadt]] was then a suburb of Vienna. When he arrived, the Jews of Vienna were scattered throughout the city, not having a central community. Heller obtained the right for the Jews to establish a central Jewish community in Leopoldstadt. He was instrumental in reorganizing the community and drew up its constitution.\n\nFrom 1627 until 1629, he was [[Chief Rabbi|chief rabbi]] of Prague.\n\nIn 1631, he moved to the Ukraine, where he served as rabbi of [[Nemirov]] for three years. In 1634, he moved to the larger city of [[Ludmir]] ([[Volodymyr-Volynskyi|Volodymyr]]) in [[Volhynia]]. During his years in Volhynia and Poland, Heller was among the rabbinic leaders of the [[Council of Four Lands]]. In 1640, he worked to obtain the renewal of the [[synod]]\u2019s decrees against [[simony]] in the rabbinate.\n\nFinally, in 1643 he was elected head of the rabbinical court of Krak\u00f3w, one of the two chief rabbis of that community. Rabbi [[Avraham Yehoshua Heschel|Yehoshua Heschel of Crakow]], the author of ''Maginei Shelomo'', was head of the yeshiva there. Four years later, Heschel died, and Heller succeeded him and also directed the yeshiva as well. Heller was chief rabbi of Krak\u00f3w during the [[Chmielnicki uprising]] of 1648, and until his death in 1654.\n\n==Imprisonment==\nIn the summer of 1629, Heller was arrested at the order of the imperial court of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II]]. Heller was accused of insulting Christianity and imprisoned in Vienna. A commission was quickly appointed to inquire into Heller's guilt. He defended himself adroitly, but the commission's verdict was that Heller be sentenced to hard labor in prison. It was an influential court Jew, [[Jacob Bassevi von Treuenberg]], who appeared before the emperor to plead the rabbi's cause. He paid 12,000 [[thaler]]s for his release on the condition that Heller resign the post of chief rabbi of Prague and leave the country. After spending more than a month in prison, Heller was released. He then spent two years paying off the fine. In 1631, Heller left Prague and spent the second part of his career in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nSeveral factors account for Heller's imprisonment. His arrest marked the beginning of a brief [[Habsburg]] anti-Jewish campaign, encouraged by the Papacy. Heller also had enemies within the Prague Jewish community. On account of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the government had imposed heavy taxes on the Jewish communities of [[Bohemia]], including that of Prague, which had to pay a yearly tax of 40,000 thalers. A commission headed by Chief Rabbi Heller unanimously voted to tax each Jewish family in Prague. The richer the family, the higher the tax. The burden fell mostly upon the rich merchants who could well afford to pay their assessments. However, they complained and demanded a reexamination of the decision. Rabbi Heller and his committee reviewed the problem and concluded that this approach was fair. The committee met with representatives of the merchants' association to explain the sensitive situation facing the Jewish community of Prague. The irate merchants refused to deal with the [[Qahal]] which was responsible for delivering the money to the government. Instead, they decided to appeal to the government. In their petition they charged the Chief Rabbi with being an enemy of Christianity. Their proof: \"His writings are filled with allegations against the religion of the country.\" Rabbi Heller was associated with the wealthy leader of the Prague community at that time, [[Jacob Bassevi]]. He was an ally of the great general [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]], who also had enemies at the Habsburg court. Heller's relationship with Bassevi and Heller's arrest played a part in larger political machinations there.\n\n==Family==\nYom-Tov Heller founded a long line of rabbis.
