He studied English literature at [[Harvard]], graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1921. His writing career began when [[Van Wyck Brooks]], the Harvard teacher he most admired, invited him to write for ''[[The Freeman#Earlier publications called The Freeman|The Freeman]]'' while he was still an undergraduate. After a short period teaching at the high school level, Arvin joined the English faculty at [[Smith College]] and, though he never earned a doctorate, won a tenured position. One of his students was [[Sylvia Plath]], the poet and novelist.\n\nHe taught at Smith College for 38 years and was Mary Augusta Jordan Professor of English during the year before his retirement in 1961. He rarely left Northampton for long nor travelled far. He visited Europe only once in the summer of 1929 or 1930. He spent a year's leave of absence in the mid-1920s as the editor of ''Living Age'', a weekly compendium of articles from British and American periodicals.<ref>Daniel Aaron and Sylvan Schendler, eds., ''American Pantheon: Essays'' (NY: Delacorte Press 1966), xxii, 251</ref>\n\nArvin often wrote about political issues and took public political positions. For example, in 1936, on the day when Harvard celebrated its 300th anniversary, he joined a group of 28 Harvard graduates in an attack on retired Harvard president [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]] for his role years earlier on an advisory Committee to Massachusetts Governor [[Alvan T. Fuller]] that found that [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] had received a fair trial. Among his co-signors were editor [[Malcolm Cowley]] and author [[John Dos Passos]].<ref>''New York Times'': [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A10F73F58107A93CBA81782D85F428385F9& \"Assail Dr. Lowell on Sacco Decision,\" Sept. 19, 1936], accessed Dec. 28, 2009; see also Barry Werth, ''The Scarlet Professor: Newton Arvin: A Literary Life Shattered by Scandal'' (NY: Doubleday, 2001), 54-6</ref>\n\nHis first book-length publication, ''Hawthorne'', appeared in 1929.

There in the summer of 1946 he met and began a two-year affair with the young [[Truman Capote]]. Newton addressed him as \"Precious Spooky\" in amorous letters that went on to discuss literary matters.<ref name=mcgrath/> In 1948 Capote dedicated his novel ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'' to Arvin, and he later described how much he learned from Arvin saying: \"Newton was my Harvard\".<ref>Werth, ''Scarlet Professor'', 3, 61-66, 108-13</ref>\n\nArvin came to national attention with the publication in 1950 of ''Herman Melville'', a critical biography of the novelist.

He is concerned with the man's evolution in a way that leaves an extraordinary impression of concentrated sympathetic awareness.</blockquote>\n\nHe particularly valued how Arvin's integration of the details of Melville's biography&ndash;his Calvinist background, the mental breakdown of the father he so loved, his mother's transformation by his father's failure and early death&ndash;exposes Melville's \"grandeur and weakness.\"<ref name=kazin>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1950/05/07/archives/the-burning-human-values-in-melville-herman-melville.html Alfred Kazin, \"The Burning Human Values in Melville,\" May 7, 1950], accessed January 7, 2010</ref>\n\nArvin was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|National institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1952.<ref>American Academy of Arts and Letters: [http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2_deceased.php Deceased Members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726004624/http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2_deceased.php |date=2011-07-26 }}, accessed January 5, 2010</ref> [[Edmund Wilson]] wrote that of all critics of American literature only Arvin and his teacher Van Wyck Brooks \"can themselves be called first-rate writers.\"<ref name=demott>''The New York Review of Books'': Benjamin DeMott, \"The Sad Tale of Newton Arvin\", November 29, 2001</ref>\n\nThough Arvin's ''Whitman'' reflected some of his leftist sympathies in the 1930s, he responded to the Cold War with renewed cultural patriotism. In a 1952 essay titled \"Our Country and Our Culture\" in ''Partisan Review'' he wrote:<ref>Robert S. Ward, \"Review of ''American Pantheon'',\" in ''New England Quarterly'', v. 39 (1966), 413-5</ref>\n\n:That period, at any rate is over, and the habit of rejection, of repudiation, of mere exacerbated alienation, has ceased to seem relevant or defensible&ndash;inevitably, since the culture we profoundly cherish is now disastrously threatened from without, and the truer this becomes, the intenser becomes the awareness of our necessary identification with it.\n\n==Scandal==\nIn 1960, the office of the [[United States Postmaster General]] (then [[Arthur Ellsworth Summerfield]]) initiated a campaign against the distribution and possession of lewd materials, including soft-core, homosexually-themed pictures. At the same time, local officials in Northampton were engaged in an anti-homosexual crusade. (See [[Lavender scare]].) On September 2, officers of the [[Massachusetts State Police]] arrested Arvin on pornography-related charges. The police charged Arvin with \"being a lewd person\" and charged both him and a Smith faculty colleague, Edward Spofford, with \"possession of obscene photographs.\" Police said Arvin led them to Spofford and that both implicated other male faculty members. Arvin, they said, admitted \"displaying the photographs at his apartment and swapping them with others.\"<ref>''New York Times'': [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A10FC345A1A7A93C6A91782D85F448685F9& \"2 Smith Teachers Held in Vice Case,\" September 4, 1960], accessed January 5, 2010</ref> Further reports specified that the pictures were of males, later revealed as issues of ''Grecian Guild Pictorial'' and ''Trim: Young America's Favorite Physique Publication'', containing pictures of semi-nude men.<ref name=mcgrath>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/arts/design/24yadd.html Charles McGrath, \"Shadows of Yaddo,\" October 23, 2008], accessed January 5, 2010</ref><ref name=usps>For the finding of the General Counsel's Office of the Post Office Department with respect to these publications, see United States Postal Service: [http://www.usps.com/judicial/1960deci/1-246.htm \"Departmental Decision,\" April 28, 1960], accessed January 6, 2010</ref>\n\nArvin eventually pleaded guilty, paid fines of $1200, and was given a one-year suspended sentence and placed on probation.<ref name=demott/>\n\nSmith College suspended Arvin from teaching, but kept him on half salary until retirement age.

Present day Northwest Territories laid northwest of Rupert's Land, known as the [[North-Western Territory]]. Although not formally part of Rupert's Land, the HBC made regular use of the region as a part of its trading area. The [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] saw the British became the only European power with practical access to the [[North-Western Territory]], with the French surrendering its claim to the Hudson Bay coast.\n\nEuropeans have visited the region for the purposes of [[North American fur trade|fur trading]], and exploration for new trade routes, including the [[Northwest Passage]].

[[Frederick Haultain]], an Ontario lawyer who practised at Fort Macleod from 1884, became its chairman in 1891 and Premier when the Assembly was reorganized in 1897.  The modern provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta were created in 1905.

The position used to be more administrative and governmental, but with the devolution of more powers to the elected assembly since 1967, the position has become symbolic. The Commissioner had full governmental powers until 1980 when the territories were given greater self-government. The Legislative Assembly then began electing a cabinet and ''Government Leader'', later known as the [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]]. Since 1985 the Commissioner no longer chairs meetings of the Executive Council (or cabinet), and the federal government has instructed commissioners to behave like a provincial [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]].

After [[List of Northwest Territories general elections|each general election]], the new Assembly elects the [[List of premiers of the Northwest Territories|Premier]] and the [[Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories|Speaker]] by secret ballot.

Present day Northwest Territories laid northwest of Rupert's Land, known as the [[North-Western Territory]]. Although not formally part of Rupert's Land, the HBC made regular use of the region as a part of its trading area. The [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] saw the British became the only European power with practical access to the [[North-Western Territory]], with the French surrendering its claim to the Hudson Bay coast.\n\nEuropeans have visited the region for the purposes of [[North American fur trade|fur trading]], and exploration for new trade routes, including the [[Northwest Passage]].

This immense region comprised all of today's Canada except British Columbia, early form of [[Manitoba]] (a small square area around [[Winnipeg]]), early forms of present-day Ontario and Quebec (the coast of the [[Great Lakes]], the [[Saint Lawrence River]] valley and the southern third of modern [[Quebec]]), the [[Maritimes]] (Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick), [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], the [[Labrador]] coast, and the [[British Arctic Territories|Arctic Islands]] (except the southern half of [[Baffin Island]]).{{NoteTag|The Arctic Islands remained under direct British claim until 1880.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/101/119-eng.cfm |title=Canadian Heritage \u2013 Northwest Territories |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Northwest Territories Proclamation.jpg|thumb|upright|A proclamation concerning the formation of the North-West Territories, from recently transferred territories to the Canadian government]]\nAfter the 1870 transfer, some of the North-West Territories was whittled away.

By the time British Columbia joined Confederation on July 20, 1871, it had already (1866) been granted the portion of North-Western Territory south of [[60th parallel north|60 degrees north]] and west of [[120th meridian west|120 degrees west]], an area that comprised most of the [[Stickeen Territories]].{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}\n\nAfter the [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885 a North-West Territories Council was created in 1887 for regional government of Canada west of the province of [[Manitoba]]; the Council was reorganized in 1888 as the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories.  [[Frederick Haultain]], an Ontario lawyer who practised at Fort Macleod from 1884, became its chairman in 1891 and Premier when the Assembly was reorganized in 1897.  The modern provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta were created in 1905.

Quebec was also extended northwards in 1898.

Withers stated in interviews that a lot of the songs approved for the album, in particular, two of the first three singles released, were the same songs which were rejected in 1982, hence contributing significantly to the eight-year hiatus between albums.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/> Withers also stated it was frustrating seeing his record label release an album for [[Mr. T]], an actor, when they were preventing him, an actual singer, from releasing his own.

The original release had reached #7 in the UK in early 1978, and the re-release climbed higher to #4.\n\nIn 1987, he received his ninth Grammy Award nomination and on March 2, 1988, his third Grammy for Best Rhythm and Blues Song as songwriter for the re-recording of \"Lean on Me\" by [[Club Nouveau]] on their debut album ''Life, Love and Pain'', released in 1986 on [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\nIn 1996, a portion of his song \"Grandma's Hands\" was sampled in the song \"[[No Diggity]]\" by [[BLACKstreet]], featuring [[Dr. Dre]]. The single went to Number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and sold 1.6&nbsp;million copies and won a Grammy in 1998 for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nWithers contributed two songs to [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s 2004 release ''[[License to Chill]]''.

Palmaccio and Tom Ruff.\n\nOn April 18, 2015, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by [[Stevie Wonder]]. Withers was stunned when he learned he had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \"I see it as an award of attrition,\" he says. \"What few songs I wrote during my brief career, there ain't a genre that somebody didn't record them in.

Withers stated in interviews that a lot of the songs approved for the album, in particular, two of the first three singles released, were the same songs which were rejected in 1982, hence contributing significantly to the eight-year hiatus between albums.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/> Withers also stated it was frustrating seeing his record label release an album for [[Mr. T]], an actor, when they were preventing him, an actual singer, from releasing his own. He toured with [[Jennifer Holliday]] in 1985 to promote what would be his final studio album.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/>\n\nHis disdain for Columbia's A&R executives or \"blaxperts\", as he termed them, trying to exert control over how he should sound if he wanted to sell more albums, played a part in his decision to not record or re-sign to a record label after 1985, effectively ending his performing career, even though remixes of his previously recorded music were released well after his 'retirement'.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\">{{cite magazine|last=Greene |first=Andy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/bill-withers-the-soul-man-who-walked-away-20150414 |title=Bill Withers: The Soul Man Who Walked Away |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph1\">{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/7928784/Bill-Withers-interview.html |title=Bill Withers interview |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/writing/still_bill_the_story_of_bill_withers/ |title=Still Bill: The Story of Bill Withers |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7236327 |title=Songwriter Bill Withers And A Career Cut Short |publisher=NPR |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/08/as-is-2 |title=As Is |magazine=The New Yorker |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref> Finding musical success later in life than most, at 32, he has said he was socialized as a 'regular guy' who had a life before the music, so he did not feel an inherent need to keep recording once he fell out of love with the industry.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/> He has also stated that he does not miss touring and performing live and does not regret leaving music behind.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/><ref name=\"telegraph1\"/> He seemingly no longer suffers from the [[speech impediment]] of [[stuttering]] that affected him during his recording career.<ref name=\"telegraph1\"/>\n\n===Post-Columbia career===\nIn 1988, a new version of \"Lovely Day\" from the 1977 ''Menagerie'' album, entitled \"Lovely Day (Sunshine Mix)\" and [[remix]]ed by [[Ben Liebrand]], reached the [[Top 40|Top 10]] in the United Kingdom, leading to Withers'  performance on the long-running ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' that year. The original release had reached #7 in the UK in early 1978, and the re-release climbed higher to #4.\n\nIn 1987, he received his ninth Grammy Award nomination and on March 2, 1988, his third Grammy for Best Rhythm and Blues Song as songwriter for the re-recording of \"Lean on Me\" by [[Club Nouveau]] on their debut album ''Life, Love and Pain'', released in 1986 on [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\nIn 1996, a portion of his song \"Grandma's Hands\" was sampled in the song \"[[No Diggity]]\" by [[BLACKstreet]], featuring [[Dr. Dre]]. The single went to Number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and sold 1.6&nbsp;million copies and won a Grammy in 1998 for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nWithers contributed two songs to [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s 2004 release ''[[License to Chill]]''. Following the reissues of ''Still Bill'' on January 28, 2003, and ''Just As I Am'' on March 8, 2005, there was speculation of previously unreleased material being issued as a new album.<ref>Mitchell, Gail (October 14, 2005). \"[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61070/withers-in-no-hurry-to-make-new-album Withers In No Hurry To Make New Album]\".

Palmaccio and Tom Ruff.\n\nOn April 18, 2015, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by [[Stevie Wonder]]. Withers was stunned when he learned he had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \"I see it as an award of attrition,\" he says. \"What few songs I wrote during my brief career, there ain't a genre that somebody didn't record them in.
