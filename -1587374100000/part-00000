It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 31 October 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from music critics upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in over 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa co-wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\": [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \"Don't Start Now\" first came about after the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] head at Lipa's record label, Joe Kentish, challenged Kirkpatrick in late 2018 to produce another track for the singer following the success of \"New Rules\".<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9350891/producer-ian-kirkpatrick-interview|title=Producer Ian Kirkpatrick on Chart Success During Quarantine: 'It's a Very Strange Duality'|last=LeDonne|first=Rob|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref> The song was first composed at Ailin's home in [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"SU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ian-kirkpatrick-songwriter-2020.htm|title=Ian Kirkpatrick Interview - Hit Songwriter and Producer|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|website=Songwriter Universe|date=20 February 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Kirkpatrick recalls it being \"a back and forth\" between the [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] sound that Lipa envisioned. Producer J Kash was involved during initial writing sessions.<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\"/>\n\nThe lyrics were written in January 2019 with a \"dance-around-the-room attitude\". Kirkpatrick included the use of a [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] in the first [[Demo (music)|demo]], based on phrasing in the chorus and inspired by music by [[Two Door Cinema Club]].

It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 31 October 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from music critics upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in over 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa co-wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\": [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \"Don't Start Now\" first came about after the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] head at Lipa's record label, Joe Kentish, challenged Kirkpatrick in late 2018 to produce another track for the singer following the success of \"New Rules\".<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9350891/producer-ian-kirkpatrick-interview|title=Producer Ian Kirkpatrick on Chart Success During Quarantine: 'It's a Very Strange Duality'|last=LeDonne|first=Rob|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref> The song was first composed at Ailin's home in [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"SU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ian-kirkpatrick-songwriter-2020.htm|title=Ian Kirkpatrick Interview - Hit Songwriter and Producer|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|website=Songwriter Universe|date=20 February 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Kirkpatrick recalls it being \"a back and forth\" between the [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] sound that Lipa envisioned. Producer J Kash was involved during initial writing sessions.<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\"/>\n\nThe lyrics were written in January 2019 with a \"dance-around-the-room attitude\". Kirkpatrick included the use of a [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] in the first [[Demo (music)|demo]], based on phrasing in the chorus and inspired by music by [[Two Door Cinema Club]].

It joined [[the Football League]] in 1962 after winning the [[Southern Football League]], reaching the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1968. After relegation in 1976, between 1984 and 1986 the club earned successive promotions into the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], and won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1986 Football League Cup Final|1986]]. However, Oxford was unable thereby to enter the 1987 [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] because of the UEFA ban on English clubs in European competitions. Relegation from the top flight in 1988 began an 18-year decline which saw the club relegated to the [[Football Conference|Conference]] in 2006, becoming the first winners of a major trophy to be relegated from the Football League. After four seasons, Oxford returned to League Two in 2010 via the playoffs, and six seasons later achieved promotion to [[League One]], after finishing second in League Two in 2016.\n\n[[Ron Atkinson]] holds the club record for the most overall appearances with 560, [[John Shuker]] holds the record for the most appearances in the Football League with 478 and Ron's late brother [[Graham Atkinson]] holds the record for the most goals scored with 107. In total, nineteen players have made international appearances while playing for the club. United's home ground is the [[Kassam Stadium]] in Oxford and has a capacity of 12,500. United moved to the stadium in 2001 after leaving the [[Manor Ground, Oxford|Manor Ground]], their home for 76 years. [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] are the club's main rivals.\n\n==History==\n{{Split section|History of Oxford United F.C.|date=September 2019}}\n===Headington United===\nOxford United were formed as Headington in 1893,<ref name=\"founded\">{{cite web|last=Brodetsky|first=Martin|last2=Brunt|first2=Heather|last3=Williams|first3=Chris|last4=Crabtree|first4=David|url=http://www.oufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10342,00.html|title=A history of Oxford United Football Club|publisher=Oxford United|accessdate=11 September 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915144006/http://www.oufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10342%2C00.html|archivedate=15 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> adding the suffix United in 1911 after merging with Headington Quarry.

For the next 17 years, the crest was simply the ox's head coloured blue, with various combinations of wording surrounding it.

After relegation in 1976, between 1984 and 1986 the club earned successive promotions into the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], and won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1986 Football League Cup Final|1986]]. However, Oxford was unable thereby to enter the 1987 [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] because of the UEFA ban on English clubs in European competitions. Relegation from the top flight in 1988 began an 18-year decline which saw the club relegated to the [[Football Conference|Conference]] in 2006, becoming the first winners of a major trophy to be relegated from the Football League. After four seasons, Oxford returned to League Two in 2010 via the playoffs, and six seasons later achieved promotion to [[League One]], after finishing second in League Two in 2016.\n\n[[Ron Atkinson]] holds the club record for the most overall appearances with 560, [[John Shuker]] holds the record for the most appearances in the Football League with 478 and Ron's late brother [[Graham Atkinson]] holds the record for the most goals scored with 107. In total, nineteen players have made international appearances while playing for the club. United's home ground is the [[Kassam Stadium]] in Oxford and has a capacity of 12,500. United moved to the stadium in 2001 after leaving the [[Manor Ground, Oxford|Manor Ground]], their home for 76 years.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side.

After a series of 3 trial matches on 27 June both the New Zealand team and Auckland teams were selected. Officials had declared that \"give us fine weather and we will get an attendance of 20,000\". Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: [[Craddock Dufty]], P. Gregory, [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Hec Brisbane]], [[Frank Delgrosso]], [[Jack Kirwan (rugby league)|Jack Kirwan]], [[Bert Laing]], [[Maurice Wetherill]], [[Wilson Hall]], C.

S., & Ryan, R. M. (2011). Glued to games: How video games draw us in and hold us spellbound.

(2011). Game reward systems: gaming experiences and social meanings. Paper presented at the DiGRA 2011 conference: Think Design Play, Hilversum.</ref> Additionally, as badges symbolize one's membership in a group of those who own this particular badge, they also can exert social influences on players and co-players,<ref name=\":6\" /> particularly if they are rare or hard to earn.\n\n=== Leaderboards ===\nLeaderboards rank players according to their relative success, measuring them against a certain success criterion.<ref>Costa, J. P., Wehbe, R. R., Robb, J., & Nacke, L. E. (2013). Time\u2019s Up: Studying Leadboards For Engaging Punctual Behaviour.

(2009). Designing social interfaces: Principles, patterns, and practices for improving the user experience.

However, the motivational potential of leaderboards is mixed. Werbach and Hunter<ref name=\":5\" /> regard them as effective motivators if there are only a few points left to the next level or position, but as demotivators, if players find themselves at the bottom end of the leaderboard. Competition caused by leaderboards can create social pressure to increase the player's level of engagement and can consequently have a constructive effect on participation and learning.<ref>Burguillo, J. C. (2010). Using game theory and Competition-based Learning to stimulate student motivation and performance. Computers & Education, 55(2), 566e575. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.018</nowiki>.</ref> However, these positive effects of competition are more likely if the respective competitors are approximately at the same performance level.<ref>Landers, R.

Unlike the social reference standard of leaderboards, performance graphs are based on an individual reference standard. By graphically displaying the player's performance over a fixed period, they focus on improvements. Motivation theory postulates that this fosters mastery orientation, which is particularly beneficial to learning.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Meaningful stories ===\nMeaningful stories are game design elements that do not relate to the player's performance. The narrative context in which a gamified application can be embedded contextualizes activities and characters in the game and gives them meaning beyond the mere quest for points and achievements.<ref name=\":7\">Kapp, K. M. (2012). The gamification of learning and instruction: Game-based methods and strategies for training and education. San Francisco: Pfeiffer.</ref> A story can be communicated by a game's title (e.g., [[Space Invaders]]) or by complex storylines typical of contemporary role-playing video games (e.g., [[The Elder Scrolls Series]]).<ref name=\":7\" /> Narrative contexts can be oriented towards real, non-game contexts or act as analogies of real-world settings. The latter can enrich boring, barely stimulating contexts, and, consequently, inspire and motivate players particularly if the story is in line with their personal interests.<ref>Nicholson, S. (2015). A RECIPE for meaningful gamification. In T. Reiners, & L. C. Wood (Eds.), Gamification in education and business (pp. 1e20). New York: Springer. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-10208-5_1</nowiki>.</ref> As such, stories are also an important part in gamification applications, as they can alter the meaning of real-world activities by adding a narrative \u2018overlay\u2019, e.g. being hunted by zombies while going for a run.\n\n=== Avatars ===\nAvatars are visual representations of players within the game or gamification environment.<ref name=\":5\" /> Usually, they are chosen or even created by the player.<ref name=\":7\" /> Avatars can be designed quite simply as a mere pictogram, or they can be complexly animated, three- dimensional representations. Their main formal requirement is that they unmistakably identify the players and set them apart from other human or computer-controlled avatars.<ref name=\":5\" /> Avatars allow the players to adopt or create another identity and, in cooperative games, to become part of a community.<ref>Annetta, L. A. (2010). The \"I's\" have it: A framework for serious educational game design. Review of General Psychology, 14(2), 105e112. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/</nowiki> a0018985.</ref>\n\n=== Teammates ===\nTeammates, whether they are other real players or virtual non-player characters, can induce conflict, competition or cooperation.<ref name=\":7\" /> The latter can be fostered particularly by introducing teams, i.e. by creating defined groups of players that work together towards a shared objective.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Applications ==\nGamification has been applied to almost every aspect of life. Examples of gamification in business context include the U.S. Army, which uses [[military simulator]] ''[[America's Army]]'' as a recruitment tool, and [[M&M's]] \"Eye Spy\" [[pretzel]] game, launched in 2013 to amplify the company's pretzel marketing campaign by creating a fun way to \"boost user engagement.\" Another example can be seen in the American education system. Students are ranked in their class based on their earned [[Grading in education|grade-point average]] (GPA), which is comparable to earning a high score in video games.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gamification in education and business|others=Reiners, Torsten,, Wood, Lincoln C.|isbn=9783319102085|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=899000643|last1 = Reiners|first1 = Torsten|last2 = Wood|first2 = Lincoln C.|date = 2014-11-22}}</ref> Students may also receive incentives, such as an honorable mention on the dean's list, the honor roll, and scholarships, which are equivalent to leveling-up a video game character or earning virtual currency or tools that augment game success. \nJob application processes sometimes use gamification as a way to hire employees by assessing their suitability through questionnaires and mini games that simulate the actual work environment of that company.\n\n=== Marketing ===\nGamification has been widely applied in marketing. Over 70% of [[Forbes Global 2000]] companies surveyed in 2013 said they planned to use gamification for the purposes of marketing and customer retention.<ref>{{cite web|last = Van Grove|first = Jennifer|title = Gamification: How Competition Is Reinventing Business, Marketing & Everyday Life|publisher = [[Mashable]]|date = 28 July 2011|url = http://mashable.com/2011/07/28/gamification/|accessdate = 12 February 2013}}</ref> For example, in November, 2011, Australian broadcast and online media partnership [[Yahoo!7]] launched its [[Yahoo!7#Fango mobile app|Fango mobile app]]/SAP, which TV viewers use to interact with shows via techniques like check-ins and badges. Gamification has also been used in customer loyalty programs. In 2010, [[Starbucks]] gave custom [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]] badges to people who checked in at multiple locations, and offered discounts to people who checked in most frequently at an individual store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/07/18/gamification-marketing/|title=HOW TO: Gamify Your Marketing|last=Kleinberg|first=Adam|date=18 July 2011|publisher=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> As a general rule Gamification Marketing or Game Marketing usually falls under four primary categories;\n\n'''1. Brandification ([[in-game advertising]]):''' Messages, images or videos promoting a Brand, Product or Service within a game's visuals components. According to NBCNews game creators [[Electronic Arts]] used \"Madden 09\" and \"Burnout Paradise\" to promote 'in-game' billboards encouraging players to vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27184857/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/ads-obama-campaign-its-game/#.W6HQHpMzafQ|title=Ads for Obama campaign: 'It's in the game'|date=2008-10-14}}</ref>\n\n'''2. Transmedia:''' The result of taking a media property and extending it into a different medium for both promotional and monetisation purposes. [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|Nintendo's \"007: GoldenEye\"]] is a classic example. A video game created to advertise the originally titled movie. In the end, the promotional game brought in more money than the originally titled film.\n\n'''3. Through-the-line (TTL) & Below-the-line (BTL):''' Text above, side or below main game screen (also known as an iFrame) advertising images or text. Example of this would be [[I Love Bees|\"I love Bees\".]]\n\n'''4. Advergames:''' Usually games based-off popular mobile game templates, such as '[[Candy Crush Saga|Candy Crush]]' or '[[Temple Run|Temple Run']]. These games are then recreated via platforms like [[Wix.com|WIX]] with software from the likes of [[Gamify (company)|Gamify]], in order to promote Brands, Products and Services. Usually to encourage engagement, loyalty and product education. These usually involve social leaderboards and rewards that are advertised via social media platforms like Facebook's Top 10 games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2009/10/16/top-facebook-games/#dN8t18tfbiqW}}</ref>\n\nGamification also has been used as a tool for [[customer engagement]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/disciplines/market-research/opinion/businesses-need-to-get-in-the-game/3018554.article|publisher=Marketing Week|title=Businesses need to get in the game|first=Matt|last=Daniels|date=September 23, 2010 }}</ref> and for encouraging desirable website usage behaviour.<ref name=\"sjmn\">{{cite news|work=San Jose Mercury News|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_16401223|title=Get ready for the decade of gamification|first=Chris|last=O'Brien|date=October 24, 2010 }}</ref> Additionally, gamification is applicable to increasing engagement on sites built on [[social network service]]s. For example, in August, 2010, the website builder DevHub announced an increase in the number of users who completed their online tasks from 10% to 80% after adding gamification elements.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=VentureBeat|title=Website builder DevHub gets users hooked by \"gamifying\" its service|date=August 25, 2010|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/08/25/devhub-scores-engagement-increase-by-gamifying-its-web-site-creation-tools/ }}</ref> On the programming [[question-and-answer site]] [[Stack Overflow]] users receive points and/or badges for performing a variety of actions, including spreading links to questions and answers via [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. A large number of different badges are available, and when a user's [[reputation points]] exceed various thresholds, the user gains additional privileges, eventually including moderator privileges.\n\n=== Inspiration ===\nGamification can be used for ideation (structured [[brainstorming]] to produce new ideas). A study at [[MIT Sloan]] found that ideation games helped participants generate more and better ideas, and compared it to gauging the influence of academic papers by the numbers of citations received in subsequent research.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf|publisher=Marketing Science|title=Idea Generation, Creativity, and Incentives|first=Olivier|last=Toubia|date=October 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520204612/http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Health ===\n{{See also|Exergaming}}\nApplications like [[Fitocracy]] and [[QUENTIQ]] (Dacadoo) use gamification to encourage their users to exercise more effectively and improve their overall health.

Based on the design methodology [[user-centered design]], its main goal is to promote greater connectivity and positive behavior change between technological consumers. It has five steps that help computer users connect with other people online to help them accomplish goals and other tasks they need to complete. The 5 steps are: an individual or company has to know their player (their target audience),  identify their mission (their goal), understand human motivation (the personality, desires, and triggers of the target audience), apply mechanics (points, badges, leaderboards, etc.),  and to manage, monitor, and measure the way they are using their mechanics to ensure it is helping them achieve the desired outcome of their goal and that their goal is specific and realistic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uxmag.com/articles/five-steps-to-enterprise-gamification|title=Five Steps to Enterprise Gamification {{!}} UX Magazine|website=uxmag.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Authentication ===\n\nGamification has also been applied to [[authentication]].

P., Wehbe, R. R., Robb, J., & Nacke, L. E. (2013). Time\u2019s Up: Studying Leadboards For Engaging Punctual Behaviour.

However, the motivational potential of leaderboards is mixed. Werbach and Hunter<ref name=\":5\" /> regard them as effective motivators if there are only a few points left to the next level or position, but as demotivators, if players find themselves at the bottom end of the leaderboard. Competition caused by leaderboards can create social pressure to increase the player's level of engagement and can consequently have a constructive effect on participation and learning.<ref>Burguillo, J. C. (2010). Using game theory and Competition-based Learning to stimulate student motivation and performance. Computers & Education, 55(2), 566e575. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.018</nowiki>.</ref> However, these positive effects of competition are more likely if the respective competitors are approximately at the same performance level.<ref>Landers, R.

Unlike the social reference standard of leaderboards, performance graphs are based on an individual reference standard. By graphically displaying the player's performance over a fixed period, they focus on improvements. Motivation theory postulates that this fosters mastery orientation, which is particularly beneficial to learning.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Meaningful stories ===\nMeaningful stories are game design elements that do not relate to the player's performance. The narrative context in which a gamified application can be embedded contextualizes activities and characters in the game and gives them meaning beyond the mere quest for points and achievements.<ref name=\":7\">Kapp, K. M. (2012). The gamification of learning and instruction: Game-based methods and strategies for training and education. San Francisco: Pfeiffer.</ref> A story can be communicated by a game's title (e.g., [[Space Invaders]]) or by complex storylines typical of contemporary role-playing video games (e.g., [[The Elder Scrolls Series]]).<ref name=\":7\" /> Narrative contexts can be oriented towards real, non-game contexts or act as analogies of real-world settings. The latter can enrich boring, barely stimulating contexts, and, consequently, inspire and motivate players particularly if the story is in line with their personal interests.<ref>Nicholson, S. (2015). A RECIPE for meaningful gamification. In T. Reiners, & L. C. Wood (Eds.), Gamification in education and business (pp. 1e20). New York: Springer. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-10208-5_1</nowiki>.</ref> As such, stories are also an important part in gamification applications, as they can alter the meaning of real-world activities by adding a narrative \u2018overlay\u2019, e.g. being hunted by zombies while going for a run.\n\n=== Avatars ===\nAvatars are visual representations of players within the game or gamification environment.<ref name=\":5\" /> Usually, they are chosen or even created by the player.<ref name=\":7\" /> Avatars can be designed quite simply as a mere pictogram, or they can be complexly animated, three- dimensional representations. Their main formal requirement is that they unmistakably identify the players and set them apart from other human or computer-controlled avatars.<ref name=\":5\" /> Avatars allow the players to adopt or create another identity and, in cooperative games, to become part of a community.<ref>Annetta, L. A. (2010). The \"I's\" have it: A framework for serious educational game design. Review of General Psychology, 14(2), 105e112. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/</nowiki> a0018985.</ref>\n\n=== Teammates ===\nTeammates, whether they are other real players or virtual non-player characters, can induce conflict, competition or cooperation.<ref name=\":7\" /> The latter can be fostered particularly by introducing teams, i.e. by creating defined groups of players that work together towards a shared objective.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Applications ==\nGamification has been applied to almost every aspect of life. Examples of gamification in business context include the U.S. Army, which uses [[military simulator]] ''[[America's Army]]'' as a recruitment tool, and [[M&M's]] \"Eye Spy\" [[pretzel]] game, launched in 2013 to amplify the company's pretzel marketing campaign by creating a fun way to \"boost user engagement.\" Another example can be seen in the American education system. Students are ranked in their class based on their earned [[Grading in education|grade-point average]] (GPA), which is comparable to earning a high score in video games.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gamification in education and business|others=Reiners, Torsten,, Wood, Lincoln C.|isbn=9783319102085|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=899000643|last1 = Reiners|first1 = Torsten|last2 = Wood|first2 = Lincoln C.|date = 2014-11-22}}</ref> Students may also receive incentives, such as an honorable mention on the dean's list, the honor roll, and scholarships, which are equivalent to leveling-up a video game character or earning virtual currency or tools that augment game success. \nJob application processes sometimes use gamification as a way to hire employees by assessing their suitability through questionnaires and mini games that simulate the actual work environment of that company.\n\n=== Marketing ===\nGamification has been widely applied in marketing. Over 70% of [[Forbes Global 2000]] companies surveyed in 2013 said they planned to use gamification for the purposes of marketing and customer retention.<ref>{{cite web|last = Van Grove|first = Jennifer|title = Gamification: How Competition Is Reinventing Business, Marketing & Everyday Life|publisher = [[Mashable]]|date = 28 July 2011|url = http://mashable.com/2011/07/28/gamification/|accessdate = 12 February 2013}}</ref> For example, in November, 2011, Australian broadcast and online media partnership [[Yahoo!7]] launched its [[Yahoo!7#Fango mobile app|Fango mobile app]]/SAP, which TV viewers use to interact with shows via techniques like check-ins and badges. Gamification has also been used in customer loyalty programs. In 2010, [[Starbucks]] gave custom [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]] badges to people who checked in at multiple locations, and offered discounts to people who checked in most frequently at an individual store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/07/18/gamification-marketing/|title=HOW TO: Gamify Your Marketing|last=Kleinberg|first=Adam|date=18 July 2011|publisher=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> As a general rule Gamification Marketing or Game Marketing usually falls under four primary categories;\n\n'''1. Brandification ([[in-game advertising]]):''' Messages, images or videos promoting a Brand, Product or Service within a game's visuals components. According to NBCNews game creators [[Electronic Arts]] used \"Madden 09\" and \"Burnout Paradise\" to promote 'in-game' billboards encouraging players to vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27184857/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/ads-obama-campaign-its-game/#.W6HQHpMzafQ|title=Ads for Obama campaign: 'It's in the game'|date=2008-10-14}}</ref>\n\n'''2. Transmedia:''' The result of taking a media property and extending it into a different medium for both promotional and monetisation purposes. [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|Nintendo's \"007: GoldenEye\"]] is a classic example. A video game created to advertise the originally titled movie. In the end, the promotional game brought in more money than the originally titled film.\n\n'''3. Through-the-line (TTL) & Below-the-line (BTL):''' Text above, side or below main game screen (also known as an iFrame) advertising images or text. Example of this would be [[I Love Bees|\"I love Bees\".]]\n\n'''4. Advergames:''' Usually games based-off popular mobile game templates, such as '[[Candy Crush Saga|Candy Crush]]' or '[[Temple Run|Temple Run']]. These games are then recreated via platforms like [[Wix.com|WIX]] with software from the likes of [[Gamify (company)|Gamify]], in order to promote Brands, Products and Services. Usually to encourage engagement, loyalty and product education. These usually involve social leaderboards and rewards that are advertised via social media platforms like Facebook's Top 10 games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2009/10/16/top-facebook-games/#dN8t18tfbiqW}}</ref>\n\nGamification also has been used as a tool for [[customer engagement]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/disciplines/market-research/opinion/businesses-need-to-get-in-the-game/3018554.article|publisher=Marketing Week|title=Businesses need to get in the game|first=Matt|last=Daniels|date=September 23, 2010 }}</ref> and for encouraging desirable website usage behaviour.<ref name=\"sjmn\">{{cite news|work=San Jose Mercury News|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_16401223|title=Get ready for the decade of gamification|first=Chris|last=O'Brien|date=October 24, 2010 }}</ref> Additionally, gamification is applicable to increasing engagement on sites built on [[social network service]]s. For example, in August, 2010, the website builder DevHub announced an increase in the number of users who completed their online tasks from 10% to 80% after adding gamification elements.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=VentureBeat|title=Website builder DevHub gets users hooked by \"gamifying\" its service|date=August 25, 2010|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/08/25/devhub-scores-engagement-increase-by-gamifying-its-web-site-creation-tools/ }}</ref> On the programming [[question-and-answer site]] [[Stack Overflow]] users receive points and/or badges for performing a variety of actions, including spreading links to questions and answers via [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. A large number of different badges are available, and when a user's [[reputation points]] exceed various thresholds, the user gains additional privileges, eventually including moderator privileges.\n\n=== Inspiration ===\nGamification can be used for ideation (structured [[brainstorming]] to produce new ideas). A study at [[MIT Sloan]] found that ideation games helped participants generate more and better ideas, and compared it to gauging the influence of academic papers by the numbers of citations received in subsequent research.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf|publisher=Marketing Science|title=Idea Generation, Creativity, and Incentives|first=Olivier|last=Toubia|date=October 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520204612/http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Health ===\n{{See also|Exergaming}}\nApplications like [[Fitocracy]] and [[QUENTIQ]] (Dacadoo) use gamification to encourage their users to exercise more effectively and improve their overall health. Users are awarded varying numbers of points for activities they perform in their workouts, and gain levels based on points collected.

The 5 steps are: an individual or company has to know their player (their target audience),  identify their mission (their goal), understand human motivation (the personality, desires, and triggers of the target audience), apply mechanics (points, badges, leaderboards, etc.),  and to manage, monitor, and measure the way they are using their mechanics to ensure it is helping them achieve the desired outcome of their goal and that their goal is specific and realistic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uxmag.com/articles/five-steps-to-enterprise-gamification|title=Five Steps to Enterprise Gamification {{!}} UX Magazine|website=uxmag.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Authentication ===\n\nGamification has also been applied to [[authentication]].

In that study the authors conjectured that data may be highly skewed by cohorts of already healthy users, rather than the intended audiences of participants requiring behavioral intervention.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2196/games.5358 | pmid=26821955 | volume=4 | issue=1 | title=Behavioral Economics, Wearable Devices, and Cooperative Games: Results From a Population-Based Intervention to Increase Physical Activity | journal=JMIR Serious Games | pages=e1| year=2016 | last1=Van Mierlo | first1=Trevor | last2=Hyatt | first2=Douglas | last3=Ching | first3=Andrew T. | last4=Fournier | first4=Rachel | last5=Dembo | first5=Ron S. | pmc=4751337 }}</ref>\n\nGame designers like [[Jon Radoff]] and Margaret Robertson have also criticized gamification as excluding elements like storytelling and experiences and using simple reward systems in place of true game mechanics.<ref name=\"radoff.com\">{{cite news|publisher=Radoff.com|title=Gamification|author=Jon Radoff|date=February 16, 2011|url=http://radoff.com/blog/2011/02/16/gamification/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219171239/http://radoff.com/blog/2011/02/16/gamification/|archivedate=February 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"hideandseek.net\">{{cite news|publisher=Hideandseek.net|title=Can't Play Won't Play|author=Margaret Robertson|url=http://www.hideandseek.net:80/cant-play-wont-play|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009223951/http://www.hideandseek.net:80/cant-play-wont-play|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-10-09}}</ref>\n\nGamification practitioners<ref name=\"Zichermann\">{{cite web|url=http://gamification.co/2011/08/10/lies-damned-lies-and-academics/|title=Lies, Damned Lies and Academics|first=Gabe|last=Zichermann|publisher=Gamification.co |date=2011-08-10}}</ref><ref name=\"Herger\">{{cite web|url=http://enterprise-gamification.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18:gamification-is-bullshit-the-academic-tea-party-blog-of-gamification&catid=4:blog&Itemid=251&lang=en|title=Gamification is Bullshit?
