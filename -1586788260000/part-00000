He died in c. 1865 and was buried in [[Yola]] leaving behind his writings both in [[Arabic]] and [[Fulfulde]], and a large scholarly community of his sons, daughters, students and associates.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n==Early life and time in Gwandu==\nModibbo Raji was born in Maratta (in present-day [[Niger|Republic of Niger]]) to Aliyu Ibn Abubakar who had moved from [[Zinder]] to join the community of Usman dan Fodio which was at the time based in Maratta.<ref name=\":0\" /> His mother Rabi\u2019ah was dan Fodio\u2019s cousin.<ref name=\":1\" /> He was taught the [[Quran]] as a little boy by his mother after which he obtained advanced Islamic education under both Usman and Abdullahi Fodio. The latter remained his teacher and mentor until death. The community subsequently moved to [[Degel]] (in present-day [[Sokoto State]], [[Nigeria]]) where Modibbo Raji continued his early education. He was 14 years old at the start of Usman Dan Fodio\u2019s [[Jihad]].\nWith the establishment of Gwandu Emirate, he went to live there under his teacher Abdullahi dan Fodio, who gave him his daughter in marriage.<ref name=\":1\" /> He rose to become a teacher himself in Abdullahi Fodio\u2019s school and a Qadi under Abdullahi\u2019s successor Emir Muhammad (1829-35). He was the deputy or ''Naib'' of Emir Muhammad\u2019s successor Emir Ibrahim Khalil (1835-60).<ref name=\":1\" /> A few years after the death of Abdullahi dan Fodio in 1828, Modibbo Raji was initiated into the Tijjaniyya Islamic sect by [[Omar Saidou Tall|al-Hajj Umar al-Futi]]. However, he initially kept his membership of the sect secret because the Sokoto establishment at the time belonged to the [[Qadiriyya]] sect. He didn\u2019t reveal his allegiance to the Tijjaniyya until he retired from his public roles c. 1848.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Migration to Adamawa==\n[[Image: Sokoto caliphate.png|thumb|Sokoto Caliphate, 19th century]]\nModibbo Raji decided to emigrate during the reign of the Emir Khalil, a decision that may have partly emanated from his initiation into the Tijjaniyya sect.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another possible reason is his increasing disillusionment with what was in his view, the setting of decadence in the Caliphate which he clearly alluded to in his Fulfulde poem ''Alaamaaji Ngirbuki'' (Signs of Collapse).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bobboyi|first=Hamid|title=''Ajami literature and the study of the Sokoto Caliphate.''

On arrival in Yola, Modibbo Raji was warmly welcomed by the emir [[Lamido]] Muhammad Lauwal who sought to discourage him from proceeding to the East. The Lamido granted a piece of land just south of Yola for Modibbo Raji and his companions to settle, a location that has now grown into the settlement of Wuro Modibbo.<ref name=\":2\">Raji, AM.

He therefore remained in the sub-emirate of [[Kalfou, Cameroon|Kalfou]] (in the present-day [[Far North Region, Cameroon|Far North Region]] of [[Cameroon]]) and founded the settlement of Dinawo (religious town) while waiting for the return of peace to Bagirmi to continue his journey.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the 19th century, Muslim scholars commanded large personal following distinct from those of the rulers in whose territory they settled. The town that he had founded in the Kalfou sub-emirate and the community that developed in it were distinct by virtue of their Tijjaniyya inclination. This was a source of worry for the then ruler of Kalfou Lamdo Koiranga who appealed to Lamido Lauwal at Yola for a solution. The Lamido then prevailed on Modibbo Raji to return to Yola after a sojourn of several years in Dinawo.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Return to Yola and death==\nModibbo Raji returned to Yola and was housed near the residence of the head of the Lamido\u2019s palace guards (''Sarkin Dogarai'').

Bello 1842-59) and \nconvey to him our prayer and gratitude - may God increase his greatness and \nsovereignty. Indeed he has brought all of us under his authority through his bounty; \nverily, his Blessings never allowed us to be thirsty or hungry - praise be to God. \n\nNext, I have learnt from numerous reports that the route to the Holy Places is \nimpossible except through association with and befriending the unbelievers and \nobeying their orders all the way from here to the Holy Places. I did not accept \nbargaining with my religion in this manner though a number of the ''Ulama'' have \ndone so. In fact, our Sheikh b. Fodiyo said \"To have association with a ''Kafir'' \n- unbeliever, who is immoral and oppressive, is a sin even if done only outwardly.\" \nBecause of this, I turned to the right-handside and stayed in the land of \nLawal b. Adama.\n</blockquote>\n</poem>\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Abba, I.

He died in c. 1865 and was buried in [[Yola]] leaving behind his writings both in [[Arabic]] and [[Fulfulde]], and a large scholarly community of his sons, daughters, students and associates.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n==Early life and time in Gwandu==\nModibbo Raji was born in Maratta (in present-day [[Niger|Republic of Niger]]) to Aliyu Ibn Abubakar who had moved from [[Zinder]] to join the community of Usman dan Fodio which was at the time based in Maratta.<ref name=\":0\" /> His mother Rabi\u2019ah was dan Fodio\u2019s cousin.<ref name=\":1\" /> He was taught the [[Quran]] as a little boy by his mother after which he obtained advanced Islamic education under both Usman and Abdullahi Fodio. The latter remained his teacher and mentor until death. The community subsequently moved to [[Degel]] (in present-day [[Sokoto State]], [[Nigeria]]) where Modibbo Raji continued his early education. He was 14 years old at the start of Usman Dan Fodio\u2019s [[Jihad]].\nWith the establishment of Gwandu Emirate, he went to live there under his teacher Abdullahi dan Fodio, who gave him his daughter in marriage.<ref name=\":1\" /> He rose to become a teacher himself in Abdullahi Fodio\u2019s school and a Qadi under Abdullahi\u2019s successor Emir Muhammad (1829-35). He was the deputy or ''Naib'' of Emir Muhammad\u2019s successor Emir Ibrahim Khalil (1835-60).<ref name=\":1\" /> A few years after the death of Abdullahi dan Fodio in 1828, Modibbo Raji was initiated into the Tijjaniyya Islamic sect by [[Omar Saidou Tall|al-Hajj Umar al-Futi]]. However, he initially kept his membership of the sect secret because the Sokoto establishment at the time belonged to the [[Qadiriyya]] sect. He didn\u2019t reveal his allegiance to the Tijjaniyya until he retired from his public roles c. 1848.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Migration to Adamawa==\n[[Image: Sokoto caliphate.png|thumb|Sokoto Caliphate, 19th century]]\nModibbo Raji decided to emigrate during the reign of the Emir Khalil, a decision that may have partly emanated from his initiation into the Tijjaniyya sect.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another possible reason is his increasing disillusionment with what was in his view, the setting of decadence in the Caliphate which he clearly alluded to in his Fulfulde poem ''Alaamaaji Ngirbuki'' (Signs of Collapse).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bobboyi|first=Hamid|title=''Ajami literature and the study of the Sokoto Caliphate.''

On arrival in Yola, Modibbo Raji was warmly welcomed by the emir [[Lamido]] Muhammad Lauwal who sought to discourage him from proceeding to the East. The Lamido granted a piece of land just south of Yola for Modibbo Raji and his companions to settle, a location that has now grown into the settlement of Wuro Modibbo.<ref name=\":2\">Raji, AM.

He therefore remained in the sub-emirate of [[Kalfou, Cameroon|Kalfou]] (in the present-day [[Far North Region, Cameroon|Far North Region]] of [[Cameroon]]) and founded the settlement of Dinawo (religious town) while waiting for the return of peace to Bagirmi to continue his journey.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the 19th century, Muslim scholars commanded large personal following distinct from those of the rulers in whose territory they settled. The town that he had founded in the Kalfou sub-emirate and the community that developed in it were distinct by virtue of their Tijjaniyya inclination. This was a source of worry for the then ruler of Kalfou Lamdo Koiranga who appealed to Lamido Lauwal at Yola for a solution. The Lamido then prevailed on Modibbo Raji to return to Yola after a sojourn of several years in Dinawo.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Return to Yola and death==\nModibbo Raji returned to Yola and was housed near the residence of the head of the Lamido\u2019s palace guards (''Sarkin Dogarai'').

We have reached the land of the ''Imam'' Adama peacefully in regard \nto both our religious and worldly affairs, all through your blessing (''baraka''). \nAnd indeed your messenger, the ''emir'' Kassan had exerted himself to fulfill your \nwishes and obey your commands, so much so that he executed all your instructions. \nWe are grateful to you and him. May God place you on the Day of Resurrection \namong the leading or chosen people.\n\nNext, convey our greetings to the ''amir-al-mu'minin'' (Ali b. Bello 1842-59) and \nconvey to him our prayer and gratitude - may God increase his greatness and \nsovereignty. Indeed he has brought all of us under his authority through his bounty; \nverily, his Blessings never allowed us to be thirsty or hungry - praise be to God. \n\nNext, I have learnt from numerous reports that the route to the Holy Places is \nimpossible except through association with and befriending the unbelievers and \nobeying their orders all the way from here to the Holy Places. I did not accept \nbargaining with my religion in this manner though a number of the ''Ulama'' have \ndone so. In fact, our Sheikh b. Fodiyo said \"To have association with a ''Kafir'' \n- unbeliever, who is immoral and oppressive, is a sin even if done only outwardly.\" \nBecause of this, I turned to the right-handside and stayed in the land of \nLawal b. Adama.\n</blockquote>\n</poem>\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Abba, I.
