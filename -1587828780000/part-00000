The phrase \"Good morning, Mr. Briggs...\" was a fixture early in each episode, where a sound or film recording he retrieved detailed the task he must accomplish. However, he was replaced in the show in 1967 after the end of the first season. As one of the few [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] actors working in [[Hollywood]], he made it clear in advance of production that he was not able to work on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] (i.e., sundown Friday to dusk Saturday), and that he would leave the set every Friday before sundown.<ref name=\"NY Times\"/> However, despite Hill's advance warnings, the show's producers were unprepared for his rigid adherence to the Sabbath, and on at least one occasion, Hill left the set while an episode was still in the midst of filming. The producers used a number of ways of reducing the role of Hill's character, Dan Briggs, whereby he would only obtain and hand out the mission details at the start of certain episodes, being unable to take further part in the mission as he was known to people they would encounter (used at least three times), or Briggs would need to don a disguise and another actor would then play his role ''incognito'' until the conclusion of the mission (and episode) when Briggs would peel off a face mask. On other occasions, Briggs was waiting to pick up the team at the end. Usually, [[Martin Landau]]'s character (Rollin Hand) took over as the team leader for missions in Briggs' absence, Landau being initially a \"special guest star\" for the first season, not even included in the show's original opening credits.<ref name=\"NY Times\"/>\n\nAccording to Desilu executive [[Herbert Franklin Solow|Herb Solow]], [[William Shatner]] once burst into his office, claiming \"Steve asked me how many Jews worked on ''Star Trek''. He was recruiting a prayer group of 10 guys to worship together on top of the studio's highest building and only had six Jews so far from ''Mission''. He asked if I would come and bring [[Leonard Nimoy|Nimoy]] and [[Robert Justman|Justman]] and you.\"<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Solow | first1 = H | last2 = Justman | first2 = R | title = Inside Star Trek: The Real Story | page = 99 | publisher = Pocket Books | year = 1996}}.</ref>\n\nHill was briefly suspended from the show near the end of the season, during the production of episode 23, titled \"Action!\" In it, for the only time, [[Barbara Bain]]'s character Cinnamon Carter obtained the mission details through the taped instructions, even though Landau's character, Rollin Hand, then actually ''led'' the team. The suspension was imposed after he refused to climb the rafters via a soundstage staircase as was called for in the script.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 98\u201399}} This incident was ostensibly unrelated to any religious observances of Hill's. Consequently, Hill was written out of that episode and when he returned to ''Mission: Impossible'' for the five remaining episodes of the season, his role was severely reduced.  Hill was not asked to return for season two, and was replaced as the show's star by [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]].{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 60\u201361, 100}} No onscreen explanation was ever given regarding Dan Briggs' later absence from the series.\n\n===Hiatus and return to acting===\nAfter appearing in ''Mission: Impossible'', Hill did no acting work for the following 10 years. Hill had what he calls \"tremendous periods of unemployment\" in his career.<ref name= PCOLSignoff /> \"What we have here is a story of profound instability and impermanence,\" he said of his own career.<ref name = PCOLSignoff /> \"This is what you learn at the beginning in show business; then it gets planted in you forever.\"<ref name=PCOLSignoff/> Hill left acting in 1967 and moved to a Jewish community in [[Rockland County, New York]], where he worked in writing and real estate.<ref name= PCOLTime /> Patrick J. White, in ''The Complete \"Mission: Impossible\" Dossier'', quoted Hill as having said later, \"I don't think an actor should act every single day.

You must have periods when you leave the land fallow, let it revitalize itself.\"<ref name =PCOLTime>{{Citation | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50715F83A590C728DDDAD0894DE484D81 | newspaper = The New Times | title = New Play on Broadway | date = April 14, 1961}}.</ref> After 10 years, he was ready to begin acting again. \"They say you can't quit show business,\" he said in 1977. \"It took 10 years, but I couldn't get it out of my system. So I called an agent and put him to work.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHill returned to work in the 1980s and 1990s, playing parental and authority-figure roles in such films as ''[[Yentl (film)|Yentl]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]]), ''[[Garbo Talks]]'' (1984), [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'', ''[[Heartburn]]'' (1986), ''[[Running on Empty (1988 film)|Running on Empty]]'' (1988), ''[[Billy Bathgate (film)|Billy Bathgate]]'' (1991), and ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'' (1993).

The phrase \"Good morning, Mr. Briggs...\" was a fixture early in each episode, where a sound or film recording he retrieved detailed the task he must accomplish. However, he was replaced in the show in 1967 after the end of the first season. As one of the few [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] actors working in [[Hollywood]], he made it clear in advance of production that he was not able to work on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] (i.e., sundown Friday to dusk Saturday), and that he would leave the set every Friday before sundown.<ref name=\"NY Times\"/> However, despite Hill's advance warnings, the show's producers were unprepared for his rigid adherence to the Sabbath, and on at least one occasion, Hill left the set while an episode was still in the midst of filming. The producers used a number of ways of reducing the role of Hill's character, Dan Briggs, whereby he would only obtain and hand out the mission details at the start of certain episodes, being unable to take further part in the mission as he was known to people they would encounter (used at least three times), or Briggs would need to don a disguise and another actor would then play his role ''incognito'' until the conclusion of the mission (and episode) when Briggs would peel off a face mask. On other occasions, Briggs was waiting to pick up the team at the end. Usually, [[Martin Landau]]'s character (Rollin Hand) took over as the team leader for missions in Briggs' absence, Landau being initially a \"special guest star\" for the first season, not even included in the show's original opening credits.<ref name=\"NY Times\"/>\n\nAccording to Desilu executive [[Herbert Franklin Solow|Herb Solow]], [[William Shatner]] once burst into his office, claiming \"Steve asked me how many Jews worked on ''Star Trek''. He was recruiting a prayer group of 10 guys to worship together on top of the studio's highest building and only had six Jews so far from ''Mission''. He asked if I would come and bring [[Leonard Nimoy|Nimoy]] and [[Robert Justman|Justman]] and you.\"<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Solow | first1 = H | last2 = Justman | first2 = R | title = Inside Star Trek: The Real Story | page = 99 | publisher = Pocket Books | year = 1996}}.</ref>\n\nHill was briefly suspended from the show near the end of the season, during the production of episode 23, titled \"Action!\" In it, for the only time, [[Barbara Bain]]'s character Cinnamon Carter obtained the mission details through the taped instructions, even though Landau's character, Rollin Hand, then actually ''led'' the team. The suspension was imposed after he refused to climb the rafters via a soundstage staircase as was called for in the script.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 98\u201399}} This incident was ostensibly unrelated to any religious observances of Hill's. Consequently, Hill was written out of that episode and when he returned to ''Mission: Impossible'' for the five remaining episodes of the season, his role was severely reduced.  Hill was not asked to return for season two, and was replaced as the show's star by [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]].{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 60\u201361, 100}} No onscreen explanation was ever given regarding Dan Briggs' later absence from the series.\n\n===Hiatus and return to acting===\nAfter appearing in ''Mission: Impossible'', Hill did no acting work for the following 10 years. Hill had what he calls \"tremendous periods of unemployment\" in his career.<ref name= PCOLSignoff /> \"What we have here is a story of profound instability and impermanence,\" he said of his own career.<ref name = PCOLSignoff /> \"This is what you learn at the beginning in show business; then it gets planted in you forever.\"<ref name=PCOLSignoff/> Hill left acting in 1967 and moved to a Jewish community in [[Rockland County, New York]], where he worked in writing and real estate.<ref name= PCOLTime /> Patrick J. White, in ''The Complete \"Mission: Impossible\" Dossier'', quoted Hill as having said later, \"I don't think an actor should act every single day. I don't think it's good for the so-called creative process. You must have periods when you leave the land fallow, let it revitalize itself.\"<ref name =PCOLTime>{{Citation | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50715F83A590C728DDDAD0894DE484D81 | newspaper = The New Times | title = New Play on Broadway | date = April 14, 1961}}.</ref> After 10 years, he was ready to begin acting again. \"They say you can't quit show business,\" he said in 1977. \"It took 10 years, but I couldn't get it out of my system. So I called an agent and put him to work.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHill returned to work in the 1980s and 1990s, playing parental and authority-figure roles in such films as ''[[Yentl (film)|Yentl]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]]), ''[[Garbo Talks]]'' (1984), [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'', ''[[Heartburn]]'' (1986), ''[[Running on Empty (1988 film)|Running on Empty]]'' (1988), ''[[Billy Bathgate (film)|Billy Bathgate]]'' (1991), and ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'' (1993). Hill also appeared as a mob kingpin in ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'' (1986), an action vehicle for [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Hill played New York District Attorney Bower in the 1986 comedy-drama ''[[Legal Eagles]]'', foreshadowing his appearance as Adam Schiff in ''[[Law & Order]]''.<ref name=\"NY Times\"/>\n\n===''Law & Order''===\nHill became best known, and to an even greater degree than from his role in ''Mission: Impossible'', as [[Adam Schiff (Law & Order)|Adam Schiff]] in the [[NBC]] TV drama series ''[[Law & Order]]'', a part that he played for 10 seasons, from 1990 to 2000.

Malaysia Airlines is the [[flag carrier]] of Malaysia and a member of the [[oneworld]] [[airline alliance]]. The company headquarters are located at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. In August 2014, the Malaysian government's sovereign wealth fund [[Khazanah Nasional]]\u2014which then owned 69.37% of the airline\u2014announced its intention to purchase remaining ownership from minority shareholders and de-list the airline from Malaysia's stock exchange, thereby [[Nationalization|renationalising]] the airline.\n\nMalaysia Airlines owns two subsidiary airlines: [[Firefly (airline)|Firefly]] and [[MASwings]]. Firefly operates scheduled flights from its two home bases [[Penang International Airport]] and [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport|Subang International Airport]]. The airline focuses on tertiary cities. MASwings focuses on inter-[[Borneo]] flights. Malaysia Airlines has a freighter fleet operated by sister company [[MASkargo]], which manages freighter flights and aircraft cargo-hold capacity for all Malaysia Airlines' passenger flights.\n\nMalaysia Airlines traces its history to Malayan Airways Limited, which was founded in Singapore in the 1930s and flew its first commercial flight in 1947.

By 1955, Malayan Airways' fleet had grown to include a large number of [[Douglas DC-3]]s, and finally went [[Public limited company|public]] in 1957. Other aircraft operated in the first two decades included the [[C-54 Skymaster|Douglas DC-4 Skymaster]], the [[Vickers Viscount]], the [[Lockheed Constellation|Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation]], the [[Bristol Britannia]], the [[de Havilland Comet 4]] and the [[Fokker F27]].\n\n===1960\u20131972: Rapid expansion, Malaysia-Singapore Airlines===\n[[File:Malaysia-Singapore Airlines B707 at Zurich 1972.jpg|thumb|[[Malaysia-Singapore Airlines]] [[Boeing 707]] at [[Z\u00fcrich-Kloten Airport]] in 1972]]\nOver the next few years, the airline expanded rapidly, boosted by post-war air travel demand when flying became more than a privilege for the rich and famous. By April 1960, the airline was operating Douglas [[DC-3]]s, [[Super Constellation]]s and Viscounts on new routes from [[Singapore]] to [[Hong Kong]], and from [[Kuala Lumpur]] to [[Bangkok]] via [[Penang]]. Flights were also introduced from Singapore to cities on the island of Borneo, including [[Brunei]], [[Jesselton]] (now [[Kota Kinabalu]]), [[Kuching]], [[Sandakan]] and [[Sibu]].\n\nWith the delivery of an 84-seat [[Bristol Britannia]] in 1960, the airline launched its first long-haul international flight, to Hong Kong. When [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], Singapore, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] formed [[Malaysia]] in 1963, the airline's name was changed, from \"Malayan Airways\" to \"Malaysian Airways\" (though still abbreviated to MAL).<ref name=History></ref> MAL also took over [[Borneo Airways]].\n\nIn 1966, following Singapore's separation from the federation, the airline's name was changed again, to [[Malaysia-Singapore Airlines]] (MSA).<ref name=History></ref> The next year saw a rapid expansion in the airline's fleet and routes, including the purchase of MSA's first [[Boeing]] aircraft: the [[Boeing 707]]s, as well as completion of a new high-rise headquarters in Singapore. [[Boeing 737]]s were added to the fleet soon afterwards.\n\n===1972\u20131997: Incorporation and international expansion===\n[[File:Malaysian Airline System Boeing 737-200 Rees-3.jpg|thumb|left|Malaysian Airline System [[Boeing 737-200]] at [[Singapore Changi Airport]] in 1985]]\nThe differing needs of the two shareholders, however, led to the break-up of the airline just 6 years later. The [[Singapore]] government preferred to develop the airline's international routes, while the Malaysian government had no choice but to develop the domestic network first before going regional and eventually international. MSA ceased operations in 1972, with its assets split between two new airlines; Malaysian Airline System (MAS), and [[Singapore Airlines]]. With the Singapore government determined to develop its airlines' international routes, it took the entire fleet of seven [[Boeing 707]]s and five [[Boeing 737]]s, which would allow it to continue servicing its regional and long-haul international routes. Since most of MSA's international routes were flown out of Singapore, the majority of international routes were in the hands of Singapore Airlines. In addition, MSA's headquarters, which was located in Singapore, became the headquarters of that airline.\n\nThe initials MSA were well regarded as an airline icon, and both carriers tried to use them. Malaysian went for MAS by just transposing the last two letters and choosing the name Malaysian Airline System, while Singapore originally proposed the name Mercury Singapore Airlines to keep the MSA initials,<ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19720210.2.124.1.aspx 'Singapore doesn't need the archaic image of Mercury'], ''[[Straits Times]]'', 10 February 1972</ref> but changed its mind and went for SIA instead.

In 1976, after receiving its [[DC-10-30]] aircraft, MAS scheduled flights to Europe, with initial flights from Kuala Lumpur to [[Amsterdam]], [[Paris]] and [[Frankfurt]].\n\nAn economic boom in Malaysia during the 1980s spurred growth of MAS. By the end of the decade, MAS was flying to 47 overseas destinations, including eight European destinations, seven Oceanian destinations, and United States destinations of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Honolulu]]. In 1993, MAS reached [[South America]] when the airline received its [[Boeing 747]] aircraft. MAS became the first airline in Southeast Asia to serve South America via its flights to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. Malaysia Airlines also flew to Mexico City between 1994 and 1998 with [[Freedoms of the air|fifth-freedom rights]] to carry passengers between [[Mexico City]] and [[Los Angeles]], en route to Kuala Lumpur.\n\n===1997\u20132005: Financial struggles===\n[[File:Malaysian Airline System DC-10-30 (9M-MAW 234 46959) (9474599003).jpg|thumb|left|Malaysia Airlines [[DC-10-30]], a backbone for the medium-long haul expansion of the airline from 1976 till 2000]]\nPrior to the [[Asian Financial Crisis]] in 1997, the airline suffered losses of as much as RM 260 million after earning a record-breaking RM333 million profit in the financial year 1996/1997.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The airline then introduced measures to bring its P&L back into the black.

Several weaknesses in airline operations were identified as the causes of the RM1.3 billion loss. The most substantial factor in the losses was [[Aviation fuel|fuel]] costs. For the period, the total fuel cost was RM3.5 billion, representing a 40.4% increase compared to the same period in 2004. Total fuel cost increases comprised RM977.8 million due to higher fuel prices and another RM157.6<ref name=\"losses\"/> million due to additional consumption.

MAS substantially lagged its peers on yield. Some of this gap was due to differences in traffic mix,<ref name=\"BTP1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/content/dam/mas/master/en/pdf/corporate-info/Business%20Turnaround%20Plan%20(BTP%201).pdf |title=Malaysia Airlines Business Turnaround Plan |accessdate=11 February 2011 |publisher=Malaysia Airlines |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714023818/http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/content/dam/mas/master/en/pdf/corporate-info/Business%20Turnaround%20Plan%20%28BTP%201%29.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2011 }}</ref> with less business traffic to and from Malaysia than to and from Singapore, but much of it was due to weaknesses in pricing and revenue management, sales and distribution, brand presence in foreign markets, and alliance base. Moreover, MAS had one of the lowest labour costs per [[available seat miles|available seat kilometres]] (ASK) at US$0.41, compared to other airlines such as [[Cathay Pacific]] and [[Singapore Airlines]] at US$0.59 and US$0.60<ref name=\"BTP1\"/> respectively.

Under the various initiatives, launched together with the Business Turnaround Plan, Malaysia Airlines switched from losses to profitability between 2006 and 2007. When the Business Turnaround Plan came to an end, the airline posted a record profit of RM853 million (US$265 million) in 2007, ending a series of losses since 2005.

MAS pared its domestic routes from 114 to 23, and also cancelled virtually all unprofitable international routes. It also rescheduled all of its flight timings and changed its operations model from [[Point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] services to [[hub and spoke]] services. Additionally, the airline started Project Omega and Project Alpha to improve the company's network and revenue management. Emphasis has been placed on six areas: pricing, revenue management, network scheduling, opening storefronts, low season strategy and distribution management.

The achievement was recognised as the world's best airline-turnaround story in 2007, with Malaysia Airlines being awarded the Phoenix award by Penton Media's [[Air Transport World]].<ref name=\"turnaround_phoenix\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news_business.php?id=311045 |title=Malaysia Airlines Gets ATW's Phoenix Award |accessdate=29 January 2008 |publisher=Bernama Malaysia |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210145309/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news_business.php?id=311045 |archivedate=10 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"toccolours sortable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center\"\n|+ '''Malaysia Airlines financial highlights'''.<ref name=\"finance\">{{cite web|url=http://ir.chartnexus.com/mas/doc/ar/ar2013.pdf |title=2013 Malaysia Airlines Annual Report |accessdate=13 September 2014 |publisher=Malaysia Airlines |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724063456/http://ir.chartnexus.com/mas/doc/ar/ar2013.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2014 }}</ref>\n|-\n!Year ended!!Revenue<br />(RM '000)!!Expenditure<br />(RM '000)!!Profit/(Loss) after tax<br />(RM '000)!!Shareholders fund<br />(RM '000)!![[Earnings per share|EPS]] after tax<br />(cents)\n|-\n|31 March 2002||8,864,385||8,872,391||{{increase}}336,531||2,562,841||{{increase}}38.7\n|-\n|31 March 2003||8,780,820||8,591,157||{{increase}}461,143||3,023,984||{{decrease}}36.8\n|-\n|31 March 2004||11,364,309||11,046,764||{{decrease}}326,079||3,318,732||{{decrease}}26.0\n|-\n|31 December 2005||9,181,338||10,434,634||{{decrease}}(1,251,603)||2,009,857||{{decrease}}(100.2)\n|-\n|31 December 2006||13,407,240||13,641,880||{{increase}}(133,737)||1,873,425||{{increase}}(10.9)\n|-\n|31 December 2007||15,232,741||14,404,400||{{increase}}852,743||3,934,893||{{increase}}58.1\n|-\n|31 December 2008||15,570,141||15,299,234||{{decrease}}271,795||4,119,822|| {{decrease}}14.6\n|-\n|31 December 2009 || 11,605,511 ||12,288,452 ||{{increase}}522,948|| 699,693||{{increase}}25.3\n|-\n|31 December 2010 || 13,585,559|| 13,485,355 || {{Increase}}237,346|| 3,524,166 || {{Increase}}7.2\n|-\n|31 December 2011 || 13,901,421|| 16,485,693 || {{decrease}}(2,521,325)|| 1,042,508 || {{decrease}}(75.5)\n|-\n|31 December 2012 || 13,756,411|| 14,162,738 || {{Decrease}}(430,738)|| 2,123,144 || {{Decrease}}(6.1)\n|-\n|31 December 2013 || 15,121,204|| 16,314,775 || {{decrease}}(1,168,839)|| 4,033,923 || {{decrease}}(8.7)\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Branding===\nFrom the late 1990s until 2007, Malaysia Airlines used the slogan \"Going Beyond Expectations\" to brand itself internationally.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In 2008, the new branding strategy slogan became \"More than just an airline code.

Flying operations started in 1947, with the aircraft bearing the symbol of a winged tiger. A new logo was introduced with the formation of Malaysia-Singapore Airlines in 1966 {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}, featuring the initials of the airline's name, MSA.\n\nIn 1971, MSA split into two airlines, each with its own policies and objectives, leading to the birth of Malaysia's flag carrier, Malaysian Airline System (MAS). The name was chosen because, in abbreviated form, ''MAS'' (as in E'''MAS''') in Malay means gold, to symbolise quality service. A corporate logo based on the [[wau bulan]] (moon kite) was eventually adopted in the following years.\n\nA new corporate logo designed by Dato' Johan Ariff of Johan Design Associates was introduced on 15 October 1987, retaining the essence of the moon kite, now with a sheared swept-back look painted in red (top) and blue (bottom).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jadeay.com/industrial-structural-design|title=Johan Design Associates \u2013 Industrial & Structural Design|publisher=Johan Design Associates|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> Along with the new corporate logo, a new type style \u2013 '''MALAYSIA''', was created. It is italicised to slant parallel with the logo to accentuate speed as well as direction. Within this corporate typestyle, the letters M, A and S bear red clippings to denote the initials of the statutory name of the airline, Malaysian Airline System (MAS). They were added after the original design was rejected by former Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The introduction of blue to the original red logo has national significance. The red and blue divides equally in the middle to denote equilibrium.\n[[File:9M-MXB (15541355595).jpg|thumb|right|Malaysia Airlines [[Boeing 737-800]] sporting the current livery]]\nBeginning 2010, all of Malaysia Airlines' new Airbus A330 and Boeing 737 aircraft sport the new standard airline livery featuring two strips of red and blue emerging from the bottom of the fuselage. The wau bulan on the tail was also refreshed. Although still featuring a sheared swept-back look with its colours in red and blue, its tails have been extended to appear twinned. Moreover, the airline's name on the fuselage is presented in full unlike before and it is entirely blue.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://worldairlinenews.com/2014/07/28/malaysia-airlines-considers-a-new-name-brand-and-livery/|title=Malaysia Airlines considers a new name, brand and livery|work=World Airline News|date=28 July 2014|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the corporate logo of red and blue wau bulan was refreshed. The new wau bulan faces from left to right, as it did in the original 1971 logo, and its tails have been extended. Initially, the airline settled for an all blue wau bulan but it has since reverted it to its red and blue form. The wordmark has also been modernised with a new typeface and the word \"airlines\" is now presented in lowercase.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.campaignasia.com/article/malaysia-airlines-quietly-launches-new-logo/297124|title=Malaysia Airlines quietly launches new logo|work=Campaign Asia|date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref> That same year, the airline also unveiled a new and exclusive livery for its Airbus A380 fleet to highlight the flagship carrier of the airline.

Malaysia Airlines is the [[flag carrier]] of Malaysia and a member of the [[oneworld]] [[airline alliance]]. The company headquarters are located at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. In August 2014, the Malaysian government's sovereign wealth fund [[Khazanah Nasional]]\u2014which then owned 69.37% of the airline\u2014announced its intention to purchase remaining ownership from minority shareholders and de-list the airline from Malaysia's stock exchange, thereby [[Nationalization|renationalising]] the airline.\n\nMalaysia Airlines owns two subsidiary airlines: [[Firefly (airline)|Firefly]] and [[MASwings]]. Firefly operates scheduled flights from its two home bases [[Penang International Airport]] and [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport|Subang International Airport]]. The airline focuses on tertiary cities. MASwings focuses on inter-[[Borneo]] flights. Malaysia Airlines has a freighter fleet operated by sister company [[MASkargo]], which manages freighter flights and aircraft cargo-hold capacity for all Malaysia Airlines' passenger flights.\n\nMalaysia Airlines traces its history to Malayan Airways Limited, which was founded in Singapore in the 1930s and flew its first commercial flight in 1947. It was then renamed as Malaysian Airways after the formation of the [[Malaysia]] in 1963. In 1966, after the [[Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965|separation of Singapore]], the airline was renamed [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore Airlines]] (MSA), before its assets were divided in 1972 to form two separate national airlines\u2014Malaysian Airline System (MAS, since renamed as Malaysia Airlines) and [[Singapore Airlines]].<ref name=\"MAS-Our Story\">{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/content/mas/us/en/corporate-info/our_story/about-us.html|website=malaysiaairlines.com|publisher=Malaysian Airline System|accessdate=28 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717121024/http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/content/mas/us/en/corporate-info/our_story/about-us.html|archive-date=17 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDespite numerous awards from the aviation industry, being crowned 'The World's 5-Star Airline' by [[Skytrax]] multiple times (2009, 2012 and 2013)<ref>{{cite web|title=Corporate Info|url=https://www.malaysiaairlines.com/my/en/corporate-info/awards/2013.html|website=malaysiaairlines.com|publisher=Malaysian Airline System|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> and recognition from the [[World Travel Awards]] as 'Asia's Leading Airline' (2010, 2011 and 2013),<ref name=\"MAS-Our Story\" /> the airline struggled to cut costs to cope with the rise of [[low-cost carrier]]s in the region since the early 2000s.<ref name=\"USA Today-MAS troubles\">{{cite news|last1=Jansen|first1=Bart|title=Hard for Malaysia Airlines to survive after two disasters|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2014/07/17/malaysia-airlines-corporate-background/12781631/|accessdate=28 July 2014|work=USA Today|date=17 July 2014}}</ref> In 2013, the airline initiated a turnaround plan after large losses beginning in 2011 and cut routes to prominent, but unprofitable, long-haul destinations, such as the Americas (Los Angeles and Buenos Aires) and South Africa.<ref name=\"ATW MAS\">{{cite news|last1=Thomas |first1=Geoffrey |title=Malaysia Airlines unveils plan to regain profitability |url=http://atwonline.com/news/malaysia-airlines-unveils-plan-regain-profitability |accessdate=28 July 2014 |date=9 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111150354/http://atwonline.com/airline-finance-data/news/malaysia-airlines-unveils-plan-regain-profitability-1209 |archivedate=11 January 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Malaysia Airlines also began an internal restructuring and intended to sell units such as engineering and pilot training.<ref name=\"ATW MAS\" />\n\n==History==\n{{missing information|section|subsection titles for large paragraph text blocks for easier page navigation|date=October 2019}}\n===1937\u20131941: Wearne's Air Service===\n\nThere were operating services between [[Singapore]], [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Penang]].

By 1955, Malayan Airways' fleet had grown to include a large number of [[Douglas DC-3]]s, and finally went [[Public limited company|public]] in 1957. Other aircraft operated in the first two decades included the [[C-54 Skymaster|Douglas DC-4 Skymaster]], the [[Vickers Viscount]], the [[Lockheed Constellation|Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation]], the [[Bristol Britannia]], the [[de Havilland Comet 4]] and the [[Fokker F27]].\n\n===1960\u20131972: Rapid expansion, Malaysia-Singapore Airlines===\n[[File:Malaysia-Singapore Airlines B707 at Zurich 1972.jpg|thumb|[[Malaysia-Singapore Airlines]] [[Boeing 707]] at [[Z\u00fcrich-Kloten Airport]] in 1972]]\nOver the next few years, the airline expanded rapidly, boosted by post-war air travel demand when flying became more than a privilege for the rich and famous. By April 1960, the airline was operating Douglas [[DC-3]]s, [[Super Constellation]]s and Viscounts on new routes from [[Singapore]] to [[Hong Kong]], and from [[Kuala Lumpur]] to [[Bangkok]] via [[Penang]]. Flights were also introduced from Singapore to cities on the island of Borneo, including [[Brunei]], [[Jesselton]] (now [[Kota Kinabalu]]), [[Kuching]], [[Sandakan]] and [[Sibu]].\n\nWith the delivery of an 84-seat [[Bristol Britannia]] in 1960, the airline launched its first long-haul international flight, to Hong Kong. When [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], Singapore, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] formed [[Malaysia]] in 1963, the airline's name was changed, from \"Malayan Airways\" to \"Malaysian Airways\" (though still abbreviated to MAL).<ref name=History></ref> MAL also took over [[Borneo Airways]].\n\nIn 1966, following Singapore's separation from the federation, the airline's name was changed again, to [[Malaysia-Singapore Airlines]] (MSA).<ref name=History></ref> The next year saw a rapid expansion in the airline's fleet and routes, including the purchase of MSA's first [[Boeing]] aircraft: the [[Boeing 707]]s, as well as completion of a new high-rise headquarters in Singapore. [[Boeing 737]]s were added to the fleet soon afterwards.\n\n===1972\u20131997: Incorporation and international expansion===\n[[File:Malaysian Airline System Boeing 737-200 Rees-3.jpg|thumb|left|Malaysian Airline System [[Boeing 737-200]] at [[Singapore Changi Airport]] in 1985]]\nThe differing needs of the two shareholders, however, led to the break-up of the airline just 6 years later. The [[Singapore]] government preferred to develop the airline's international routes, while the Malaysian government had no choice but to develop the domestic network first before going regional and eventually international. MSA ceased operations in 1972, with its assets split between two new airlines; Malaysian Airline System (MAS), and [[Singapore Airlines]]. With the Singapore government determined to develop its airlines' international routes, it took the entire fleet of seven [[Boeing 707]]s and five [[Boeing 737]]s, which would allow it to continue servicing its regional and long-haul international routes. Since most of MSA's international routes were flown out of Singapore, the majority of international routes were in the hands of Singapore Airlines. In addition, MSA's headquarters, which was located in Singapore, became the headquarters of that airline.\n\nThe initials MSA were well regarded as an airline icon, and both carriers tried to use them. Malaysian went for MAS by just transposing the last two letters and choosing the name Malaysian Airline System, while Singapore originally proposed the name Mercury Singapore Airlines to keep the MSA initials,<ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19720210.2.124.1.aspx 'Singapore doesn't need the archaic image of Mercury'], ''[[Straits Times]]'', 10 February 1972</ref> but changed its mind and went for SIA instead.

In 1976, after receiving its [[DC-10-30]] aircraft, MAS scheduled flights to Europe, with initial flights from Kuala Lumpur to [[Amsterdam]], [[Paris]] and [[Frankfurt]].\n\nAn economic boom in Malaysia during the 1980s spurred growth of MAS. By the end of the decade, MAS was flying to 47 overseas destinations, including eight European destinations, seven Oceanian destinations, and United States destinations of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Honolulu]]. In 1993, MAS reached [[South America]] when the airline received its [[Boeing 747]] aircraft. MAS became the first airline in Southeast Asia to serve South America via its flights to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. Malaysia Airlines also flew to Mexico City between 1994 and 1998 with [[Freedoms of the air|fifth-freedom rights]] to carry passengers between [[Mexico City]] and [[Los Angeles]], en route to Kuala Lumpur.\n\n===1997\u20132005: Financial struggles===\n[[File:Malaysian Airline System DC-10-30 (9M-MAW 234 46959) (9474599003).jpg|thumb|left|Malaysia Airlines [[DC-10-30]], a backbone for the medium-long haul expansion of the airline from 1976 till 2000]]\nPrior to the [[Asian Financial Crisis]] in 1997, the airline suffered losses of as much as RM 260 million after earning a record-breaking RM333 million profit in the financial year 1996/1997.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The airline then introduced measures to bring its P&L back into the black.

Several weaknesses in airline operations were identified as the causes of the RM1.3 billion loss. The most substantial factor in the losses was [[Aviation fuel|fuel]] costs. For the period, the total fuel cost was RM3.5 billion, representing a 40.4% increase compared to the same period in 2004. Total fuel cost increases comprised RM977.8 million due to higher fuel prices and another RM157.6<ref name=\"losses\"/> million due to additional consumption.

MAS substantially lagged its peers on yield. Some of this gap was due to differences in traffic mix,<ref name=\"BTP1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/content/dam/mas/master/en/pdf/corporate-info/Business%20Turnaround%20Plan%20(BTP%201).pdf |title=Malaysia Airlines Business Turnaround Plan |accessdate=11 February 2011 |publisher=Malaysia Airlines |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714023818/http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/content/dam/mas/master/en/pdf/corporate-info/Business%20Turnaround%20Plan%20%28BTP%201%29.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2011 }}</ref> with less business traffic to and from Malaysia than to and from Singapore, but much of it was due to weaknesses in pricing and revenue management, sales and distribution, brand presence in foreign markets, and alliance base. Moreover, MAS had one of the lowest labour costs per [[available seat miles|available seat kilometres]] (ASK) at US$0.41, compared to other airlines such as [[Cathay Pacific]] and [[Singapore Airlines]] at US$0.59 and US$0.60<ref name=\"BTP1\"/> respectively.

Under the various initiatives, launched together with the Business Turnaround Plan, Malaysia Airlines switched from losses to profitability between 2006 and 2007. When the Business Turnaround Plan came to an end, the airline posted a record profit of RM853 million (US$265 million) in 2007, ending a series of losses since 2005.

MAS pared its domestic routes from 114 to 23, and also cancelled virtually all unprofitable international routes. It also rescheduled all of its flight timings and changed its operations model from [[Point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] services to [[hub and spoke]] services. Additionally, the airline started Project Omega and Project Alpha to improve the company's network and revenue management. Emphasis has been placed on six areas: pricing, revenue management, network scheduling, opening storefronts, low season strategy and distribution management.

The achievement was recognised as the world's best airline-turnaround story in 2007, with Malaysia Airlines being awarded the Phoenix award by Penton Media's [[Air Transport World]].<ref name=\"turnaround_phoenix\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news_business.php?id=311045 |title=Malaysia Airlines Gets ATW's Phoenix Award |accessdate=29 January 2008 |publisher=Bernama Malaysia |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210145309/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news_business.php?id=311045 |archivedate=10 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"toccolours sortable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center\"\n|+ '''Malaysia Airlines financial highlights'''.<ref name=\"finance\">{{cite web|url=http://ir.chartnexus.com/mas/doc/ar/ar2013.pdf |title=2013 Malaysia Airlines Annual Report |accessdate=13 September 2014 |publisher=Malaysia Airlines |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724063456/http://ir.chartnexus.com/mas/doc/ar/ar2013.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2014 }}</ref>\n|-\n!Year ended!!Revenue<br />(RM '000)!!Expenditure<br />(RM '000)!!Profit/(Loss) after tax<br />(RM '000)!!Shareholders fund<br />(RM '000)!![[Earnings per share|EPS]] after tax<br />(cents)\n|-\n|31 March 2002||8,864,385||8,872,391||{{increase}}336,531||2,562,841||{{increase}}38.7\n|-\n|31 March 2003||8,780,820||8,591,157||{{increase}}461,143||3,023,984||{{decrease}}36.8\n|-\n|31 March 2004||11,364,309||11,046,764||{{decrease}}326,079||3,318,732||{{decrease}}26.0\n|-\n|31 December 2005||9,181,338||10,434,634||{{decrease}}(1,251,603)||2,009,857||{{decrease}}(100.2)\n|-\n|31 December 2006||13,407,240||13,641,880||{{increase}}(133,737)||1,873,425||{{increase}}(10.9)\n|-\n|31 December 2007||15,232,741||14,404,400||{{increase}}852,743||3,934,893||{{increase}}58.1\n|-\n|31 December 2008||15,570,141||15,299,234||{{decrease}}271,795||4,119,822|| {{decrease}}14.6\n|-\n|31 December 2009 || 11,605,511 ||12,288,452 ||{{increase}}522,948|| 699,693||{{increase}}25.3\n|-\n|31 December 2010 || 13,585,559|| 13,485,355 || {{Increase}}237,346|| 3,524,166 || {{Increase}}7.2\n|-\n|31 December 2011 || 13,901,421|| 16,485,693 || {{decrease}}(2,521,325)|| 1,042,508 || {{decrease}}(75.5)\n|-\n|31 December 2012 || 13,756,411|| 14,162,738 || {{Decrease}}(430,738)|| 2,123,144 || {{Decrease}}(6.1)\n|-\n|31 December 2013 || 15,121,204|| 16,314,775 || {{decrease}}(1,168,839)|| 4,033,923 || {{decrease}}(8.7)\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Branding===\nFrom the late 1990s until 2007, Malaysia Airlines used the slogan \"Going Beyond Expectations\" to brand itself internationally.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In 2008, the new branding strategy slogan became \"More than just an airline code.

Flying operations started in 1947, with the aircraft bearing the symbol of a winged tiger. A new logo was introduced with the formation of Malaysia-Singapore Airlines in 1966 {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}, featuring the initials of the airline's name, MSA.\n\nIn 1971, MSA split into two airlines, each with its own policies and objectives, leading to the birth of Malaysia's flag carrier, Malaysian Airline System (MAS). The name was chosen because, in abbreviated form, ''MAS'' (as in E'''MAS''') in Malay means gold, to symbolise quality service. A corporate logo based on the [[wau bulan]] (moon kite) was eventually adopted in the following years.\n\nA new corporate logo designed by Dato' Johan Ariff of Johan Design Associates was introduced on 15 October 1987, retaining the essence of the moon kite, now with a sheared swept-back look painted in red (top) and blue (bottom).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jadeay.com/industrial-structural-design|title=Johan Design Associates \u2013 Industrial & Structural Design|publisher=Johan Design Associates|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> Along with the new corporate logo, a new type style \u2013 '''MALAYSIA''', was created. It is italicised to slant parallel with the logo to accentuate speed as well as direction. Within this corporate typestyle, the letters M, A and S bear red clippings to denote the initials of the statutory name of the airline, Malaysian Airline System (MAS). They were added after the original design was rejected by former Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The introduction of blue to the original red logo has national significance. The red and blue divides equally in the middle to denote equilibrium.\n[[File:9M-MXB (15541355595).jpg|thumb|right|Malaysia Airlines [[Boeing 737-800]] sporting the current livery]]\nBeginning 2010, all of Malaysia Airlines' new Airbus A330 and Boeing 737 aircraft sport the new standard airline livery featuring two strips of red and blue emerging from the bottom of the fuselage. The wau bulan on the tail was also refreshed. Although still featuring a sheared swept-back look with its colours in red and blue, its tails have been extended to appear twinned. Moreover, the airline's name on the fuselage is presented in full unlike before and it is entirely blue.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://worldairlinenews.com/2014/07/28/malaysia-airlines-considers-a-new-name-brand-and-livery/|title=Malaysia Airlines considers a new name, brand and livery|work=World Airline News|date=28 July 2014|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the corporate logo of red and blue wau bulan was refreshed. The new wau bulan faces from left to right, as it did in the original 1971 logo, and its tails have been extended. Initially, the airline settled for an all blue wau bulan but it has since reverted it to its red and blue form. The wordmark has also been modernised with a new typeface and the word \"airlines\" is now presented in lowercase.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.campaignasia.com/article/malaysia-airlines-quietly-launches-new-logo/297124|title=Malaysia Airlines quietly launches new logo|work=Campaign Asia|date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref> That same year, the airline also unveiled a new and exclusive livery for its Airbus A380 fleet to highlight the flagship carrier of the airline.
