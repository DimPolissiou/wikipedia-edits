He suggested that, \"We should use the same media to remove the misconceptions, misquotations, misinterpretations, and misrepresentations about Islam.\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/> He claimed, [[western power]]s and [[western media|media]] play a double-standard strategy, who describe Muslims as [[extremist]]s and [[fundamentalist]]s to defame Islam.<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/><ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> He said, \"The maximum damage done to the image of Islam today is by the international media which is bombarding misconceptions about it day and night using an array of strategies. International media, be it print, audio, video, or online, use a number of strategies to malign Islam by first picking up the black sheep of the Muslim community, and portraying them as though they are exemplary Muslims.\" Naik also claimed the \"third and fourth\" strategy by international media is \"to pick a word from [[Quran]] or [[sunnah]] and mistranslate it\" and \"to malign Islam by saying something that does not belong to it\".<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nNaik also said, \"If a Muslim woman wears [[hijab]] or veil it is labeled as women subjugation, but if a [[nun]] does to the same it turns into a sign of respect and modesty. A 50-year-old Muslim marrying a 16-year-old girl (willingly) is a headline, but a 50-year-old non-Muslim raping a six-year-old girl appears as brief news or filler. They say Islam does not give [[Women's rights|rights to women]], and is an illogical [[religion]]. They portray Islam as the problem of humanity though it is the solution to all man's problems. The same applies to the misinterpreted words 'fundamentalist' and 'extremist' which are basically western words.<ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> A true Muslim must be an extremist in the correct direction, by being extremely kind, loving, tolerant, honest and just. While [[Indian people|Indians]] were [[Indian independence movement|fighting for their freedom]], the [[British government]] was labelling them as terrorists; same activity, same people, but two different labels. The same happened with Muslims who are labelled as terrorists in media, so we should look into backgrounds and reasons for an activity before labelling people.\" <ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nHe criticizes the portrayal of Muslims in films saying, \"Hundreds of movies were made in [[Hollywood]] to malign the image of Islam that a non-Muslim gets scared when he heard a Muslim saying '[[Allah Akbar]]', thinking that he is going to kill him. If anyone really wants to know how good Islam is, he or she has to study its authentic sources; the glorious [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] rather than looking to its followers ([[Muslim]]s) as is the case with a motorist whose reckless driving should be blamed for an accident rather than the latest [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes car]] he was driving.

There is no book saying 'the Fact of Evolution' \u2013 All the books say ''Theory of Evolution''.\" He further added, \"There is not a single statement in the Qur'an, which Science has proved wrong yet. Hypothesis go against the Qur'an \u2013 theories go against the Qur'an. There is not a single scientific fact, which is mentioned in the Holy Qur'an which goes against established science \u2013 It may go against theory.\"<ref name=\"hp10\" />\n\n===Criticism of media===\nNaik has called the [[mass media|media]] \"the most important tool rather the most dangerous weapon in the world, which converts black into white and a villain into a hero\". He suggested that, \"We should use the same media to remove the misconceptions, misquotations, misinterpretations, and misrepresentations about Islam.\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/> He claimed, [[western power]]s and [[western media|media]] play a double-standard strategy, who describe Muslims as [[extremist]]s and [[fundamentalist]]s to defame Islam.<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/><ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> He said, \"The maximum damage done to the image of Islam today is by the international media which is bombarding misconceptions about it day and night using an array of strategies. International media, be it print, audio, video, or online, use a number of strategies to malign Islam by first picking up the black sheep of the Muslim community, and portraying them as though they are exemplary Muslims.\" Naik also claimed the \"third and fourth\" strategy by international media is \"to pick a word from [[Quran]] or [[sunnah]] and mistranslate it\" and \"to malign Islam by saying something that does not belong to it\".<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nNaik also said, \"If a Muslim woman wears [[hijab]] or veil it is labeled as women subjugation, but if a [[nun]] does to the same it turns into a sign of respect and modesty. A 50-year-old Muslim marrying a 16-year-old girl (willingly) is a headline, but a 50-year-old non-Muslim raping a six-year-old girl appears as brief news or filler. They say Islam does not give [[Women's rights|rights to women]], and is an illogical [[religion]]. They portray Islam as the problem of humanity though it is the solution to all man's problems. The same applies to the misinterpreted words 'fundamentalist' and 'extremist' which are basically western words.<ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> A true Muslim must be an extremist in the correct direction, by being extremely kind, loving, tolerant, honest and just. While [[Indian people|Indians]] were [[Indian independence movement|fighting for their freedom]], the [[British government]] was labelling them as terrorists; same activity, same people, but two different labels. The same happened with Muslims who are labelled as terrorists in media, so we should look into backgrounds and reasons for an activity before labelling people.\" <ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nHe criticizes the portrayal of Muslims in films saying, \"Hundreds of movies were made in [[Hollywood]] to malign the image of Islam that a non-Muslim gets scared when he heard a Muslim saying '[[Allah Akbar]]', thinking that he is going to kill him. If anyone really wants to know how good Islam is, he or she has to study its authentic sources; the glorious [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] rather than looking to its followers ([[Muslim]]s) as is the case with a motorist whose reckless driving should be blamed for an accident rather than the latest [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes car]] he was driving. The best exemplary Muslim is the last and final messenger prophet [[Muhammad]], peace be upon him.\" He also criticized media for \"pick(ing) up Muslims who criticised Islam like [[Salman Rushdie]], and giv(ing) them awards\", saying, \"If a Muslim does something great, they may give him credit but ignore his religion or change his Muslim name like the Aristotle of the East, [[Avicenna]], whose real name was \"Ali Ibn Sina\".\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\n=== Other religions ===\n\n====Apostasy====\nNaik believes that Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|convert from Islam]] should not necessarily receive death sentences, but that under Islamic law those who leave Islam<ref name=\"hp10\" /> and then \"propagate the non-Islamic faith and speak against Islam\" should be put to death.<ref name=\"apostat4\">\n[http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 \"Maldivian renounces Islam, gets attacked by Zakir Naik audience\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827113937/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 |date=27 August 2013}} May 2010.

These comments sparked outrage across Malaysian society, being criticised as inciting racial and religious hatred and disrupting the peace and harmony between communities. By 15 August, four government ministers called for revocation of Zakir Naik's permanent residency and for him to be extradited to India.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/outrage-malaysia-zakir-naik-suggests-chinese-expulsion-190814230715236.html |title=Outrage in Malaysia as Zakir Naik suggests Chinese expulsion |author=Amy Chew |work=Aljazeera |date=15 August 2019 |accessdate=19 August 2019 }}</ref> Citizens lodged a total of 115 police complaints against Naik.<ref name=\"Soo Wern Jun\"/>\n\nOn 16 August, Naik was questioned for about seven hours by the [[Royal Malaysia Police]] at Bukit Aman in Kuala Lumpur about his controversial statements, while PM Mahathir said that \"If he is found to be doing detrimental things to the country, it will be necessary for us to take away his permanent resident status.

The carnival is celebrated during the first week of September, at the peak of the summer heat. As crab is known to be an aphrodisiac, the Carnival also becomes a meeting point for many people.

The carnival is celebrated during the first week of September, at the peak of the summer heat. As crab is known to be an aphrodisiac, the Carnival also becomes a meeting point for many people.

Priest]] and written by [[Mike Baron]], Michael Ahn, and Priest. Each book focuses on a different Green Lantern\u2014Kyle Rayner, Alan Scott, and Hal Jordan, respectively.\n\nPocket has published a series of Justice League of America novels. Of these, ''Exterminators'' by [[Christopher Golden]] includes Hal Jordan as part of the team, and ''Hero's Quest'' by [[Dennis O'Neil]] is a solo Green Lantern story.\n\nAll of these stories have been made into full-cast dramatizations released by [[GraphicAudio]].\n\n==Television==\n\n===Animation===\n\n====''The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure''====\n[[Hal Jordan]] was the featured character in a solo series which was part of ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' (1967) as well as part of the Justice League segments. These would be the character's first animated appearances. [[Gerald Mohr]] is the voice of Green Lantern.\n\n====''Super Friends''====\nIn addition, Hal Jordan's Green Lantern was an occasional supporting character in the various ''[[Super Friends]]'' incarnations: ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'', and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]''. [[Michael Rye]] provided the voice of the Green Lantern for these appearances.\n\n====''Justice League''====\n [[File:Justice league green lantern.jpg|thumb|180px|Model sheets for Green Lantern [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] in ''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited''.]]\n[[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] is a member of the [[Justice League]] in the [[Justice League (TV series)|''Justice League'' animated series]]. In this series, Stewart's ring was initially constrained to permitting him to fly, generating a protective force field, creating walls, and firing energy blasts; this limitation was established as being due to Stewart's mindset, not an inherent limitation of the ring itself (the series' version of Stewart is a former U.S. Marine, not an architect). After being berated by [[Katma Tui]] for his unimaginative use of the ring, Stewart has learned to generate complex tools (to defuse a bomb in one instance) and weapons. (He was also shown to be more creative when transformed into a child in the episode \"Kids Stuff\".) In a development not seen in any other version of the Green Lantern mythos, Stewart's eyes glow green when wearing his charged power ring. The glow fades when the ring runs out of power. The series has been inconsistent about the ring's effectiveness against yellow; Stewart is seen fighting [[Sinestro]] in one episode, and the yellow energy does not prove to be a significant problem for the Lantern, although in a later episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]] threw yellow [[Jell-O]] at him, breaking his force field. Stewart's voice is provided by [[Phil LaMarr]].\n\n====Other DCAU appearances====\n[[File:Return JLU.jpg|frame|Kyle Rayner in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series]]\n*[[Kyle Rayner]] appears as Green Lantern in \"In Brightest Day...\", an episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. This version is recruited by Abin Sur, and fights Jordan's old enemy Sinestro (voiced by [[Ted Levine]]). [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] makes a cameo as the mugger who steals Jimmy Olsen's camera. Rayner is voiced by Michael P. Greco.\n*Rayner is briefly mentioned in one episode of ''Justice League'' and appears as one of the Green Lanterns attending Superman's funeral in \"Hereafter\". He later reappears after the series became ''Justice League Unlimited'' in \"The Return\", bearing a far greater resemblance to his comics counterpart. Rayner's appearance (where he and the Corps unsuccessfully attempted to defend [[Oa]] from [[Amazo]]) finally explains why Stewart is the Green Lantern of Earth; Rayner had been stationed on Oa all along. [[Will Friedle]] provides Rayner's voice in \"The Return\".\n*A character known as Scott Mason / Green Guardsman appears in the two-part ''Justice League'' episode \"Legends\", in which Stewart and several other members travel to a parallel universe. This other universe has its own superhero group, the [[Justice Guild of America]], whose members are modeled on Golden Age versions of the [[Justice Society of America]] characters. Green Guardsman is an homage to the [[Alan Scott|Golden Age Green Lantern]]. His power ring is unable to affect aluminum. The voice of the Green Guardsman is provided by [[William Katt]].\n*The ''Justice League'' version of Stewart appeared in several episodes of ''[[Static Shock]]'', both as a member of the League and in a solo appearance. Phil LaMarr reprises his ''Justice League'' role as Green Lantern, as well as providing the voice for Static.\n[[File:Green Lantern Beyond (Kai-ro).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kai-ro as appeared in ''Batman Beyond''.]]\n*\"[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Three: 2000\u20132001|The Call]]\", a two-part episode of ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', features a future Justice League that includes a Green Lantern who was an eight-year-old Asian child; he later appears as a young adult in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode \"[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]]\". His name was [[Kai-ro]], a tribute to [[Kairo (Superman/Aquaman Hour)|Kairo]], Green Lantern's alien sidekick on ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]''. Kai-ro is voiced by [[Lauren Tom]].\n[[Image:Hal Jordan JLU.jpg|thumb|170px|Hal Jordan in ''Justice League Unlimited''.]]\n*Hal Jordan appears briefly in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode \"The Once and Future Thing, Part 2: Time, Warped\" in which the time-traveling villain Chronos causes the timeline to become unstable, with characters changing or disappearing as their history is altered. At one point, Stewart morphs into Jordan, who aids the other characters for several minutes before changing back into Stewart. Jordan is voiced by [[Adam Baldwin]].\n\n====''Duck Dodgers''====\nOn the animated TV series ''[[Duck Dodgers]]'', the episode entitled \"The Green Loontern\" includes appearances by many members of the Green Lantern Corps. In this episode, a mixup at the dry cleaners results in Dodgers (Daffy Duck) getting Jordan's outfit and ring. Filmmaker and comics fan [[Kevin Smith]] provided the voice of Jordan for this cameo. Other Green Lanterns that appear in this episode are [[Kilowog]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]), [[Katma Tui]] (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]), [[Boodikka]] (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]), [[Ch'p]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), and [[Sinestro]] (voiced by [[John de Lancie]]), as well as nonspeaking appearances by Stewart, Arisia Rrab, G'nort, and Guy Gardner.\n\n====''The Batman''====\nIn the fourth-season finale of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', \"[[The Joining, Part Two|The Joining]]\", the Justice League is introduced. Hal Jordan is included among its members, in a non-speaking cameo. He next appears in the fifth-season episode \"Ring Toss\", voiced by [[Dermot Mulroney]] and again in the 2-part series finale, \"Lost Heroes\".\n\n====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''====\n[[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] appears in multiple episodes of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]. He appears briefly in the pre-title segment of \"Day of the Dark Knight!\", in which he ignores Batman's advice and accidentally frees an imprisoned alien by pouring coffee on him.\n\nIn the episode \"The Eyes of Despero!\", [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Gardner]], [[G'nort]], [[Sinestro]] and [[Mogo]] join forces with the Batman to stop the villain [[Despero]] from using his mental powers to turn the Green Lantern Corps into an army of mind controlled slaves. Other members of the Lantern Corps are seen, including [[Ch'p]], [[Kilowog]], [[Medphyll]], and [[Hal Jordan]]. Jordan later makes a cameo appearance as a member of the original Justice League of America in \"Sidekicks Assemble!\", and is mentioned in \"Darkseid Descending!\" when Guy joins the [[Justice League International]]. A heroic version of Sinestro (clad in a Sinestro Corps uniform) briefly appears \"Deep Cover for Batman!\", where he is shown as one of the superheroes being held captive by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Injustice Syndicate]]. In this series, Hal is voiced by [[Loren Lester]], Sinestro is voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]], G'nort is voiced by [[Alexander Polinsky]], and the Guardians are voiced by [[J. K. Simmons]] and [[Armin Shimerman]]. In the episode \"Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth!\", Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern, appears as a member of the Justice Society of America. The JSA and the new Justice League International are meeting at a mixer on the Watchtower. The JSA is quickly disappointed when they learn they were not meeting the original Justice League which had broken up recently. Things get bad and both teams start fighting each other. Meanwhile, Batman is trying to stop Ra's Al Ghul from firing a fusion rocket into the sun triggering solar flares that will melt the polar ice caps and flood the planet. He sends a distress signal to the Watchtower and the two leagues stop fighting and team up to defeat Ra's. In this episode, he is voiced by [[Corey Burton]].\n\n====''Young Justice''====\nHal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Alan Scott appear in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series. Jordan and Stewart appear as members of the [[Justice League]], while Scott appears as a member of the [[Justice Society]]. Jordan and Stewart make their first appearances in the episode \"Fireworks\", Gardner appears in \"Revelation\" in a cameo to help the Justice League, and Scott appears in the episode \"Humanity\" in a flashback. None of them are voiced except for Stewart, who was voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in the episode \"Failsafe\". In the episode \"Agendas\", Jordan and Stewart were convenes recruitment for the Justice League new members, both Jordan and Stewart immediately dismiss Gardner from the Flash's idea. However, Gardner would be later inducted to the Justice League sometime before the third season.\n\n====''Green Lantern: The Animated Series''====\n[[Hal Jordan]] appears as the main character in ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Josh Keaton]]. Other characters include [[Kilowog]], the [[Guardians of the Universe]], [[Carol Ferris]], [[Salaak]], [[Sayd]], [[Saint Walker]], and Zilius Zox, among others. The main antagonists of the first arc of the show are the [[Red Lantern Corps]], led by [[Atrocitus]], as well as the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]]. [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] appears as a recurring character while [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] is mentioned and [[Alan Scott]] is alluded to.\n\n====''DC Super Hero Girls''====\n*Hal Jordan appears in the web series ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'' as a student at Super Hero High, voiced again by Josh Keaton.\n*[[Jessica Cruz]] is also featured in the series, voiced by Cristina Milizia.\n\n====''Justice League Action''====\nHal Jordan appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', with Josh Keaton reprising his role.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=joshkeaton|author=\ud83d\udd4eJosh\ud83c\udf84hanukKeaton\ud83d\udd4e|number=756242632913723392|date=21 July 2016|title=Glad to be coming back as Hal Jordan on #JusticeLeagueAction #SDCC2016 and joining this incredible cast and crew!}}</ref>\n\n===Live action===\n[[Image:Justice League of America.JPG|thumb|[[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] alongside other members of the JLA, from the failed Justice League pilot.]]\n*Howard Murphy played Green Lantern in the live action ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' TV specials in 1979. The role of Sinestro was played by comedian [[Charlie Callas]].\n*The unsuccessful 1997 pilot for a live-action [[Justice League of America (TV movie)|''Justice League of America'' television series]] included [[Matthew Settle]] as Guy Gardner, although the pilot's Green Lantern uses only the name and costume of the comic book Gardner.\n*[[Alan Scott]] briefly appears in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode \"[[Absolute Justice]]\" which featured the Justice Society of America. He is a superhero in the 1970s and a CEO of an unnamed broadcasting company, who was arrested for fraud by the government in a mission to take down the Justice Society of America. He, like the others, tried to take the blame for all crimes, though he and the rest were never convicted. As the law was now aware of his superhero identity, Scott retired from heroics. In 2010, [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Chloe Sullivan]] find old black-and-white footage of Alan (his power ring is visible on his left hand), along with his criminal record. Very little is said about him, other than that he is the CEO of a broadcasting company, but it was confirmed that he was still alive by [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] and hinted at that he had children. His power ring and Lantern battery are later shown in a display case at the JSA Brownstone, as well as in his portrait in a JSA painting. Alan Scott is played by Doug Pinton. Subsequently, John Stewart and the Green Lantern Corps appear in the comic book continuation of the show.\n*Within the [[Arrowverse]], there are several references and nods to the Green Lantern Corps and its related characters.\n**''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' executive producer [[Marc Guggenheim]] tweeted a photo of [[Ferris Aircraft|Ferris Air]] with the slogan \"We fly without Fear\" as an easter egg of Green Lantern, with the location itself later showing up in the ''Arrow'' spin-off, ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref>[https://twitter.com/mguggenheim/statuses/454344476417605632]</ref> The series' star, [[Stephen Amell]], has talked about seeing Green Lantern in the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=55430 |title=\"ARROW'S\" STEPHEN AMELL TEASES SEASON THREE |publisher=Comic Book Resource |date=September 10, 2014 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref> In the season 4 premiere episode, \"Green Arrow\", an aviator jacket with the name \"Jordan\" appears at a bar where [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] and [[Amanda Waller]] are seen discussing a mission along with a billboard proclaiming \"In brightest day, In blackest night, Come to Coast City, When money's tight\".

Priest]] and written by [[Mike Baron]], Michael Ahn, and Priest. Each book focuses on a different Green Lantern\u2014Kyle Rayner, Alan Scott, and Hal Jordan, respectively.\n\nPocket has published a series of Justice League of America novels. Of these, ''Exterminators'' by [[Christopher Golden]] includes Hal Jordan as part of the team, and ''Hero's Quest'' by [[Dennis O'Neil]] is a solo Green Lantern story.\n\nAll of these stories have been made into full-cast dramatizations released by [[GraphicAudio]].\n\n==Television==\n\n===Animation===\n\n====''The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure''====\n[[Hal Jordan]] was the featured character in a solo series which was part of ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' (1967) as well as part of the Justice League segments. These would be the character's first animated appearances. [[Gerald Mohr]] is the voice of Green Lantern.\n\n====''Super Friends''====\nIn addition, Hal Jordan's Green Lantern was an occasional supporting character in the various ''[[Super Friends]]'' incarnations: ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'', and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]''. [[Michael Rye]] provided the voice of the Green Lantern for these appearances.\n\n====''Justice League''====\n [[File:Justice league green lantern.jpg|thumb|180px|Model sheets for Green Lantern [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] in ''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited''.]]\n[[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] is a member of the [[Justice League]] in the [[Justice League (TV series)|''Justice League'' animated series]]. In this series, Stewart's ring was initially constrained to permitting him to fly, generating a protective force field, creating walls, and firing energy blasts; this limitation was established as being due to Stewart's mindset, not an inherent limitation of the ring itself (the series' version of Stewart is a former U.S. Marine, not an architect). After being berated by [[Katma Tui]] for his unimaginative use of the ring, Stewart has learned to generate complex tools (to defuse a bomb in one instance) and weapons. (He was also shown to be more creative when transformed into a child in the episode \"Kids Stuff\".) In a development not seen in any other version of the Green Lantern mythos, Stewart's eyes glow green when wearing his charged power ring. The glow fades when the ring runs out of power. The series has been inconsistent about the ring's effectiveness against yellow; Stewart is seen fighting [[Sinestro]] in one episode, and the yellow energy does not prove to be a significant problem for the Lantern, although in a later episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]] threw yellow [[Jell-O]] at him, breaking his force field. Stewart's voice is provided by [[Phil LaMarr]].\n\n====Other DCAU appearances====\n[[File:Return JLU.jpg|frame|Kyle Rayner in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series]]\n*[[Kyle Rayner]] appears as Green Lantern in \"In Brightest Day...\", an episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. This version is recruited by Abin Sur, and fights Jordan's old enemy Sinestro (voiced by [[Ted Levine]]). [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] makes a cameo as the mugger who steals Jimmy Olsen's camera. Rayner is voiced by Michael P. Greco.\n*Rayner is briefly mentioned in one episode of ''Justice League'' and appears as one of the Green Lanterns attending Superman's funeral in \"Hereafter\". He later reappears after the series became ''Justice League Unlimited'' in \"The Return\", bearing a far greater resemblance to his comics counterpart. Rayner's appearance (where he and the Corps unsuccessfully attempted to defend [[Oa]] from [[Amazo]]) finally explains why Stewart is the Green Lantern of Earth; Rayner had been stationed on Oa all along. [[Will Friedle]] provides Rayner's voice in \"The Return\".\n*A character known as Scott Mason / Green Guardsman appears in the two-part ''Justice League'' episode \"Legends\", in which Stewart and several other members travel to a parallel universe. This other universe has its own superhero group, the [[Justice Guild of America]], whose members are modeled on Golden Age versions of the [[Justice Society of America]] characters. Green Guardsman is an homage to the [[Alan Scott|Golden Age Green Lantern]]. His power ring is unable to affect aluminum. The voice of the Green Guardsman is provided by [[William Katt]].\n*The ''Justice League'' version of Stewart appeared in several episodes of ''[[Static Shock]]'', both as a member of the League and in a solo appearance. Phil LaMarr reprises his ''Justice League'' role as Green Lantern, as well as providing the voice for Static.\n[[File:Green Lantern Beyond (Kai-ro).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kai-ro as appeared in ''Batman Beyond''.]]\n*\"[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Three: 2000\u20132001|The Call]]\", a two-part episode of ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', features a future Justice League that includes a Green Lantern who was an eight-year-old Asian child; he later appears as a young adult in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode \"[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]]\". His name was [[Kai-ro]], a tribute to [[Kairo (Superman/Aquaman Hour)|Kairo]], Green Lantern's alien sidekick on ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]''. Kai-ro is voiced by [[Lauren Tom]].\n[[Image:Hal Jordan JLU.jpg|thumb|170px|Hal Jordan in ''Justice League Unlimited''.]]\n*Hal Jordan appears briefly in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode \"The Once and Future Thing, Part 2: Time, Warped\" in which the time-traveling villain Chronos causes the timeline to become unstable, with characters changing or disappearing as their history is altered. At one point, Stewart morphs into Jordan, who aids the other characters for several minutes before changing back into Stewart. Jordan is voiced by [[Adam Baldwin]].\n\n====''Duck Dodgers''====\nOn the animated TV series ''[[Duck Dodgers]]'', the episode entitled \"The Green Loontern\" includes appearances by many members of the Green Lantern Corps. In this episode, a mixup at the dry cleaners results in Dodgers (Daffy Duck) getting Jordan's outfit and ring. Filmmaker and comics fan [[Kevin Smith]] provided the voice of Jordan for this cameo. Other Green Lanterns that appear in this episode are [[Kilowog]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]), [[Katma Tui]] (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]), [[Boodikka]] (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]), [[Ch'p]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), and [[Sinestro]] (voiced by [[John de Lancie]]), as well as nonspeaking appearances by Stewart, Arisia Rrab, G'nort, and Guy Gardner.\n\n====''The Batman''====\nIn the fourth-season finale of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', \"[[The Joining, Part Two|The Joining]]\", the Justice League is introduced. Hal Jordan is included among its members, in a non-speaking cameo. He next appears in the fifth-season episode \"Ring Toss\", voiced by [[Dermot Mulroney]] and again in the 2-part series finale, \"Lost Heroes\".\n\n====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''====\n[[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] appears in multiple episodes of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]. He appears briefly in the pre-title segment of \"Day of the Dark Knight!\", in which he ignores Batman's advice and accidentally frees an imprisoned alien by pouring coffee on him.\n\nIn the episode \"The Eyes of Despero!\", [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Gardner]], [[G'nort]], [[Sinestro]] and [[Mogo]] join forces with the Batman to stop the villain [[Despero]] from using his mental powers to turn the Green Lantern Corps into an army of mind controlled slaves. Other members of the Lantern Corps are seen, including [[Ch'p]], [[Kilowog]], [[Medphyll]], and [[Hal Jordan]]. Jordan later makes a cameo appearance as a member of the original Justice League of America in \"Sidekicks Assemble!\", and is mentioned in \"Darkseid Descending!\" when Guy joins the [[Justice League International]]. A heroic version of Sinestro (clad in a Sinestro Corps uniform) briefly appears \"Deep Cover for Batman!\", where he is shown as one of the superheroes being held captive by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Injustice Syndicate]]. In this series, Hal is voiced by [[Loren Lester]], Sinestro is voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]], G'nort is voiced by [[Alexander Polinsky]], and the Guardians are voiced by [[J. K. Simmons]] and [[Armin Shimerman]]. In the episode \"Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth!\", Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern, appears as a member of the Justice Society of America. The JSA and the new Justice League International are meeting at a mixer on the Watchtower. The JSA is quickly disappointed when they learn they were not meeting the original Justice League which had broken up recently. Things get bad and both teams start fighting each other. Meanwhile, Batman is trying to stop Ra's Al Ghul from firing a fusion rocket into the sun triggering solar flares that will melt the polar ice caps and flood the planet. He sends a distress signal to the Watchtower and the two leagues stop fighting and team up to defeat Ra's. In this episode, he is voiced by [[Corey Burton]].\n\n====''Young Justice''====\nHal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Alan Scott appear in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series. Jordan and Stewart appear as members of the [[Justice League]], while Scott appears as a member of the [[Justice Society]]. Jordan and Stewart make their first appearances in the episode \"Fireworks\", Gardner appears in \"Revelation\" in a cameo to help the Justice League, and Scott appears in the episode \"Humanity\" in a flashback. None of them are voiced except for Stewart, who was voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in the episode \"Failsafe\". In the episode \"Agendas\", Jordan and Stewart were convenes recruitment for the Justice League new members, both Jordan and Stewart immediately dismiss Gardner from the Flash's idea. However, Gardner would be later inducted to the Justice League sometime before the third season.\n\n====''Green Lantern: The Animated Series''====\n[[Hal Jordan]] appears as the main character in ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Josh Keaton]]. Other characters include [[Kilowog]], the [[Guardians of the Universe]], [[Carol Ferris]], [[Salaak]], [[Sayd]], [[Saint Walker]], and Zilius Zox, among others. The main antagonists of the first arc of the show are the [[Red Lantern Corps]], led by [[Atrocitus]], as well as the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]]. [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] appears as a recurring character while [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] is mentioned and [[Alan Scott]] is alluded to.\n\n====''DC Super Hero Girls''====\n*Hal Jordan appears in the web series ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'' as a student at Super Hero High, voiced again by Josh Keaton.\n*[[Jessica Cruz]] is also featured in the series, voiced by Cristina Milizia.\n\n====''Justice League Action''====\nHal Jordan appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', with Josh Keaton reprising his role.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=joshkeaton|author=\ud83d\udd4eJosh\ud83c\udf84hanukKeaton\ud83d\udd4e|number=756242632913723392|date=21 July 2016|title=Glad to be coming back as Hal Jordan on #JusticeLeagueAction #SDCC2016 and joining this incredible cast and crew!}}</ref>\n\n===Live action===\n[[Image:Justice League of America.JPG|thumb|[[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] alongside other members of the JLA, from the failed Justice League pilot.]]\n*Howard Murphy played Green Lantern in the live action ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' TV specials in 1979. The role of Sinestro was played by comedian [[Charlie Callas]].\n*The unsuccessful 1997 pilot for a live-action [[Justice League of America (TV movie)|''Justice League of America'' television series]] included [[Matthew Settle]] as Guy Gardner, although the pilot's Green Lantern uses only the name and costume of the comic book Gardner.\n*[[Alan Scott]] briefly appears in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode \"[[Absolute Justice]]\" which featured the Justice Society of America. He is a superhero in the 1970s and a CEO of an unnamed broadcasting company, who was arrested for fraud by the government in a mission to take down the Justice Society of America. He, like the others, tried to take the blame for all crimes, though he and the rest were never convicted. As the law was now aware of his superhero identity, Scott retired from heroics. In 2010, [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Chloe Sullivan]] find old black-and-white footage of Alan (his power ring is visible on his left hand), along with his criminal record. Very little is said about him, other than that he is the CEO of a broadcasting company, but it was confirmed that he was still alive by [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] and hinted at that he had children. His power ring and Lantern battery are later shown in a display case at the JSA Brownstone, as well as in his portrait in a JSA painting. Alan Scott is played by Doug Pinton.
