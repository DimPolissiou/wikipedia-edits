{"title_page": "Danish phonology", "text_new": "{{selfref|For assistance with IPA transcriptions of Danish for Wikipedia articles, see [[Help:IPA/Danish]]. For the transcription system based on the Danish orthography, see [[Dania transcription]].}}\n{{IPA notice}}\n\nThe [[phonology]] of [[Danish language|Danish]] is similar to that of the other closely related [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but it also has distinct features setting it apart. For example, Danish has a [[suprasegmental]] feature known as [[st\u00f8d]] which is a kind of laryngeal phonation that is used phonemically. It also exhibits extensive [[lenition]] of plosives, which is noticeably more common than in the neighboring languages. Because of that and a few other things, spoken Danish is rather hard to understand for Norwegians and Swedes, although they can easily read it.\n\n== Consonants ==\nDanish has at least 17 [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

Long vowels may have [[Danish phonology#St.C3.B8d|st\u00f8d]],{{cn|date=January 2020}} thus making it possible to distinguish 30 different vowels in stressed syllables. However, vowel length and st\u00f8d are most likely features of the syllable rather than of the vowel.\n\nThese [[allophone]]s can be analyzed into 11 distinctive vowels, where allophonic alternation mainly depends on whether the vowel occurs before or after {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Central vowel|Central]]\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{small|unrounded}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{small|rounded}}\n|-\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n|-\n!

It also exhibits extensive [[lenition]] of plosives, which is noticeably more common than in the neighboring languages.

These vowels are shown here in a narrow transcription.\n\n{{IPA|/\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/\u0250/}} occur only in unstressed syllables and thus can only be short. With the exception of {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u028c/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} all stressed vowels may be either long and short, including {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} (only phonetically, it is mostly long though as its phonemic short counterpart is {{IPA|/a/}}). {{IPA|/\u028c/}} is always short, whereas its phonemic long counterpart {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} is mostly long, except before {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} (the short {{IPA|[\u0254\u031d]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/o/}}). Long vowels may have [[Danish phonology#St.C3.B8d|st\u00f8d]],{{cn|date=January 2020}} thus making it possible to distinguish 30 different vowels in stressed syllables. However, vowel length and st\u00f8d are most likely features of the syllable rather than of the vowel.\n\nThese [[allophone]]s can be analyzed into 11 distinctive vowels, where allophonic alternation mainly depends on whether the vowel occurs before or after {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Central vowel|Central]]\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{small|unrounded}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{small|rounded}}\n|-\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Lethal Weapon (franchise)", "text_new": "'''''Lethal Weapon''''' is an American [[buddy cop film|buddy cop]] [[action comedy]] [[media franchise]] created by [[Shane Black]]. It focuses on two [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) detectives, [[Martin Riggs]] and [[Roger Murtaugh]]. The franchise originally consisted of a series of four films released from 1987 and 1998, and later a [[Lethal Weapon (TV series)|television series]] which aired from 2016 to 2019. All four films in the series were directed by [[Richard Donner]] and also share many of the same core cast members, while the television series recast the main roles with younger actors instead. Though the original film was not explicitly a comedy, despite a fair amount of comic relief, the sequels and television series are significantly comedic in nature.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)<!--Do not change the way writers are credit.

Together, they work the case of the alleged suicide of Amanda Hunsaker, daughter of a wealthy businessman who served with Murtaugh in Vietnam. Murtaugh and Riggs soon discover that Hunsaker was involved in a heroin-smuggling scheme led by a retired general ([[Mitchell Ryan]]) and his lead enforcer ([[Gary Busey]]).\n\n===''Lethal Weapon 2'' (1989)===\n{{main|Lethal Weapon 2}}\n\nDuring a car chase, Riggs and Murtaugh stumble upon a trunk full of smuggled South African [[Krugerrand]]s. This sparks a series of attempts at their lives, forcing them to take a less dangerous case, protecting Leo Getz ([[Joe Pesci]]), a loud-mouthed [[whistleblower]] with whom they gradually bond and befriend. However, they realize that Getz was involved in the same South African illegal activities. As a result, the three men become entangled in a drug-smuggling operation involving South African diplomats in Los Angeles, using their immunity and biting wit as a shield. Riggs kills the murderer of his wife who is among the criminals.\n\n===''Lethal Weapon 3'' (1992)===\n{{main|Lethal Weapon 3}}\n\nAs Murtaugh, who is one week from retiring, and Riggs investigate a robbery committed using a duplicate [[armored car (valuables)|armored car]], they find themselves in the middle of an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] investigation led by Sergeant Lorna Cole ([[Rene Russo]]). With assistance from Leo, they learn that the subject of the investigation is a rogue [[AWOL]] cop ([[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]]) who is stealing impounded weapons and selling them on the black market. During the investigation, Murtaugh shoots and kills a teenager who attacks him and Riggs; he turns out to be a friend of his own son. This prompts Murtaugh to capture the man responsible for the distribution of illegal firearms and to rethink his retirement.\n\n===''Lethal Weapon 4'' (1998)===\n{{main|Lethal Weapon 4}}\n\nWhile Lorna and Murtaugh's daughter Rianne are both pregnant, Riggs and Murtaugh once again team up with Leo as well as rookie Detective Lee Butters ([[Chris Rock]]) to investigate a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrant smuggling ring. Wah Sing Ku ([[Jet Li]]) is a ruthless enforcer who personally attempts to murder Murtaugh's family by burning them alive in their own home. As the story progresses, Murtaugh discovers that Lee is the father of his daughter's unborn child. The two slay dozens of Chinese gangsters and ultimately manage to catch up with the boss of the smuggling ring. Riggs and Lorna are married at the end of the film as their child is born.\n\n=== ''Lethal Finale'' (TBA)===\n\nThere has been talk of a fifth ''Lethal Weapon'' film, although both [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Danny Glover]] have expressed a lack of interest. In 2007, Moviehole.net received word from sources that [[Warner Bros.]] were in the early stages of trying to relaunch the ''Lethal Weapon'' series sometime in 2009 or later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070806_will_lethal_weapon_be_reloaded.html|title=Will ''Lethal Weapon'' be reloaded?|last=Kegar|first=Kirby|date=August 6, 2007|work=Moviehole|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225300/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070806_will_lethal_weapon_be_reloaded.html|archive-date=September 26, 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref> A spec script treatment was written by [[Shane Black]] and [[Chuck Mondry]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=47707|title=Gibson and Glover Up for Lethal Weapon 5?|date=August 6, 2008|work=[[CraveOnline|ComingSoon.net]]|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.joblo.com/movie-news/shane-black-on-the-nice-guys-buddy-comedies-lethal-weapon-predator-more-321&order=asc?id=shane-black-on-the-nice-guys-buddy-comedies-lethal-weapon-predator-more-321&order=popular|title=Shane Black on The Nice Guys, buddy comedies, Lethal Weapon, Predator & more|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en-US}}</ref> leading to rumors that the sequel was on fast track by [[Warner Bros.]] with Black in the director's chair. In November 2017, Mel Gibson hinted that a fifth movie might happen and that he, Richard Donner, and Danny Glover have discussed the idea to return. In December 2017, Donner confirmed in an interview on the Spocklight podcast that Gibson and Glover have agreed to return as Riggs and Murtaugh respectively and that he has a story all set. The only obstacle is Warner Bros. Pictures greenlighting the film. Donner has recruited Channing Gibson, the original screenwriter from the fourth film, to begin writing the script. The story will take place in present day (setting the characters of Murtaugh and Riggs in their mid-seventies and sixties, respectively) and is intended to be the final film in the series. In February 2018, Donner revealed the film's official title to be ''Lethal Finale''; while also stating that the film is being held up by the production company.<ref>https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/919259-donner-reveals-lethal-weapon-5-title-but-is-doubtful-it-will-happen</ref> In January 2020, ''Lethal Weapon 5'' was confirmed to be in active development, with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover confirmed to return, and [[Richard Donner]] returning to direct.<ref>https://popculture.com/movies/2020/01/28/lethal-weapon-5-mel-gibson-danny-glover-set-to-return/</ref>\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n!

It focuses on two [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) detectives, [[Martin Riggs]] and [[Roger Murtaugh]]. The franchise originally consisted of a series of four films released from 1987 and 1998, and later a [[Lethal Weapon (TV series)|television series]] which aired from 2016 to 2019. All four films in the series were directed by [[Richard Donner]] and also share many of the same core cast members, while the television series recast the main roles with younger actors instead. Though the original film was not explicitly a comedy, despite a fair amount of comic relief, the sequels and television series are significantly comedic in nature.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)<!--Do not change the way writers are credit.

Together, they work the case of the alleged suicide of Amanda Hunsaker, daughter of a wealthy businessman who served with Murtaugh in Vietnam. Murtaugh and Riggs soon discover that Hunsaker was involved in a heroin-smuggling scheme led by a retired general ([[Mitchell Ryan]]) and his lead enforcer ([[Gary Busey]]).\n\n===''Lethal Weapon 2'' (1989)===\n{{main|Lethal Weapon 2}}\n\nDuring a car chase, Riggs and Murtaugh stumble upon a trunk full of smuggled South African [[Krugerrand]]s. This sparks a series of attempts at their lives, forcing them to take a less dangerous case, protecting Leo Getz ([[Joe Pesci]]), a loud-mouthed [[whistleblower]] with whom they gradually bond and befriend. However, they realize that Getz was involved in the same South African illegal activities. As a result, the three men become entangled in a drug-smuggling operation involving South African diplomats in Los Angeles, using their immunity and biting wit as a shield. Riggs kills the murderer of his wife who is among the criminals.\n\n===''Lethal Weapon 3'' (1992)===\n{{main|Lethal Weapon 3}}\n\nAs Murtaugh, who is one week from retiring, and Riggs investigate a robbery committed using a duplicate [[armored car (valuables)|armored car]], they find themselves in the middle of an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] investigation led by Sergeant Lorna Cole ([[Rene Russo]]). With assistance from Leo, they learn that the subject of the investigation is a rogue [[AWOL]] cop ([[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]]) who is stealing impounded weapons and selling them on the black market. During the investigation, Murtaugh shoots and kills a teenager who attacks him and Riggs; he turns out to be a friend of his own son. This prompts Murtaugh to capture the man responsible for the distribution of illegal firearms and to rethink his retirement.\n\n===''Lethal Weapon 4'' (1998)===\n{{main|Lethal Weapon 4}}\n\nWhile Lorna and Murtaugh's daughter Rianne are both pregnant, Riggs and Murtaugh once again team up with Leo as well as rookie Detective Lee Butters ([[Chris Rock]]) to investigate a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrant smuggling ring. Wah Sing Ku ([[Jet Li]]) is a ruthless enforcer who personally attempts to murder Murtaugh's family by burning them alive in their own home. As the story progresses, Murtaugh discovers that Lee is the father of his daughter's unborn child. The two slay dozens of Chinese gangsters and ultimately manage to catch up with the boss of the smuggling ring. Riggs and Lorna are married at the end of the film as their child is born.\n\n=== ''Lethal Finale'' (TBA)===\n\nThere has been talk of a fifth ''Lethal Weapon'' film, although both [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Danny Glover]] have expressed a lack of interest. In 2007, Moviehole.net received word from sources that [[Warner Bros.]] were in the early stages of trying to relaunch the ''Lethal Weapon'' series sometime in 2009 or later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070806_will_lethal_weapon_be_reloaded.html|title=Will ''Lethal Weapon'' be reloaded?|last=Kegar|first=Kirby|date=August 6, 2007|work=Moviehole|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225300/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070806_will_lethal_weapon_be_reloaded.html|archive-date=September 26, 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref> A spec script treatment was written by [[Shane Black]] and [[Chuck Mondry]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=47707|title=Gibson and Glover Up for Lethal Weapon 5?|date=August 6, 2008|work=[[CraveOnline|ComingSoon.net]]|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.joblo.com/movie-news/shane-black-on-the-nice-guys-buddy-comedies-lethal-weapon-predator-more-321&order=asc?id=shane-black-on-the-nice-guys-buddy-comedies-lethal-weapon-predator-more-321&order=popular|title=Shane Black on The Nice Guys, buddy comedies, Lethal Weapon, Predator & more|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en-US}}</ref> leading to rumors that the sequel was on fast track by [[Warner Bros.]] with Black in the director's chair. In November 2017, Mel Gibson hinted that a fifth movie might happen and that he, Richard Donner, and Danny Glover have discussed the idea to return. In December 2017, Donner confirmed in an interview on the Spocklight podcast that Gibson and Glover have agreed to return as Riggs and Murtaugh respectively and that he has a story all set. The only obstacle is Warner Bros. Pictures greenlighting the film. Donner has recruited Channing Gibson, the original screenwriter from the fourth film, to begin writing the script. The story will take place in present day (setting the characters of Murtaugh and Riggs in their mid-seventies and sixties, respectively) and is intended to be the final film in the series.

''It's Academic'' programs have notably aired on [[NBC]]-owned [[WRC-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[NBC]] affiliate [[WVIR]] in [[Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]], and [[CBS]]-owned [[WJZ-TV]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].\n\nThe Washington, D.C. version of the show has been on the air since October 7, 1961, and is recognized by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the longest-running quiz program in TV history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itsacademicquizshow.com/|title=It's Academic|publisher=}}</ref> The program was created for WRC by Sophie Altman, who continued as executive producer until her death on May 24, 2008. [[Mac McGarry]] hosted the Washington shows from the beginning until June 25, 2011. [[Hillary Howard]], a news anchor for Washington radio station [[WTOP-FM]], took over as host subsequent to McGarry's official retirement in November 2011.<ref>http://wtop.com/?nid=41&sid=2617677</ref> The Baltimore show is hosted by David Zahren. The show features three local high school teams of three players each. Over the years, chief sponsor [[Giant-Landover|Giant Food]] has given more than $2,000,000 in scholarship funds to participating schools. In 2014, [[James Hubert Blake High School]] became the first ever school to win three consecutive super bowls in the Washington edition of ''It's Academic''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesentinel.com/mont/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=668:blake-high-school-sets-an-academic-record&Itemid=766|title=Blake High School sets an academic record|date=10 Jul 2014|first=Bonnie|last=Katz|website=The Sentinel|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe single-elimination tournament features 81 schools in the [[Washington, D.C. metropolitan area]], 81 schools in the [[Baltimore metropolitan area]] (including Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore), and 9 schools in the Central Virginia region. The winners in each region go on to battle each other in the Super Bowl.\n\nEach contest is composed of five rounds. Round 1 is a category round with eight themed questions (e.g. \"the letter B\" or \"famous paintings\"). Questions do not appear on the players' monitors but do appear for the home viewers. Each team is given 100 points before this round and teams receive 10 points for each correct answer and lose 10 for each incorrect answer.\n\nIn Round 2, each team is individually asked five questions and receive 20 points each for a correct answer, but do not lose points for an incorrect answer.\n\nRound 3 is a toss-up visual round. The monitor displays an image and the host provides a question accompanying the image. Teams receive 20 points for each correct answer and lose 20 for each incorrect answer (10 until April 19, 2014 in Washington, Baltimore, and starting with the 2014 season in Charlottesville; other cities' visual rounds are still 10 points up or down). Eight questions are used. The fourth question is always a math question.\n\nBefore Round 4 the captain of each team introduces the sponsors and school administrators and coaches. Teams then select from three question packets. The team to the immediate left of the team that is supposed to answer chooses which packet the answering team will use. Eight questions are given to each team, with 20 points for a correct answer and no penalties. A 25-point bonus is given if a team correctly answers all eight questions, for a total of 185 points in this round. The fourth question is always a science question and the seventh question is always a math question (data from both those questions are displayed on the monitor or team's screen).\n\nRound 5 features quick-fire toss-up questions, each worth +/-20 points. Visual questions are worth +/-30 points. The number of questions varies depending on the time left in the game. The game ends when the buzzer sounds, home viewers may realize that the game will come to a close while the countdown clock appears on the television screen. If a team has buzzed in prior the buzzer sounding, the team is required to answer the question before the game is considered over. If there is a tie in the knockout round (e.g. the final), the presenter may ask one last tie-breaker question to determine the winner.\n\nAfter the host has announced the teams' final scores, the studio audience is invited down from the stands to join the contestants on camera during the closing credit sequence. In the Washington version from about 1976 to June 2017, the song heard under the credit roll (if there are no musicians from any of the competing schools) was \"T.L.C. (Tender Loving Care)\" by the band [[MFSB]] (a new theme was introduced in Washington for the 2017\u201318 season, entitled \"Just Let Go\", by Marti Amado and Ron Bolton, which is used throughout the show).\n\n===Discontinued rounds===\nPrior to the adoption of the current format, there were several other formats of play.\n\n====Category round====\nThe \"very fast\"<ref name=\"washington-1983\">[[WRC-TV]] (Washington) in association with Altman Productions. 23rd season premiere. ''It's Academic''. Presented by [[Mac McGarry]]. Featuring Churchill, Mount Vernon and Northwestern. Original airdate 1983-09-25.</ref> category round consisted of questions pertaining to the same category. In some cases, the question was the same throughout the round:  teams were given different items, and had to answer the common question on the basis of each item (e.g., given a state, name either senator from that state<ref name=\"buffalo-1979\">[[WIVB-TV]] (Buffalo) in association with Altman Productions. 1978\u201379 championship. ''It's Academic''  Presented by [[Van Miller]]. Featuring Grand Island, Iroquois, and Jamestown. Original airdate 1979.</ref>). In other cases, all the answers in the category round shared an announced characteristic in common (e.g., geographical locations whose names begin and end with \"A\"<ref name=\"washington-1983\" />). Teams used their buzzers in this round, earning 10 points for a correct answer, but losing 10 points<ref name=\"buffalo-1979\" /> (later 20 points<ref name=\"washington-1983\" />) for wrong answers.\n\n====Timed round====\nIn all forms, a team individually answers questions from a packet within a time limit. In one form, at the beginning of the game, teams get one minute to answer questions for 20 points each. In this form, teams are not penalized for wrong answers, in order to help the teams in \"building score\".<ref name=\"buffalo-1981\">[[WIVB-TV]] (Buffalo) in association with Altman Productions. ''It's Academic'' Presented by [[Van Miller]]. Featuring Williamsville East, Bishop Timon, and Salamanca Central. Original airdate 1981.</ref> In another form, teams have one and a half minutes to answer questions for 20 points each. However, 20 points are deducted for a wrong answer. Teams may pass a question, losing 10 points; however, the other two teams may buzz-in to answer the passed questions (with a few exceptions) for plus or minus 20 points after the time runs out for the team's turn. Every question that is fully read must be answered or passed within a reasonable time. However, if a question is not finished when time expires, the team may reject it without penalty or answer the question at their own risk. In this form, getting all 10 questions (later 8) correct originally earned the team a 50-point bonus, later reduced to 25.<ref name=\"washington-1983\" /><ref name=\"buffalo-1981\" /><ref name=\"central-virginia-1988\">Altman Productions.

Teams were instructed to \"use [their] lights and buzzers\" for a \"one-minute scrimmage round.\" 10 points were scored for a correct answer, with no penalties.<ref name=\"buffalo-1978\">[[WIVB-TV]] (Buffalo) in association with Altman Productions. 1977\u201378 championship.

''It's Academic'' programs have notably aired on [[NBC]]-owned [[WRC-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[NBC]] affiliate [[WVIR]] in [[Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]], and [[CBS]]-owned [[WJZ-TV]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].\n\nThe Washington, D.C. version of the show has been on the air since October 7, 1961, and is recognized by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the longest-running quiz program in TV history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itsacademicquizshow.com/|title=It's Academic|publisher=}}</ref> The program was created for WRC by Sophie Altman, who continued as executive producer until her death on May 24, 2008. [[Mac McGarry]] hosted the Washington shows from the beginning until June 25, 2011. [[Hillary Howard]], a news anchor for Washington radio station [[WTOP-FM]], took over as host subsequent to McGarry's official retirement in November 2011.<ref>http://wtop.com/?nid=41&sid=2617677</ref> The Baltimore show is hosted by David Zahren. The show features three local high school teams of three players each. Over the years, chief sponsor [[Giant-Landover|Giant Food]] has given more than $2,000,000 in scholarship funds to participating schools. In 2014, [[James Hubert Blake High School]] became the first ever school to win three consecutive super bowls in the Washington edition of ''It's Academic''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesentinel.com/mont/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=668:blake-high-school-sets-an-academic-record&Itemid=766|title=Blake High School sets an academic record|date=10 Jul 2014|first=Bonnie|last=Katz|website=The Sentinel|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe single-elimination tournament features 81 schools in the [[Washington, D.C. metropolitan area]], 81 schools in the [[Baltimore metropolitan area]] (including Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore), and 9 schools in the Central Virginia region. The winners in each region go on to battle each other in the Super Bowl.\n\nEach contest is composed of five rounds. Round 1 is a category round with eight themed questions (e.g. \"the letter B\" or \"famous paintings\"). Questions do not appear on the players' monitors but do appear for the home viewers. Each team is given 100 points before this round and teams receive 10 points for each correct answer and lose 10 for each incorrect answer.\n\nIn Round 2, each team is individually asked five questions and receive 20 points each for a correct answer, but do not lose points for an incorrect answer.\n\nRound 3 is a toss-up visual round. The monitor displays an image and the host provides a question accompanying the image. Teams receive 20 points for each correct answer and lose 20 for each incorrect answer (10 until April 19, 2014 in Washington, Baltimore, and starting with the 2014 season in Charlottesville; other cities' visual rounds are still 10 points up or down). Eight questions are used. The fourth question is always a math question.\n\nBefore Round 4 the captain of each team introduces the sponsors and school administrators and coaches. Teams then select from three question packets. The team to the immediate left of the team that is supposed to answer chooses which packet the answering team will use. Eight questions are given to each team, with 20 points for a correct answer and no penalties. A 25-point bonus is given if a team correctly answers all eight questions, for a total of 185 points in this round. The fourth question is always a science question and the seventh question is always a math question (data from both those questions are displayed on the monitor or team's screen).\n\nRound 5 features quick-fire toss-up questions, each worth +/-20 points. Visual questions are worth +/-30 points. The number of questions varies depending on the time left in the game. The game ends when the buzzer sounds, home viewers may realize that the game will come to a close while the countdown clock appears on the television screen. If a team has buzzed in prior the buzzer sounding, the team is required to answer the question before the game is considered over. If there is a tie in the knockout round (e.g. the final), the presenter may ask one last tie-breaker question to determine the winner.\n\nAfter the host has announced the teams' final scores, the studio audience is invited down from the stands to join the contestants on camera during the closing credit sequence. In the Washington version from about 1976 to June 2017, the song heard under the credit roll (if there are no musicians from any of the competing schools) was \"T.L.C. (Tender Loving Care)\" by the band [[MFSB]] (a new theme was introduced in Washington for the 2017-18 season, entitled \"Just Let Go\", by Marti Amado and Ron Bolton, which is used throughout the show).\n\n===Discontinued rounds===\nPrior to the adoption of the current format, there were several other formats of play.\n\n====Category round====\nThe \"very fast\"<ref name=\"washington-1983\">[[WRC-TV]] (Washington) in association with Altman Productions. 23rd season premiere.

In some cases, the question was the same throughout the round:  teams were given different items, and had to answer the common question on the basis of each item (e.g., given a state, name either senator from that state<ref name=\"buffalo-1979\">[[WIVB-TV]] (Buffalo) in association with Altman Productions. 1978\u201379 championship. ''It's Academic''  Presented by [[Van Miller]]. Featuring Grand Island, Iroquois, and Jamestown. Original airdate 1979.</ref>). In other cases, all the answers in the category round shared an announced characteristic in common (e.g., geographical locations whose names begin and end with \"A\"<ref name=\"washington-1983\" />). Teams used their buzzers in this round, earning 10 points for a correct answer, but losing 10 points<ref name=\"buffalo-1979\" /> (later 20 points<ref name=\"washington-1983\" />) for wrong answers.\n\n====Timed round====\nIn all forms, a team individually answers questions from a packet within a time limit. In one form, at the beginning of the game, teams get one minute to answer questions for 20 points each. In this form, teams are not penalized for wrong answers, in order to help the teams in \"building score\".<ref name=\"buffalo-1981\">[[WIVB-TV]] (Buffalo) in association with Altman Productions. ''It's Academic'' Presented by [[Van Miller]]. Featuring Williamsville East, Bishop Timon, and Salamanca Central. Original airdate 1981.</ref> In another form, teams have one and a half minutes to answer questions for 20 points each. However, 20 points are deducted for a wrong answer. Teams may pass a question, losing 10 points; however, the other two teams may buzz-in to answer the passed questions (with a few exceptions) for plus or minus 20 points after the time runs out for the team's turn. Every question that is fully read must be answered or passed within a reasonable time. However, if a question is not finished when time expires, the team may reject it without penalty or answer the question at their own risk. In this form, getting all 10 questions (later 8) correct originally earned the team a 50-point bonus, later reduced to 25.<ref name=\"washington-1983\" /><ref name=\"buffalo-1981\" /><ref name=\"central-virginia-1988\">Altman Productions.

Teams were instructed to \"use [their] lights and buzzers\" for a \"one-minute scrimmage round.\" 10 points were scored for a correct answer, with no penalties.<ref name=\"buffalo-1978\">[[WIVB-TV]] (Buffalo) in association with Altman Productions. 1977\u201378 championship.

It was replaced by the [[United States biological defense program]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history (1918\u20131941)===\n\nThe '''[[United States]] [[biological weapons]] program''' officially began in spring 1943 on orders from U.S. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. Research continued following [[World War II]] as the U.S. built up a large stockpile of [[biological agent]]s and [[biological weapon|weapons]]. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven [[bio-agent]]s (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\n*''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' ([[anthrax]])\n*''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' ([[tularemia]])\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp ([[brucellosis]])\n*''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' ([[Q-fever]])\n*[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE)]]\n*[[Botulinum toxin]] ([[botulism]])\n*[[Staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed.\n\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] and the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC)\u2014international treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. [[biodefense]] programs, however, have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by The United Nations. Initial interest in any form of biological warfare came at the close of [[World War I]]. The only agent the U.S. tested was the toxin [[ricin]], a product of the castor plant.<ref name=\"smart\" /> The U.S. conducted tests concerning two methods of ricin dissemination: the first, which involved adhering the toxin to [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] for delivery by [[artillery shell]], was successful;<ref name=\"smart\" /> the second, delivering an aerosol cloud of ricin, was proven less successful in these tests.<ref name=\"smart\" /> Neither delivery method was perfected before the war in Europe ended.<ref name=\"smart\">Smart, Jeffery K.

Research continued following [[World War II]] as the U.S. built up a large stockpile of [[biological agent]]s and [[biological weapon|weapons]]. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven [[bio-agent]]s (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\n*''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' ([[anthrax]])\n*''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' ([[tularemia]])\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp ([[brucellosis]])\n*''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' ([[Q-fever]])\n*[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE)]]\n*[[Botulinum toxin]] ([[botulism]])\n*[[Staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed.\n\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] and the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC)\u2014international treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. [[biodefense]] programs, however, have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by The United Nations. Initial interest in any form of biological warfare came at the close of [[World War I]]. The only agent the U.S. tested was the toxin [[ricin]], a product of the castor plant.<ref name=\"smart\" /> The U.S. conducted tests concerning two methods of ricin dissemination: the first, which involved adhering the toxin to [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] for delivery by [[artillery shell]], was successful;<ref name=\"smart\" /> the second, delivering an aerosol cloud of ricin, was proven less successful in these tests.<ref name=\"smart\" /> Neither delivery method was perfected before the war in Europe ended.<ref name=\"smart\">Smart, Jeffery K.

The wavelength of visible light ranges from deep [[red]], roughly 700 [[nanometre|nm]], to [[Violet (color)|violet]], roughly 400&nbsp;nm (for other examples, see [[electromagnetic spectrum]]).\n\nFor [[sound wave]]s in air, the [[speed of sound]] is 343&nbsp;m/s (at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure|room temperature and atmospheric pressure]]). The wavelengths of sound frequencies audible to the human ear (20&nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]]\u201320&nbsp;kHz) are thus between approximately 17&nbsp;[[metre|m]] and 17&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]], respectively. Somewhat higher frequencies are used by [[bat]]s so they can resolve targets smaller than 17&nbsp;mm. Wavelengths in audible sound are much longer than those in visible light.\n\n[[File:Waves in Box.svg|thumb|Sinusoidal standing waves in a box that constrains the end points to be nodes will have an integer number of half wavelengths fitting in the box.]]\n[[File:Standing wave 2.gif|thumb|right|A standing wave (black) depicted as the sum of two propagating waves traveling in opposite directions (red and blue)]]\n\n===Standing waves===\nA [[standing wave]] is an undulatory motion that stays in one place.  A sinusoidal standing wave includes stationary points of no motion, called [[node (physics)|nodes]], and the wavelength is twice the distance between nodes.\n\nThe upper figure shows three standing waves in a box. The walls of the box are considered to require the wave to have nodes at the walls of the box (an example of [[boundary conditions]]) determining which wavelengths are allowed. For example, for an electromagnetic wave,  if the box has ideal metal walls, the condition for nodes at the walls results because the metal walls cannot support a tangential electric field, forcing the wave to have zero amplitude at the wall.\n\nThe stationary wave can be viewed as the sum of two traveling sinusoidal waves of oppositely directed velocities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = The World of Physics\n | author = John Avison\n | publisher = Nelson Thornes\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 978-0-17-438733-6\n | page = 460\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DojwZzKAvN8C&pg=PA460&dq=%22standing+wave%22+wavelength\n }}</ref> Consequently, wavelength, period, and wave velocity are related just as for a traveling wave. For example, the [[Speed of light#Cavity resonance|speed of light]] can be determined from observation of standing waves in a metal box containing an ideal vacuum.\n\n===Mathematical representation===\nTraveling sinusoidal waves are often represented mathematically in terms of their velocity ''v'' (in the x direction), frequency ''f'' and wavelength ''\u03bb'' as:\n\n:<math>  y (x, \\ t) = A \\cos \\left( 2 \\pi \\left( \\frac{x}{\\lambda } - ft \\right ) \\right )  = A \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} (x - vt) \\right )</math>\n\nwhere ''y'' is the value of the wave at any position ''x'' and time ''t'', and ''A'' is the [[amplitude]] of the wave.  They are also commonly expressed in terms of [[wavenumber]] ''k'' (2\u03c0 times the reciprocal of wavelength) and [[angular frequency]] ''\u03c9'' (2\u03c0 times the frequency) as:\n\n:<math>  y (x, \\ t) = A \\cos \\left( kx - \\omega t \\right)  = A \\cos \\left(k(x - v t) \\right) </math>\n\nin which wavelength and wavenumber are related to velocity and frequency as:\n\n:<math> k = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\pi f}{v} = \\frac{\\omega}{v},</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math> \\lambda = \\frac{2 \\pi}{k} = \\frac{2 \\pi v}{\\omega} = \\frac{v}{f}.</math>\n\nIn the second form given above, the phase {{nowrap|(''kx'' \u2212 ''\u03c9t'')}} is often generalized to {{nowrap|('''k'''\u2022'''r''' \u2212 ''\u03c9t'')}}, by replacing the wavenumber ''k'' with a [[wave vector]] that specifies the direction and wavenumber of a [[plane wave]] in [[3-space]], parameterized by position vector '''r'''.  In that case, the wavenumber ''k'', the magnitude of '''k''', is still in the same relationship with wavelength as shown above, with ''v'' being interpreted as scalar speed in the direction of the wave vector.  The first form, using reciprocal wavelength in the phase, does not generalize as easily to a wave in an arbitrary direction.\n\nGeneralizations to sinusoids of other phases, and to complex exponentials, are also common; see [[plane wave]].  The typical convention of using the [[cosine]] phase instead of the [[sine]] phase when describing a wave is based on the fact that the cosine is the real part of the complex exponential in the wave\n:<math>A e^{ i \\left( kx - \\omega t \\right)}. </math>\n\n===General media===\n[[File:Wavelength & refractive index.JPG|thumb|Wavelength is decreased in a medium with slower propagation.]]\n[[File:Refraction - Huygens-Fresnel principle.svg|right|thumb|Refraction: upon entering a medium where its speed is lower, the wave changes direction.]]\n[[File:Light dispersion conceptual waves.gif|thumb|Separation of colors by a prism (click for animation)]]\n\nThe speed of a wave depends upon the medium in which it propagates. In particular, the speed of light in a medium is less than in [[Vacuum#In electromagnetism|vacuum]], which means that the same frequency will correspond to a shorter wavelength in the medium than in vacuum, as shown in the figure at right.\n\nThis change in speed upon entering a medium causes [[refraction]], or a change in direction of waves that encounter the interface between media at an angle.<ref name=mud>\nTo aid imagination, this bending of the wave often is compared to the analogy of a column of marching soldiers crossing from solid ground into mud. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Principles of Planetary Climate |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bO_U8f5pVR8C&pg=PA327 |page=327 |year=2010 |author=Raymond T. Pierrehumbert |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-86556-5 }}\n\n</ref> For [[electromagnetic waves]], this change in the angle of propagation is governed by [[Snell's law]].\n\nThe wave velocity in one medium not only may differ from that in another, but the velocity typically varies with wavelength. As a result, the change in direction upon entering a different medium changes with the wavelength of the wave.\n\nFor electromagnetic waves the speed in a medium is governed by its ''[[refractive index]]'' according to\n:<math>v = \\frac{c}{n(\\lambda_0)},</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum and ''n''(\u03bb<sub>0</sub>) is the refractive index of the medium at wavelength \u03bb<sub>0</sub>, where the latter is measured in vacuum rather than in the medium. The corresponding wavelength in the medium is\n:<math>\\lambda = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{n(\\lambda_0)}.</math>\n\nWhen wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation are quoted, the wavelength in vacuum usually is intended unless the wavelength is specifically identified as the wavelength in some other medium.  In acoustics, where a medium is essential for the waves to exist, the wavelength value is given for a specified medium.\n\t\nThe variation in speed of light with vacuum wavelength is known as [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], and is also responsible for the familiar phenomenon in which light is separated into component colors by a [[dispersive prism|prism]]. Separation occurs when the refractive index inside the prism varies with wavelength, so different wavelengths propagate at different speeds inside the prism, causing them to [[refract]] at different angles. The mathematical relationship that describes how the speed of light within a medium varies with wavelength is known as a [[dispersion relation]].\n\n====Nonuniform media====\n[[File:Local wavelength.svg|thumb|Various local wavelengths on a crest-to-crest basis in an ocean wave approaching shore<ref name=Pinet2/>]]\nWavelength can be a useful concept even if the wave is not [[periodic function|periodic]] in space. For example, in an ocean wave approaching shore, shown in the figure, the incoming wave undulates with a varying ''local'' wavelength that depends in part on the depth of the sea floor compared to the wave height. The analysis of the wave can be based upon comparison of the local wavelength with the local water depth.<ref name=Pinet2>\n{{cite book |title=op. cit\n |author = Paul R Pinet\n |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6TCm8Xy-sLUC&pg=PA242\n |page = 242\n |isbn = 0-7637-5993-7\n |year = 2009\n }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cochlea wave animated.gif|right|thumb|A sinusoidal wave travelling in a nonuniform medium, with loss]]\nWaves that are sinusoidal in time but propagate through a medium whose properties vary with position (an ''inhomogeneous'' medium) may propagate at a velocity that varies with position, and as a result may not be sinusoidal in space. The figure at right shows an example. As the wave slows down, the wavelength gets shorter and the amplitude increases; after a place of maximum response, the short wavelength is associated with a high loss and the wave dies out.\n\nThe analysis of [[differential equation]]s of such systems is often done approximately, using the ''[[WKB approximation|WKB method]]'' (also known as the ''Liouville\u2013Green method'').

Examples of waves are [[sound wave]]s, [[light]], [[water wave]]s and periodic electrical signals in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]. A [[sound]] wave is a variation in air [[sound pressure|pressure]], while in [[light]] and other [[electromagnetic radiation]] the strength of the [[electric field|electric]] and the [[magnetic field]] vary. Water waves are variations in the height of a body of water. In a crystal [[lattice vibration]], atomic positions vary.\n\nThe range of wavelengths or frequencies for wave phenomena is called a [[spectrum]]. The name originated with the [[Visible spectrum|visible light spectrum]] but now can be applied to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]] as well as to a [[sound spectrum]] or [[vibration spectrum]].\n\n==Sinusoidal waves==\nIn [[linear]] media, any wave pattern can be described in terms of the independent propagation of sinusoidal components. The wavelength ''\u03bb'' of a sinusoidal waveform traveling at constant speed ''v'' is given by<ref name= Cassidy>\n{{cite book\n |title=Understanding physics\n |author1=David C.

In a [[dispersive medium]], the phase speed itself depends upon the frequency of the wave, making the [[dispersion relation|relationship between wavelength and frequency]] nonlinear.\n\nIn the case of [[electromagnetic radiation]]\u2014such as light\u2014in [[free space]], the phase speed is the [[speed of light]], about 3\u00d710<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;m/s.  Thus the wavelength of a 100&nbsp;MHz electromagnetic (radio) wave is about: 3\u00d710<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;m/s divided by 10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Hz = 3 metres. The wavelength of visible light ranges from deep [[red]], roughly 700 [[nanometre|nm]], to [[Violet (color)|violet]], roughly 400&nbsp;nm (for other examples, see [[electromagnetic spectrum]]).\n\nFor [[sound wave]]s in air, the [[speed of sound]] is 343&nbsp;m/s (at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure|room temperature and atmospheric pressure]]). The wavelengths of sound frequencies audible to the human ear (20&nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]]\u201320&nbsp;kHz) are thus between approximately 17&nbsp;[[metre|m]] and 17&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]], respectively. Somewhat higher frequencies are used by [[bat]]s so they can resolve targets smaller than 17&nbsp;mm. Wavelengths in audible sound are much longer than those in visible light.\n\n[[File:Waves in Box.svg|thumb|Sinusoidal standing waves in a box that constrains the end points to be nodes will have an integer number of half wavelengths fitting in the box.]]\n[[File:Standing wave 2.gif|thumb|right|A standing wave (black) depicted as the sum of two propagating waves traveling in opposite directions (red and blue)]]\n\n===Standing waves===\nA [[standing wave]] is an undulatory motion that stays in one place.  A sinusoidal standing wave includes stationary points of no motion, called [[node (physics)|nodes]], and the wavelength is twice the distance between nodes.\n\nThe upper figure shows three standing waves in a box. The walls of the box are considered to require the wave to have nodes at the walls of the box (an example of [[boundary conditions]]) determining which wavelengths are allowed. For example, for an electromagnetic wave,  if the box has ideal metal walls, the condition for nodes at the walls results because the metal walls cannot support a tangential electric field, forcing the wave to have zero amplitude at the wall.\n\nThe stationary wave can be viewed as the sum of two traveling sinusoidal waves of oppositely directed velocities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = The World of Physics\n | author = John Avison\n | publisher = Nelson Thornes\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 978-0-17-438733-6\n | page = 460\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DojwZzKAvN8C&pg=PA460&dq=%22standing+wave%22+wavelength\n }}</ref> Consequently, wavelength, period, and wave velocity are related just as for a traveling wave. For example, the [[Speed of light#Cavity resonance|speed of light]] can be determined from observation of standing waves in a metal box containing an ideal vacuum.\n\n===Mathematical representation===\nTraveling sinusoidal waves are often represented mathematically in terms of their velocity ''v'' (in the x direction), frequency ''f'' and wavelength ''\u03bb'' as:\n\n:<math>  y (x, \\ t) = A \\cos \\left( 2 \\pi \\left( \\frac{x}{\\lambda } - ft \\right ) \\right )  = A \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} (x - vt) \\right )</math>\n\nwhere ''y'' is the value of the wave at any position ''x'' and time ''t'', and ''A'' is the [[amplitude]] of the wave.  They are also commonly expressed in terms of [[wavenumber]] ''k'' (2\u03c0 times the reciprocal of wavelength) and [[angular frequency]] ''\u03c9'' (2\u03c0 times the frequency) as:\n\n:<math>  y (x, \\ t) = A \\cos \\left( kx - \\omega t \\right)  = A \\cos \\left(k(x - v t) \\right) </math>\n\nin which wavelength and wavenumber are related to velocity and frequency as:\n\n:<math> k = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\pi f}{v} = \\frac{\\omega}{v},</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math> \\lambda = \\frac{2 \\pi}{k} = \\frac{2 \\pi v}{\\omega} = \\frac{v}{f}.</math>\n\nIn the second form given above, the phase {{nowrap|(''kx'' \u2212 ''\u03c9t'')}} is often generalized to {{nowrap|('''k'''\u2022'''r''' \u2212 ''\u03c9t'')}}, by replacing the wavenumber ''k'' with a [[wave vector]] that specifies the direction and wavenumber of a [[plane wave]] in [[3-space]], parameterized by position vector '''r'''.  In that case, the wavenumber ''k'', the magnitude of '''k''', is still in the same relationship with wavelength as shown above, with ''v'' being interpreted as scalar speed in the direction of the wave vector.  The first form, using reciprocal wavelength in the phase, does not generalize as easily to a wave in an arbitrary direction.\n\nGeneralizations to sinusoids of other phases, and to complex exponentials, are also common; see [[plane wave]].  The typical convention of using the [[cosine]] phase instead of the [[sine]] phase when describing a wave is based on the fact that the cosine is the real part of the complex exponential in the wave\n:<math>A e^{ i \\left( kx - \\omega t \\right)}. </math>\n\n===General media===\n[[File:Wavelength & refractive index.JPG|thumb|Wavelength is decreased in a medium with slower propagation.]]\n[[File:Refraction - Huygens-Fresnel principle.svg|right|thumb|Refraction: upon entering a medium where its speed is lower, the wave changes direction.]]\n[[File:Light dispersion conceptual waves.gif|thumb|Separation of colors by a prism (click for animation)]]\n\nThe speed of a wave depends upon the medium in which it propagates. In particular, the speed of light in a medium is less than in [[Vacuum#In electromagnetism|vacuum]], which means that the same frequency will correspond to a shorter wavelength in the medium than in vacuum, as shown in the figure at right.\n\nThis change in speed upon entering a medium causes [[refraction]], or a change in direction of waves that encounter the interface between media at an angle.<ref name=mud>\nTo aid imagination, this bending of the wave often is compared to the analogy of a column of marching soldiers crossing from solid ground into mud. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Principles of Planetary Climate |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bO_U8f5pVR8C&pg=PA327 |page=327 |year=2010 |author=Raymond T. Pierrehumbert |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-86556-5 }}\n\n</ref> For [[electromagnetic waves]], this change in the angle of propagation is governed by [[Snell's law]].\n\nThe wave velocity in one medium not only may differ from that in another, but the velocity typically varies with wavelength. As a result, the change in direction upon entering a different medium changes with the wavelength of the wave.\n\nFor electromagnetic waves the speed in a medium is governed by its ''[[refractive index]]'' according to\n:<math>v = \\frac{c}{n(\\lambda_0)},</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum and ''n''(\u03bb<sub>0</sub>) is the refractive index of the medium at wavelength \u03bb<sub>0</sub>, where the latter is measured in vacuum rather than in the medium. The corresponding wavelength in the medium is\n:<math>\\lambda = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{n(\\lambda_0)}.</math>\n\nWhen wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation are quoted, the wavelength in vacuum usually is intended unless the wavelength is specifically identified as the wavelength in some other medium.  In acoustics, where a medium is essential for the waves to exist, the wavelength value is given for a specified medium.\n\t\nThe variation in speed of light with vacuum wavelength is known as [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], and is also responsible for the familiar phenomenon in which light is separated into component colors by a [[dispersive prism|prism]]. Separation occurs when the refractive index inside the prism varies with wavelength, so different wavelengths propagate at different speeds inside the prism, causing them to [[refract]] at different angles. The mathematical relationship that describes how the speed of light within a medium varies with wavelength is known as a [[dispersion relation]].\n\n====Nonuniform media====\n[[File:Local wavelength.svg|thumb|Various local wavelengths on a crest-to-crest basis in an ocean wave approaching shore<ref name=Pinet2/>]]\nWavelength can be a useful concept even if the wave is not [[periodic function|periodic]] in space. For example, in an ocean wave approaching shore, shown in the figure, the incoming wave undulates with a varying ''local'' wavelength that depends in part on the depth of the sea floor compared to the wave height. The analysis of the wave can be based upon comparison of the local wavelength with the local water depth.<ref name=Pinet2>\n{{cite book |title=op. cit\n |author = Paul R Pinet\n |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6TCm8Xy-sLUC&pg=PA242\n |page = 242\n |isbn = 0-7637-5993-7\n |year = 2009\n }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cochlea wave animated.gif|right|thumb|A sinusoidal wave travelling in a nonuniform medium, with loss]]\nWaves that are sinusoidal in time but propagate through a medium whose properties vary with position (an ''inhomogeneous'' medium) may propagate at a velocity that varies with position, and as a result may not be sinusoidal in space. The figure at right shows an example. As the wave slows down, the wavelength gets shorter and the amplitude increases; after a place of maximum response, the short wavelength is associated with a high loss and the wave dies out.\n\nThe analysis of [[differential equation]]s of such systems is often done approximately, using the ''[[WKB approximation|WKB method]]'' (also known as the ''Liouville\u2013Green method'').

The path of the light to a position on the screen is different for the two slits, and depends upon the angle \u03b8 the path makes with the screen. If we suppose the screen is far enough from the slits (that is, ''s'' is large compared to the slit separation ''d'') then the paths are nearly parallel, and the path difference is simply ''d'' sin \u03b8.

The main result of this interference is to spread out the light from the narrow slit into a broader image on the screen. This distribution of wave energy is called [[diffraction]].\n\nTwo types of diffraction are distinguished, depending upon the separation between the source and the screen: [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] or far-field diffraction at large separations and [[Fresnel diffraction]] or near-field diffraction at close separations.\n\nIn the analysis of the single slit, the non-zero width of the slit is taken into account, and each point in the aperture is taken as the source of one contribution to the beam of light (''Huygen's wavelets'').  On the screen, the light arriving from each position within the slit has a different path length, albeit possibly a very small difference.  Consequently, interference occurs.\n\nIn the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern sufficiently far from a single slit, within a [[small-angle approximation]], the intensity spread ''S'' is related to position ''x'' via a squared [[sinc function]]:<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Optical scattering: measurement and analysis\n | edition = 2nd\n | author = John C.
