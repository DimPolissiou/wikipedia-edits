It's clear that ''Girl'' isn't a sophomore slump, but rather an album worth investing in.\"<ref name=\"Exclaim\"/> [[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called ''Girl'' \"bright, shiny, and big, an album designed to appeal to any imaginable audience\", noting how Morris goes for a \"pan-cultural pop\" soundscape that draws from different genres and delivers straightforward messages that's backed by equally strong production. He concluded by finding criticism in the album's songwriting following that musical direction, \"By foregrounding her lyrical intent and offering no room for interpretation, Morris winds up with songs that feel less imaginative than their execution, a flaw that is by no means fatal but does mean that ''Girl'' plays on a smaller scale than intended.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor [[Rob Sheffield]] felt that fans of Morris's \"scrappy attitude on ''Hero''\" will be oft-put by the \"happy midtempo love songs\" found in the album's second half but said that tracks like \"All My Favorite People\", \"Flavor\" and \"Make Out with Me\" will satisfy them, concluding that, \"She might be on her best behavior on this LP, but the liveliest moments come when she gets out of line.\"<ref name=\"RS2\"/> Laura Snapes of ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt the record goes for \"neither gutsy grandstanding nor Vegas-adjacent pop\" throughout its track listing, criticizing the \"biographical sincerity (\"Great Ones\", \"Gold Love\", \"Make Out with Me\")\" for lacking conviction and the misuse of Morris's \"compellingly hardbitten voice\" on songs that don't involve fractured romances, saying that Morris should take inspiration from fellow country artist [[Kacey Musgraves]] when recording her third album.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Girl'' debuted and peaked at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 46,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 25,000 were pure album sales in its first week.

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 66, based on 8 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n\nMelissa Novacaska from ''[[Exclaim!]]'' said, \"What's impressive about ''Girl'' though is how strong Morris's vocals have grown, along with the maturity and uniqueness of each song. It's clear that ''Girl'' isn't a sophomore slump, but rather an album worth investing in.\"<ref name=\"Exclaim\"/> [[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called ''Girl'' \"bright, shiny, and big, an album designed to appeal to any imaginable audience\", noting how Morris goes for a \"pan-cultural pop\" soundscape that draws from different genres and delivers straightforward messages that's backed by equally strong production. He concluded by finding criticism in the album's songwriting following that musical direction, \"By foregrounding her lyrical intent and offering no room for interpretation, Morris winds up with songs that feel less imaginative than their execution, a flaw that is by no means fatal but does mean that ''Girl'' plays on a smaller scale than intended.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor [[Rob Sheffield]] felt that fans of Morris's \"scrappy attitude on ''Hero''\" will be oft-put by the \"happy midtempo love songs\" found in the album's second half but said that tracks like \"All My Favorite People\", \"Flavor\" and \"Make Out with Me\" will satisfy them, concluding that, \"She might be on her best behavior on this LP, but the liveliest moments come when she gets out of line.\"<ref name=\"RS2\"/> Laura Snapes of ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt the record goes for \"neither gutsy grandstanding nor Vegas-adjacent pop\" throughout its track listing, criticizing the \"biographical sincerity (\"Great Ones\", \"Gold Love\", \"Make Out with Me\")\" for lacking conviction and the misuse of Morris's \"compellingly hardbitten voice\" on songs that don't involve fractured romances, saying that Morris should take inspiration from fellow country artist [[Kacey Musgraves]] when recording her third album.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Girl'' debuted and peaked at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 46,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 25,000 were pure album sales in its first week.

Rohland Building]] (1891). With wealth and leisure time, cultural institutions emerged, such as the [[Fitzgerald Theater|Shubert Theatre]] now Fitzgerald Theater. [[Andrew Carnegie]] funded three libraries in the city: the [[St. Anthony Park Branch Library|Saint Anthony Park]], [[Riverview Branch Library|Riverview]], and [[Arlington Hills Library|Arlington Hills]] libraries, while [[James J. Hill]] endowed the [[Saint Paul Public Library]]/[[James J. Hill Reference Library]]. In 1924 the [[Ford Motor Company]] opened the [[Twin Cities Assembly Plant]]; the site is located on the Mississippi River adjacent to a company-owned dam, which generates [[hydroelectric power]]. Somewhat unique to this site are the [[sandstone]] tunnels beneath the {{convert|125|acre|km2|adj=on}} factory. Ford mined [[silica]] to make glass for the automobiles produced here, leaving an extensive tunnel system deep into the river-side bluffs.<ref>{{cite web| title = Ford Motors Abandoned Sand Mines| publisher = Action Squad| url = http://www.actionsquad.org/ford.htm| accessdate =2008-03-29}}</ref> The plant was converted to produce armored vehicles during [[World War II]].<ref name=Kunz/>\n\n==Higher education==\nHigher education has played a prominent part in the city's history.\n\n[[Image:Hamline University Old Main.jpg|thumb|[[Hamline University]]'s Old Main]]\n'''[[Hamline University]]''' (1854) Hamline was founded and named after Methodist Bishop [[Leonidas Lent Hamline]], who provided [[USD]] $25,000 of his own money to launch the school. The university opened in [[Red Wing, Minnesota]], with the premise that the school would eventually move to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]]. A statue of the bishop, sculpted by the late professor of art Michael Price, stands on campus. In 1869, the university shut down its operations after enrollment dropped drastically due to the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]]. The first building at the Red Wing site was torn down in 1872. A new building opened in 1880 in Saint Paul's Midway neighborhood housing 113 students. The building burned in 1883, and the following year, a new building was developed: Old Main, Hamline's oldest remaining building.\n\nIn 1917 Hamline actively responded to the call of [[World War I]] by incorporating an Army Training Corps at the university. More buildings developed after [[World War II]]. By 1928, Hamline consisted of Old Main (classrooms and administration), Manor House (women's residence hall), a Methodist church, and Goheen Hall (men's residence hall). Hamline faced tough challenges during the U.S. economic depression of the early 1930s. After World War II, Hamline's choir and theater department became a musical reference in Minnesota. The choir would eventually become nationally renowned, and would travel overseas. By 1950, enrollment surpassed 1000 students, and the board of directors decided on further development. New developments included two new residential halls (Sorin and Drew halls), a cultural center (Bush Student Center), a new carpentry center (VanHemert Hall) a new arts center, and a new science center (Drew Hall of Science). All of these projects were completed in the mid-1960s.\n\n[[Image:Old Main, Macalester College.JPG|thumb|left|Macalester's Old Main]]\n'''[[Macalester College]]''' (1885) had its beginnings due to the efforts of the Reverend Dr. [[Edward Duffield Neill]], who had founded two schools in Saint Paul and nearby [[Minneapolis]] which were named after M.W. Baldwin, a [[locomotive]] builder and friend of Neill's. With the intention of turning his Saint Paul Baldwin School into a college, Neill turned to Charles Macalester, a businessman from [[Philadelphia]], for sponsorship. Macalester donated a building near [[Saint Anthony Falls]], and the college was chartered in 1874. The college moved to its present location in 1885 after building an endowment and seeking the help of the [[Presbyterian Church]]. The College first admitted women in 1893,<ref name=Macalester>{{cite web| title = Macalester's History| publisher = Macalester College| url = http://www.macalester.edu/about/history.html| accessdate = 2009-03-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116123213/http://www.macalester.edu/about/history.html |archivedate=2009-01-16}}</ref> and despite being affiliated with a religious institution, remained open to students of other faiths.<ref>[http://www.macalester.edu/academic/catalog/mhra5.html Macalester College Catalog: College Seal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305075016/http://www.macalester.edu/academic/catalog/mhra5.html |date=2008-03-05 }}</ref>\n\nMacalester was largely carried through financial hardship and brought to prominence by Dr. James Wallace, father of [[DeWitt Wallace]]. Wallace was acting president of the college from 1894 to 1900, president from 1900 to 1906, and professor until just before his death in 1939. After [[World War II]], the college developed a reputation for [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] under the presidency of Charles Turck (later the namesake of Turck Hall), who recruited overseas and created a more diverse student body.<ref name=Macalester/> Macalester's positive reputation grew during the 1960s, when it consistently drew many [[National Merit Scholarship|National Merit Scholars]], enough to come in at the country's top ten. During this time the college also benefitted greatly from DeWitt Wallace's success with [[Reader's Digest]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827356,00.html?promoid=googlep Time Magazine: Meritorious Macalester]</ref> Macalester continued to develop into the 1990s, building its endowment and adding new facilities and equipment.\n\n[[Image:Derhamhall.jpg|thumb|Derham Hall at Saint Catherine University]]\nThe '''[[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]]''' (1885) began as an all-male, Catholic seminary. [[John Ireland (archbishop)|John Ireland]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis]] started the Saint Thomas Aquinas seminary, which became a [[liberal arts college]] in 1894. A gift from local railroad tycoon [[James J. Hill]] provided funds to establish the Saint Paul Seminary apart from the college. The College of Saint Thomas became a military-based school for undergraduates in 1906 and awarded its first academic degrees in 1910. Before that, the school gave out two-year diplomas in commercial and classical programs. In 1915, the college and Saint Thomas Military Academy for high school students split into two institutions and in 1965 the academy moved to [[Mendota Heights, Minnesota]]. The college later dropped its military distinction in 1922.<ref name=\"facultyhistory\">{{cite web|title=History, Mission, General Operation and Governance |publisher=UST Office of Academic Affairs |date=July 2001 |url=http://www.stthomas.edu/facultyhandbook/archives/history.htm |accessdate=2007-09-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716062723/http://www.stthomas.edu/facultyhandbook/archives/history.htm |archivedate=2007-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFrom the late 1920s through the mid-1930s, the [[Holy Cross Fathers]], who run the [[University of Notre Dame]], controlled the college's administration. The [[diocese]] called those priests in to help with the school's financial problems; they were known as a crisis intervention team of sorts for parochial schools of that time. During [[World War II]], St. Thomas served as a training base for naval officers, which kept the school open when men who would have attended college were fighting in the war. After the war, in 1948, the college established 'Tom Town' on the eastern end of the lower quadrant, which is currently home to the O'Shaughnessey-Frey Library. Tom Town consisted of white, barrack-like housing units for faculty, students and their families. The units helped to meet housing demand after WWII.\n\n'''[[Concordia University (Saint Paul)|Concordia University]]''' (1893) was founded by the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]].  It is part of the 10-member [[Concordia University System]].  It was founded to provide a Christian learning environment to high school students planning to go into professional ministries with the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod.  Current enrollment is about 2,800.\n\nThe first predecessor of '''[[William Mitchell College of Law]]''' (1900) was founded by five prominent St. Paulites ([[Hiram F. Stevens]], [[Ambrose Tighe]], [[Moses Clapp]], [[Thomas D. O'Brien]], and Clarence Halbert).  St. Paulites [[Warren E. Burger]] and [[John B. Sanborn, Jr.]] received their law degrees from William Mitchell, while fellow native [[Harry Blackmun]] taught at the school prior to his judicial service.\n\nThe Saint Paul campus of the '''[[St. Catherine University]]''' (1905) was founded by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet. It was named for Saint [[Catherine of Alexandria]].\n\n'''[[Luther Seminary]]''' (1917) ([[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|ELCA]]) was initially formed through the merger of three institutions in 1917 in conjunction with the merger of three Norwegian Lutheran Churches to create what was later named the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church (United States)|Evangelical Lutheran Church]]. The ELC became part of the ALC in 1960.\n\n==Religion==\n[[Image:SummitAvenue2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cathedral of Saint Paul in Saint Paul|Cathedral of Saint Paul]], the highest structure in the city]]\n[[Image:First Baptist Church of Saint Paul.jpg|thumb|right|[[First Baptist Church of Saint Paul|First Baptist Church]]]]\nAs the population of the city grew churches for Christian worship were erected. Most prominently on the city's skyline is the  [[Cathedral of Saint Paul in Saint Paul|Cathedral of Saint Paul]]; its construction was instigated by [[Archbishop]] [[John Ireland (archbishop)|John Ireland]] in 1904. At Ireland's direction, the archdiocese commissioned well-known [[France|French]] [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[architect]] [[Emmanuel Louis Masqueray]], who was also the chief architect of the [[1904 World's Fair]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and construction began in 1906.

Until the [[Treaty of Traverse des Sioux]], the West Side belonged to the Dakota people, and hence unavailable for settlement. After the 1851 treaty, it was available, but due to frequent flooding, prior to 1880, few people lived on the \"flats.\" French-Canadians, Irish, and especially Germans lived on the banks and bluffs out of the flood zone; in 1874, the West Side was annexed by the city of Saint Paul. In 1882 a trainload of 200 Eastern European [[Jewish people|Jews]] arrived, having fled [[genocide]] in their homelands. Having no money, they initially set up tents on the lowlands on the West Side, Saint Paul. The tents gradually gave way to small houses and over the subsequent three decades, more refugees joined them, coming from [[Russia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. Synagogues and a [[Hebrew]] school were built. The neighborhood was bound by geography, with the river forming the west, north, and east boundaries and the bluffs demarking the southern one. Elevation divided the area economically and ethnically. After [[World War I]], the flats began to be populated by [[Mexican-Americans]] who came to Minnesota to work in meat packing plants and the [[sugar beet]] fields, and settled there permanently. The Neighborhood House, a community support resource for social services was founded by the [[eastern Europe]]an Jews, and became a haven for the Mexican immigrants in the 1920s and 1930s.

Thus was born the [[Saint Paul Winter Carnival]]. In 1886 King Boreas the First was crowned and the first Winter Carnival commenced. This festival also featured an ice castle, an elaborate creation made from the ice of Minnesota lakes, which has evolved into an internationally recognized icon for Saint Paul's festival. Foreign-language newspapers flourished, with local publications in [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].

Soldiers mustering for the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] were encouraged by 40,000 visitors and 500 soldiers took ill from the exposure. By the turn of the century, resentment of the newest immigrants began to take hold. Henry A. Castle wrote that the earliest immigrants, primarily from the [[British Isles]], [[Germany]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[France]] easily reached the standards expected of them. In contrast, by the 1880s, most new immigrants were unskilled workers from [[southern Europe]], [[eastern Europe]], and [[Russia]].

Capitol buildings were built in 1854 and 1882. But by the turn of the century, the third state capitol was under construction. The building was designed by [[Cass Gilbert]] and modeled after [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]\u2014the unsupported [[marble]] [[dome]] is the second largest in the world, after Saint Peter's. At a cost of [[USD]] $4.5 million, it opened in 1905. The exterior is made of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgian]] marble and [[Saint Cloud, Minnesota|Saint Cloud]] [[granite]]. The interior walls are constructed of 20 different types of stone, including [[Mankato, Minnesota|Mankato]] [[limestone]]. Above the southern (main) entrance to the building is a [[gilding|gilded]] [[quadriga]] called the ''[[Progress of the State]]'' which was sculpted by [[Daniel Chester French]] and [[Edward Clark Potter]]. It was completed and raised to the roof of the capitol in 1906. On the floor of the [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] under the dome is a large star, representing the \"North Star State.\" Above is a {{convert|6|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[crystal]] chandelier. Art-work and gold-leaf are used liberally to decorate the legislative structure. The building's opulence is testimony to the great wealth the state generated at that time.\n\n==Commerce and industry==\nAs [[Minneapolis]] boomed as a [[gristmill|mill]]ing city, Saint Paul flourished in financing and commerce. Brewers Anthony Yoerg and Theodore Hamm arrived with their German recipes for beer and found a thirsty population here. Bohn Manufacturing Company, a cabinet-maker, rode the wave as households replaced their [[ice box]]es with refrigerators, becoming Seeger Refrigerator Company, eventually to be bought out by [[Whirlpool Corporation]]. In 1906 the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company moved from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] to Saint Paul, later to become [[3M]], a [[Fortune 500]] company. Banks financed railroads, mills, and housing for the booming economy and burgeoning population. Grand buildings such as the [[Germania Bank Building (St. Paul)|Germania Bank Building]] (1889), the [[Manhattan Building (St. Paul, Minnesota)|Manhattan Building]] (1889), the [[Merchants National Bank (Saint Paul)|Merchants National Bank]] (1892), and [[Pioneer and Endicott Buildings]] (1889\u20131890) soared in Lowertown, where arriving businessmen and new immigrants couldn't help but be impressed by them. Blocks of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] storefronts with upper-level apartments sprouted along the city streets. Some surviving ones include the [[Schornstein Grocery and Saloon]] (1884), the [[Walsh Building]] (1888), the [[Rochat-Louise-Sauerwein Block]] (1885\u20131895), and the [[Otto W. Rohland Building]] (1891). With wealth and leisure time, cultural institutions emerged, such as the [[Fitzgerald Theater|Shubert Theatre]] now Fitzgerald Theater. [[Andrew Carnegie]] funded three libraries in the city: the [[St. Anthony Park Branch Library|Saint Anthony Park]], [[Riverview Branch Library|Riverview]], and [[Arlington Hills Library|Arlington Hills]] libraries, while [[James J. Hill]] endowed the [[Saint Paul Public Library]]/[[James J. Hill Reference Library]]. In 1924 the [[Ford Motor Company]] opened the [[Twin Cities Assembly Plant]]; the site is located on the Mississippi River adjacent to a company-owned dam, which generates [[hydroelectric power]]. Somewhat unique to this site are the [[sandstone]] tunnels beneath the {{convert|125|acre|km2|adj=on}} factory. Ford mined [[silica]] to make glass for the automobiles produced here, leaving an extensive tunnel system deep into the river-side bluffs.<ref>{{cite web| title = Ford Motors Abandoned Sand Mines| publisher = Action Squad| url = http://www.actionsquad.org/ford.htm| accessdate =2008-03-29}}</ref> The plant was converted to produce armored vehicles during [[World War II]].<ref name=Kunz/>\n\n==Higher education==\nHigher education has played a prominent part in the city's history.\n\n[[Image:Hamline University Old Main.jpg|thumb|[[Hamline University]]'s Old Main]]\n'''[[Hamline University]]''' (1854) Hamline was founded and named after Methodist Bishop [[Leonidas Lent Hamline]], who provided [[USD]] $25,000 of his own money to launch the school. The university opened in [[Red Wing, Minnesota]], with the premise that the school would eventually move to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]]. A statue of the bishop, sculpted by the late professor of art Michael Price, stands on campus. In 1869, the university shut down its operations after enrollment dropped drastically due to the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]]. The first building at the Red Wing site was torn down in 1872. A new building opened in 1880 in Saint Paul's Midway neighborhood housing 113 students. The building burned in 1883, and the following year, a new building was developed: Old Main, Hamline's oldest remaining building.\n\nIn 1917 Hamline actively responded to the call of [[World War I]] by incorporating an Army Training Corps at the university. More buildings developed after [[World War II]]. By 1928, Hamline consisted of Old Main (classrooms and administration), Manor House (women's residence hall), a Methodist church, and Goheen Hall (men's residence hall). Hamline faced tough challenges during the U.S. economic depression of the early 1930s. After World War II, Hamline's choir and theater department became a musical reference in Minnesota. The choir would eventually become nationally renowned, and would travel overseas. By 1950, enrollment surpassed 1000 students, and the board of directors decided on further development. New developments included two new residential halls (Sorin and Drew halls), a cultural center (Bush Student Center), a new carpentry center (VanHemert Hall) a new arts center, and a new science center (Drew Hall of Science). All of these projects were completed in the mid-1960s.\n\n[[Image:Old Main, Macalester College.JPG|thumb|left|Macalester's Old Main]]\n'''[[Macalester College]]''' (1885) had its beginnings due to the efforts of the Reverend Dr. [[Edward Duffield Neill]], who had founded two schools in Saint Paul and nearby [[Minneapolis]] which were named after M.W. Baldwin, a [[locomotive]] builder and friend of Neill's. With the intention of turning his Saint Paul Baldwin School into a college, Neill turned to Charles Macalester, a businessman from [[Philadelphia]], for sponsorship. Macalester donated a building near [[Saint Anthony Falls]], and the college was chartered in 1874. The college moved to its present location in 1885 after building an endowment and seeking the help of the [[Presbyterian Church]].

Wallace was acting president of the college from 1894 to 1900, president from 1900 to 1906, and professor until just before his death in 1939. After [[World War II]], the college developed a reputation for [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] under the presidency of Charles Turck (later the namesake of Turck Hall), who recruited overseas and created a more diverse student body.<ref name=Macalester/> Macalester's positive reputation grew during the 1960s, when it consistently drew many [[National Merit Scholarship|National Merit Scholars]], enough to come in at the country's top ten. During this time the college also benefitted greatly from DeWitt Wallace's success with [[Reader's Digest]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827356,00.html?promoid=googlep Time Magazine: Meritorious Macalester]</ref> Macalester continued to develop into the 1990s, building its endowment and adding new facilities and equipment.\n\n[[Image:Derhamhall.jpg|thumb|Derham Hall at Saint Catherine University]]\nThe '''[[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]]''' (1885) began as an all-male, Catholic seminary. [[John Ireland (archbishop)|John Ireland]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis]] started the Saint Thomas Aquinas seminary, which became a [[liberal arts college]] in 1894. A gift from local railroad tycoon [[James J. Hill]] provided funds to establish the Saint Paul Seminary apart from the college. The College of Saint Thomas became a military-based school for undergraduates in 1906 and awarded its first academic degrees in 1910. Before that, the school gave out two-year diplomas in commercial and classical programs. In 1915, the college and Saint Thomas Military Academy for high school students split into two institutions and in 1965 the academy moved to [[Mendota Heights, Minnesota]]. The college later dropped its military distinction in 1922.<ref name=\"facultyhistory\">{{cite web|title=History, Mission, General Operation and Governance |publisher=UST Office of Academic Affairs |date=July 2001 |url=http://www.stthomas.edu/facultyhandbook/archives/history.htm |accessdate=2007-09-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716062723/http://www.stthomas.edu/facultyhandbook/archives/history.htm |archivedate=2007-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFrom the late 1920s through the mid-1930s, the [[Holy Cross Fathers]], who run the [[University of Notre Dame]], controlled the college's administration. The [[diocese]] called those priests in to help with the school's financial problems; they were known as a crisis intervention team of sorts for parochial schools of that time. During [[World War II]], St. Thomas served as a training base for naval officers, which kept the school open when men who would have attended college were fighting in the war. After the war, in 1948, the college established 'Tom Town' on the eastern end of the lower quadrant, which is currently home to the O'Shaughnessey-Frey Library. Tom Town consisted of white, barrack-like housing units for faculty, students and their families. The units helped to meet housing demand after WWII.\n\n'''[[Concordia University (Saint Paul)|Concordia University]]''' (1893) was founded by the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]].  It is part of the 10-member [[Concordia University System]].  It was founded to provide a Christian learning environment to high school students planning to go into professional ministries with the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod.  Current enrollment is about 2,800.\n\nThe first predecessor of '''[[William Mitchell College of Law]]''' (1900) was founded by five prominent St. Paulites ([[Hiram F. Stevens]], [[Ambrose Tighe]], [[Moses Clapp]], [[Thomas D. O'Brien]], and Clarence Halbert).  St. Paulites [[Warren E. Burger]] and [[John B. Sanborn, Jr.]] received their law degrees from William Mitchell, while fellow native [[Harry Blackmun]] taught at the school prior to his judicial service.\n\nThe Saint Paul campus of the '''[[St. Catherine University]]''' (1905) was founded by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet. It was named for Saint [[Catherine of Alexandria]].\n\n'''[[Luther Seminary]]''' (1917) ([[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|ELCA]]) was initially formed through the merger of three institutions in 1917 in conjunction with the merger of three Norwegian Lutheran Churches to create what was later named the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church (United States)|Evangelical Lutheran Church]].

Until the [[Treaty of Traverse des Sioux]], the West Side belonged to the Dakota people, and hence unavailable for settlement. After the 1851 treaty, it was available, but due to frequent flooding, prior to 1880, few people lived on the \"flats.\" French-Canadians, Irish, and especially Germans lived on the banks and bluffs out of the flood zone; in 1874, the West Side was annexed by the city of Saint Paul. In 1882 a trainload of 200 Eastern European [[Jewish people|Jews]] arrived, having fled [[genocide]] in their homelands. Having no money, they initially set up tents on the lowlands on the West Side, Saint Paul. The tents gradually gave way to small houses and over the subsequent three decades, more refugees joined them, coming from [[Russia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. Synagogues and a [[Hebrew]] school were built. The neighborhood was bound by geography, with the river forming the west, north, and east boundaries and the bluffs demarking the southern one. Elevation divided the area economically and ethnically. After [[World War I]], the flats began to be populated by [[Mexican-Americans]] who came to Minnesota to work in meat packing plants and the [[sugar beet]] fields, and settled there permanently. The Neighborhood House, a community support resource for social services was founded by the [[eastern Europe]]an Jews, and became a haven for the Mexican immigrants in the 1920s and 1930s. The organization provided services such as [[English language|English]], sewing, and cooking classes, and employment referrals.<ref name=Kunz/> As the Jewish residents built wealth and moved to higher ground, they rented their modest houses on the lowlands to the Mexican immigrants.<ref name=Gilman/> The [[African-American]] architect, [[Clarence W. Wigington]] (1883&ndash;1967) designed several structures in the city, including the [[Harriet Island Pavilion]]. Little is left of the historical lowlands, as in the early 1960s, the entire neighborhood was bulldozed for [[urban renewal]], destroying most of the historic structures on the lower West Side;<ref>{{cite web| title = Tour Saint Paul West Side| publisher = www.historicsaintpaul.org| url = http://www.visitsaintpaul.com/DAM_public/8171.pdf| accessdate =2008-03-26}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> but many of the homes of the wealthier residents on the high bluffs survive, including the [[Edward and Elizabeth Heimbach House and Carriage House|Heimbach House]] and the [[Anthony Yoerg, Sr. House|Anthony Yoerg House]].\n\n==1904 tornado==\n{{Main|August 1904 tornado outbreak}}\nOn August 20, 1904, Saint Paul and much of the Twin Cities area was struck by damaging [[thunderstorm]]s and [[tornado]]es.

In 1879 the Czech Slovak immigrant community that was based at the intersection of St. Clair and West Seventh Streets purchased a lot at 383 Michigan from a sitting mayor of Saint Paul, William Dawson. They establish their first hall as a home to a number of their organizations, including a literary society Slovanska Lipa (1868\u201379), a fitness society Sokol (1882\u2013present) and \u010cesko-Slovansk\u00fd Podporuj\u00edc\u00ed Spolek (C.S.P.S.) or Czech-Slovak Protective Society as a fraternal benevolent/insurance group ([[Czech-Slovak Protective Society|C.S.P.S.]]) When the first hall burned, the second was built in 1887 with a third story added in 1917. St. Paul's C.S.P.S. Hall is the oldest Czech-Slovak Hall in the United States, as well as the oldest theater and national hall in the State of Minnesota. In 1977 it was declared a National and State Historic Site and placed on the National Register of Historic Sites as Building #77000763. The 1923 [[Payne Avenue State Bank]] served [[Scandinavia]]n, [[German people|German]], [[Italian people|Italian]], and other European settlers who lived in the East Side neighborhood. [[World War I]] brought a violent wave of anti-[[German people|German]] sentiment to the city. The [[Saint Paul Public Schools]] stopped teaching the [[German language]] (which had been standard fare), German Christians congregations experienced harassment from the [[Minnesota National Guard]], the {{convert|18|ft|m|0|adj=on}} statue of \"Germania\" was removed from the Germania Life Insurance Company building, [[sauerkraut]] was temporarily renamed \"Liberty Cabbage,\" and [[hamburger]]s were dubbed [[Salisbury Steak]].<ref name=Kunz/>\n\n[[Image:cinco26.jpg|thumb|right|2007 [[Cinco de Mayo]] parade]]\n[[World War II]] brought labor shortages and new opportunities for [[African American]]s in the city.

Tragically, Rondo Street, once the heart of the [[African American]] middle class in the city was destroyed, when the neighborhood was razed to make way for [[Interstate 94 in Minnesota|Interstate 94]]. According to [[Roy Wilkins]], Rondo Street had been one of the city's best locations, with tree-lined streets and abundant music, emanating from [[Victrola]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[player piano]]s. Like many U.S. cities, Saint Paul endured rioting in 1968 after the assassination of [[Martin Luther King]]. The unrest stemmed out of despair and protests against the [[Vietnam War]].

The myth holds that any current student to step on the seal will never graduate. In reverence for this tradition, the seal has been fenced off from the rest of the room.\n\nAn annual event is the ''Lighting of the Quad'', a ceremony each winter during which the campus is lit up in holiday lights. Recent years have included singing and fireworks.\n\n===Housing===\n[[File:AMR I, JHU.jpg|thumb|right|Alumni Memorial Residence I, a freshman dormitory]]Living on campus is typically required for first- and second-year undergraduates.<ref name=\"Johns Hopkins Freshman Room Selection Brochure\"/> Freshman housing is centered around Freshman Quad, which consists of three residence hall complexes: The two Alumni Memorial Residences (AMR I and AMR II) plus Buildings A and B. The AMR dormitories are each divided into ''houses'', subunits named for figures from the university's early history. Freshmen are also housed in Wolman Hall and in certain wings of McCoy Hall, both located slightly outside the campus. Dorms at Hopkins are generally co-ed with same-gender rooms, though a new policy has allowed students to live in mixed-gender rooms since Fall 2014.<ref name=\"Gender Inclusive Housing\"/><ref name=\"Freshman Residence Halls\"/>\n\nStudents determine where they will live during Sophomore year through a housing lottery. Most juniors and seniors move into nearby apartments or row-houses. Non-freshmen in university housing occupy one of four buildings: McCoy Hall, the Bradford Apartments, the Homewood Apartments, and Charles Commons.<ref name=\"Freshman Room Selection\"/> All are located in [[Charles Village]] within a block from the [[Homewood campus]].

The myth holds that any current student to step on the seal will never graduate. In reverence for this tradition, the seal has been fenced off from the rest of the room.\n\nAn annual event is the ''Lighting of the Quad'', a ceremony each winter during which the campus is lit up in holiday lights. Recent years have included singing and fireworks.\n\n===Housing===\n[[File:AMR I, JHU.jpg|thumb|right|Alumni Memorial Residence I, a freshman dormitory]]Living on campus is typically required for first- and second-year undergraduates.<ref name=\"Johns Hopkins Freshman Room Selection Brochure\"/> Freshman housing is centered around Freshman Quad, which consists of three residence hall complexes: The two Alumni Memorial Residences (AMR I and AMR II) plus Buildings A and B. The AMR dormitories are each divided into ''houses'', subunits named for figures from the university's early history. Freshmen are also housed in Wolman Hall and in certain wings of McCoy Hall, both located slightly outside the campus. Dorms at Hopkins are generally co-ed with same-gender rooms, though a new policy has allowed students to live in mixed-gender rooms since Fall 2014.<ref name=\"Gender Inclusive Housing\"/><ref name=\"Freshman Residence Halls\"/>\n\nStudents determine where they will live during Sophomore year through a housing lottery. Most juniors and seniors move into nearby apartments or row-houses. Non-freshmen in university housing occupy one of four buildings: McCoy Hall, the Bradford Apartments, the Homewood Apartments, and Charles Commons.<ref name=\"Freshman Room Selection\"/> All are located in [[Charles Village]] within a block from the [[Homewood campus]].
