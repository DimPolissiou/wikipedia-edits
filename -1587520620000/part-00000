Metadata and file data are organized into tables similar to a [[relational database]]. The file size, number of files in a [[folder (computing)|folder]], total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 [[exabyte]]s, a maximum of 18.4 \u00d7 10<sup>18</sup> folders and a maximum volume size of 1 [[yottabyte]] (with 64 KB [[Data cluster|clusters]]) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB [[Unicode]] text string.\n;Built-in resilience: ReFS employs an [[copy-on-write|allocation-on-write]] update strategy for metadata,<ref name=\"B8_ReFS\"/>  which allocates new chunks for every update transaction and uses large IO batches. All ReFS metadata has built-in 64-bit checksums which are stored independently.

In that case, the number of physical processors cannot exceed twice the number of licenses assigned to the server.}}\n\n{{efn|name=long|Each license of Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter allows ''up to two'' processor chips. Each license of Windows Server 2012 Standard allows up to two virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard on that physical server. If more virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard are needed, each additional license of Windows Server 2012 allows up to two more virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard, even though the physical server itself may have sufficient licenses for its processor chip count. Because Windows Server 2012 Datacenter has no limit on the number of virtual instances per licensed server, only enough licenses for the physical server are needed for any number of virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Datacenter. If the number of processor chips or virtual instances is an odd number, the number of licenses required is the same as the ''next even number''. For example, a single-processor-chip server would still require 1 license, the ''same'' as if the server were two-processor-chip and a five-processor-chip server would require 3 licenses, the ''same'' as if the server were six-processor-chip, and if 15 virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard are needed on one server, 8 licenses of Windows Server 2012, which can cover up to 16 virtual instances, are needed (assuming, in this example, that the processor chip count does not exceed 16).}}\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=Windows

Metadata and file data are organized into tables similar to a [[relational database]]. The file size, number of files in a [[folder (computing)|folder]], total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 [[exabyte]]s, a maximum of 18.4 \u00d7 10<sup>18</sup> folders and a maximum volume size of 1 [[yottabyte]] (with 64 KB [[Data cluster|clusters]]) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB [[Unicode]] text string.\n;Built-in resilience: ReFS employs an [[copy-on-write|allocation-on-write]] update strategy for metadata,<ref name=\"B8_ReFS\"/>  which allocates new chunks for every update transaction and uses large IO batches. All ReFS metadata has built-in 64-bit checksums which are stored independently.

In that case, the number of physical processors cannot exceed twice the number of licenses assigned to the server.}}\n\n{{efn|name=long|Each license of Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter allows ''up to two'' processor chips. Each license of Windows Server 2012 Standard allows up to two virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard on that physical server. If more virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard are needed, each additional license of Windows Server 2012 allows up to two more virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard, even though the physical server itself may have sufficient licenses for its processor chip count. Because Windows Server 2012 Datacenter has no limit on the number of virtual instances per licensed server, only enough licenses for the physical server are needed for any number of virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Datacenter.

Alberta was predominantly French-speaking until the end of the 19th century, but has since been predominantly [[English speaking|English-speaking]]. In the capital of Alberta, [[Edmonton]], this population is mainly concentrated in the [[Bonnie Doon, Edmonton|Bonnie Doon]] area. In [[Calgary]], a large population is dispersed throughout the city. There are several Francophone communities bringing together a few tens of thousands of people, such as those of [[Bonnyville]], [[Plamondon, Alberta|Plamondon]], Saint-Paul, mainly in the north and north-central of [[Alberta]], [[St Isidore's|St-Isidore]], Regional Municipality of [[Municipal District of Smoky River No. 130|Smoky River No. 130]] (including the cities of [[Falher]], [[Donnelly, Alberta|Donnelly]], [[McLennan, Alberta|McLennan]] and [[Girouxville]]) mainly in northwestern Alberta. For several decades, there have also been emerging Francophone populations in medium-sized Alberta cities such as [[Grande Prairie]], [[Fort McMurray]], [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Lethbridge]], among others.\n\nThe Unith\u00e9\u00e2tre in Edmonton and the Theater Society perform in French. The Alberta Visual Arts Center provides a place of expression for French-speaking artists and artisans. There is also an annual French language and culture festival in [[Alberta]].\n\n==History==\nFrench history in Alberta goes back to the [[fur trade in North America]] when [[voyageurs]] (travelling<ref>\n[[\n]]\n</ref> traders) with the Montreal-based [[North-West Company]] arrived in the late 1780s.   Along with new arrivals from [[Canada East]], the French continued to make up a large percentage of the workforce in the [[Hudson\u2019s Bay Company]] after it took over the NWCo. In 1821, and French was the primary European language spoken in what later became Alberta until the 1870s.\n\nAfter Canada acquired [[Rupert\u2019s Land]] (which included the future Alberta) from the HBCo., more francophones arrived from Eastern Canada, the United States, and Europe, this time to settle and found agricultural communities.  They were later joined by urban migrants, and there are now French quarters in both Calgary and Edmonton.\n\nHowever, in 1892, the [[Northwest Territories]] (which at the time covered the [[Canadian Prairies]] west of [[Southern Manitoba]]) abolished French as an official language. In 1984, its status as an official language was restored in the Canadian territories, but not in the prairie provinces.\n\nIn 2011 81,085 Albertans spoke French as first language, giving Alberta the fourth largest francophone population in Canada after Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick.  Between  2006 and 2011, of all provinces, it is Alberta where the growth rate of the population with French as a mother tongue or language spoken most often at home was the most important.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/98-314-x/98-314-x2011003_1-eng.cfm|title=French and the francophonie in Canada|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> The Francophone population grew by approximately 18% since 2006.\nIn the 2006 census 12% of Albertans or 390,000 people claimed French or Acadian ancestry, making French the 3rd largest ethnic group in the province after British (including Scottish) and German.  A combined total of 238,000 Albertans can speak French either as a first or additional language.  In the 2011-12 school year 5,943 students in Alberta were enrolled in francophone schools (where French is the sole language of instruction except during the English Language Arts class) and 145,099 students in Alberta were taking French as a Second Language (FSL) classes.\n\nFour municipalities in Alberta are officially bilingual and offer local services in French: Beaumont ({{convert|15|km}} southeast of Edmonton), Legal ({{convert|35|km}} north of Edmonton), Falher ({{convert|420|km}} northwest of Edmonton), and Plamondon ({{convert|204|km}} northeast of Edmonton).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturetourism.alberta.ca/francophone-secretariat/english/facts-and-statistics/|title=Header and Footer|last=Alberta|first=Government of|website=www.culturetourism.alberta.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:R\u00e9seau des municipalit\u00e9s bilingues de l'Alberta.png|thumb|Nine municipalities that are members of the Alberta Bilingual Municipalities Network.<ref>[https://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=471088AC318FE-0275-478A-29387B822D1D55A4#.WUQh8iofsEJ.facebook Alberta unveils first French policy]</ref>]]\nFranco-Albertans are concentrated in communities such as [[Legal, Alberta|Legal]], [[Bonnyville, Alberta|Bonnyville]], [[Plamondon, Alberta|Plamondon]], and [[St. Paul, Alberta|St. Paul]] in the northeastern part of the province, northwest areas such as the hamlet of [[St. Isidore, Alberta|St. Isidore]], [[Municipal District of Smoky River No. 130]] &nbsp; including the towns of [[Falher, Alberta|Falher]], [[Donnelly, Alberta|Donnelly]], [[McLennan, Alberta|McLennan]] and [[Girouxville, Alberta|Girouxville]] and north central [[Alberta]]. Immigration from [[Quebec]] to Alberta in the 1970s and again in the 21st century has also increased the [[francophone]] population of the province, especially in the cities of [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]] and [[Fort McMurray]].\n\n== Origins ==\nThe territory corresponding today to Alberta was explored in 1741-1749 by the brothers Fran\u00e7ois and Louis-Joseph de la V\u00e9rendrye. The territory was then populated by the [[Assiniboine]], [[Gros Ventre|Atsina]], [[Cree]], [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]], [[Slavey]], Tchipewyan, Tsa-dunnes and [[Tsuu T'ina 145|Tsuu T'inas]]. Some of these peoples have already been present since the end of the 18th century and very early on had commercial ties with the Whites. People called \"[[Coureur des bois|Coureurs des Bois]]\" from [[New France]] also roamed the territory in search of [[Fur|furs]]. French therefore becomes the first language of European origin to be spoken on the territory. Many French [[Toponymy|toponyms]] are also created. [[Anthony Henday]] in [[1754]], [[Peter Pond]] in [[1778]], Alexander MacKenzie in 1789 and 1783, as well as Peter Fiddler and David Thompson at the turn of the 19th century explored the rest of the territory5. By the end of the 18th century, there were already 18 forts because the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company competed for the fur trade4 but the two merged in 1821, retaining the name of Compagnie de la Baie Hudson 5.\n\nFrench-speaking settlers from various regions of Canada and the world settled during the 19th century4. The first French-speaking Catholic missionaries to visit the territory were Abbots Blanchet and Demers, in 18384. It was at this time that the Saint-Joachim parish of Edmonton was founded4. There were then five missionaries to serve the whole territory, but the Oblates of Marie-Immaculate were established in 18464. The first school was founded in 1859 at Fort Edmonton4. Religious communities play an important role in education4 and Albert Lacombe is one of the main missionaries5.\n\nThe progress of the establishment of whites in the North threatens the monopoly of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) 5. Following the presentation of the report of the Henry Youle Hind expedition of 1857, the British government decided not to renew the license of the HBC5. Its territory was bought by the Canadian government on June 23, 1870 and became the Northwest Territories a year later5. There were only about 1,000 whites in 1881 and, despite the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Calgary in 1883, the population increased slowly and reached only 17,500 whites in 18915. French already has a important unofficial status at the time, but the Northwest Territories Act of 1875 offered no protection for this language7. In 1877, the Government of Canada changed its mind by adopting section 11, which allowed the use of French in the courts, the Territorial Council, the minutes and the Assembly journal; in 1886, section 11 became section 110 of the Northwest Territories Act7. The federal law protects Catholic and French-language schools, while the 1875 law provides for the possibility, for minorities, the right to establish separate schools7. The Council for Public Education was created in 1884 and divided into two committees, one Protestant and the other Catholic, managing their own schools7. Religious education is, however, restricted to one hour per day7.\n\n==Culture==\n\n''L\u2019Unith\u00e9\u00e2tre'' in Edmonton and the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre'' serve a French-speaking audience, and a number of folk dancing troupes tour the province. The ''Centre d\u2019arts visuels de l\u2019Alberta'' provides a venue for francophone artists and craftsmen, and the annual Franco-Alberta Festival showcases French language and culture.\n\n==Media==\nFrancophones in Alberta receive broadcast media service primarily from the television and radio services of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada]], the French-language division of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], including [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]]'s station [[CBXFT-DT]], [[Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re]]'s [[CHFA-FM]] and [[Ici Musique]]'s [[CBCX-FM]]. Francophone community radio stations exist in Edmonton ([[CFED-FM]]) and [[Plamondon, Alberta|Plamondon]] ([[CHPL-FM]]); a third community radio station, [[CKRP-FM]] in [[Falher, Alberta|Falher]], was shut down in 2017.\n\nIn print, the province is served by the French-language weekly newspaper ''Le Franco''.\n\n==Notable Franco-Albertans==\nThe first notable Franco-Albertan, in many regards, was [[Father Albert Lacombe]].\n\n=== Politics ===\n* [[Prosper-Edmond Lessard]] - Alberta\u2019s first French-speaking cabinet minister.

The second is when there is a delay between the detection of the outbreak and widespread recognition and declaration of it as an international concern.<ref name=\"Hoffman2018\" /> The declaration is promulgated by an Emergency Committee (EC) made up of international experts operating under the IHR (2005),<ref name=\"WHO-IHR2\"/> which was developed following the [[Timeline of the SARS outbreak|SARS outbreak]] of 2002/2003.<ref name=\"Hoffman2018\" /> Between 2009 and 2016, there were four PHEIC declarations.<ref name=\"WashPost2016\"/> The fifth was the 2018\u201320 Kivu Ebola epidemic which was announced on 17 July 2019.<ref name=\"WHO18Oct2019\"/> The sixth is the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2019\u201320 novel coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"WHOStatement30January2020\"/> Under the 2005 [[International Health Regulations]] (IHR), States have a legal duty to respond promptly to a PHEIC.<ref name=\"urlInside Justice-WHO-PHEIC\"/>\n\n==Definition==\nPHEIC is defined as; <blockquote>an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response<ref name=WHO2016>WHO Regulations (2005). {{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ihr/annex_2/en/|title= Annex 2 of the International Health Regulations (2005)|website=WHO|access-date=6 February 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis definition designates a [[public health crisis]] of potentially global reach and implies a situation that is \"serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected\", which may necessitate immediate international action.<ref name=WHO2016/><ref name=Exter2015>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhMACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA540|title=International Health Law and Ethics: Basic Documents|last=Exter|first=Andr\u00e9 den|date=2015|publisher=Maklu|isbn=978-9046607923|edition=3rd|series=|location=|pages=540|language=en|chapter=Part VI Public Health; Chapter 1.1 International Health Regulations (2005)}}</ref>\n\nIt is a \"call to action\" and \"last resort\" measure.<ref name=\"Rull2015\"/>\n\n==Reporting a potential concern==\nWHO Member States have 24 hours within which to report potential PHEIC events to the WHO.<ref name=Hall2018/> It does not have to be a member State that reports a potential outbreak, hence reports to the WHO can also be received informally.<ref name=Davies2015/>\nUnder the IHR (2005), ways to detect, evaluate, notify and report events were ascertained by all countries in order to avoid PHEICs.

Consequently, Muslims are projected to rise from 23% of the world\u2019s population in 2010 to 30% in 2050.\n:#Muslims are expected to grow twice as fast as the overall global population (the expected annual growth rate of Muslims is projected to be 0.6 p.p. above the rate for the world\u2019s population through 2050)\n:#If current trends continue, by 2050 the number of Muslims will nearly equal the number of Christians around the world.\n:# In Europe, Muslims will make up 10% of the overall population.\n:# India will retain a [[Hindu]] majority but also will have the largest Muslim population of any country in the world, surpassing [[Indonesia]].\n:# In the United States, Judaism will no longer be the largest non-Christian religion. Muslims will be more numerous in the U.S. than people who identify as Jewish on the basis of religion.\n\n:'''Reasons given for the projected growth'''\n:# The change in the world's religious is \"driven primarily by differences in fertility rates and the size of youth populations among the world's major religions, as well as by people switching faiths.\"\n:# ''Fertility rates''. The world's total population \"is expected to rise to 9.3 billion, a 35% increase\" between 2010 and 2050, However, \"over that same period, Muslims, who have a comparatively youthful population with high fertility rates, are projected to increase by 73%.\" Muslim growth benefits from the fertility factor because \"globally, Muslims have the highest fertility rate, an average of 3.1 children per woman.\" This is above a replacement level of 2.1 which is \"the minimum typically needed to maintain a stable population.\"\n:# ''Size of youth population''. \"In 2010, more than a quarter of the world's total population (27%) was under the age of 15. But a \"higher percentage of Muslims (34%) were younger than 15.\"\n:# ''Size of old population''. In 2010, \"11% of the world's population was at least 60 years old,\" but only 7% of Muslims were over 60.\n:# ''Switching''. Between 2010 and 2050 a gain of 3,220,000 Muslim adherents is projected to come through switching, mostly found in the [[Sub Saharan Africa]] (2.9 million). Also, the Muslim population are projected to add 1.3 million and lose 880,000 via switching, for a net gain of 420,000 between 2015 and 2020.\n:# ''Migration''. Migration  is the third reason for the Muslim population growth. For example, 1.8% of the projected growth in Europe is attributed to Muslims migrating in.\n\n===Asia===\n[[Islam]] is currently the largest religion in Asia. According to the [[Pew Research Center]], 27.3% of the people living in the Asia-Pacific region in 2030 will be Muslim, up from about a quarter in 2010 (24.8%) and 21.6% in 1990.<ref name=\"Pew2011Muslim\" />\n\n====India====\nIslam is the [[Growth of religion|fastest-growing religion]] in India.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/religion.aspx |title=Census of India |access-date=11 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015225409/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/religion.aspx |publisher=[[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India]] |archive-date=15 October 2007}}</ref> Growth rate of Muslims has been consistently higher than the growth rate of Hindus, ever since the census data of independent India has been available.

The world's total population \"is expected to rise to 9.3 billion, a 35% increase\" between 2010 and 2050, However, \"over that same period, Muslims, who have a comparatively youthful population with high fertility rates, are projected to increase by 73%.\" Muslim growth benefits from the fertility factor because \"globally, Muslims have the highest fertility rate, an average of 3.1 children per woman.\" This is above a replacement level of 2.1 which is \"the minimum typically needed to maintain a stable population.\"\n:# ''Size of youth population''. \"In 2010, more than a quarter of the world's total population (27%) was under the age of 15. But a \"higher percentage of Muslims (34%) were younger than 15.\"\n:# ''Size of old population''. In 2010, \"11% of the world's population was at least 60 years old,\" but only 7% of Muslims were over 60.\n:# ''Switching''. Between 2010 and 2050 a gain of 3,220,000 Muslim adherents is projected to come through switching, mostly found in the [[Sub Saharan Africa]] (2.9 million). Also, the Muslim population are projected to add 1.3 million and lose 880,000 via switching, for a net gain of 420,000 between 2015 and 2020.\n:# ''Migration''. Migration  is the third reason for the Muslim population growth. For example, 1.8% of the projected growth in Europe is attributed to Muslims migrating in.\n\n===Asia===\n[[Islam]] is currently the largest religion in Asia. According to the [[Pew Research Center]], 27.3% of the people living in the Asia-Pacific region in 2030 will be Muslim, up from about a quarter in 2010 (24.8%) and 21.6% in 1990.<ref name=\"Pew2011Muslim\" />\n\n====India====\nIslam is the [[Growth of religion|fastest-growing religion]] in India.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/religion.aspx |title=Census of India |access-date=11 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015225409/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/religion.aspx |publisher=[[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India]] |archive-date=15 October 2007}}</ref> Growth rate of Muslims has been consistently higher than the growth rate of Hindus, ever since the census data of independent India has been available.

The Patriots compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC South|South]] division. The club joined the NFL in {{nfly|1976}} as an [[expansion team]], along with the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Tampa Bay played its first season in the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division as part of the 1976 expansion plan, whereby each new franchise would play every other franchise over the first two years. After the season, the team switched conferences with the Seahawks and became a member of the [[NFC North|NFC Central]] division. During the 2002 league realignment, the Patriots joined three former [[NFC West]] teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the [[Malcolm Glazer|Glazer family]], and plays its home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa.\n\nThe Buccaneers are the first post-[[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] [[expansion team]] to win a division championship, a playoff game, and to host and play in a conference championship game; all three accomplishments occurred during the [[1979 NFL season|1979 season]]. They are also the first team since the merger to complete a winning season when starting 10 or more rookies, which happened in the 2010 season.  In 1976 and 1977, the Buccaneers lost their first 26 games. They would not win their first game in franchise history until Week 13, of 14, in 1977. After a brief winning era in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team suffered through 14 consecutive losing seasons. Then, for a 10-year period, they were consistent playoff contenders and won [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] at the end of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]], but have not yet returned to the Super Bowl.\n\n==\"Tampa Bay\"==\nThe name [[Tampa Bay Area|\"Tampa Bay\"]] is often used to describe a geographic metropolitan area which encompasses the cities around the body of water known as [[Tampa Bay]], including [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] and several smaller cities. Unlike in the case of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], there is no municipality known as \"Tampa Bay\". The \"Tampa Bay\" in the names of local professional sports franchises, such as the Buccaneers, [[Tampa Bay Lightning|Lightning]], [[Tampa Bay Rays|Rays]], [[Tampa Bay Rowdies|Rowdies]], and the former [[Tampa Bay Storm|Storm]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny|Mutiny]], denotes that they represent the entire region, not just the city of Tampa.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{main|History of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers}}\n\n===Origins===\nThe Tampa Bay expansion franchise was originally awarded to Tom McCloskey, a construction company owner from Philadelphia. McCloskey soon entered a financial dispute with the NFL, so the league found a replacement in Hugh Culverhouse, a wealthy tax attorney from Jacksonville. Culverhouse's handshake deal to purchase the Los Angeles Rams from the estate of Dan Reeves was thwarted by Robert Irsay's purchase of the team, which he then traded to Carroll Rosenbloom in exchange for the Baltimore Colts, a complete trade of teams between two owners. Culverhouse filed antitrust lawsuits in which he accused the NFL of conspiracy for preventing his purchase of the Rams, and as part of his settlement with the league, he was given priority when the NFL expanded soon thereafter.\n\nA name-the-team contest resulted in the nickname \"Buccaneers\", a reference to Jos\u00e9 Gaspar, the mythical Florida pirate who is the inspiration for Tampa's Gasparilla Pirate Festival. The team name was opposed by St. Petersburg businessmen on the grounds that it emphasized Tampa at the expense of other Bay Area cities, until NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle himself met with them to encourage their support. Their uniforms and \"Bucco Bruce\" winking pirate logo were designed by Tampa Tribune artist Lamar Sparkman using colors drawn from the state's four major college teams at the time: orange from the universities of Miami and Florida, and red from Florida State and the University of Tampa. They were one of the few teams to wear white home uniforms, forcing opponents to wear their warmer dark uniforms in Tampa's afternoon heat. The team's first home was Tampa Stadium, which had been built in 1967 to attract an NFL franchise and was expanded in 1974 to seat just over 72,500 fans.\n\nJohn McKay, a college coach who had led the University of Southern California Trojans to four national championships in the 1960s and 1970s, was named the Buccaneers' first head coach in early 1976. The Bucs soon traded for Steve Spurrier, who had won a Heisman Trophy at the University of Florida in 1966, to be their starting quarterback for their expansion season.\n\n===1976\u20131978===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:John McKay (American football).jpg|thumbnail|[[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]] was the team's first coach from 1976 to 1984.]] -->\nThe Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the [[AFC West]] in 1976. The following year, they were moved to the [[NFC North|NFC Central]], while the other 1976 expansion team, the [[Seattle Seahawks]], switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons. Instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice, the Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Answer Man, Series 2, Vol. 18|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/the-answer-man-series-2-vol-18-2145514|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=June 20, 2005|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTampa Bay did not win their first game until the 13th week of their [[1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|second season]], starting with a record of 0\u201326 (though the Bucs had beaten the [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], 17\u20133, in a 1976 pre-season game before their first regular season).<ref>Underwood, John. \"A Three-hour Time Difference\".

In the first, [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]] was put all over the goal posts in Tampa to prevent the goalposts from being ripped down in the event of a celebration. Four blocked kicks later, the Bucs wasted the oily substance, falling to the [[1979 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 23\u201322. STP was wasted again the following week as the Bucs were shut out 14\u20130 by the [[1979 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], and in [[O. J. Simpson]]'s final home game in [[1979 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]], Tampa Bay lost its third straight attempt to clinch a division title against a 49ers team which came in with a 1\u201313 record. However, in the season finale at home against the [[1979 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], which was played in the worst downpour in Bucs history, Tampa Bay pulled out a 3\u20130 victory. Finishing with a 10\u20136 record, the Bucs had their first winning season in franchise history, and won the Central Division in a tiebreaker over the Bears. In an upset, the Bucs defeated the [[1979 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] 24\u201317 in the divisional round of the [[NFL playoffs, 1979-80|playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html|title=SI.com \u2013 Sports Illustrated Covers \u2013 January 7, 1980|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612064908/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html|archivedate=June 12, 2007|df=}}</ref> Because the [[1979 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] defeated the [[1979 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the other NFC playoff game, the Bucs hosted the [[NFC Championship Game]] the following week in Tampa. The Bucs lost to the Rams 9\u20130. In their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay's five-year plan.\n\nThe Bucs made the playoffs again by winning their division in the [[1981 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1981 season]]. It came down to a thrilling final game at [[1981 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]]; the winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR [[Kevin House]] and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by DT [[David Logan (American football)|David Logan]] sealed the win for the Bucs. In the playoffs, the [[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] defeated the Bucs, 38\u20130, in the divisional round.\n\nThe [[1982 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1982 season]] started 0\u20133 for the Bucs, before a [[1982 NFL Players Strike|player's strike]] shut down the NFL for seven weeks. When the league resumed play, the Bucs were nicknamed the \"Cardiac Kids\" for winning five of their next six games, all in the final moments, to go 5\u20134 and qualify for the expanded playoff slate. In the first round, the Bucs once again faced the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] at Dallas, losing 30\u201317. As it turned out, this would be the last winning regular season under Culverhouse's ownership.\n\n===1983\u20131996===\nBefore the 1983 season, Williams bolted to the [[United States Football League]] in a salary dispute. The Bucs lost their first nine games of the 1983 season en route to finishing 2\u201314, the first of 12 consecutive seasons with at least ten losses\u2014an NFL record. Included was the drafting of [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Bo Jackson]] with the first pick in the [[1986 NFL Draft|1986 draft]]. Jackson had let it be known that he would never play a down for Hugh Culverhouse at Tampa Bay. Making good on his threat, he opted instead to play baseball for the [[Kansas City Royals]] and would later return for parts of football seasons with the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]]. Along with Williams, who later was a Super Bowl champion QB for Washington, two other Buc quarterbacks during this era led other teams to Super Bowl wins. [[Steve Young]] won with the 49ers and [[Trent Dilfer]] won with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nUnder Culverhouse, the Bucs were one of the NFL's more profitable teams during the 1980s; however, this was largely because he kept the payroll among the lowest in the league, hampering their ability to sign quality players. Attendance also sagged; at one point the Buccaneers went parts of three whole seasons without having a home game televised locally, and when they did it was more attributed to a strong visiting team with a large following in the area, such as the Chicago Bears or Green Bay Packers.\n\n[[Hardy Nickerson]], a future 5-time Pro Bowl linebacker, signed as a free agent from the Pittsburgh Steelers. [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], a future Pro Bowl strong safety, was drafted in 1993. In the [[1995 NFL draft]] the Buccaneers drafted two future Hall of Famers: [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]]. Pro Bowl Fullback, [[Mike Alstott]], was drafted the next year in the 1996 draft.\n\n===1994\u20131996===\nDespite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death in 1994 revealed a team close to [[bankruptcy]], which surprised many observers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} His son, [[Miami]] attorney Hugh Culverhouse Jr., practically forced{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} the trustees of his father's estate to sell the team, which cast doubt on the future of the franchise in Tampa. Interested parties included [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]] owner [[Peter Angelos]], the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to [[Baltimore]], as the city did not have an NFL franchise at that time.\n\nHowever, in a last-minute surprise, real estate magnate [[Malcolm Glazer]] outbid both of them for $192 million, the highest sale price for a professional sports franchise up to that point. Glazer immediately placed his sons [[Bryan Glazer|Bryan]], [[Edward Glazer|Edward]], and [[Joel Glazer|Joel]] in charge of the team's financial affairs. He stated that he had every intention of keeping the team in Tampa, but informed area citizens its current stadium deal would not support the record paid amount and that a new stadium would be required. The Glazers convinced [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] voters to raise sales taxes to fund the construction of what would become [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\nThe Glazers' deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team\u2013in Tampa Bay\u2013finally allowed the Bucs to become competitive. The team's performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator [[Tony Dungy]] as head coach, jettisoned the old uniform designs (see below).\n\n===1996\u20132001: Tony Dungy era===\nDuring [[1996 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Dungy's first season in 1996]], the team continued to struggle, starting the season 1\u20138. But in the second half of the season they finished 5\u20132, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by [[Hardy Nickerson]] and the maturing of Sam Wyche's draftees Brooks, Lynch, and Sapp. Dungy, with his even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team, and his [[Football coverage shells#Cover 2|Cover 2]] defensive scheme, sharpened to perfection by [[defensive coordinator]] [[Monte Kiffin]] and linebackers coach [[Lovie Smith]], became the foundation for Tampa Bay's future success.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Dungy to Join Buccaneers Ring of Honor|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/tony-dungy-to-join-buccaneers-ring-of-honor-20639092|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=February 4, 2019|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref> Their version of Cover 2 was so successful that it became known as the [[Tampa 2]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Varley|first=Teresa|title=Tony Dungy credits Chuck Noll with his defensive philosophy|url=http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Steelers.com|date=January 31, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209171311/http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|archive-date=February 9, 2007|access-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> It has been brought to the [[Chicago Bears]] by Smith, [[Detroit Lions]] by Rod Marinelli, [[Kansas City Chiefs]] by [[Herman Edwards]] and to the [[Indianapolis Colts]] by Dungy himself, and copied by several other teams.\n\nThe team started the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1997 season]] 5\u20130, picking up where they left off the previous year, and this quick start once again landed them on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|title=SI.com \u2013 Sports Illustrated Covers \u2013 September 8, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122458/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|title=SI.com \u2013 September 29, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122508/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref>  The Bucs went 10\u20136 for their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1982, as a wild-card team.

Several potential candidates were offered the job, including [[University of Florida]] head coach (and former Buccaneers quarterback) [[Steve Spurrier]], former [[New York Giants]] head coach [[Bill Parcells]], and Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator [[Marvin Lewis]]. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs' offer\u2014the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise. Bucs' general manager Rich McKay threw his support behind Lewis. The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was [[Jon Gruden]]; however, he was still under contract with the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nWhile talks with the Raiders were secretly under way, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, [[San Francisco 49ers]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]].

The team hired Gruden away from the Raiders on February 20, 2002, but the price was four [[Draft (sports)|draft]] picks, including the Bucs' first and second round picks in 2002, their first round pick in 2003, and their second round selection in 2004, along with $8 million in cash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/sports/pro-football-raiders-get-a-pirate-s-booty-for-gruden.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; Raiders Get a Pirate's Booty for Gruden|first=Mike|last=Freeman|date=February 24, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>  (The league as a result prohibited any further trading of draft picks for coaches.)

After a loss to the Detroit Lions, they were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs with a 4\u20139 record. The Bucs finished the season 5-11. This was their tenth consecutive season without a playoff appearance, with their last being in the 2007 season. Also, the Bucs finished last in the NFC South for the seventh time in nine seasons.\n\nThe Bucs began the 2018 season 2\u20130 for the first time since the [[2010 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2010 season]]. Journeyman quarterback [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] started the first two games after Jameis Winston was suspended during the off-season for the first three games. Fitzpatrick threw for over 400 yards and 4 touchdowns in the two-game winning streak, coming against the Saints (the eventual NFC South winner) and the Eagles (the defending [[Super Bowl LII|Super Bowl champions]]). Fitzpatrick would continue the success in week 3's Monday night game against the Steelers, throwing for another 400 yards and becoming the first player in NFL history to throw for 400 or more yards in three consecutive games. After Winston's suspension was up following the Monday Night game, Fitzpatrick remained the starter for week 4's matchup against the Bears. Fitzpatrick struggled and was benched after halftime for Winston. Winston returned as the starter in week 6. Despite the quarterback controversy, the Bucs had a top 3 offense, averaging 27.8 points during the first six games. However, their defense continued to struggle. After week 6's loss to the Falcons, defensive coordinator [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]] was fired and linebackers coach [[Mark Duffner]] was named the interim defensive coordinator. After a close overtime win against the Browns, Winston threw four interceptions against the Bengals the following week. After returning from suspension, Winston threw at least two interceptions per game, and due to that, Fitzpatrick was once again named the starter in week 9. Fitzpatrick, again, struggled, and Winston was renamed the starter for week 12's game against the 49ers. Winston improved, and the team won two straight. However, they dropped their last four games. After a second consecutive last-place season where the team finished with a 5\u201311 record, Koetter was fired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25649986/dirk-koetter-tampa-bay-buccaneers-head-coach |title=Dirk Koetter out as Bucs coach after going 5-11 in 3rd season |last=Laine |first=Jenna |date=December 30, 2018 |website=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |access-date=December 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====2019\u2013present: Bruce Arians era, \"TB\" to TB====\nFollowing the termination of [[Dirk Koetter]], the Buccaneers named [[Bruce Arians]] as the 12th head coach in franchise history on January 8, 2019.

Because Arians was still under contract with the Cardinals through the end of the 2019 season, Tampa Bay agreed to give the Cardinals a sixth-round pick in the [[2019 NFL Draft]] for the rights to Arians, as well as receiving Arizona's seventh-round pick in the same draft.

On the same day, the New England Patriots made an agreement to trade Gronkowski to the Buccaneers, along with a seventh-round pick in exchange for a compensatory fourth round pick in the [[2020 NFL Draft]].\n\n==Defense==\nThroughout their history, the Buccaneers have been known for their suffocating defense. It started with the drafting of Hall of Fame defensive end [[Lee Roy Selmon]] with their first pick ever in 1976. Three Buccaneer players have been named the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award|AP Defensive Player of the Year]], and the team has led the league in total defense on three occasions. The 2002 Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers had the number one Defense that year and it was one of the Greatest NFL Defenses of All Time along  with the 1985 Bears, 2000 Ravens and 2015 Broncos. All four of the Buccaneers [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] inductees are defensive players or coaches. \n===1978\u20131982===\nLed by Selmon, Linebackers [[Dewey Selmon]], [[Richard Wood (American football)|Richard Wood]], [[Dave Lewis (linebacker)|Dave Lewis]], and [[Mike Washington]], [[Mark Cotney]], and [[Cedric Brown]] in the secondary, the early years Buccaneers quickly earned an identity as a defensive team. Their 3\u20134 defense peaked in 1979 when they led the league in total defense, points allowed, and first downs allowed. Lee Roy Selmon was voted NFL Defensive Player of the Year, but they eventually fell 10 points short of the [[Super Bowl]] as the offense held them back in the NFC Championship game in a 9\u20130 loss to the [[Los Angeles Rams]].\n\n===1997\u20132008: The Tampa 2===\n{{main|Tampa 2}}\nThe team drafted franchise cornerstones [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] in 1993, and [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]] in 1995 to go along with All-Pro linebacker [[Hardy Nickerson]]. That was followed by the hiring of innovative defensive coordinator [[Monte Kiffin]] in 1996. The new-look Buccaneers set the stage for one of the greatest defensive runs in NFL history. From 1997 to 2008, the Buccaneers defense finished in the league's top ten every year but one, including eight top-5 finishes, and two top-ranked efforts. Kiffin along with head coach [[Tony Dungy]] created the \"[[Tampa 2]]\" defense, a modified version of the established [[Cover 2]] scheme.\n\nKiffin's defenses were known as gang tacklers with tremendous team speed with a front four that could pressure the quarterback consistently, fast sideline-to-sideline linebackers, and a hard-hitting secondary that caused turnovers. Many teams have copied the Tampa 2, but none have come close to the success the Buccaneers experienced led by numerous Pro Bowlers and Hall of Famers. The Tampa Bay defense featured future Hall of Famers, [[Derrick Brooks]] and [[Warren Sapp]], and Pro Bowlers, [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], [[Ronde Barber]], [[Hardy Nickerson]], [[Simeon Rice]], [[Shelton Quarles]], [[Donnie Abraham]], and [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] MVP [[Dexter Jackson (safety)|Dexter Jackson]]. Sapp and Nickerson were named to the [[National Football League 1990s All-Decade Team|1990s All-Decade 2nd Team]] while the [[National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team|2000s All-Decade Team]] featured Sapp and Brooks as 1st Team players and Ronde Barber on the 2nd Team.\n\n====2002 defense====\n[[File:Tampabaybucsplayersreunion.JPG|thumb|175px|Players from the 2002 team along with head coach Jon Gruden]]\nThe 2002 Buccaneers defense is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 2000 Ravens, 1985 Bears, 2015 Broncos, 1976 Steelers, and few others. In the regular season Tampa Bay led the league in total defense (252.8 ypg), points allowed (196), first downs allowed (14.8 pg), passing (155.6 ypg), interceptions (31), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opponent passer rating (48.4), and shutouts (2). They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43). [[Derrick Brooks]] was awarded AP Defensive Player of the Year as the defense led the way to a 12\u20134 regular season. The team was even better in the postseason allowing only 37 points in three games combined \u2013 all against top ten offenses. In those three playoff games, they intercepted 9 passes \u2013 returning 4 for touchdowns \u2013 and collected 11 sacks.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], the Buccaneers delivered one of the most impressive defensive performances in Super Bowl history. Playing against the #1 offense in the league led by league MVP [[Rich Gannon]], the defense actually outscored the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] offense, allowing 2 offensive touchdowns while returning 3 interceptions for touchdowns. The defense set two records in the 48\u201321 blowout, one for most interceptions in a Super Bowl (5), and one for most interceptions returned for touchdowns in a Super Bowl (3). In 19 total games in 2002, the Buccaneers recorded 40 interceptions, 53 sacks, and 9 defensive touchdowns.\n\n==Team facilities==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width =\n | image1 = Tampa Stadium1.jpg\n | width1 = 227\n | caption1 = [[Tampa Stadium]], where the Buccaneers played for their first 22 seasons\n | image2 = Raymond James Stadium01.jpg\n | width2 = 201\n | caption2 = [[Raymond James Stadium]], where the Buccaneers play\n}}\nSince 1998 the Buccaneers have played their home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa. Prior to that they played in [[Tampa Stadium]] since their establishment.\n\nIn 1975, the Buccaneers built a small practice complex with offices near [[Tampa International Airport]] called One Buccaneer Place  - often shorted to \"One Buc Place\". The team utilized the unspectacular facility through the 1990s and into the early 2000s. As other NFL clubs began replacing and upgrading their respective facilities, Buccaneers players and coaches stepped up their complaints about the constant aircraft noise, cramped offices, small locker rooms, and decrepit condition of One Buc Place. Then-head coach Jon Gruden sarcastically referred to the facility as \"The Woodshed\", and some of the coaches' offices were actually converted broom [[closet]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/18/news_pf/Bucs/Time_to_say_goodbye.shtml|title=Time to say goodbye|publisher=St. Pete Times|first=Rick|last=Stroud|date=August 18, 2006|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> For much of the team's existence, the Buccaneers held [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]] on the [[University of Tampa]] campus, then at the expansive and better-equipped [[ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex|Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex]] near Orlando (2002\u20132008).\n\n[[File:Raymond James Stadium03.jpg|thumb|175px|The pirate ship at Raymond James Stadium]]\nIn August 2006, the Buccaneers unveiled a new $30 million training facility. Conveniently located across the street from [[Raymond James Stadium]] (on the former site of [[Tampa Bay Center]]), the state-of-the-art ({{convert|145000|sqft|adj=on}} facility on {{convert|33|acre}}) is one of the largest in the NFL. Its features include offices and meeting rooms, three natural grass practice fields, a theater for meetings and press conferences, an expanded weight room, a fully equipped kitchen and dining room, a rehabilitation center with three separate pools and a locker room twice the size of the former location. The building is capped off with a five-story glass and steel football as a key design element. An indoor practice field, featuring artificial turf, was completed in 2017. In 2009, the team began holding training camp at the new upgraded facilities in Tampa.\n\nIn the second week of September 2007, statues of important figures from the Bucs 2002 championship season were moved into the lobby area in an exhibit called \"Moment of Victory\". The life-size statues included players [[Mike Alstott]], [[Ronde Barber]], [[Derrick Brooks]], [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]], [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], [[Shelton Quarles]], [[Simeon Rice]], [[Warren Sapp]], and head coach [[Jon Gruden]].

However, the shade of green was too close to the teal that used by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. A medium shade of \"Florida Orange\" was substituted for green. Home uniforms included orange jerseys with white numerals outlined in red\u2014the now-infamous \"[[Creamsicle]]\" uniforms. Road white jerseys originally had orange numerals outlined in red, but these colors were reversed for year two and beyond. The color swap provided better visibility, especially for television coverage purposes.\n\nLong-time ''[[Tampa Tribune]]'' cartoonist and [[Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla]] member [[Lamar Sparkman]] designed the first team logo.<ref>Gershman, Rick. \"101 Gasparilla\".

[[Beloit College]], located in Beloit, Wisconsin, received a notice from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the college's illegitimate use of their mascot. Beloit College's buccaneer is the mirror image of the Tampa Bay buccaneer, with the creamsicle colors replaced with Beloit's school colors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mascotdb.com/team.php?id=40206 |title=Beloit College Buccaneers |publisher=MASCOTdb.com |date= |access-date=September 3, 2012}}</ref> Athletic Director Ed DeGeorge said Beloit's Buccaneers have used the logo since the early 1980s, when he chose it from a book while ordering decals for the football team's helmets. The NFL's Buccaneers joined the league in 1976.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} However, the Buccaneers withdrew their claim against Beloit College because of the independent decision to redesign the logo.\n\nIn 1992, the Buccaneers introduced orange pants to be worn with the white jerseys. Prior to the team's season finale in 1995 against the [[Detroit Lions|Lions]], coach [[Sam Wyche]] suggested that the Buccaneers wear the orange pants with their orange jerseys.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The idea was vetoed by, among others, Pro Bowl linebacker [[Hardy Nickerson]].\n\nFor the 1993 season, following Culverhouse's death, the Buccaneers added a commemorative patch to the right sleeve of their orange away uniforms, which read  \"Mr C\" in cursive script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucpower.com/feature-jahimiak.html|title=Collecting game-worn Buccaneer jerseys|author=Jake Jahimiak|date=May 2010|work=Bucpower.com|accessdate=December 28, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928051240/http://www.bucpower.com/feature-jahimiak.html|archivedate=September 28, 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132013===\n[[File:NFCS-Uniform-TB.png|thumb|left|250px|Buccaneer uniforms worn in the [[2012 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2012 season]], including the throwback orange uniform]]\n[[File:TBHelmet.jpg|thumbnail|Buccaneer helmet worn from 1997 to 2013]]\nFor the {{nfly|1997}} season, the Buccaneers worked with the NFL to develop a more marketable and intimidating look in order to improve the team's image. The Buccaneers changed their team colors to red, [[pewter]], black, and orange. \"Bucco Bruce\" was replaced by a red wind-swept flag displaying a white pirate skull and crossed [[sabre]]s which is a modified [[Jolly Roger]] (similar to that of [[Calico Jack]]). The flagpole was another larger sabre. The \"Buccaneers\" team name was written in a new font, ''Totally Gothic'', and was either red with shadows of pewter or red and white.

This new color scheme loosely resembled that of the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]], the [[United States Football League|USFL]] team that played in the region during their three-season existence from 1983 to 1985 and had a color scheme of red, silver, black and white.\n\nThe new uniforms provided a combination of either red or white jerseys with either pewter or white trousers. The white-on-white combination has been used numerous times during preseason and early regular season games, while the red-on-white combination has been used much less sparingly. The red-on-white has been used for some prime time home games, and other selected home games. Most games, home and away, have utilized pewter trousers.\n\nIn {{nfly|2003}}, the Buccaneers introduced a practice jersey that featured orange piping. In {{nfly|2004}}, a pewter practice jersey was used, with numerals in the ''Totally Gothic'' font. For 2005, the uniform featured a patch commemorating the club's 30th season.\n\nLike many other NFL teams located in [[subtropical climate]]s, the Buccaneers traditionally wear their white road jerseys at home during the first half of the season \u2013 forcing opponents to wear their darker colors during the hot summers and autumns in Tampa. Additionally, the visitors' bench of Raymond James Stadium is located on the east side of the stadium, which is in direct sunlight for games that kick off at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] games. The west sideline is in the shade. In {{nfly|1989}}, the Buccaneers started to wear white at home to accommodate [[Vinny Testaverde]]'s color blindness.

During the preseason, the Buccaneers usually wear white for their home games. The Buccaneers have worn their red jerseys for all home postseason games except for a January 6, 2008 playoff match up against the [[New York Giants|Giants]]. The Buccaneers wore white that day instead, as the temperature that day was unseasonably high. At [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], in which Tampa Bay was the designated home team, they elected to wear their red home jerseys.

The [[play-by-play]] announcer since 1989 has been [[Gene Deckerhoff]]. Former Bucs tight end [[Dave Moore (American football player)|Dave Moore]] joined Deckerhoff as analyst for the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]]. [[T. J. Rives]] works as the sideline reporter.\n\nBroadcast legend and former Green Bay Packers' announcer [[Ray Scott (sportscaster)|Ray Scott]] was the play-by-play man for the Bucs' first two seasons in 1976 and 1977. [[Dick Crippen]] called the team's games in the first half of the 1978 season, with Jim Gallogly taking over for the second half. From 1979 to 1988 [[Mark Champion]], who became the radio voice of the Detroit Lions (1989\u20132004) and then the Detroit Pistons (2001\u2013present), held that position with the Bucs.\n\nFormer Buccaneer [[Hardy Nickerson]] served as color commentator for one season in 2006, until he signed with the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] as a linebackers coach on February 23, 2007. Nickerson had replaced [[Scot Brantley]], who was the commentator from 1999 through 2005. [[Jesse Ventura]], the famous [[professional wrestler]], [[actor]], and former [[governor of Minnesota]], was Deckerhoff's partner on the Bucs radio broadcasts for one year, 1990, and former Buc [[David Logan (American football)|David Logan]] held that position after Ventura until his death after the 1998 season. [[Dave Kocerek]] and [[Fran Curci]] were also color commentors for the Buccaneers during their earlier years.\n\nRonnie Lane previously worked as a sideline reporter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucpower.com/crawford2.html|title=BUCPOWER.COM|website=www.bucpower.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Bucs have broadcast on FM radio since signing with [[Top 40]] station [[WRBQ-FM]] in {{nfly|1992}}.

The great majority of games are aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] owned-and-operated stations WTVT and WOFL, by virtue of Fox owning the rights to NFC games. WTSP and WKMG air any Buccaneers home games against [[American Football Conference]] teams. ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games on [[ESPN]] and Thursday night games on [[NFL Network]] are simulcast locally on [[WMOR-TV]], who also previously carried the Bucs' ''Sunday Night Football'' games when they were televised on ESPN and [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]]; previously, the Bucs' appearances on the cable networks were seen locally on WFLA-TV and [[WFTS]].\n\nWFLA was the previous home to Buccaneers preseason games, where they have been televised from 2003 to 2010.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} At WFLA, [[Chris Myers]] was the [[play-by-play]] announcer with [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] as color commentator. Both Myers and Lynch worked nationally with Fox Sports at the time until Lynch became the general manager of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in 2017. [[Ron Jaworski]] previously served as color commentator, until he signed with ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' for 2007.

The Buccaneers compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC South|South]] division. The club joined the NFL in {{nfly|1976}} as an [[expansion team]], along with the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Tampa Bay played its first season in the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division as part of the 1976 expansion plan, whereby each new franchise would play every other franchise over the first two years. After the season, the team switched conferences with the Seahawks and became a member of the [[NFC North|NFC Central]] division. During the 2002 league realignment, the Buccaneers joined three former [[NFC West]] teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the [[Malcolm Glazer|Glazer family]], and plays its home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa.\n\nThe Buccaneers are the first post-[[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] [[expansion team]] to win a division championship, a playoff game, and to host and play in a conference championship game; all three accomplishments occurred during the [[1979 NFL season|1979 season]]. They are also the first team since the merger to complete a winning season when starting 10 or more rookies, which happened in the 2010 season.  In 1976 and 1977, the Buccaneers lost their first 26 games. They would not win their first game in franchise history until Week 13, of 14, in 1977. After a brief winning era in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team suffered through 14 consecutive losing seasons. Then, for a 10-year period, they were consistent playoff contenders and won [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] at the end of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]], but have not yet returned to the Super Bowl.\n\n==\"Tampa Bay\"==\nThe name [[Tampa Bay Area|\"Tampa Bay\"]] is often used to describe a geographic metropolitan area which encompasses the cities around the body of water known as [[Tampa Bay]], including [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] and several smaller cities. Unlike in the case of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], there is no municipality known as \"Tampa Bay\". The \"Tampa Bay\" in the names of local professional sports franchises, such as the Buccaneers, [[Tampa Bay Lightning|Lightning]], [[Tampa Bay Rays|Rays]], [[Tampa Bay Rowdies|Rowdies]], and the former [[Tampa Bay Storm|Storm]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny|Mutiny]], denotes that they represent the entire region, not just the city of Tampa.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{main|History of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers}}\n\n===Origins===\nThe Tampa Bay expansion franchise was originally awarded to Tom McCloskey, a construction company owner from Philadelphia. McCloskey soon entered a financial dispute with the NFL, so the league found a replacement in Hugh Culverhouse, a wealthy tax attorney from Jacksonville. Culverhouse's handshake deal to purchase the Los Angeles Rams from the estate of Dan Reeves was thwarted by Robert Irsay's purchase of the team, which he then traded to Carroll Rosenbloom in exchange for the Baltimore Colts, a complete trade of teams between two owners. Culverhouse filed antitrust lawsuits in which he accused the NFL of conspiracy for preventing his purchase of the Rams, and as part of his settlement with the league, he was given priority when the NFL expanded soon thereafter.\n\nA name-the-team contest resulted in the nickname \"Buccaneers\", a reference to Jos\u00e9 Gaspar, the mythical Florida pirate who is the inspiration for Tampa's Gasparilla Pirate Festival. The team name was opposed by St. Petersburg businessmen on the grounds that it emphasized Tampa at the expense of other Bay Area cities, until NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle himself met with them to encourage their support. Their uniforms and \"Bucco Bruce\" winking pirate logo were designed by Tampa Tribune artist Lamar Sparkman using colors drawn from the state's four major college teams at the time: orange from the universities of Miami and Florida, and red from Florida State and the University of Tampa. They were one of the few teams to wear white home uniforms, forcing opponents to wear their warmer dark uniforms in Tampa's afternoon heat. The team's first home was Tampa Stadium, which had been built in 1967 to attract an NFL franchise and was expanded in 1974 to seat just over 72,500 fans.\n\nJohn McKay, a college coach who had led the University of Southern California Trojans to four national championships in the 1960s and 1970s, was named the Buccaneers' first head coach in early 1976. The Bucs soon traded for Steve Spurrier, who had won a Heisman Trophy at the University of Florida in 1966, to be their starting quarterback for their expansion season.\n\n===1976\u20131978===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:John McKay (American football).jpg|thumbnail|[[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]] was the team's first coach from 1976 to 1984.]] -->\nThe Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the [[AFC West]] in 1976. The following year, they were moved to the [[NFC North|NFC Central]], while the other 1976 expansion team, the [[Seattle Seahawks]], switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons. Instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice, the Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Answer Man, Series 2, Vol. 18|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/the-answer-man-series-2-vol-18-2145514|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=June 20, 2005|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTampa Bay did not win their first game until the 13th week of their [[1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|second season]], starting with a record of 0\u201326 (though the Bucs had beaten the [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], 17\u20133, in a 1976 pre-season game before their first regular season).<ref>Underwood, John. \"A Three-hour Time Difference\".

In the first, [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]] was put all over the goal posts in Tampa to prevent the goalposts from being ripped down in the event of a celebration. Four blocked kicks later, the Bucs wasted the oily substance, falling to the [[1979 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 23\u201322. STP was wasted again the following week as the Bucs were shut out 14\u20130 by the [[1979 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], and in [[O. J. Simpson]]'s final home game in [[1979 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]], Tampa Bay lost its third straight attempt to clinch a division title against a 49ers team which came in with a 1\u201313 record. However, in the season finale at home against the [[1979 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], which was played in the worst downpour in Bucs history, Tampa Bay pulled out a 3\u20130 victory. Finishing with a 10\u20136 record, the Bucs had their first winning season in franchise history, and won the Central Division in a tiebreaker over the Bears. In an upset, the Bucs defeated the [[1979 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] 24\u201317 in the divisional round of the [[NFL playoffs, 1979-80|playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html|title=SI.com \u2013 Sports Illustrated Covers \u2013 January 7, 1980|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612064908/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html|archivedate=June 12, 2007|df=}}</ref> Because the [[1979 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] defeated the [[1979 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the other NFC playoff game, the Bucs hosted the [[NFC Championship Game]] the following week in Tampa. The Bucs lost to the Rams 9\u20130. In their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay's five-year plan.\n\nThe Bucs made the playoffs again by winning their division in the [[1981 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1981 season]]. It came down to a thrilling final game at [[1981 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]]; the winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR [[Kevin House]] and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by DT [[David Logan (American football)|David Logan]] sealed the win for the Bucs. In the playoffs, the [[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] defeated the Bucs, 38\u20130, in the divisional round.\n\nThe [[1982 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1982 season]] started 0\u20133 for the Bucs, before a [[1982 NFL Players Strike|player's strike]] shut down the NFL for seven weeks. When the league resumed play, the Bucs were nicknamed the \"Cardiac Kids\" for winning five of their next six games, all in the final moments, to go 5\u20134 and qualify for the expanded playoff slate. In the first round, the Bucs once again faced the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] at Dallas, losing 30\u201317. As it turned out, this would be the last winning regular season under Culverhouse's ownership.\n\n===1983\u20131996===\nBefore the 1983 season, Williams bolted to the [[United States Football League]] in a salary dispute. The Bucs lost their first nine games of the 1983 season en route to finishing 2\u201314, the first of 12 consecutive seasons with at least ten losses\u2014an NFL record. Included was the drafting of [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Bo Jackson]] with the first pick in the [[1986 NFL Draft|1986 draft]]. Jackson had let it be known that he would never play a down for Hugh Culverhouse at Tampa Bay. Making good on his threat, he opted instead to play baseball for the [[Kansas City Royals]] and would later return for parts of football seasons with the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]]. Along with Williams, who later was a Super Bowl champion QB for Washington, two other Buc quarterbacks during this era led other teams to Super Bowl wins. [[Steve Young]] won with the 49ers and [[Trent Dilfer]] won with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nUnder Culverhouse, the Bucs were one of the NFL's more profitable teams during the 1980s; however, this was largely because he kept the payroll among the lowest in the league, hampering their ability to sign quality players. Attendance also sagged; at one point the Buccaneers went parts of three whole seasons without having a home game televised locally, and when they did it was more attributed to a strong visiting team with a large following in the area, such as the Chicago Bears or Green Bay Packers.\n\n[[Hardy Nickerson]], a future 5-time Pro Bowl linebacker, signed as a free agent from the Pittsburgh Steelers. [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], a future Pro Bowl strong safety, was drafted in 1993. In the [[1995 NFL draft]] the Buccaneers drafted two future Hall of Famers: [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]]. Pro Bowl Fullback, [[Mike Alstott]], was drafted the next year in the 1996 draft.\n\n===1994\u20131996===\nDespite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death in 1994 revealed a team close to [[bankruptcy]], which surprised many observers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} His son, [[Miami]] attorney Hugh Culverhouse Jr., practically forced{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} the trustees of his father's estate to sell the team, which cast doubt on the future of the franchise in Tampa. Interested parties included [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]] owner [[Peter Angelos]], the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to [[Baltimore]], as the city did not have an NFL franchise at that time.\n\nHowever, in a last-minute surprise, real estate magnate [[Malcolm Glazer]] outbid both of them for $192 million, the highest sale price for a professional sports franchise up to that point. Glazer immediately placed his sons [[Bryan Glazer|Bryan]], [[Edward Glazer|Edward]], and [[Joel Glazer|Joel]] in charge of the team's financial affairs. He stated that he had every intention of keeping the team in Tampa, but informed area citizens its current stadium deal would not support the record paid amount and that a new stadium would be required. The Glazers convinced [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] voters to raise sales taxes to fund the construction of what would become [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\nThe Glazers' deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team\u2013in Tampa Bay\u2013finally allowed the Bucs to become competitive. The team's performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator [[Tony Dungy]] as head coach, jettisoned the old uniform designs (see below).\n\n===1996\u20132001: Tony Dungy era===\nDuring [[1996 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Dungy's first season in 1996]], the team continued to struggle, starting the season 1\u20138. But in the second half of the season they finished 5\u20132, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by [[Hardy Nickerson]] and the maturing of Sam Wyche's draftees Brooks, Lynch, and Sapp. Dungy, with his even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team, and his [[Football coverage shells#Cover 2|Cover 2]] defensive scheme, sharpened to perfection by [[defensive coordinator]] [[Monte Kiffin]] and linebackers coach [[Lovie Smith]], became the foundation for Tampa Bay's future success.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Dungy to Join Buccaneers Ring of Honor|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/tony-dungy-to-join-buccaneers-ring-of-honor-20639092|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=February 4, 2019|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref> Their version of Cover 2 was so successful that it became known as the [[Tampa 2]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Varley|first=Teresa|title=Tony Dungy credits Chuck Noll with his defensive philosophy|url=http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Steelers.com|date=January 31, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209171311/http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|archive-date=February 9, 2007|access-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> It has been brought to the [[Chicago Bears]] by Smith, [[Detroit Lions]] by Rod Marinelli, [[Kansas City Chiefs]] by [[Herman Edwards]] and to the [[Indianapolis Colts]] by Dungy himself, and copied by several other teams.\n\nThe team started the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1997 season]] 5\u20130, picking up where they left off the previous year, and this quick start once again landed them on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|title=SI.com \u2013 Sports Illustrated Covers \u2013 September 8, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122458/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|title=SI.com \u2013 September 29, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122508/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref>  The Bucs went 10\u20136 for their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1982, as a wild-card team.

They lost at [[Lambeau Field]] to the eventual NFC champion [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 21\u20137.

The Bucs' loss was controversial, highlighted by the reversal of a pass from King to WR [[Bert Emanuel]], which ended the Bucs' chances at continuing their last-minute drive.

Several potential candidates were offered the job, including [[University of Florida]] head coach (and former Buccaneers quarterback) [[Steve Spurrier]], former [[New York Giants]] head coach [[Bill Parcells]], and Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator [[Marvin Lewis]]. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs' offer\u2014the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise. Bucs' general manager Rich McKay threw his support behind Lewis. The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was [[Jon Gruden]]; however, he was still under contract with the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nWhile talks with the Raiders were secretly under way, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, [[San Francisco 49ers]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]]. Just when initial reports indicated that Mariucci had agreed to become both the Bucs' head coach and their general manager, Raiders owner [[Al Davis]] agreed to release Gruden to Tampa Bay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/19/sports/pro-football-buccaneers-get-gruden-but-pay-a-steep-price.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; Buccaneers Get Gruden, But Pay a Steep Price|first=Buster|last=Olney|date=February 19, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Glazers' shrewd move eventually paid off in acquiring Gruden, but it was costly. The team hired Gruden away from the Raiders on February 20, 2002, but the price was four [[Draft (sports)|draft]] picks, including the Bucs' first and second round picks in 2002, their first round pick in 2003, and their second round selection in 2004, along with $8 million in cash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/sports/pro-football-raiders-get-a-pirate-s-booty-for-gruden.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; Raiders Get a Pirate's Booty for Gruden|first=Mike|last=Freeman|date=February 24, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>  (The league as a result prohibited any further trading of draft picks for coaches.) Gruden was frustrated by the limitation of his coaching authority by Davis and was more than pleased to return to Tampa Bay.

With a new Tailback, Wide Receiver, Two Tight Ends, Left Tackle, and Left Guard, Gruden put his stamp on the teams offense to remove the term \"Dungy's Team\" label.

Tampa Bay entered the game as heavy underdogs and fell behind early. However, the Bucs persevered and took a ten-point lead into the fourth quarter.

McKay, like Gruden, had long-established ties to the [[Tampa Bay area]]. However, during the [[2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2003 season]], the Gruden-McKay relationship deteriorated as the Bucs struggled on the field.

After a loss to the Detroit Lions, they were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs with a 4\u20139 record. The Bucs finished the season 5-11. This was their tenth consecutive season without a playoff appearance, with their last being in the 2007 season. Also, the Bucs finished last in the NFC South for the seventh time in nine seasons.\n\nThe Bucs began the 2018 season 2\u20130 for the first time since the [[2010 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2010 season]]. Journeyman quarterback [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] started the first two games after Jameis Winston was suspended during the off-season for the first three games. Fitzpatrick threw for over 400 yards and 4 touchdowns in the two-game winning streak, coming against the Saints (the eventual NFC South winner) and the Eagles (the defending [[Super Bowl LII|Super Bowl champions]]). Fitzpatrick would continue the success in week 3's Monday night game against the Steelers, throwing for another 400 yards and becoming the first player in NFL history to throw for 400 or more yards in three consecutive games. After Winston's suspension was up following the Monday Night game, Fitzpatrick remained the starter for week 4's matchup against the Bears. Fitzpatrick struggled and was benched after halftime for Winston. Winston returned as the starter in week 6. Despite the quarterback controversy, the Bucs had a top 3 offense, averaging 27.8 points during the first six games. However, their defense continued to struggle. After week 6's loss to the Falcons, defensive coordinator [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]] was fired and linebackers coach [[Mark Duffner]] was named the interim defensive coordinator. After a close overtime win against the Browns, Winston threw four interceptions against the Bengals the following week. After returning from suspension, Winston threw at least two interceptions per game, and due to that, Fitzpatrick was once again named the starter in week 9. Fitzpatrick, again, struggled, and Winston was renamed the starter for week 12's game against the 49ers. Winston improved, and the team won two straight. However, they dropped their last four games. After a second consecutive last-place season where the team finished with a 5\u201311 record, Koetter was fired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25649986/dirk-koetter-tampa-bay-buccaneers-head-coach |title=Dirk Koetter out as Bucs coach after going 5-11 in 3rd season |last=Laine |first=Jenna |date=December 30, 2018 |website=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |access-date=December 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====2019\u2013present: Bruce Arians era, \"TB\" to TB====\nFollowing the termination of [[Dirk Koetter]], the Buccaneers named [[Bruce Arians]] as the 12th head coach in franchise history on January 8, 2019.

Because Arians was still under contract with the Cardinals through the end of the 2019 season, Tampa Bay agreed to give the Cardinals a sixth-round pick in the [[2019 NFL Draft]] for the rights to Arians, as well as receiving Arizona's seventh-round pick in the same draft.

On the same day, the New England Patriots made an agreement to trade Gronkowski to the Buccaneers, along with a seventh-round pick in exchange for a compensatory fourth round pick in the [[2020 NFL Draft]].\n\n==Defense==\nThroughout their history, the Buccaneers have been known for their suffocating defense. It started with the drafting of Hall of Fame defensive end [[Lee Roy Selmon]] with their first pick ever in 1976. Three Buccaneer players have been named the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award|AP Defensive Player of the Year]], and the team has led the league in total defense on three occasions. The 2002 Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers had the number one Defense that year and it was one of the Greatest NFL Defenses of All Time along  with the 1985 Bears, 2000 Ravens and 2015 Broncos. All four of the Buccaneers [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] inductees are defensive players or coaches. \n===1978\u20131982===\nLed by Selmon, Linebackers [[Dewey Selmon]], [[Richard Wood (American football)|Richard Wood]], [[Dave Lewis (linebacker)|Dave Lewis]], and [[Mike Washington]], [[Mark Cotney]], and [[Cedric Brown]] in the secondary, the early years Buccaneers quickly earned an identity as a defensive team. Their 3\u20134 defense peaked in 1979 when they led the league in total defense, points allowed, and first downs allowed. Lee Roy Selmon was voted NFL Defensive Player of the Year, but they eventually fell 10 points short of the [[Super Bowl]] as the offense held them back in the NFC Championship game in a 9\u20130 loss to the [[Los Angeles Rams]].\n\n===1997\u20132008: The Tampa 2===\n{{main|Tampa 2}}\nThe team drafted franchise cornerstones [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] in 1993, and [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]] in 1995 to go along with All-Pro linebacker [[Hardy Nickerson]]. That was followed by the hiring of innovative defensive coordinator [[Monte Kiffin]] in 1996. The new-look Buccaneers set the stage for one of the greatest defensive runs in NFL history. From 1997 to 2008, the Buccaneers defense finished in the league's top ten every year but one, including eight top-5 finishes, and two top-ranked efforts. Kiffin along with head coach [[Tony Dungy]] created the \"[[Tampa 2]]\" defense, a modified version of the established [[Cover 2]] scheme.\n\nKiffin's defenses were known as gang tacklers with tremendous team speed with a front four that could pressure the quarterback consistently, fast sideline-to-sideline linebackers, and a hard-hitting secondary that caused turnovers. Many teams have copied the Tampa 2, but none have come close to the success the Buccaneers experienced led by numerous Pro Bowlers and Hall of Famers. The Tampa Bay defense featured future Hall of Famers, [[Derrick Brooks]] and [[Warren Sapp]], and Pro Bowlers, [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], [[Ronde Barber]], [[Hardy Nickerson]], [[Simeon Rice]], [[Shelton Quarles]], [[Donnie Abraham]], and [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] MVP [[Dexter Jackson (safety)|Dexter Jackson]]. Sapp and Nickerson were named to the [[National Football League 1990s All-Decade Team|1990s All-Decade 2nd Team]] while the [[National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team|2000s All-Decade Team]] featured Sapp and Brooks as 1st Team players and Ronde Barber on the 2nd Team.\n\n====2002 defense====\n[[File:Tampabaybucsplayersreunion.JPG|thumb|175px|Players from the 2002 team along with head coach Jon Gruden]]\nThe 2002 Buccaneers defense is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 2000 Ravens, 1985 Bears, 2015 Broncos, 1976 Steelers, and few others. In the regular season Tampa Bay led the league in total defense (252.8 ypg), points allowed (196), first downs allowed (14.8 pg), passing (155.6 ypg), interceptions (31), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opponent passer rating (48.4), and shutouts (2). They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43). [[Derrick Brooks]] was awarded AP Defensive Player of the Year as the defense led the way to a 12\u20134 regular season. The team was even better in the postseason allowing only 37 points in three games combined \u2013 all against top ten offenses. In those three playoff games, they intercepted 9 passes \u2013 returning 4 for touchdowns \u2013 and collected 11 sacks.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], the Buccaneers delivered one of the most impressive defensive performances in Super Bowl history. Playing against the #1 offense in the league led by league MVP [[Rich Gannon]], the defense actually outscored the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] offense, allowing 2 offensive touchdowns while returning 3 interceptions for touchdowns. The defense set two records in the 48\u201321 blowout, one for most interceptions in a Super Bowl (5), and one for most interceptions returned for touchdowns in a Super Bowl (3). In 19 total games in 2002, the Buccaneers recorded 40 interceptions, 53 sacks, and 9 defensive touchdowns.\n\n==Team facilities==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width =\n | image1 = Tampa Stadium1.jpg\n | width1 = 227\n | caption1 = [[Tampa Stadium]], where the Buccaneers played for their first 22 seasons\n | image2 = Raymond James Stadium01.jpg\n | width2 = 201\n | caption2 = [[Raymond James Stadium]], where the Buccaneers play\n}}\nSince 1998 the Buccaneers have played their home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa. Prior to that they played in [[Tampa Stadium]] since their establishment.\n\nIn 1975, the Buccaneers built a small practice complex with offices near [[Tampa International Airport]] called One Buccaneer Place  - often shorted to \"One Buc Place\". The team utilized the unspectacular facility through the 1990s and into the early 2000s. As other NFL clubs began replacing and upgrading their respective facilities, Buccaneers players and coaches stepped up their complaints about the constant aircraft noise, cramped offices, small locker rooms, and decrepit condition of One Buc Place. Then-head coach Jon Gruden sarcastically referred to the facility as \"The Woodshed\", and some of the coaches' offices were actually converted broom [[closet]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/18/news_pf/Bucs/Time_to_say_goodbye.shtml|title=Time to say goodbye|publisher=St. Pete Times|first=Rick|last=Stroud|date=August 18, 2006|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> For much of the team's existence, the Buccaneers held [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]] on the [[University of Tampa]] campus, then at the expansive and better-equipped [[ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex|Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex]] near Orlando (2002\u20132008).\n\n[[File:Raymond James Stadium03.jpg|thumb|175px|The pirate ship at Raymond James Stadium]]\nIn August 2006, the Buccaneers unveiled a new $30 million training facility. Conveniently located across the street from [[Raymond James Stadium]] (on the former site of [[Tampa Bay Center]]), the state-of-the-art ({{convert|145000|sqft|adj=on}} facility on {{convert|33|acre}}) is one of the largest in the NFL. Its features include offices and meeting rooms, three natural grass practice fields, a theater for meetings and press conferences, an expanded weight room, a fully equipped kitchen and dining room, a rehabilitation center with three separate pools and a locker room twice the size of the former location. The building is capped off with a five-story glass and steel football as a key design element. An indoor practice field, featuring artificial turf, was completed in 2017. In 2009, the team began holding training camp at the new upgraded facilities in Tampa.\n\nIn the second week of September 2007, statues of important figures from the Bucs 2002 championship season were moved into the lobby area in an exhibit called \"Moment of Victory\". The life-size statues included players [[Mike Alstott]], [[Ronde Barber]], [[Derrick Brooks]], [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]], [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], [[Shelton Quarles]], [[Simeon Rice]], [[Warren Sapp]], and head coach [[Jon Gruden]].

However, the shade of green was too close to the teal that used by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. A medium shade of \"Florida Orange\" was substituted for green. Home uniforms included orange jerseys with white numerals outlined in red\u2014the now-infamous \"[[Creamsicle]]\" uniforms. Road white jerseys originally had orange numerals outlined in red, but these colors were reversed for year two and beyond. The color swap provided better visibility, especially for television coverage purposes.\n\nLong-time ''[[Tampa Tribune]]'' cartoonist and [[Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla]] member [[Lamar Sparkman]] designed the first team logo.<ref>Gershman, Rick. \"101 Gasparilla\".

[[Beloit College]], located in Beloit, Wisconsin, received a notice from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the college's illegitimate use of their mascot. Beloit College's buccaneer is the mirror image of the Tampa Bay buccaneer, with the creamsicle colors replaced with Beloit's school colors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mascotdb.com/team.php?id=40206 |title=Beloit College Buccaneers |publisher=MASCOTdb.com |date= |access-date=September 3, 2012}}</ref> Athletic Director Ed DeGeorge said Beloit's Buccaneers have used the logo since the early 1980s, when he chose it from a book while ordering decals for the football team's helmets. The NFL's Buccaneers joined the league in 1976.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} However, the Buccaneers withdrew their claim against Beloit College because of the independent decision to redesign the logo.\n\nIn 1992, the Buccaneers introduced orange pants to be worn with the white jerseys. Prior to the team's season finale in 1995 against the [[Detroit Lions|Lions]], coach [[Sam Wyche]] suggested that the Buccaneers wear the orange pants with their orange jerseys.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The idea was vetoed by, among others, Pro Bowl linebacker [[Hardy Nickerson]].\n\nFor the 1993 season, following Culverhouse's death, the Buccaneers added a commemorative patch to the right sleeve of their orange away uniforms, which read  \"Mr C\" in cursive script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucpower.com/feature-jahimiak.html|title=Collecting game-worn Buccaneer jerseys|author=Jake Jahimiak|date=May 2010|work=Bucpower.com|accessdate=December 28, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928051240/http://www.bucpower.com/feature-jahimiak.html|archivedate=September 28, 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132013===\n[[File:NFCS-Uniform-TB.png|thumb|left|250px|Buccaneer uniforms worn in the [[2012 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2012 season]], including the throwback orange uniform]]\n[[File:TBHelmet.jpg|thumbnail|Buccaneer helmet worn from 1997 to 2013]]\nFor the {{nfly|1997}} season, the Buccaneers worked with the NFL to develop a more marketable and intimidating look in order to improve the team's image.

The flagpole was another larger sabre. The \"Buccaneers\" team name was written in a new font, ''Totally Gothic'', and was either red with shadows of pewter or red and white.

This new color scheme loosely resembled that of the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]], the [[United States Football League|USFL]] team that played in the region during their three-season existence from 1983 to 1985 and had a color scheme of red, silver, black and white.\n\nThe new uniforms provided a combination of either red or white jerseys with either pewter or white trousers. The white-on-white combination has been used numerous times during preseason and early regular season games, while the red-on-white combination has been used much less sparingly. The red-on-white has been used for some prime time home games, and other selected home games. Most games, home and away, have utilized pewter trousers.\n\nIn {{nfly|2003}}, the Buccaneers introduced a practice jersey that featured orange piping. In {{nfly|2004}}, a pewter practice jersey was used, with numerals in the ''Totally Gothic'' font. For 2005, the uniform featured a patch commemorating the club's 30th season.\n\nLike many other NFL teams located in [[subtropical climate]]s, the Buccaneers traditionally wear their white road jerseys at home during the first half of the season \u2013 forcing opponents to wear their darker colors during the hot summers and autumns in Tampa. Additionally, the visitors' bench of Raymond James Stadium is located on the east side of the stadium, which is in direct sunlight for games that kick off at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] games. The west sideline is in the shade. In {{nfly|1989}}, the Buccaneers started to wear white at home to accommodate [[Vinny Testaverde]]'s color blindness.

During the preseason, the Buccaneers usually wear white for their home games. The Buccaneers have worn their red jerseys for all home postseason games except for a January 6, 2008 playoff match up against the [[New York Giants|Giants]]. The Buccaneers wore white that day instead, as the temperature that day was unseasonably high. At [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], in which Tampa Bay was the designated home team, they elected to wear their red home jerseys. This was despite the kickoff temperature of {{convert|81|F|C}}, one of the hottest Super Bowls on record.<ref>{{cite news|title=Super Bowl Game-Time Temperatures|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/super-bowl-game-time-temperatures/|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|access-date=March 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Buccaneers' 1997 uniform change prompted a 2003 lawsuit by the Raiders, who claimed that the NFL and the Buccaneers had infringed upon key [[trademark]] elements of the Raiders' brand, including the Raiders' pirate logo.

Former Bucs tight end [[Dave Moore (American football player)|Dave Moore]] joined Deckerhoff as analyst for the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]]. [[T. J. Rives]] works as the sideline reporter.\n\nBroadcast legend and former Green Bay Packers' announcer [[Ray Scott (sportscaster)|Ray Scott]] was the play-by-play man for the Bucs' first two seasons in 1976 and 1977. [[Dick Crippen]] called the team's games in the first half of the 1978 season, with Jim Gallogly taking over for the second half. From 1979 to 1988 [[Mark Champion]], who became the radio voice of the Detroit Lions (1989\u20132004) and then the Detroit Pistons (2001\u2013present), held that position with the Bucs.\n\nFormer Buccaneer [[Hardy Nickerson]] served as color commentator for one season in 2006, until he signed with the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] as a linebackers coach on February 23, 2007. Nickerson had replaced [[Scot Brantley]], who was the commentator from 1999 through 2005. [[Jesse Ventura]], the famous [[professional wrestler]], [[actor]], and former [[governor of Minnesota]], was Deckerhoff's partner on the Bucs radio broadcasts for one year, 1990, and former Buc [[David Logan (American football)|David Logan]] held that position after Ventura until his death after the 1998 season. [[Dave Kocerek]] and [[Fran Curci]] were also color commentors for the Buccaneers during their earlier years.\n\nRonnie Lane previously worked as a sideline reporter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucpower.com/crawford2.html|title=BUCPOWER.COM|website=www.bucpower.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Bucs have broadcast on FM radio since signing with [[Top 40]] station [[WRBQ-FM]] in {{nfly|1992}}.

The great majority of games are aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] owned-and-operated stations WTVT and WOFL, by virtue of Fox owning the rights to NFC games. WTSP and WKMG air any Buccaneers home games against [[American Football Conference]] teams. ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games on [[ESPN]] and Thursday night games on [[NFL Network]] are simulcast locally on [[WMOR-TV]], who also previously carried the Bucs' ''Sunday Night Football'' games when they were televised on ESPN and [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]]; previously, the Bucs' appearances on the cable networks were seen locally on WFLA-TV and [[WFTS]].\n\nWFLA was the previous home to Buccaneers preseason games, where they have been televised from 2003 to 2010.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} At WFLA, [[Chris Myers]] was the [[play-by-play]] announcer with [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] as color commentator. Both Myers and Lynch worked nationally with Fox Sports at the time until Lynch became the general manager of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in 2017. [[Ron Jaworski]] previously served as color commentator, until he signed with ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' for 2007.
