The scale of the song's success surprised everyone and there were no plans to promote Thunderclap Newman with live performances. Eventually a line-up - augmented by  Jim Pitman-Avory on bass and McCulloch's elder brother Jack on drums - played a handful of gigs. Personal records say the band played live only five times, although Keen referred to a two-month tour, playing \"everywhere\". In the UK, a follow-up single, \"Accidents\", came out only in May 1970 and charted at No. 46 for a week. An album, ''Hollywood Dream'', peaked in ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' at No. 163. Thus, the song and the band were forever linked as a [[one hit wonder]].

It later appeared in ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'' (1996), ''[[Almost Famous]]'' (2000), ''[[The Dish]]'' (2000), and ''[[The Girl Next Door (2004 film)|The Girl Next Door]]'' (2004). It also appeared on and was the title of the second disc in the Deluxe Edition of the ''[[Easy Rider (soundtrack)|Easy Rider]]'' soundtrack.\n\n\"Something in the Air\" has been used extensively in television, most notably on an advertisement for [[British Airways]] which featured [[PJ O'Rourke]]. The song also appeared in a [[retro]] [[Television advertisement|TV advert]] for the [[Austin Mini]] in the early 1990s, featuring 1960s fashion model ''[[Twiggy]]''. More recently, a version of the song was used in the advertisements for the mobile phone service provider [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]]. (A similar advert for TalkTalk shown at the beginning of advert breaks during ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' features the opening bars). The song was featured in a number of episodes of 1960s-set UK police series ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]''. It is also used as the 'on hold' music for The Carphone Warehouse, of which Talk Talk is a part. The song was also featured in the pilot episode of the American television show ''[[Aliens in America]]'' and in the third-season episode ''[[Creative Writing (My Name Is Earl)|Bad Earl]]'' of ''[[My Name Is Earl]]''.  A version of the song recorded by [[Ocean Colour Scene]] was previously used by telephone provider [[Ionica (company)|Ionica]]. In 2008, this song appeared in a [[Coca-Cola]] commercial in [[Taiwan]]. It was also recently used in an episode of ''[[Prime Suspect 1973]]''.\n\n==Musical quotation==\n\"Something in the Air\" features a short burst of ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' - the national anthem of France. The ''revolution'' reference in the song's lyrics has subtly been hinted at in the synthesised brass arrangement from 3'30\". ''La Marseillaise'' also features in the ''[[1812 Overture]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] and in the opening of the [[Beatles]]' 1967 single [[All You Need Is Love]].\n\n==Covers==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Something in the Air\n| cover      = Something in the air tom petty.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]\n| album      = [[Greatest Hits (Tom Petty album)|Greatest Hits]]\n| released   = January 31, 1994\n| format     =\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 3:17\n| label      = [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]\n| writer     = {{hlist|[[Speedy Keen]]}}\n| producer   = [[Rick Rubin]]\n| prev_title = [[Mary Jane's Last Dance]]\n| prev_year  = 1993\n| next_title = [[You Don't Know How It Feels]]\n| next_year  = 1994\n}}\nThe song has been covered by a number of artists, including:\n* The [[Mandrake Memorial]] in 1969\n* [[Labelle]] in 1973\n* [[Herbie Mann]] in 1974\n* [[Simon Park]] in 1974\n* [[Gamma (band)|Gamma]] in 1980\n* [[Eurythmics]] in 1985\n* [[Fish (singer)|Fish]] in 1991\n* [[The Lightning Seeds]] and [[Trip Shakespeare]] in 1992\n* [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] in 1994\n* [[U.K. Subs]] in 2000\n* [[The Superjesus]] in 2001\n* [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] and [[Wellwater Conspiracy]] in 2003\n* [[Wilco]] live in late 2004 and throughout 2005 \n* [[Hayley Sanderson]] in 2006{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n* [[Donald Fagen]] with the [[Dukes of September]]\n* [[Polyphonic Spree]] live since 2010\n* New Zealand/Australian band [[Dragon (band)|Dragon]] covered the song on their album, ''[[It's All Too Beautiful (album)|It's All Too Beautiful]]'' (2011). \n* [[Dixie Chicks]] live on select final dates of the [[DCX MMXVI World Tour]] in 2017.\n* [[Luna (1990s American band)|Luna]] on their 2019 album ''Postscripts''.

[[Labelle]] recorded an emotional cover of it alongside \"[[The Revolution Will Not Be Televised]]\" by [[Gil Scott-Heron]] for their 1973 album, ''[[Pressure Cookin']]''.\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Speedy Keen]] - [[double tracking|double-tracked]] lead vocal, drums\n*[[Jimmy McCulloch]] - lead and rhythm guitars\n*[[Pete Townshend]] - bass guitar (credited to \"Bijou Drains\"), orchestral arrangement\n*Andy \"Thunderclap\" Newman - piano, lead vocals on \"Wilhelmina\"\n\n==Chart performance (Thunderclap Newman version)==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1969)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany|13|artist=Thunderclap Newman|song=Something in the Air }}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch100|9|artist=Thunderclap Newman|song=Something in the Air }}\n|-\n{{singlechart|UKsinglesbyname|1|artist=Thunderclap Newman|song=Something in the Air}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|37|artist=Thunderclap Newman|song=Something in the Air }}\n|}\n\n==Appearance in other media==\n\"Something in the Air\" by Thunderclap Newman appeared on the soundtracks of several films, such as ''[[The Magic Christian (film)|The Magic Christian]]'' (1969), which helped the single reach No. 37 in the United States, and ''[[The Strawberry Statement (film)|The Strawberry Statement]]'' (1970), which prompted a reissue of the single that \"bubbled under\" the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 at No. 120. It later appeared in ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'' (1996), ''[[Almost Famous]]'' (2000), ''[[The Dish]]'' (2000), and ''[[The Girl Next Door (2004 film)|The Girl Next Door]]'' (2004). It also appeared on and was the title of the second disc in the Deluxe Edition of the ''[[Easy Rider (soundtrack)|Easy Rider]]'' soundtrack.\n\n\"Something in the Air\" has been used extensively in television, most notably on an advertisement for [[British Airways]] which featured [[PJ O'Rourke]]. The song also appeared in a [[retro]] [[Television advertisement|TV advert]] for the [[Austin Mini]] in the early 1990s, featuring 1960s fashion model ''[[Twiggy]]''. More recently, a version of the song was used in the advertisements for the mobile phone service provider [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]]. (A similar advert for TalkTalk shown at the beginning of advert breaks during ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' features the opening bars). The song was featured in a number of episodes of 1960s-set UK police series ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]''. It is also used as the 'on hold' music for The Carphone Warehouse, of which Talk Talk is a part. The song was also featured in the pilot episode of the American television show ''[[Aliens in America]]'' and in the third-season episode ''[[Creative Writing (My Name Is Earl)|Bad Earl]]'' of ''[[My Name Is Earl]]''.  A version of the song recorded by [[Ocean Colour Scene]] was previously used by telephone provider [[Ionica (company)|Ionica]]. In 2008, this song appeared in a [[Coca-Cola]] commercial in [[Taiwan]]. It was also recently used in an episode of ''[[Prime Suspect 1973]]''.\n\n==Musical quotation==\n\"Something in the Air\" features a short burst of ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' - the national anthem of France. The ''revolution'' reference in the song's lyrics has subtly been hinted at in the synthesised brass arrangement from 3'30\". ''La Marseillaise'' also features in the ''[[1812 Overture]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] and in the opening of the [[Beatles]]' 1967 single [[All You Need Is Love]].\n\n==Covers==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Something in the Air\n| cover      = Something in the air tom petty.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]\n| album      = [[Greatest Hits (Tom Petty album)|Greatest Hits]]\n| released   = January 31, 1994\n| format     =\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 3:17\n| label      = [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]\n| writer     = {{hlist|[[Speedy Keen]]}}\n| producer   = [[Rick Rubin]]\n| prev_title = [[Mary Jane's Last Dance]]\n| prev_year  = 1993\n| next_title = [[You Don't Know How It Feels]]\n| next_year  = 1994\n}}\nThe song has been covered by a number of artists, including:\n* The [[Mandrake Memorial]] in 1969\n* [[Labelle]] in 1973\n* [[Herbie Mann]] in 1974\n* [[Simon Park]] in 1974\n* [[Gamma (band)|Gamma]] in 1980\n* [[Eurythmics]] in 1985\n* [[Fish (singer)|Fish]] in 1991\n* [[The Lightning Seeds]] and [[Trip Shakespeare]] in 1992\n* [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] in 1994\n* [[U.K. Subs]] in 2000\n* [[The Superjesus]] in 2001\n* [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] and [[Wellwater Conspiracy]] in 2003\n* [[Wilco]] live in late 2004 and throughout 2005 \n* [[Hayley Sanderson]] in 2006{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n* [[Donald Fagen]] with the [[Dukes of September]]\n* [[Polyphonic Spree]] live since 2010\n* New Zealand/Australian band [[Dragon (band)|Dragon]] covered the song on their album, ''[[It's All Too Beautiful (album)|It's All Too Beautiful]]'' (2011). \n* [[Dixie Chicks]] live on select final dates of the [[DCX MMXVI World Tour]] in 2017.\n* [[Luna]] on their 2019 album 'Postscripts'.

The  son of [[Malcolm I of Scotland|Malcolm I]] (M\u00e1el Coluim mac Domnaill), he succeeded [[Cuil\u00e9n|King Cuil\u00e9n]] (Cuil\u00e9n mac Iduilb) on the latter's death at the hands of [[Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal]] in 971.\n\n==Primary sources==\nThe ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'' was compiled in Kenneth's reign, but many of the place names mentioned are entirely corrupt, if not fictitious.<ref>Duncan, p. 21.</ref> Whatever the reality, the Chronicle states that \"[h]e immediately plundered <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> in part. Kenneth's infantry were slain with very great slaughter in Moin Uacoruar.\" The Chronicle further states that Kenneth plundered [[Northumbria]] three times, first as far as Stainmore, then to ''Cluiam'' and lastly to the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] by [[Chester]]. These raids may belong to around 980, when the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records attacks on [[Cheshire]].<ref>''ESSH'', p. 512; Duncan, p.25.</ref>\n\nIn 973, the ''[[Chronicle of Melrose]]'' reports that Kenneth, with [[M\u00e1el Coluim I of Strathclyde|M\u00e1el Coluim I]] (M\u00e1el Coluim mac Domnaill), the [[King of Strathclyde]], \"Maccus, king of very many islands\" (i.e. Magnus Haraldsson ([[Maccus mac Arailt]]), [[King of Mann and the Isles]]) and other kings, [[Wales|Welsh]] and [[Norsemen|Norse]], came to [[Chester]] to acknowledge the overlordship of the English king [[Edgar of England|Edgar the Peaceable]]<ref>''ESSH'', pp. 478&ndash;479; ''SAEC'', pp. 75&ndash;78.</ref> at [[King Edgar's council at Chester|a council in Chester]]. It may be that Edgar here regulated the frontier between the southern lands of the kingdom of Alba and the northern lands of his English kingdom. [[Cumbria]] was English, the western frontier lay on the [[Solway Firth|Solway]]. In the east, the frontier lay somewhere in later [[Lothian]], south of [[Edinburgh]].<ref>Duncan, pp.24&ndash;25.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'', in an aside, name three of the [[Mormaer]]s of Alba in Kenneth's reign in entry in 976: [[Cellach mac F\u00edndgaine]], [[Cellach mac Baireda]] and [[Donnchad mac Morga\u00ednd]]. The third of these, if not an error for Domnall mac Morga\u00ednd, is very likely a brother of Domnall, and thus the [[Mormaer of Moray]]. The Mormaerdoms or kingdoms ruled by the two Cellachs cannot be identified.<!--This could well be original research since I have lost the reference, if any, on which it is based.-->\n\nThe feud which had persisted since the death of [[Indulf of Scotland|King Indulf]] (Idulb mac Causant\u00edn) between his descendants and Kenneth's family persisted. In 977 the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' report that \"Amla\u00edb mac Iduilb <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Amla\u00edb, King of Scotland|Amla\u00edb]], son of Indulf<nowiki>]</nowiki>, King of Scotland, was killed by Cin\u00e1ed mac Domnaill.\" The ''Annals of Tigernach'' give the correct name of Amla\u00edb's killer: ''Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Coluim'', or Kenneth II. Thus, even if only for a short time, Kenneth had been overthrown by the brother of the previous king.<ref>Duncan, pp. 21&ndash;22; ''ESSH'', p. 484.</ref>\n\n[[Adam of Bremen]] tells that [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn Forkbeard]] found exile in Scotland at this time, but whether this was with Kenneth, or one of the other kings in Scotland, is unknown. Also at this time, ''[[Njal's Saga]]'', the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'' and other sources recount wars between \"the Scots\" and the Northmen, but these are more probably wars between [[Sigurd Hlodvisson]], [[Earl of Orkney]], and the Mormaers, or Kings, of Moray.<ref>See ''ESSH'', pp. 483&ndash;484 & 495&ndash;502.</ref>\n\nThe Chronicle says that Kenneth founded a great monastery at [[Brechin]].\n\nKenneth was killed in 995, the ''Annals of Ulster'' say \"by deceit\" and the ''Annals of Tigernach'' say \"by his subjects\". Some later sources, such as the ''[[Chronicle of Melrose]]'',  [[John of Fordun]] and [[Andrew of Wyntoun]] provide more details, accurately or not. The simplest account is that he was killed by his own men in [[Fettercairn]], through the treachery of Finnguala (also called Fimberhele or Fenella), daughter of [[Cuncar of Angus|Cuncar]], [[Mormaer of Angus]], in revenge for the killing of her only son.<ref>The name of Cuncar's daughter is given as Fenella, Finele or Sibill in later sources. John of Fordun credits [[Constantine III of Scotland|Constantine III]] (Causant\u00edn mac Cuil\u00e9n) and [[Kenneth III of Scotland|Kenneth III]] (Cin\u00e1ed mac Duib) with the planning, claiming that Kenneth II planned to change the laws of succession. See ''ESSH'', pp. 512&ndash;515.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n]]'' adds little to our knowledge, except that it names Kenneth \"the kinslayer\", and states he died in [[Strathmore, Angus and Perth & Kinross|Strathmore]].<ref>''ESSH'', p. 516.</ref>\n\n==Children==\n\nKenneth's son [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]] (M\u00e1el Coluim mac Cin\u00e1eda)  was later king of Alba. Kenneth may have had a second son, named either D\u00fangal or Gille Coemg\u00e1in.<ref>''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'', s.a. 998: \"D\u00fangal Cin\u00e1ed's son, was killed by Gille Coemg\u00e1in, Cin\u00e1ed's son.\" It is not clear if the Cin\u00e1eds (Kenneths) referred to are Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Coluim (Kenneth II) or his nephew and namesake Cin\u00e1ed mac Duib (Kenneth III). Smyth, pp. 221&ndash;222, makes D\u00fangal following ''ESSH'' p. 580.</ref> Sources differ as to whether [[Boite mac Cin\u00e1eda]] should be counted a son of Kenneth II or of Kenneth III (Cin\u00e1ed mac Duib).<ref>Compare Duncan, p.345 and Lynch (ed), Genealogies, at about p. 680. See also ''ESSH'', p. 580.</ref> Another son of Kenneth may have been [[Suibne mac Cin\u00e1eda]], a king of the ''[[Gall Gaidheil]]'' who died in 1034.\n\n==Interpretation==\nKenneth's rival [[Amla\u00edb, King of Scotland]] is omitted by the ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'' and later Scottish king-lists. The Irish [[Annals of Tigernach]] appear to better reflect contemporary events. Amla\u00edb could be a direct predecessor of Kenneth who suffered [[damnatio memoriae]], or the rival king recognized in parts of Scotland. A period of divided kingship appears likely.<ref name=\"Woolf\">Woolf (2007), p. 205-206</ref>\n\nAmla\u00edb was the heir of his brother [[Cuil\u00e9n]], who was killed in a hall-burning. He might have served as a regent north of the [[River Forth]], during the absence of his brother. Kenneth was brother to the deceased [[Dub, King of Scotland]] and was most likely an exile. He could claim the throne due to the support of friends and maternal kin. He was likely older and more experienced than his rival king.<ref name=\"Woolf\">Woolf (2007), p. 205-206</ref> Amla\u00edb is the Gaelic form of \u00d3l\u00e1fr, suggesting maternal descent from [[Norsemen]]. He could possibly claim descent from the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] dynasty. Alex Woolf suggests he was a grandson of [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]], [[Kingdom of Dublin|King of Dublin]] or his cousin [[Olaf Guthfrithson]], which suggests his own group of supporters.<ref name=\"Woolf\">Woolf (2007), p. 205-206</ref>\n\n==Death==\nAccording to [[John of Fordun]] (14th century), Kenneth II of Scotland (reigned 971-995) attempted to change the succession rules, allowing \"''the nearest survivor in blood to the deceased king to succeed''\", thus securing the throne for his own descendants. He reportedly did so to specifically exclude Constantine (III) and Kenneth (III), called Gryme in this source. The two men then jointly conspired against him, convincing [[Lady Finella]], daughter of [[Cuncar of Angus|Cuncar]], [[Mormaer of Angus]], to kill the king. She reportedly did so to achieve personal revenge, as Kenneth II had killed her own son. Entries in ''the Chronicles of the Picts and Scots'', collected by [[William Forbes Skene]], provide the account of Finnela killing Kenneth II in revenge, but not her affiliation to Constantine or his cousins. These entries date to the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>{{harvnb|Cawley|2011|loc=[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SCOTLAND.htm#_Toc253996179 Malcolm]}}.Listing includes all kings descended from him, excluding Kenneth III.</ref><ref>The name of Cuncar's daughter is given as Fenella, Finele or Sibill in later sources.

Entry U995.1]</ref>\n\nIn the account of John of Fordun, [[Constantine III of Scotland|Constantine III]] and Gryme were \"plotting unceasingly the death of the king and his son\". One day, Kenneth II and his companions went hunting into the woods, \"at no great distance from his own abode\". The hunt took him to [[Fettercairn]], where Finella resided. She approached him to proclaim her loyalty and invited him to visit her residence, whispering into his ear that she had information about a conspiracy plot. She managed to lure him to \"an out-of-the-way little cottage\", where a [[booby trap]] was hidden. Inside the cottage was a statue, connected by strings to a number of [[crossbow]]s. If anyone touched or moved the statue, he would trigger the crossbows and fall victim to their arrows. Kenneth II gently touched the statue and \"was shot through by arrows sped from all sides, and fell without uttering another word.\" Finella escaped through the woods and managed to join her [[abettor]]s, Constantine III and Gryme. The hunting companions soon discovered the bloody king. They were unable to locate Finella, but burned Fettercairn to the ground.<ref name=\"Skene\">[https://archive.org/details/johnoffordunschr00fordrich Skene, John of Fordun's Chronicle of the Scottish nation, Book IV, Chapters XXXII-XXXIV (32-34), pages 165-169]</ref> Smyth dismisses the elaborate plotting and the mechanical contraption as mere fables, but accepts the basic details of the story, that the succession plans of Kenneth II caused his assassination.<ref name=\"Smyth2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxxwmg48bFgC&pg=PA226 Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000, p. 224-225]</ref> [[Alan Orr Anderson]] raised his own doubts concerning the story of  Finella, which he considered \"semi-mythical\". He noted that the feminine name Finnguala or Findguala means \"white shoulders\", but suggested it derived from \"find-ela\" (white swan).

The  son of [[Malcolm I of Scotland|Malcolm I]] (M\u00e1el Coluim mac Domnaill), he succeeded [[Cuil\u00e9n|King Cuil\u00e9n]] (Cuil\u00e9n mac Iduilb) on the latter's death at the hands of [[Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal]] in 971.\n\n==Primary sources==\nThe ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'' was compiled in Kenneth's reign, but many of the place names mentioned are entirely corrupt, if not fictitious.<ref>Duncan, p. 21.</ref> Whatever the reality, the Chronicle states that \"[h]e immediately plundered <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> in part. Kenneth's infantry were slain with very great slaughter in Moin Uacoruar.\" The Chronicle further states that Kenneth plundered [[Northumbria]] three times, first as far as Stainmore, then to ''Cluiam'' and lastly to the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] by [[Chester]]. These raids may belong to around 980, when the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records attacks on [[Cheshire]].<ref>''ESSH'', p. 512; Duncan, p.25.</ref>\n\nIn 973, the ''[[Chronicle of Melrose]]'' reports that Kenneth, with [[M\u00e1el Coluim I of Strathclyde|M\u00e1el Coluim I]] (M\u00e1el Coluim mac Domnaill), the [[King of Strathclyde]], \"Maccus, king of very many islands\" (i.e. Magnus Haraldsson ([[Maccus mac Arailt]]), [[King of Mann and the Isles]]) and other kings, [[Wales|Welsh]] and [[Norsemen|Norse]], came to [[Chester]] to acknowledge the overlordship of the English king [[Edgar of England|Edgar the Peaceable]]<ref>''ESSH'', pp. 478&ndash;479; ''SAEC'', pp. 75&ndash;78.</ref> at [[King Edgar's council at Chester|a council in Chester]]. It may be that Edgar here regulated the frontier between the southern lands of the kingdom of Alba and the northern lands of his English kingdom. [[Cumbria]] was English, the western frontier lay on the [[Solway Firth|Solway]]. In the east, the frontier lay somewhere in later [[Lothian]], south of [[Edinburgh]].<ref>Duncan, pp.24&ndash;25.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'', in an aside, name three of the [[Mormaer]]s of Alba in Kenneth's reign in entry in 976: [[Cellach mac F\u00edndgaine]], [[Cellach mac Baireda]] and [[Donnchad mac Morga\u00ednd]]. The third of these, if not an error for Domnall mac Morga\u00ednd, is very likely a brother of Domnall, and thus the [[Mormaer of Moray]]. The Mormaerdoms or kingdoms ruled by the two Cellachs cannot be identified.<!--This could well be original research since I have lost the reference, if any, on which it is based.-->\n\nThe feud which had persisted since the death of [[Indulf of Scotland|King Indulf]] (Idulb mac Causant\u00edn) between his descendants and Kenneth's family persisted. In 977 the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' report that \"Amla\u00edb mac Iduilb <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Amla\u00edb, King of Scotland|Amla\u00edb]], son of Indulf<nowiki>]</nowiki>, King of Scotland, was killed by Cin\u00e1ed mac Domnaill.\" The ''Annals of Tigernach'' give the correct name of Amla\u00edb's killer: ''Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Coluim'', or Kenneth II. Thus, even if only for a short time, Kenneth had been overthrown by the brother of the previous king.<ref>Duncan, pp. 21&ndash;22; ''ESSH'', p. 484.</ref>\n\n[[Adam of Bremen]] tells that [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn Forkbeard]] found exile in Scotland at this time, but whether this was with Kenneth, or one of the other kings in Scotland, is unknown. Also at this time, ''[[Njal's Saga]]'', the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'' and other sources recount wars between \"the Scots\" and the Northmen, but these are more probably wars between [[Sigurd Hlodvisson]], [[Earl of Orkney]], and the Mormaers, or Kings, of Moray.<ref>See ''ESSH'', pp. 483&ndash;484 & 495&ndash;502.</ref>\n\nThe Chronicle says that Kenneth founded a great monastery at [[Brechin]].\n\nKenneth was killed in 995, the ''Annals of Ulster'' say \"by deceit\" and the ''Annals of Tigernach'' say \"by his subjects\". Some later sources, such as the ''[[Chronicle of Melrose]]'',  [[John of Fordun]] and [[Andrew of Wyntoun]] provide more details, accurately or not. The simplest account is that he was killed by his own men in [[Fettercairn]], through the treachery of Finnguala (also called Fimberhele or Fenella), daughter of [[Cuncar of Angus|Cuncar]], [[Mormaer of Angus]], in revenge for the killing of her only son.<ref>The name of Cuncar's daughter is given as Fenella, Finele or Sibill in later sources. John of Fordun credits [[Constantine III of Scotland|Constantine III]] (Causant\u00edn mac Cuil\u00e9n) and [[Kenneth III of Scotland|Kenneth III]] (Cin\u00e1ed mac Duib) with the planning, claiming that Kenneth II planned to change the laws of succession. See ''ESSH'', pp. 512&ndash;515.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n]]'' adds little to our knowledge, except that it names Kenneth \"the kinslayer\", and states he died in [[Strathmore, Angus and Perth & Kinross|Strathmore]].<ref>''ESSH'', p. 516.</ref>\n\n==Children==\n\nKenneth's son [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]] (M\u00e1el Coluim mac Cin\u00e1eda)  was later king of Alba. Kenneth may have had a second son, named either D\u00fangal or Gille Coemg\u00e1in.<ref>''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'', s.a. 998: \"D\u00fangal Cin\u00e1ed's son, was killed by Gille Coemg\u00e1in, Cin\u00e1ed's son.\" It is not clear if the Cin\u00e1eds (Kenneths) referred to are Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Coluim (Kenneth II) or his nephew and namesake Cin\u00e1ed mac Duib (Kenneth III). Smyth, pp. 221&ndash;222, makes D\u00fangal following ''ESSH'' p. 580.</ref> Sources differ as to whether [[Boite mac Cin\u00e1eda]] should be counted a son of Kenneth II or of Kenneth III (Cin\u00e1ed mac Duib).<ref>Compare Duncan, p.345 and Lynch (ed), Genealogies, at about p. 680. See also ''ESSH'', p. 580.</ref> Another son of Kenneth may have been [[Suibne mac Cin\u00e1eda]], a king of the ''[[Gall Gaidheil]]'' who died in 1034.\n\n==Interpretation==\nKenneth's rival [[Amla\u00edb, King of Scotland]] is omitted by the ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'' and later Scottish king-lists. The Irish [[Annals of Tigernach]] appear to better reflect contemporary events. Amla\u00edb could be a direct predecessor of Kenneth who suffered [[damnatio memoriae]], or the rival king recognized in parts of Scotland. A period of divided kingship appears likely.<ref name=\"Woolf\">Woolf (2007), p. 205-206</ref>\n\nAmla\u00edb was the heir of his brother [[Cuil\u00e9n]], who was killed in a hall-burning. He might have served as a regent north of the [[River Forth]], during the absence of his brother. Kenneth was brother to the deceased [[Dub, King of Scotland]] and was most likely an exile. He could claim the throne due to the support of friends and maternal kin. He was likely older and more experienced than his rival king.<ref name=\"Woolf\">Woolf (2007), p. 205-206</ref> Amla\u00edb is the Gaelic form of \u00d3l\u00e1fr, suggesting maternal descent from [[Norsemen]]. He could possibly claim descent from the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] dynasty. Alex Woolf suggests he was a grandson of [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]], [[Kingdom of Dublin|King of Dublin]] or his cousin [[Olaf Guthfrithson]], which suggests his own group of supporters.<ref name=\"Woolf\">Woolf (2007), p. 205-206</ref>\n\n==Death==\nAccording to [[John of Fordun]] (14th century), Kenneth II of Scotland (reigned 971-995) attempted to change the succession rules, allowing \"''the nearest survivor in blood to the deceased king to succeed''\", thus securing the throne for his own descendants. He reportedly did so to specifically exclude Constantine (III) and Kenneth (III), called Gryme in this source. The two men then jointly conspired against him, convincing [[Lady Finella]], daughter of [[Cuncar of Angus|Cuncar]], [[Mormaer of Angus]], to kill the king. She reportedly did so to achieve personal revenge, as Kenneth II had killed her own son. Entries in ''the Chronicles of the Picts and Scots'', collected by [[William Forbes Skene]], provide the account of Finnela killing Kenneth II in revenge, but not her affiliation to Constantine or his cousins. These entries date to the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>{{harvnb|Cawley|2011|loc=[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SCOTLAND.htm#_Toc253996179 Malcolm]}}.Listing includes all kings descended from him, excluding Kenneth III.</ref><ref>The name of Cuncar's daughter is given as Fenella, Finele or Sibill in later sources.

One day, Kenneth II and his companions went hunting into the woods, \"at no great distance from his own abode\". The hunt took him to [[Fettercairn]], where Finella resided. She approached him to proclaim her loyalty and invited him to visit her residence, whispering into his ear that she had information about a conspiracy plot. She managed to lure him to \"an out-of-the-way little cottage\", where a [[booby trap]] was hidden. Inside the cottage was a statue, connected by strings to a number of [[crossbow]]s. If anyone touched or moved the statue, he would trigger the crossbows and fall victim to their arrows. Kenneth II gently touched the statue and \"was shot though by arrows sped from all sides, and fell without uttering another word.\" Finella escaped through the woods and managed to join her [[abettor]]s, Constantine III and Gryme. The hunting companions soon discovered the bloody king. They were unable to locate Finella, but burned Fettercairn to the ground.<ref name=\"Skene\">[https://archive.org/details/johnoffordunschr00fordrich Skene, John of Fordun's Chronicle of the Scottish nation, Book IV, Chapters XXXII-XXXIV (32-34), pages 165-169]</ref> Smyth dismisses the elaborate plotting and the mechanical contraption as mere fables, but accepts the basic details of the story, that the succession plans of Kenneth II caused his assassination.<ref name=\"Smyth2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxxwmg48bFgC&pg=PA226 Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000, p. 224-225]</ref> [[Alan Orr Anderson]] raised his own doubts concerning the story of  Finella, which he considered \"semi-mythical\". He noted that the feminine name Finnguala or Findguala means \"white shoulders\", but suggested it derived from \"find-ela\" (white swan). The name figures in toponyms such as Finella Hill (near [[Fordoun]]) and Finella Den (near [[St Cyrus]]), while local tradition in The Mearns ([[Kincardineshire]]) has Finella walking atop the treetops from one location to the other.

The population was 405 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\n[[Arconic]] has an aluminum rolling mill in Riverdale that employs approximately 2,000 people. The city is surrounded on three sides by the far larger, albeit more boring, city of [[Bettendorf, Iowa|Bettendorf]], and on the fourth by the [[Mississippi River]]. Riverdale is part of the [[Quad Cities]] metropolitan area.\n\n==History==\nIn 1912, Iowana Dairy Farms was established by Col. G. W. French in what is today the city of Riverdale. French's herd of [[Holstein cattle]] became one of the largest and most outstanding in the United States.  After the death of Col. French, Glenn Moore took over part of the operation as Iowana Milk Farm, and G. Decker French operated the other part of the operation as Iowana Holstein Farm.  The Aluminum Company of America, (ALCOA), moved to the area in 1946.  By the middle of 1948 the new plant's construction was finished and operations began in 1949.\n\nThe city of Riverdale was incorporated December 27, 1950. After a three-year incorporation challenge by the city of Bettendorf, the Iowa Supreme Court upheld the incorporation and the city of Riverdale was granted its independence on February 10, 1953.\n\nRiverdale is part of the Quad Cities community. The area was originally called the Tri-Cities which included Moline, Rock Island, and Davenport.  Later the name was changed to the Quad Cities with the addition of East Moline. Today the Quad Cities community consists of the larger cities of Davenport, Iowa; Bettendorf, Iowa; Moline, Illinois; Rock Island, Illinois; and East Moline, Illinois, as well as surrounding smaller cities Eldridge, Long Grove, Park View, Blue Grass, Buffalo, Walcott, Maysville, Mount Joy, Pleasant Valley, LeClaire, Panorama Park, and Riverdale in Iowa and Silvis, Milan, Hampton, Carbon Cliff, Port Byron, Andalusia, Coal Valley, and Colona in Illinois. The Quad Cities has a total population of over 380,000 people.\n\n==Geography==\nRiverdale is located at {{coord|41|32|8|N|90|28|2|W|type:city}} (41.535466, \u221290.467216).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.20|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|1.84|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.36|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-05-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=January 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\nThere are several distinct neighborhoods in Riverdale:  \n* Belmont Road - There are two clusters of homes along Belmont Road: one is directly adjacent to Pleasant Valley High School and the other is near the intersection of Belmont Road and Pleasant Ridge Drive.\n* Fenno Hill - This neighborhood consists of homes along Fenno Drive, Fenno Road and Valley Drive near the eastern edge of the community.\n* Haven's Acres - This neighborhood consists of homes along Bellingham Street, Kensington Street, Wisteria Lane and Sycamore Lane.

The population was 405 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\n[[Arconic]] has an aluminum rolling mill in Riverdale that employs approximately 2,000 people. The city is surrounded on three sides by the far larger city of [[Bettendorf, Iowa|Bettendorf]], and on the fourth by the [[Mississippi River]]. Riverdale is part of the [[Quad Cities]] metropolitan area.\n\n==History==\nIn 1912, Iowana Dairy Farms was established by Col. G. W. French in what is today the city of Riverdale. French's herd of [[Holstein cattle]] became one of the largest and most outstanding in the United States.  After the death of Col. French, Glenn Moore took over part of the operation as Iowana Milk Farm, and G. Decker French operated the other part of the operation as Iowana Holstein Farm.  The Aluminum Company of America, (ALCOA), moved to the area in 1946.  By the middle of 1948 the new plant's construction was finished and operations began in 1949.\n\nThe city of Riverdale was incorporated December 27, 1950. After a three-year incorporation challenge by the city of Bettendorf, the Iowa Supreme Court upheld the incorporation and the city of Riverdale was granted its independence on February 10, 1953.\n\nRiverdale is part of the Quad Cities community. The area was originally called the Tri-Cities which included Moline, Rock Island, and Davenport.  Later the name was changed to the Quad Cities with the addition of East Moline. Today the Quad Cities community consists of the larger cities of Davenport, Iowa; Bettendorf, Iowa; Moline, Illinois; Rock Island, Illinois; and East Moline, Illinois, as well as surrounding smaller cities Eldridge, Long Grove, Park View, Blue Grass, Buffalo, Walcott, Maysville, Mount Joy, Pleasant Valley, LeClaire, Panorama Park, and Riverdale in Iowa and Silvis, Milan, Hampton, Carbon Cliff, Port Byron, Andalusia, Coal Valley, and Colona in Illinois. The Quad Cities has a total population of over 380,000 people.\n\n==Geography==\nRiverdale is located at {{coord|41|32|8|N|90|28|2|W|type:city}} (41.535466, \u221290.467216).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.20|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|1.84|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.36|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-05-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=January 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\nThere are several distinct neighborhoods in Riverdale:  \n* Belmont Road - There are two clusters of homes along Belmont Road: one is directly adjacent to Pleasant Valley High School and the other is near the intersection of Belmont Road and Pleasant Ridge Drive.\n* Fenno Hill - This neighborhood consists of homes along Fenno Drive, Fenno Road and Valley Drive near the eastern edge of the community.\n* Haven's Acres - This neighborhood consists of homes along Bellingham Street, Kensington Street, Wisteria Lane and Sycamore Lane.

The [[parish church]], [[St Cadoc's Church, Caerleon|St Cadoc's]] was founded on the site of the legionary headquarters building probably sometime in the 6th century. A [[Norman architecture|Norman]]-style [[motte and bailey]] [[castle]] was built outside the eastern corner of the old Roman fort, possibly by the Welsh Lord of Caerleon, [[Caradog ap Gruffydd]]. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 recorded that a small colony of eight [[carucates]] of land (about 1.5 square miles) in the jurisdiction of Caerleon, seemingly just within the Welsh Lordship of [[Gwynllwg]], was held by [[Turstin FitzRolf]], standard bearer to William the Conqueror at Hastings, subject to [[William d'Ecouis]], a magnate of unknown antecedents with lands in Hereford, Norfolk and other counties.<ref name=domesday>{{Cite web|url=http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/|title=The Domesday Book Online - Home|website=www.domesdaybook.co.uk}}</ref> Also listed on the manor were three Welshmen with as many ploughs and carucates, who continued their Welsh customs (''leges Walensi viventes'').<ref name=domesday/> Caerleon itself may have remained in Welsh hands, or may have changed hands frequently.<ref name=\"caerbaer\">Jermyn, Anthony. \"[http://www.acanterthroughcaerleon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=58 4: Caerleon Through the Centuries to the Year 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620143235/http://www.acanterthroughcaerleon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=58 |date=20 June 2013}}\". 2010 Accessed 13 Feb 2013.</ref>\n\nFrom the apparent banishment of Turstin by William II, Turstin's lands were transferred in 1088 by [[Wynebald de Ballon]], brother of [[Hamelin de Ballon]] who held [[Abergavenny]] further up the River Usk.

Caerleon was an important market and port and possibly became a [[borough]] by 1171, although no independent charters exist. In 1171 Iorwerth ab Owain and his two sons destroyed the town of Caerleon and burned the Castle. Both castle and borough were seized by [[William Marshal]] from [[Morgan ap Hywel]] in 1217 and Caerleon castle was rebuilt in stone. The remains of many of the old Roman buildings stood to some height until this time and were probably demolished for their building materials.\n\n===Welsh Revolt===\n[[File:Caerleon-Round Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|Round Tower at The Hanbury Arms in 2010]]\n\nDuring the [[Glynd\u0175r Rising|Welsh Revolt]] in 1402 [[Rhys Gethin]], General for [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], took Caerleon Castle together with those of Newport, Cardiff, Llandaff, Abergavenny, Caerphilly and Usk by force.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = The Bull Inn, Caerleon, June 2007 | url = http://www.thebellatcaerleon.co.uk/info/glyndwr.htm | title = Owain Glyndwr, The Bell at Caerleon | accessdate = 9 October 2008}}</ref> This was probably the last time Caerleon castle was ruined, though the walls were still standing in 1537 and the castle ruins only finally collapsed in 1739 - their most obvious remnant is the Round Tower at the Hanbury Arms public house.

Until the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] development of the downstream docks at [[Newport Docks]], Caerleon acted as the major port on the River Usk. The wharf was located on the right bank, to the west of today's river bridge which marked the limit of navigability for masted ships.

The jaw of the skull could be made to move, with the aid of rods. Hando's informant, Gus Sergeant of Bulmoor, reported that the Mari Lwyd had not been seen in the town for at least 20 years, but he was still able to describe it:\n<blockquote>\n\"We filled the eye-holes with wadding and '[[Marble (toy)|pop alleys]]' and fixed great ears made of wadding stiffened with cardboard; then we stuck rosettes on the sides of the skull and strung long coloured ribbons as reins.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nOne man acted as leader of the Mari, holding the ribbons, and then came the Mari itself draped in a white sheet. It was followed by three singers, who sang in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] although \"they didn't understand the words\". On occasion, the procession of the Mari Lwyd would start as far north as [[Newbridge-on-Usk]] and proceed through the town, ending as far south as [[Goldcliff]]. The party would be invited into houses along the way and given \"money and home-made cakes and gallons of beer\". Another of Hando's informants provides a description, dated 1841, of the Yuletide tradition:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The custom of chaunting at their neighbours' doors on the [[twelfth night]] ... on which occasion they are fantastically dressed with ribbons of various colours. One of the party carries a horse's head decorated in the same manner. Representations of trees, to which are appended apples and oranges, are also carried about, and on one of the branches an artificial bird, called \"Aderyn Pica Llwyd\" (the grey hobgoblin bird) is placed.\"<ref>[[Fred Hando|Hando, F.J.]], (1951) \"Journeys in Gwent\", R.

The jaw of the skull could be made to move, with the aid of rods. Hando's informant, Gus Sergeant of Bulmoor, reported that the Mari Lwyd had not been seen in the town for at least 20 years, but he was still able to describe it:\n<blockquote>\n\"We filled the eye-holes with wadding and '[[Marble (toy)|pop alleys]]' and fixed great ears made of wadding stiffened with cardboard; then we stuck rosettes on the sides of the skull and strung long coloured ribbons as reins.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nOne man acted as leader of the Mari, holding the ribbons, and then came the Mari itself draped in a white sheet. It was followed by three singers, who sang in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] although \"they didn't understand the words\". On occasion, the procession of the Mari Lwyd would start as far north as [[Newbridge-on-Usk]] and proceed through the town, ending as far south as [[Goldcliff]]. The party would be invited into houses along the way and given \"money and home-made cakes and gallons of beer\". Another of Hando's informants provides a description, dated 1841, of the Yuletide tradition:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The custom of chaunting at their neighbours' doors on the [[twelfth night]] ... on which occasion they are fantastically dressed with ribbons of various colours. One of the party carries a horse's head decorated in the same manner. Representations of trees, to which are appended apples and oranges, are also carried about, and on one of the branches an artificial bird, called \"Aderyn Pica Llwyd\" (the grey hobgoblin bird) is placed.\"<ref>[[Fred Hando|Hando, F.J.]], (1951) \"Journeys in Gwent\", R.
