The [[Dragon Ball (manga)|initial manga]], written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by its publisher [[Shueisha]]. ''Dragon Ball'' was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', as well as [[Hong Kong martial arts films]]. The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, [[Goku|Son Goku]], from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named [[Bulma]], who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man, discovers his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls. <onlyinclude>\n\nToriyama's [[manga]] was adapted and divided into two [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]]: ''[[Dragon Ball (TV series)|Dragon Ball]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed [[List of Dragon Ball films|20 animated feature films]] and three television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'' (1996\u20131997) and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' (2015\u20132018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of ''Dragon Ball Z'' aired in Japan under the title ''Dragon Ball Kai'', as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with [[List of Dragon Ball soundtracks|several collections of soundtracks]] and [[List of Dragon Ball video games|numerous video games]]. ''Dragon Ball'' is one of the top twenty [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]], having generated more than {{US$|20 billion|long=no}} in total franchise revenue as of 2018</onlyinclude>.<ref name=\"sfchronicle\"/>\n\nSince its release, ''Dragon Ball'' has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time, with the manga sold in over 40{{nbsp}}countries and the anime broadcast in more than 80{{nbsp}}countries. The manga's 42 collected ''tank\u014dbon'' volumes have sold over 160{{nbsp}}million copies in Japan, and are estimated to have sold more 250{{ndash}}300 million copies worldwide, making it the second [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, behind only ''[[One Piece]]''.<!-- This is referenced in the reception section below. --> Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humour of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential manga series ever made, with many [[Mangaka|manga artists]] citing ''Dragon Ball'' as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly ''Dragon Ball Z'', is also highly popular across the world and is considered one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture. It has had a considerable impact on global [[popular culture]], referenced by and inspiring numerous artists, athletes, celebrities, filmmakers, musicians and writers across the world.\n\n==Setting==\nThe Dragon Ball story takes place on Earth where Goku goes on adventures to find the Dragon Balls, as well as aspiring to become a great fighter, and compete in multiple martial arts tournaments. Goku later stops the evil Red Ribbon Army, then 3 years later, thwarts the Grand Demon King Piccolo's plans for world conquest, afterwards he and his friends protect the Earth from the Saiyan invasion. The setting also goes to Planet Namek later on in the series for Bulma, Gohan, and Kuririn to revive Goku's fallen friends from the Saiyan's attack, where they encounter Vegeta's higher ups, as well as the cosmic emperor, Freeza.\n\nThe ''Dragon Ball'' franchise is set in a [[multiverse]]<ref>''SOS from the Future: A Dark New Enemy Appears!'', [[Funimation]] dub</ref> composed of twelve{{refn|name=Multiverse|group=N|Originally there were eighteen universes, but six of them were since erased by Zeno, a supreme deity.}} numbered universes, each ruled by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities, respectively called Supreme Kais and Gods of Destruction. Almost all of the ''Dragon Ball'' series, except for parts of ''Dragon Ball Super'', takes place in Universe 7. Years in the timeline are called \"Ages\", with most of the story occurring between Age 749 and Age 790.\n\nUniverse 7 contains several planets, including a fictionalized Earth, where humans reside, and Planet Vegeta, the home world of the Saiyans, a powerful and destructive race. Many other races also inhabit Universe 7, including Angels, Demons, Androids, Tuffles and Namekians. Humans are among the weakest races in the universe. The protagonist Goku is raised as a human on Earth but finds out that he is actually a Saiyan from Planet Vegeta.\n\n''[[Dr. Slump]]'', an earlier manga series by Akira Toriyama, is set in the same multiverse.\n\n== Production ==\n{{See also|List of Dragon Ball characters|Dragon Ball (manga)#Production}}\n[[File:Akira Toriyama.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Akira Toriyama]], the creator of ''Dragon

The [[Dragon Ball (manga)|initial manga]], written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by its publisher [[Shueisha]]. ''Dragon Ball'' was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', as well as [[Hong Kong martial arts films]]. The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, [[Goku|Son Goku]], from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named [[Bulma]], who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man, discovers his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls. <onlyinclude>\n\nToriyama's [[manga]] was adapted and divided into two [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]]: ''[[Dragon Ball (TV series)|Dragon Ball]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed [[List of Dragon Ball films|20 animated feature films]] and three television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'' (1996\u20131997) and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' (2015\u20132018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of ''Dragon Ball Z'' aired in Japan under the title ''Dragon Ball Kai'', as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with [[List of Dragon Ball soundtracks|several collections of soundtracks]] and [[List of Dragon Ball video games|numerous video games]].

The manga's 42 collected ''tank\u014dbon'' volumes have sold over 160{{nbsp}}million copies in Japan, and are estimated to have sold more 250{{ndash}}300 million copies worldwide, making it the second [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, behind only ''[[One Piece]]''.<!-- This is referenced in the reception section below. --> Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humour of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential manga series ever made, with many [[Mangaka|manga artists]] citing ''Dragon Ball'' as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly ''Dragon Ball Z'', is also highly popular across the world and is considered one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture. It has had a considerable impact on global [[popular culture]], referenced by and inspiring numerous artists, athletes, celebrities, filmmakers, musicians and writers across the world.\n\n==Setting==\nThe Dragon Ball story takes place on Earth where Goku goes on adventures to find the Dragon Balls, as well as aspiring to become a great fighter, and compete in multiple martial arts tournaments. Goku later stops the evil Red Ribbon Army, then 3 years later, thwarts the Grand Demon King Piccolo's plans for world conquest, afterwards he and his friends protect the Earth from the Saiyan invasion. The setting also goes to Planet Namek later on in the series for Bulma, Gohan, and Kuririn to revive Goku's fallen friends from the Saiyan's attack, where they encounter Vegeta's higher ups, as well as the cosmic emperor, Freeza.\n\nThe ''Dragon Ball'' franchise is set in a [[multiverse]]<ref>''SOS from the Future: A Dark New Enemy Appears!'', [[Funimation]] dub</ref> composed of twelve{{refn|name=Multiverse|group=N|Originally there were eighteen universes, but six of them were since erased by Zeno, a supreme deity.}} numbered universes, each ruled by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities, respectively called Supreme Kais and Gods of Destruction. Almost all of the ''Dragon Ball'' series, except for parts of ''Dragon Ball Super'', takes place in Universe 7. Years in the timeline are called \"Ages\", with most of the story occurring between Age 749 and Age 790.\n\nUniverse 7 contains several planets, including a fictionalized Earth, where humans reside, and Planet Vegeta, the home world of the Saiyans, a powerful and destructive race. Many other races also inhabit Universe 7, including Angels, Demons, Androids, Tuffles and Namekians. Humans are among the weakest races in the universe. The protagonist Goku is raised as a human on Earth but finds out that he is actually a Saiyan from Planet Vegeta.\n\n''[[Dr. Slump]]'', an earlier manga series by Akira Toriyama, is set in the same multiverse.\n\n== Production ==\n{{See also|List of Dragon Ball characters|Dragon Ball (manga)#Production}}\n[[File:Akira Toriyama.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Akira Toriyama]], the creator of ''Dragon
