He goes to her home and poisons her coffee, but cannot go through with it and slaps the cup out of her hand.

When Alberto awakes, he arrests the Professor and brings him to jail. The Professor uses the bathroom at the prison and beats himself up to make it look like it was done by Alberto. He calls Raquel who helps release him. Meanwhile, the robbers start losing hope after many hours without news from the Professor, and Tokyo begins a mutiny after becoming restless.

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. Raquel visits \u00c1ngel in the hospital, where the police arrest her. At a moral crossroads, she initially refuses to divulge the Professor's hideout, but when Colonel Prieto threatens her with several charges that would ensure her daughter be taken away from her, she finally tells him. As the police race to the hideout, a tactical squad inside the Mint is fought off by Berlin so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, despite the Professor's desperate calls for him to come. Berlin insistently continues, and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police arrive to the empty hideout. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force and that the robbers' whereabouts are still unknown. When Raquel notices coordinates on a postcard previously given to her by the Professor, she tracks him down in [[Palawan]], Philippines, and smiles at him.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019\u201320)===\n{{Episode table |background=#000000 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=15 |director=12 |writer=38 |airdate=25 |airdateR=<ref name=\"TFC\">{{cite web |title=Money Heist \u2013 Listings |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/la-casa-de-papel/listings/ |website=[[The Futon Critic]] |accessdate=24 March 2020}}</ref> |aux1T=English title |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode table/part|p=3|c=#000000}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 16\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = Hemos vuelto\n| AltTitle        = We're Back\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Over two years after the heist, Arturo gives a talk to a large crowd condemning the fugitive members of the gang who held him and others hostage at the Mint as \"terrorists\". Meanwhile, Tokyo and Rio have relocated to [[Guna Yala]], Panama, Nairobi and Helsinki to [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], Argentina, and Denver, M\u00f3nica and her baby to [[Java]], Indonesia. Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio. The professor enlists three new members, Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille, into the gang and begins planning an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]], from an Italian monastery.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 17\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Aikido\n| AltTitle        = Aikido\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, Juan Salvador L\u00f3pez, Luis Moya, Alberto \u00dacar, David Barrocal\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = The Professor initiates the plan to rob the Bank of Spain using [[airships]] to release money across Madrid. The government responds by mobilizing the army, which the robbers use to provide cover and entry into the Bank. In flashbacks, the Professor recruits Mart\u00edn, an experienced thief and former associate to replace Berlin (Andr\u00e9s). The Professor and Mart\u00edn (now code named \"Palermo\") explain that their strategy for this robbery is based on ''[[Aikido]]'', a martial art that uses an enemy's force to create an advantage. As the robbers enter the Bank, public sentiment rallies to their side in the form of mass government protests and riots over the illegal imprisonment of Rio, demanding that he receive a public trial.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 18\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = 48 metros bajo el suelo\n| AltTitle        = 48 Meters Underground\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, Juan Salvador L\u00f3pez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = While commandeering the Bank, the robbers engage in a series of intense conflicts with guards and government officials. Palermo, the commander in charge, is temporarily blinded in the struggle, but retains command after Nairobi removes glass shrapnel from his eyes, and the guards restrained. The robbers locate accomplices among the hostages who were previously planted in the Bank and go to work on opening the vault, which is rigged to flood with water once tampered with. Bogot\u00e1, uses his expertise in diving and welding to overcome the lock down, granting access to the gold.

Colonel Tamayo and Alicia Sierra prove to be formidable adversaries, as they quickly realize that they must change their strategies drastically from the first robbery. Sierra tortures Rio for more information and Tamayo plans an assault on the bank with Su\u00e1rez. The robbers reveal that they know about a second, secret vault behind the gold and attempt to persuade the governor of the bank to open it for them.

Given no other option, the robbers detonate the inner vault door inside the flooded main chamber. It works and grants them access to \"the red boxes\"\u2014cases filled with government secrets that were too dangerous to lock anywhere else. Tamayo's assault begins, taking the robbers and the Professor by surprise. To stall for time and prevent bloodshed, Denver runs into the line of fire with a truce flag carrying two of the red cases, which forces Tamayo to stop. He reveals to Sierra the contents of the cases and that the Professor has the advantage\u2014an attack might force the robbers to make the secrets public. However, Sierra is able to unbalance the Professor and Raquel Murillo (now code-named \"Lisbon\"), with psychological taunting. Inside the bank, the team divides when Nairobi and Palermo disagree over the use of force on the unruly restrained guards.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels of their [[RV]] sink in mud. They narrowly escape detection with the help of some sympathetic local farmers. They then manage to inform the team of the breach 10 minutes before it happens, who defeat, capture, unclothe, and humiliate the breaching team by forcing them sing \"[[Bella ciao]]\" on video.

At the exchange, Rio is shocked by the massive crowds gathered in support of the robbers, wearing red jumpsuits and Dal\u00ed masks. The exchange proceeds smoothly and he rejoins the robbers. During the reunion, the police and government intelligence team listen in on their conversations, having planted a listening device inside Rio before releasing him. In flashbacks, the Professor instructs the team, preparing them to detect and remove these devices surgically from Rio, if the time comes. After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working. Privately, Rio breaks up with Tokyo, believing that she will be better off with someone else. Nairobi surgically removes the listening device. The police manage to locate the Professor and Lisbon using a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], forcing them to separate and try to escape on foot; the Professor camouflages himself in a tree, while Lisbon is unable, she takes refuge in a barn.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 23\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = La deriva\n| AltTitle        = Astray\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, \u00c1lex Pina, Almudena Ram\u00edrez-Pantanella, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Tokyo drinks herself into a semi-[[stupor]] as a result of her breakup and insults Rio. In the forest, a massive manhunt begins for the Professor and Raquel. Raquel is discovered in the barn by farmers, which begins a [[Mexican Standoff]]. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Meanwhile, Sierra uses Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Sierra brings Nairobi's son, Axel, in front of the bank, luring Nairobi to a window. Sierra gives the green light for a police sniper to shoot, and Nairobi is shot in the chest. As the robbers scramble to aid an [[exsanguinating]] Nairobi, the police begin the assault. In the forest, Su\u00e1rez and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] find Raquel and remove the farmers from the barn. The Professor hears gunshots over Raquel's microphone, and thinking she is executed, becomes distraught. Palermo radios the Professor to inform him of the incoming assault and the Professor declares [[DEFCON]] 2. Tokyo and Rio destroy the approaching armoured car with [[RPG-7]]s. Afterwards, it is revealed that Raquel is alive and in custody, with Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap, that Sierra had ordered Su\u00e1rez to fake an execution to elicit a drastic response, stating that \"the war had begun.\"\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|p=4|c=#295E6E}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 24\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Game Over\n| AltTitle        = Game Over\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra\n| WrittenBy       = Esther Morales, Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = The gang rushes to save Nairobi's life, but given the risks surrounding the surgery that they must perform on her, she pleads to be released to the police so that she can get proper care. Meanwhile, the Professor, at first distraught at believing Lisbon to be executed, manages to escape the forest after Marseille lures the police away with a tracker they believe to be the Professor escaping. After an argument between gang members develops about the decision to perform surgery on Nairobi, Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], and leads the surgery with the video aid of a surgeon in Pakistan. The Professor develops a truce with Tamayo for 48 hours to assess Nairobi. In flashbacks, Nairobi convinces Tokyo that she ask the Professor to be the leader of the heist, but the Professor insists that since Palermo came up with the idea for the heist, he will be in charge.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 25\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n| Title           = La boda de Berl\u00edn\n| AltTitle        = Berlin's Wedding\n| DirectedBy      = Javier Quintas\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Tokyo ultimately leads the successful surgery of Nairobi, removing the bullet by cutting out a portion of her lung. With Tokyo in charge, the ego-centric Palermo is about to walk out of the bank before he is restrained to a chair by the gang. Meanwhile, Lisbon is transported to a police tent outside the bank, where she is interrogated by Sierra. Tokyo calls the Professor, who is furious at her coup, however, Tokyo helps him deduce that the police had staged Lisbon's execution and that she is being interrogated inside the police tent. In flashbacks, Marseille, Bogot\u00e1 and the Professor celebrate Berlin's wedding to Tatiana, but the Professor expresses concern to Berlin about marrying since he has a terminal illness. In the present, the Professor and Marseille break into the apartment of Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, but he jumps out of his window into the pool below.

They fit his apartment with fake bombs as an alibi if the police discover him working for the Professor. Anto\u00f1anzas admits that Lisbon is being held in the tent; the Professor gives him his watch to wear so that she would know that the Professor is aware that she is alive. Lisbon's ex-husband, Alberto, examines the ambulance that the Professor and Lisbon had used for mobile transportation and broadcasting, and finds a phone SIM card that Lisbon had attempted to destroy. Although burnt, it is able to be analyzed, and the police find solely one call that was made to [[Mindanao]], Philippines\u2014where Lisbon's mother and daughter are staying. Sierra tells Lisbon that they know where they live, and allows Lisbon to call them so they can leave before the police arrive. Just as Lisbon is about to make the call, she notices Anto\u00f1anzas wearing the Professor's watch, so she stops. In flashbacks, the Professor raises reservations of Palermo's ability to be a team player to Berlin, who has concern that he has more love for the plan and being in command than for the team. In the present, Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda dislocates his thumbs in order to slip through his handcuffs as verbally aided by Palermo. Rio, guarding the hostages, is emotionally unable to stop Gand\u00eda from escaping.

Gand\u00eda later almost kills Helsinki by hanging as he drops a noose around his neck from the ceiling. Bogot\u00e1 and Tokyo save Helsinki. Before Gand\u00eda retreats to a secret [[panic room]], he cuts the telecommunication cords that render the Professor's cameras in the bank inoperative. The panic room is equipped with weapons and a communication centre, which Gand\u00eda uses to communicate with Tamayo. Tamayo tells him that they are under a truce with the Professor, but he wants to coordinate an attack. Anto\u00f1anzas tells the Professor that Gand\u00eda is communicating with the police from a panic room, and as the Professor relays this information to Tokyo, Gand\u00eda knocks her out from behind.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = 5 minutos antes\n| AltTitle        = 5 Minutes Earlier\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra, \u00c1lex Rodrigo\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Denver and Moscow ask the Professor if Juan, Moscow's godchild, can join them in the heist, but the Professor is hesitant. In the present, Gand\u00eda restrains Tokyo in the panic room, and announces on the bank's intercom that he has Tokyo, and that Palermo was the one who aided his escape. In flashbacks, Berlin tells the Professor that the dozens of hostages could stage a rebellion at some point, and that it would be wise to have an infiltrated member pose as a hostage to diffuse a potential revolt. The Professor, Moscow and Denver meet Juan, who is now a [[trans woman]] that goes by Julia. In the present, she poses as a hostage in the bank, and goes by \"Manila.\" Palermo admits to the Professor that what Gand\u00eda said is true; the Professor assures he will be punished later, and orders the group to unchain him. The robbers continue to melt the gold in the [[foundry]]\u201443.5 tonnes at that point. While in the freight elevator, Bogot\u00e1 and Nairobi kiss passionately and mentions they should marry after the heist. As Rio and Denver enter an elevator, Gand\u00eda throws a grenade into it just as the doors close, and the two rush to muffle the grenade with their bulletproof vests and helmets; they survive the explosion. As a shootout ensues between Gand\u00eda and all members of the gang, with the exception of the restrained Tokyo and wheelchair-bound Nairobi who remains armed in a bathroom, Gand\u00eda escapes through a duct.

In flashbacks, Nairobi asks the Professor to be the father of her child by [[in vitro fertilisation]] because she believes the Professor to have good genes. Initially opposed to the idea, the Professor agrees. In the present, although the panic room is not present on the bank's blueprints, the Professor deduces the location of the panic room to be in the vicinity of the governor's office\u2014behind the governor's bathroom. The Professor tells Palermo this. Tamayo and Su\u00e1rez plan an assault on the bank. Meanwhile, the Professor sends Marseille to Algeria, where the police tortured Rio, to gather intel.

The Professor tells the gang to drill a hole through to the panic room and inject narcotic gas to incapacitate Gand\u00eda before rescuing Tokyo. The Professor gets people to put up posters all over Madrid that bear the face of Rio with the title \"buried alive,\" and nationally broadcasts a video of Rio recounting his illegal detainment and torture by police. Meanwhile, the Professor enlists Benjam\u00edn, father of Manila, and his crew to participate in a plan to free Lisbon. In a press conference, Colonel Prieto denies Rio's accusations, but Marseille forces a man who had taken part in Rio's torture in Algeria to corroborate Rio's story, which is broadcast nationally via video during the press conference. This deflates Tamayo's plans, and he calls off his planned assault on the bank. Tamayo tells Sierra that she must take the blame. Meanwhile, Gand\u00eda unties Tokyo to remove the shrapnel from his back, but she knocks him unconscious and the group frees her. The Professor then nationally broadcasts a video of himself exposing the illegal detainment of Lisbon inside the police tent outside the bank.

They passionately kiss, however, Berlin says they must part ways and give up the plan because their love would interfere too much. In the present, Sierra admits to several damaging acts to the press, including implicating Colonel Tamayo. At a restaurant, Benjam\u00edn and Marseille construct a tunnel that leads to the parking garage of the Supreme Court, where Lisbon is brought to testify. As Sierra is fired and legal proceedings begin against her, she commences a pursuit of the Professor on her own. Sierra deduces that Anto\u00f1anzas must be a mole. After she extracts information from his wife, she obtains security camera footage from outside the apartment building, and watches footage of Anto\u00f1anzas being helped out of the pool by the Professor, as well as the license plate of his car from the parking lot. Benjam\u00edn and his crew, disguised as court personnel, seize the guards as Lisbon is escorted from the court through the parking garage. They strap them with bombs, bring in a woman disguised as Lisbon, and force them to take their normally scheduled route. Lisbon escapes through the tunnel. The gang forces Gand\u00eda to radio Tamayo that he is in another attack and requests to be evacuated from the roof. The Professor intercepts Tamayo's request for a helicopter, and brings his own, acquired on the black market, piloted by Marseille to deceptively transport a disguised Lisbon to the bank. As Lisbon descends from the helicopter, the gang creates a ruse on the roof to create the impression that Gand\u00eda is fighting. Lisbon is reunited with the gang, and they chant \"for Nairobi!\" just as Sierra finds the Professor's hideout, and holds him at gunpoint.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Money Heist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Money Heist'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Money Heist episodes, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Spanish television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Money Heist|Episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n''[[Money Heist]]'' ({{lang-es|La casa de papel}}, {{trans|The House of Paper}}) is a Spanish television series created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]].

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. Raquel visits \u00c1ngel in the hospital, where the police arrest her. At a moral crossroads, she initially refuses to divulge the Professor's hideout, but when Colonel Prieto threatens her with several charges that would ensure her daughter be taken away from her, she finally tells him. As the police race to the hideout, a tactical squad inside the Mint is fought off by Berlin so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, despite the Professor's desperate calls for him to come. Berlin insistently continues, and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police arrive to the empty hideout. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force and that the robbers' whereabouts are still unknown. When Raquel notices coordinates on a postcard previously given to her by the Professor, she tracks him down in [[Palawan]], Philippines, and smiles at him.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019\u201320)===\n{{Episode table |background=#000000 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=15 |director=12 |writer=38 |airdate=25 |airdateR=<ref name=\"TFC\">{{cite web |title=Money Heist \u2013 Listings |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/la-casa-de-papel/listings/ |website=[[The Futon Critic]] |accessdate=24 March 2020}}</ref> |aux1T=English title |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode table/part|p=3|c=#000000}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 16\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = Hemos vuelto\n| AltTitle        = We're Back\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Over two years after the heist, Arturo gives a talk to a large crowd condemning the fugitive members of the gang who held him and others hostage at the Mint as \"terrorists\". Meanwhile, Tokyo and Rio have relocated to [[Guna Yala]], Panama, Nairobi and Helsinki to [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], Argentina, and Denver, M\u00f3nica and her baby to [[Java]], Indonesia. Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio. The professor enlists three new members, Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille, into the gang and begins planning an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]], from an Italian monastery.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 17\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Aikido\n| AltTitle        = Aikido\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, Juan Salvador L\u00f3pez, Luis Moya, Alberto \u00dacar, David Barrocal\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = The Professor initiates the plan to rob the Bank of Spain using [[airships]] to release money across Madrid. The government responds by mobilizing the army, which the robbers use to provide cover and entry into the Bank. In flashbacks, the Professor recruits Mart\u00edn, an experienced thief and former associate to replace Berlin (Andr\u00e9s). The Professor and Mart\u00edn (now code named \"Palermo\") explain that their strategy for this robbery is based on ''[[Aikido]]'', a martial art that uses an enemy's force to create an advantage. As the robbers enter the Bank, public sentiment rallies to their side in the form of mass government protests and riots over the illegal imprisonment of Rio, demanding that he receive a public trial.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 18\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = 48 metros bajo el suelo\n| AltTitle        = 48 Meters Underground\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, Juan Salvador L\u00f3pez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = While commandeering the Bank, the robbers engage in a series of intense conflicts with guards and government officials. Palermo, the commander in charge, is temporarily blinded in the struggle, but retains command after Nairobi removes glass shrapnel from his eyes, and the guards restrained. The robbers locate accomplices among the hostages who were previously planted in the Bank and go to work on opening the vault, which is rigged to flood with water once tampered with. Bogot\u00e1, uses his expertise in diving and welding to overcome the lock down, granting access to the gold.

Colonel Tamayo and Alicia Sierra prove to be formidable adversaries, as they quickly realize that they must change their strategies drastically from the first robbery. Sierra tortures Rio for more information and Tamayo plans an assault on the bank with Su\u00e1rez. The robbers reveal that they know about a second, secret vault behind the gold and attempt to persuade the governor of the bank to open it for them.

Given no other option, the robbers detonate the inner vault door inside the flooded main chamber. It works and grants them access to \"the red boxes\"\u2014cases filled with government secrets that were too dangerous to lock anywhere else. Tamayo's assault begins, taking the robbers and the Professor by surprise. To stall for time and prevent bloodshed, Denver runs into the line of fire with a truce flag carrying two of the red cases, which forces Tamayo to stop. He reveals to Sierra the contents of the cases and that the Professor has the advantage\u2014an attack might force the robbers to make the secrets public. However, Sierra is able to unbalance the Professor and Raquel Murillo (now code-named \"Lisbon\"), with psychological taunting. Inside the bank, the team divides when Nairobi and Palermo disagree over the use of force on the unruly restrained guards.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels of their [[RV]] sink in mud. They narrowly escape detection with the help of some sympathetic local farmers. They then manage to inform the team of the breach 10 minutes before it happens, who defeat, capture, unclothe, and humiliate the breaching team by forcing them sing \"[[Bella ciao]]\" on video.

At the exchange, Rio is shocked by the massive crowds gathered in support of the robbers, wearing red jumpsuits and Dal\u00ed masks. The exchange proceeds smoothly and he rejoins the robbers. During the reunion, the police and government intelligence team listen in on their conversations, having planted a listening device inside Rio before releasing him. In flashbacks, the Professor instructs the team, preparing them to detect and remove these devices surgically from Rio, if the time comes. After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working. Privately, Rio breaks up with Tokyo, believing that she will be better off with someone else. Nairobi surgically removes the listening device. The police manage to locate the Professor and Lisbon using a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], forcing them to separate and try to escape on foot; the Professor camouflages himself in a tree, while Lisbon is unable, she takes refuge in a barn.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 23\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = La deriva\n| AltTitle        = Astray\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, \u00c1lex Pina, Almudena Ram\u00edrez-Pantanella, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Tokyo drinks herself into a semi-[[stupor]] as a result of her breakup and insults Rio. In the forest, a massive manhunt begins for the Professor and Raquel. Raquel is discovered in the barn by farmers, which begins a [[Mexican Standoff]]. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Meanwhile, Sierra uses Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Sierra brings Nairobi's son, Axel, in front of the bank, luring Nairobi to a window. Sierra gives the green light for a police sniper to shoot, and Nairobi is shot in the chest. As the robbers scramble to aid an [[exsanguinating]] Nairobi, the police begin the assault. In the forest, Su\u00e1rez and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] find Raquel and remove the farmers from the barn. The Professor hears gunshots over Raquel's microphone, and thinking she is executed, becomes distraught. Palermo radios the Professor to inform him of the incoming assault and the Professor declares [[DEFCON]] 2. Tokyo and Rio destroy the approaching armoured car with [[RPG-7]]s. Afterwards, it is revealed that Raquel is alive and in custody, with Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap, that Sierra had ordered Su\u00e1rez to fake an execution to elicit a drastic response, stating that \"the war had begun.\"\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|p=4|c=#295E6E}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 24\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Game Over\n| AltTitle        = Game Over\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra\n| WrittenBy       = Esther Morales, Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = The gang rushes to save Nairobi's life, but given the risks surrounding the surgery that they must perform on her, she pleads to be released to the police so that she can get proper care. Meanwhile, the Professor, at first distraught at believing Lisbon to be executed, manages to escape the forest after Marseille lures the police away with a tracker they believe to be the Professor escaping. After an argument between gang members develops about the decision to perform surgery on Nairobi, Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], and leads the surgery with the video aid of a surgeon in Pakistan. The Professor develops a truce with Tamayo for 48 hours to assess Nairobi. In flashbacks, Nairobi convinces Tokyo that she ask the Professor to be the leader of the heist, but the Professor insists that since Palermo came up with the idea for the heist, he will be in charge.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 25\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n| Title           = La boda de Berl\u00edn\n| AltTitle        = Berlin's Wedding\n| DirectedBy      = Javier Quintas\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Tokyo ultimately leads the successful surgery of Nairobi, removing the bullet by cutting out a portion of her lung. With Tokyo in charge, the ego-centric Palermo is about to walk out of the bank before he is restrained to a chair by the gang. Meanwhile, Lisbon is transported to a police tent outside the bank, where she is interrogated by Sierra. Tokyo calls the Professor, who is furious at her coup, however, Tokyo helps him deduce that the police had staged Lisbon's execution and that she is being interrogated inside the police tent. In flashbacks, Marseille, Bogot\u00e1 and the Professor celebrate Berlin's wedding to Tatiana, but the Professor expresses concern to Berlin about marrying since he has a terminal illness. In the present, the Professor and Marseille break into the apartment of Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, but he jumps out of his window into the pool below. Sierra tells Lisbon that if she cooperates, her probable 30 year sentence would potentially be reduced to 10 years, and that she would be out in five years.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 26\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Lecci\u00f3n de anatom\u00eda\n| AltTitle        = Anatomy Lesson\n| DirectedBy      = \u00c1lex Rodrigo\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = The Professor and Marseille help Anto\u00f1anzas out of the pool, and persuade him to do tasks for them by offering him \u20ac1 million. They fit his apartment with fake bombs as an alibi if the police discover him working for the Professor. Anto\u00f1anzas admits that Lisbon is being held in the tent; the Professor gives him his watch to wear so that she would know that the Professor is aware that she is alive. Lisbon's ex-husband, Alberto, examines the ambulance that the Professor and Lisbon had used for mobile transportation and broadcasting, and finds a phone SIM card that Lisbon had attempted to destroy. Although burnt, it is able to be analyzed, and the police find solely one call that was made to [[Mindanao]], Philippines\u2014where Lisbon's mother and daughter are staying. Sierra tells Lisbon that they know where they live, and allows Lisbon to call them so they can leave before the police arrive. Just as Lisbon is about to make the call, she notices Anto\u00f1anzas wearing the Professor's watch, so she stops. In flashbacks, the Professor raises reservations of Palermo's ability to be a team player to Berlin, who has concern that he has more love for the plan and being in command than for the team. In the present, Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda dislocates his thumbs in order to slip through his handcuffs as verbally aided by Palermo. Rio, guarding the hostages, is emotionally unable to stop Gand\u00eda from escaping.

Gand\u00eda later almost kills Helsinki by hanging as he drops a noose around his neck from the ceiling. Bogot\u00e1 and Tokyo save Helsinki. Before Gand\u00eda retreats to a secret [[panic room]], he cuts the telecommunication cords that render the Professor's cameras in the bank inoperative. The panic room is equipped with weapons and a communication centre, which Gand\u00eda uses to communicate with Tamayo. Tamayo tells him that they are under a truce with the Professor, but he wants to coordinate an attack. Anto\u00f1anzas tells the Professor that Gand\u00eda is communicating with the police from a panic room, and as the Professor relays this information to Tokyo, Gand\u00eda knocks her out from behind.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = 5 minutos antes\n| AltTitle        = 5 Minutes Earlier\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra, \u00c1lex Rodrigo\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Denver and Moscow ask the Professor if Juan, Moscow's godchild, can join them in the heist, but the Professor is hesitant. In the present, Gand\u00eda restrains Tokyo in the panic room, and announces on the bank's intercom that he has Tokyo, and that Palermo was the one who aided his escape. In flashbacks, Berlin tells the Professor that the dozens of hostages could stage a rebellion at some point, and that it would be wise to have an infiltrated member pose as a hostage to diffuse a potential revolt. The Professor, Moscow and Denver meet Juan, who is now a [[trans woman]] that goes by Julia. In the present, she poses as a hostage in the bank, and goes by \"Manila.\" Palermo admits to the Professor that what Gand\u00eda said is true; the Professor assures he will be punished later, and orders the group to unchain him. The robbers continue to melt the gold in the [[foundry]]\u201443.5 tonnes at that point. While in the freight elevator, Bogot\u00e1 and Nairobi kiss passionately and mentions they should marry after the heist. As Rio and Denver enter an elevator, Gand\u00eda throws a grenade into it just as the doors close, and the two rush to muffle the grenade with their bulletproof vests and helmets; they survive the explosion. As a shootout ensues between Gand\u00eda and all members of the gang, with the exception of the restrained Tokyo and wheelchair-bound Nairobi who remains armed in a bathroom, Gand\u00eda escapes through a duct.

Gand\u00eda shoots a hole through the door and forces her head through it while he ties her hands to the door. In flashbacks, Nairobi asks the Professor to be the father of her child by [[in vitro fertilisation]] because she believes the Professor to have good genes. Initially opposed to the idea, the Professor agrees. In the present, although the panic room is not present on the bank's blueprints, the Professor deduces the location of the panic room to be in the vicinity of the governor's office\u2014behind the governor's bathroom. The Professor tells Palermo this. Tamayo and Su\u00e1rez plan an assault on the bank. Meanwhile, the Professor sends Marseille to Algeria, where the police tortured Rio, to gather intel.

The gang uncover the tunnel to the panic room behind the governor's bathroom.

The Professor tells the gang to drill a hole through to the panic room and inject narcotic gas to incapacitate Gand\u00eda before rescuing Tokyo. The Professor gets people to put up posters all over Madrid that bear the face of Rio with the title \"buried alive,\" and nationally broadcasts a video of Rio recounting his illegal detainment and torture by police. Meanwhile, the Professor enlists Benjam\u00edn, father of Manila, and his crew to participate in a plan to free Lisbon. In a press conference, Colonel Prieto denies Rio's accusations, but Marseille forces a man who had taken part in Rio's torture in Algeria to corroborate Rio's story, which is broadcast nationally via video during the press conference. This deflates Tamayo's plans, and he calls off his planned assault on the bank. Tamayo tells Sierra that she must take the blame. Meanwhile, Gand\u00eda unties Tokyo to remove the shrapnel from his back, but she knocks him unconscious and the group frees her. The Professor then nationally broadcasts a video of himself exposing the illegal detainment of Lisbon inside the police tent outside the bank.

They passionately kiss, however, Berlin says they must part ways and give up the plan because their love would interfere too much. In the present, Sierra admits to several damaging acts to the press, including implicating Colonel Tamayo. At a restaurant, Benjam\u00edn and Marseille construct a tunnel that leads to the parking garage of the Supreme Court, where Lisbon is brought to testify. As Sierra is fired and legal proceedings begin against her, she commences a pursuit of the Professor on her own. Sierra deduces that Anto\u00f1anzas must be a mole. After she extracts information from his wife, she obtains security camera footage from outside the apartment building, and watches footage of Anto\u00f1anzas being helped out of the pool by the Professor, as well as the license plate of his car from the parking lot. Benjam\u00edn and his crew, disguised as court personnel, seize the guards as Lisbon is escorted from the court through the parking garage. They strap them with bombs, bring in a woman disguised as Lisbon, and force them to take their normally scheduled route. Lisbon escapes through the tunnel. The gang forces Gand\u00eda to radio Tamayo that he is in another attack and requests to be evacuated from the roof. The Professor intercepts Tamayo's request for a helicopter, and brings his own, acquired on the black market, piloted by Marseille to deceptively transport a disguised Lisbon to the bank. As Lisbon descends from the helicopter, the gang creates a ruse on the roof to create the impression that Gand\u00eda is fighting. Lisbon is reunited with the gang, and they chant \"for Nairobi!\" just as Sierra finds the Professor's hideout, and holds him at gunpoint.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Money Heist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Money Heist'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Money Heist episodes, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Spanish television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Money Heist|Episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted a duplicate \"the\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Money_Heist_episodes"}

The lava flows into the ocean and hardens into new land. The resulting barren land is first colonized by pioneer organisms, like algae, which pave the way for later, less hardy plants, such as [[Hardwood|hardwood tree]]s, by facilitating [[pedogenesis]], especially through the biotic acceleration of [[weathering]] and the addition of organic debris to the surface [[regolith]]. An example of this is the island of [[Surtsey]], which is an island formed in 1963 after a volcanic eruption from beneath the sea. Surtsey is off the South coast of Iceland and is being monitored to observe primary succession in progress. About thirty species of plant had become established by 2008 and more species continue to arrive, at a typical rate of roughly 2\u20135&nbsp;new species per year.<ref name=plants>{{citation| url=http://www.vulkaner.no/n/surtsey/esurtplant.html|title= The volcano island: Surtsey, Iceland: Plants| publisher=Our Beautiful World| accessdate=2016-02-02}}</ref>\n\nAnother example takes place after a glacier in Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, Maritime Antarctic. Glacier retreat is becoming more normal with the warming climate, and lichens and mosses are the first colonizers. The study, conducted by Favero-Longo et al. found that lichen species diversity varies based on the environmental conditions of the previously existing earth that is first exposed and the lichens reproductive patterns. <ref>Favero-Longo et al., \u201cPrimary Succession of Lichen and Bryophyte Communities Following Glacial Recession on Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, Maritime Antarctic.\u201d</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ecological succession]]\n*[[Lithophyte]]\n*[[Pioneer species]]\n*[[Secondary succession]]\n*[[Soil creation]]\n*[[Stability (ecology)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Ecological succession]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Ecology terminology]]\n", "name_user": "SelChrisPar", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_succession"}
