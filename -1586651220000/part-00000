The Italian [[libretto]] was written by [[Francesco Maria Piave]] based on the play ''[[Le roi s'amuse]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]]. Despite serious initial problems with the [[Austrians|Austrian]] censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere at [[La Fenice]] in Venice on 11 March 1851.\n\nThe work, Verdi's sixteenth in the genre, is widely considered to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi's middle-to-late career. Its tragic story revolves around the licentious [[Duchy of Mantua|Duke of Mantua]], his hunch-backed [[court jester]] Rigoletto, and Rigoletto's beautiful daughter Gilda. The opera's original title, ''La maledizione'' (The Curse), refers to a curse placed on both the Duke and Rigoletto by a courtier whose daughter the Duke has seduced with Rigoletto's encouragement. The curse comes to fruition when Gilda falls in love with the Duke and sacrifices her life to save him from the assassin hired by her father.\n\n==Composition history==\n[[File:Verdi-1850s.jpg|thumb|Verdi around 1850]]\n[[La Fenice]] of [[Venice]] commissioned Verdi in 1850 to compose a new opera. He was prominent enough by this time to enjoy some freedom in choosing texts to set to music. He initially asked [[Francesco Maria Piave]] (with whom he had already created ''[[Ernani]]'', ''[[I due Foscari]]'', ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'', ''[[Il Corsaro]]'' and ''[[Stiffelio]]'') to examine the play ''Kean'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]], but soon came to believe that they needed to find a more energetic subject.<ref name = \"PM265\">Phillips-Matz (1993) p. 265</ref>\n\nThat came in the form of [[Victor Hugo]]'s controversial five-act play ''[[Le roi s'amuse]]'' (\"The king amuses himself\"). Verdi later explained that \"The subject is grand, immense, and there is a character that is one of the greatest creations that the theatre can boast of, in any country and in all history.\"<ref name=\"VtoP1850\">Verdi to Piave, 28 April 1850, in Phillips-Matz, p. 265</ref> However, Hugo's depiction of a venal, cynical, womanizing king ([[Francis I of France]]) was considered unacceptably scandalous. The play had been banned in France following its premiere nearly twenty years earlier (not to be staged again until 1882);<ref>Hugo (1863) pp. 163\u2013164</ref> now it was to come before the Austrian Board of [[Censors]] (as Austria [[History of Austria#The Nineteenth Century(1815-1918)|at that time]] directly [[History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification#Foreign domination (16th-18th centuries)|controlled much of Northern Italy]].)\n\nFrom the beginning, both composer and librettist knew this step would not be easy. As Verdi wrote in a letter to Piave: \"Use four legs, run through the town and find me an influential person who can obtain the permission for making ''Le Roi s'amuse''.\"<ref name=\"VtoP1850\"/>  Guglielmo Brenna, secretary of La Fenice, promised the duo that they would not have problems with the censors. He was wrong, and rumours began to spread in early summer that the production would be forbidden. In August, Verdi and Piave retired to [[Busseto]], Verdi's hometown, to prepare a defensive scheme as they continued work on the opera. Despite their best efforts, including frantic correspondence with La Fenice, the Austrian censor De Gorzkowski emphatically denied consent to the production of \"La Maledizione\" (its working title) in a December 1850 letter, calling the opera \"a repugnant [example of] immorality and obscene triviality.\"<ref>Phillips-Matz (1993) p. 270</ref>\n[[File:Rigoletto premiere poster.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[La Fenice]]'s poster for the world premiere of ''Rigoletto'']]\nPiave set to work revising the libretto, eventually pulling from it another opera, ''Il Duca di Vendome'', in which the sovereign was a duke and both the hunchback and the curse disappeared. Verdi was completely against this proposed solution, preferring to negotiate directly with the censors over each and every point of the work.<ref name = PM272>Phillips-Matz (1993) p. 272</ref> Brenna, La Fenice's sympathetic secretary, mediated the dispute by showing the Austrians some letters and articles depicting the bad character, but great value, of the artist. By January 1851 the parties had settled on a compromise: the action of the opera would be moved, and some of the characters would be renamed. In the new version, the Duke would preside over [[Mantua]] and belong to the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] family. (The House of Gonzaga had long been extinct by the mid-19th century, and the Dukedom of Mantua no longer existed.) The scene in which he retired to Gilda's bedroom would be deleted, and his visit to the ''Taverna'' (inn) would no longer be intentional, but the result of a trick. The hunchbacked jester (originally called [[Triboulet]]) was renamed Rigoletto (from the French word ''rigoler'') from a parody of a comedy by [[Jules-\u00c9douard Alboize de Pujol]]: ''Rigoletti, ou Le dernier des fous'' (Rigoletti, or The last of the fools) of 1835.<ref>\"Rigolo\" is a French word meaning \"funny\"</ref> By 14 January, the opera's definitive title had become ''Rigoletto''.<ref>Phillips-Matz (1993) p. 273</ref>\n\nVerdi finally completed the composition on 5 February 1851, a little more than a month before the premiere. Piave had already arranged for the sets to be designed while Verdi was still working on the final stages of Act 3. The singers were given some of their music to learn on 7 February. However, Verdi kept at least a third of the score at Busseto. He brought it with him when he arrived in Venice for the rehearsals on 19 February, and would continue refining the orchestration throughout the rehearsal period.<ref>Phillips-Matz (1993) pp. 278, 281, 283</ref> For the premi\u00e8re, La Fenice had cast [[Felice Varesi]] as Rigoletto, the young tenor [[Raffaele Mirate]] as the Duke, and [[Teresa Brambilla]] as Gilda (although Verdi would have preferred [[Teresa De Giuli Borsi]]).<ref>Budden (1984) p. 482</ref> Due to a high risk of unauthorised copying, Verdi demanded extreme secrecy from all his singers and musicians, particularly Mirate: the \"Duke\" had the use of his score for only a few evenings before the premi\u00e8re, and was made to swear that he would not sing or even whistle the tune of \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" except during rehearsal.<ref>Downes (1918) p. 38</ref>\n\n== Performance history ==\n[[File:Felice Varesi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|[[Felice Varesi]], the first Rigoletto]]\n[[File:Teresa Brambilla 1845.jpg|upright=0.55|thumb|[[Teresa Brambilla]], the first Gilda]]\n\n=== 19th-century productions ===\n''Rigoletto'' premiered on 11 March 1851 why do they make a site where anyone can come on and edit it. in a sold-out La Fenice as the first part of a double bill with [[Giacomo Panizza]]'s ballet ''Faust''.

It initially had a run of 13 performances and was revived in Venice the following year, and again in 1854. Despite a rather disastrous production in [[Bergamo]] shortly after its initial run at La Fenice, the opera soon entered the repertory of Italian theatres. By 1852, it had premiered in all the major cities of Italy, although sometimes under different titles due to the vagaries of censorship (e.g. as ''Viscardello'', ''Lionello'', and ''Clara de Perth'').<ref>The opera was performed as ''Viscardello'' in Bologna and as both ''Lionello'' and ''Clara de Perth'' in Naples.</ref> From 1852, it also began to be performed in major cities worldwide, reaching as far afield as [[Alexandria]] and [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] in 1854 and both [[Montevideo]] and [[Havana]] in 1855. The UK premiere took place on 14 May 1853 at what is now the [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden in London with [[Giovanni Matteo Mario]] as the Duke of Mantua and [[Giorgio Ronconi]] as Rigoletto. In the US, the opera was first seen on 19 February 1855 at New York's [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]] in a performance by the [[Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company]].<ref>David Kimbell in Holden (2001) p. 991</ref><ref>Casaglia 2005, p. ??; Phillips-Matz (1993) p. 286</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEYA8_RARL0C&pg=PA81&dq=%22Boston+Theatre%22+%22Max+Maretzek%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwjipKjEuPLGAhUN4oAKHYjAAUA#v=onepage&q=%22Boston%20Theatre%22%20%22Max%20Maretzek%22&f=false|title=Verdi in America: Oberto Through Rigoletto|author=George Whitney Martin|page=81|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century and beyond ===\nSeveral modern productions have radically changed the original setting.

A magnificent hall in the ducal palace. Doors at the back open into other rooms, splendidly lit up. A crowd of lords and ladies in grand costumes are seen walking about in the rear rooms; page boys come and go.  The festivities are at their height. Music is heard from offstage. The Duke and Borsa enter from a  door in the back.''\n[[File:Roi s'amuse-Hugo.png|thumb|left|220px|Act 1, sc. 1: Victor Hugo's ''Le Roi s'amuse'']]\nAt a ball in his palace, the Duke sings of a life of pleasure with as many women as possible, and mentions that he particularly enjoys cuckolding his courtiers: \"''Questa o quella''\" (\"This woman or that\"). He mentions to Borsa that he has seen an unknown beauty in church and desires to possess her, but he also wishes to seduce the Countess of Ceprano. Rigoletto, the Duke's hunchbacked court jester, mocks the husbands of the ladies to whom the Duke is paying attention, including the Count Ceprano, and advises the Duke to get rid of him by prison or death.  The Duke laughs indulgently, but Ceprano is not amused. Marullo, one of the guests at the ball, informs the courtiers that Rigoletto has a \"lover\", which astonishes them. (Marullo is not aware that the \"lover\" is actually Rigoletto's daughter.) The courtiers, at Ceprano's suggestion, resolve to take vengeance on Rigoletto for making fun of them. The festivities are interrupted by the arrival of the elderly Count Monterone, whose daughter the Duke had seduced. Rigoletto provokes him further by making fun of his helplessness to avenge his daughter's honor.  Monterone confronts the Duke, and is immediately arrested by the Duke's guards.  Before being led off to prison, Monterone curses both the Duke for the attack on his daughter and Rigoletto for having mocked his righteous anger. The curse terrifies Rigoletto, who believes the popular superstition that an old man's curse has real power.\n[[File:Rigoletto premiere stage set for Act 1, Scene 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Act 1, Scene 2 stage set by Giuseppe Bertoja for the world premiere of ''Rigoletto'']]\n\n''Scene 2: The end of a dead-end street. On the left, a house of discreet appearance with one small courtyard surrounded by walls. In the yard there is one tall tree and a marble seat; in the wall, a door that leads to the street; above the wall, a terrace supported by arches. The second floor door opens on to the said terrace, which can also be reached by a staircase in front. To the right of the street is the very high wall of the garden and a side of the Ceprano palace. It is night.''\n\nPreoccupied with the old man's curse, Rigoletto approaches the house where he is concealing his daughter from the world and is accosted by the hit-man Sparafucile, who walks up to him and offers his services. Rigoletto declines for the moment, but leaves open the possibility of hiring Sparafucile later, should the need arise.  Sparafucile wanders off, after repeating his own name a few times. Rigoletto contemplates the similarities between the two of them: \"Pari siamo!\" (\"We are alike!\"); Sparafucile kills men with his sword, and Rigoletto uses \"a tongue of malice\" to stab his victims. Rigoletto opens a door in the wall and embraces his daughter Gilda. They greet each other warmly: \"Figlia!\" \"Mio padre!\" (\"Daughter!\" \"My father!\"). Rigoletto has been concealing his daughter from the Duke and the rest of the city, and she does not know her father's occupation. Since he has forbidden her to appear in public, she has been nowhere except to church and does not even know her own father's name.\n\nWhen Rigoletto has gone, the Duke appears and overhears Gilda confess to her nurse Giovanna that she feels guilty for not having told her father about a young man she had met at the church. She says that she fell in love with him, but that she would love him even more if he were a student and poor. As she declares her love, the Duke enters, overjoyed. Gilda, alarmed, calls for Giovanna, unaware that the Duke had sent her away. Pretending to be a student, the Duke convinces Gilda of his love: \"\u00c8 il sol dell'anima\" (\"Love is the sunshine of the soul\"). When she asks for his name, he hesitantly calls himself Gualtier Mald\u00e8. Hearing sounds and fearing that her father has returned, Gilda sends the Duke away after they quickly trade vows of love: \"Addio, addio\" (\"Farewell, farewell\"). Alone, Gilda meditates on her love for the Duke, whom she believes is a student: \"Gualtier Mald\u00e8!... [[Caro nome che il mio cor]]\" (\"Dearest name\").\n\nLater, Rigoletto returns: \"Riedo!... perch\u00e9?\" (\"I've returned!... why?\"), while the hostile courtiers outside the walled garden (believing Gilda to be the jester's mistress, unaware she is his daughter) get ready to abduct the helpless girl. They tell Rigoletto that they are actually abducting the Countess Ceprano.  He sees that they are masked and asks for a mask for himself; while they are tying the mask onto his face, they also blindfold him.  Blindfolded and deceived, he holds the ladder steady while they climb up to Gilda's room: Chorus: \"Zitti, zitti\" (\"Softly, softly\"). With her father's unknowing assistance Gilda is carried away by the courtiers. Left alone, Rigoletto removes his mask and blindfold, and realizes that it was in fact Gilda who was carried away. He collapses in despair, remembering the old man's curse.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\n{{listen\n|title=\"Cortigiani, vil razza dannata\"\"\n|filename=ICBSA Verdi - Rigoletto, Cortigiani vil razza.ogg\n|description=Sung by [[Titta Ruffo]]\n}}\n''A room in the ducal palace. There are doors on both sides as well as a larger one at the far end by the sides of which hang full length portraits of the Duke and his wife.  There is one high-backed chair at a table covered with velvet and other furnishings.''\n\nThe Duke is concerned that Gilda has disappeared: \"Ella mi fu rapita!\" (\"She was stolen from me!\") and \"Parmi veder le lagrime\" (\"I seem to see tears\"). The courtiers then enter and inform him that they have captured Rigoletto's mistress: Chorus: \"Scorrendo uniti\" (\"We went together at nightfall\"). By their description, he recognizes it to be Gilda and rushes off to the room where she is held: \"Possente amor mi chiama\" (\"Mighty love beckons me\"). Rigoletto enters singing and feigning nonchalance, but also looking anxiously for any trace of Gilda, whom he fears may have fallen into the hands of the Duke.  The courtiers pretend not to notice his anxiety, but quietly laugh at him with each other.  A [[Page (servant)|page boy]] arrives with a message from the Duke's wife - the Duchess wishes to speak to her husband - but the courtiers reply suggestively that the Duke cannot be disturbed at the moment. Rigoletto realizes this must mean that Gilda is with the Duke.  To the courtiers' surprise, he reveals that Gilda is his daughter. He first demands, then tearfully pleads with the courtiers to return her to him: \"Cortigiani, vil razza dannata\" (\"Accursed race of courtiers\"). Rigoletto attempts to run into the room in which Gilda is being held, but the courtiers block his way.  After a time, Gilda enters, and Rigoletto orders the courtiers to leave him alone with her. The courtiers leave the room, believing Rigoletto has gone mad. Gilda describes to her father what has happened to her in the palace: \"Tutte le feste al tempio\" (\"On all the holy days\") and he attempts to console her. Monterone is led across the room on the way to prison and pauses in front of the portrait of the Duke to regret that his curse on the libertine has had no effect. As the guards lead Monterone away, Rigoletto mutters that the old man is mistaken; he, Rigoletto, the dishonored buffoon, shall make thunder and lightning rain from heaven onto the offender's head. He repeats this vow as Gilda pleads for mercy for her lover the Duke: Duet:\"S\u00ec! Vendetta, tremenda vendetta!\" (\"Yes! Revenge, terrible revenge!\").\n\n=== Act 3 ===\n''The right bank of the river [[Mincio]]. On the left is a two-story house, half ruined. Through a large arch on the ground floor a rustic tavern can be seen as well as a rough stone staircase that leads to an attic room with a small bed which is in full view as there are no shutters. In the wall downstairs that faces the street is a door that opens to the inside. The wall is so full of holes and cracks that everything that happens inside is easily seen from the exterior. At the back of the stage are deserted areas by the river which flows behind a parapet that has half collapsed into ruins. Beyond the river is Mantua. It is night. Gilda and Rigoletto, both uneasy, are standing in the road; Sparafucile is seated at a table in the tavern.''\n\n{{listen\n|title=\"La donna \u00e8 mobile\"\n|filename=La Donna E Mobile Rigoletto.ogg\n|description=[[Enrico Caruso]] singing \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\".

Rigoletto and Gilda arrive outside. The Duke's voice can be heard from inside, singing \"[[La donna \u00e8 mobile]]\" (\"Woman is fickle\").  Sparafucile's sister, Maddalena, has lured him to the house. Rigoletto and Gilda listen from outside as the Duke flirts with Maddalena. Gilda laments that the Duke is unfaithful; Rigoletto assures her that he is arranging revenge: \"[[Bella figlia dell\u2019amore]]\" (\"Beautiful daughter of love\").\n\nRigoletto orders Gilda to put on a man's clothes to prepare to leave for [[Verona]] and tells her that he plans to follow later. After she leaves, he completes his bargain with the assassin, who is ready to murder his guest for 20 [[scudi]].  Rigoletto then withdraws.\n\nWith falling darkness, a thunderstorm approaches and the Duke decides to spend the rest of the night in the house. Sparafucile directs him to the upstairs sleeping quarters, resolving to kill him in his sleep.\n\nGilda, who still loves the Duke despite knowing him to be unfaithful, returns dressed as a man and stands outside the house. Maddalena, who is smitten with the Duke, begs Sparafucile to spare his life: \"\u00c8 amabile invero cotal giovinotto/ Ah, pi\u00f9 non ragiono!...\".  Sparafucile reluctantly promises her that if by midnight another victim can be found, he will kill the other instead of the Duke. Gilda, overhearing this exchange, resolves to sacrifice herself for the Duke, and enters the house: \"Trio: Se pria ch\u2019abbia il mezzo la notte toccato\".  Sparafucile stabs her and she collapses, mortally wounded.\n\nAt midnight, when Rigoletto arrives with money, he receives a corpse wrapped in a sack, and rejoices in his triumph. Weighting it with stones, he is about to cast the sack into the river when he hears the voice of the Duke, sleepily singing a reprise of his \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" aria. Bewildered, Rigoletto opens the sack and, to his despair, discovers his dying daughter. For a moment, she revives and declares she is glad to die for her beloved: \"V'ho ingannato\" (\"Father, I deceived you\"). She dies in his arms. Rigoletto cries out in horror: \"La maledizione!\" (\"The curse!\")<ref name=Grove>{{GroveOnline|title=Rigoletto|author= Parker,Roger|access-date=12 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe orchestra calls for 2 [[flute]]s (Flute 2 doubles [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s (Oboe 2 doubles [[English horn]]), 2 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]] in Eb, D, C, Ab, G, and F, 2 [[trumpet]]s in C, D, and Eb, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[cimbasso]], [[timpani]], [[bass drum]] and [[cymbals]], [[String section|strings]].\n*Offstage: [[Banda (opera)|Banda]], [[bass drum]], 2 [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[thunder machine]]\n*Onstage: [[Violin]]s I and II, [[viola]]s, and [[contrabass]]es\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi, Rigoletto, Vocal score illustration by Roberto Focosi - Restoration.jpg|thumb|upright=1|\"Bella figlia dell'amore\" scene, depicted by Roberto Focosi in an early edition of the vocal score]]\n\nThe short orchestral [[Prelude (music)|preludio]] is based on the theme of the curse, intoned quietly on brass at first and building in intensity until it bursts into a passionate outcry by the full orchestra, subsiding once more and ending with repeated drum rolls alternating with brass,  cumulatively increasing in volume to come to a somber conclusion.<ref name=Grove/> At curtain rise, great contrast is immediately felt as jolly dance music is played by an offstage [[Banda (opera)|band]] while the Duke and his courtiers have a lighthearted conversation. The Duke sings the cynical \"Questa o quella\" to a flippant tune and then further contrast is again achieved as he attempts to seduce the Countess Ceprano while the strings of a chamber orchestra onstage play an elegant [[minuet]].<ref name=Grove/> The off stage dance music resumes as an ensemble builds between Rigoletto, the angry courtiers and the Duke, interrupted by the furious entry of Monterone. Slithery effects in the strings accompany Rigoletto as he brutally mocks the old man, who responds with his curse, leading to a final dramatic ensemble.\n\nIn its great variety of tone and texture, its use of instrumental resources (the orchestra in the pit, an offstage band, and a chamber ensemble of strings on the stage), its dramatic pacing and the way the music is continuous rather than consisting of  one \"number\" after another, this concise opening scene is unprecedented in Italian opera.<ref name=Grove/>\n\nThe duet between Rigoletto and Sparafucile that opens the second scene of the first act is also unprecedented in its structure, being a free-ranging dialogue with melodies not in the voices but in the orchestra, on a solo cello, solo bass, and low woodwinds to create a distinctive sinister atmosphere.<ref name=Grove/>\n\nThe famous quartet in act three is actually a double duet with each of the characters given a musical identity\u2014the ardent wooing of the Duke, with the main melody, as Maddalena laughingly puts him off, while outside Gilda has a sobbing figure in her vocal line and her father implacably urges revenge.<ref name=\"Brandenburg\">{{cite book |last1=Brandenburg |first1=Daniel |title=Verdi:Rigoletto |date=2012 |publisher=B\u00e4renreiter |isbn=9783761822258}}</ref> Victor Hugo resented his play, which had been banned in France, being transformed into an Italian opera and considered it plagiarism (there were no copyright restrictions against this at the time).<ref name=\"Csampai\">{{cite book |last1=Csampai |first1=Attila |title=Giuseppe Verdi, Rigoletto: Texte, Materialien, Kommentare |date=1982 |publisher=Rowohlt |isbn=9783499174872}}</ref> When Hugo attended a performance of the opera in Paris, however, he marveled at the way Verdi's music in the quartet allowed the emotions of the four different characters to be heard together and yet distinguished clearly from each other at the same time and wished that he could achieve such an effect in a spoken drama.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schwarm |first1=Betsy |title=Rigoletto |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rigoletto |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe section following the quartet, marked \"Scena e Terzetto Tempesta\" (scene and storm trio) is also, as [[Julian Budden]] has written,\"without any antecedent\".<ref>Budden</ref> Very different from the storm music that can be heard in [[Rossini]]'s  ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' or ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' , that of the storm in ''Rigoletto'' is not an interlude between acts or scenes, but is totally integrated into the unfolding of the plot, with its strings in the bass register, its interventions of oboe and piccolo,and especially the male chorus behind the scenes humming through closed mouths to create the sound of the wind, a completely original effect. Composer and professor of experimental music [[Dieter Schnebel]] (1930\u20132018) wrote of this scene\n\n<blockquote>The central storm scene is, so to speak, a film with sound, whose moving images show an exterior and interior drama. The furtive encounters between people in the darkness, irregularly broken by lightning, are exposed by the empty fifths, the tremolos of strings, the brief breakthroughs of the wind instruments, the thunderclaps and the sinister sighs of the chorus, which express as well an external process that is internal: death arrives with thunderclaps. The music always passes in this scene from jerky recitatives to fluid arias...<ref name=\"Csampai\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Musicologist]] Julian Budden regards the opera as \"revolutionary\", just as [[Beethoven]]' ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'' Symphony was: \"the barriers between formal melody and recitative are down as never before. In the whole opera, there is only one conventional double aria [...and there are...] no concerted act finales.\"<ref name=\"BUDD483\">Budden, pp. 483\u2013487</ref> Verdi used that same word\u2014\"revolutionary\"\u2014in a letter to Piave,<ref>Verdi to Piave, October 1854, in Budden, p. 484</ref> and Budden also refers to a letter which Verdi wrote in 1852 in which the composer states that \"I conceived ''Rigoletto'' almost without arias, without finales but only an unending string of duets.\"<ref>Verdi to Borsi, in Budden, p. 483</ref>\n\nBudden's conclusions about this opera and its place in Verdi's output are summed up by noting that:\n\n<blockquote>Just after 1850 at the age of 38 Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with ''Rigoletto''. The so-called ''ottocento'' in music is finished. Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas, but in a totally new spirit.<ref>Budden, p. 510</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAlthough immensely successful  with audiences from the beginning, many critics in various countries condemned the work for its dark and bitterly tragic plot combined with a succession of mere popular tunes, as they thought of the music. After the first performance in Venice in 1851 the ''Gazzetta ufficiale di Venezia'' deplored the fact that in his opinion the libretto was inspired by \"the Satanic school\" and Verdi and Piave had sought beauty from the \"deformed and repulsive\".<ref name=Brandenburg/>\n\nTypical of critical reaction in Britain, Austria and Germany was the review in the  ''Frankfurter Nachrichten'' of July 24, 1859 - \"It is well known that this shoddy work presents all the vices and virtues of Verdi's music: light music, pleasant dance rhythms for frightful scenes; that death and corruption are represented as in all the works of this composer by [[galop]]s and party favors.\"<ref name=\"Engler\">{{cite book |last1=Engler |first1=G\u00fcnter |title=\u00dcber Verdi |date=2000 |publisher=Reclam |location=Ditzingen |isbn=978-3150180907}}</ref>\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, ''Rigoletto'' has received high praise even from [[avant-garde]] and experimental composers such as  [[Luigi Dallapiccola]], [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Ernst Krenek]].<ref name=Brandenburg/> [[Igor Stravinsky]] wrote \"I say that in the aria 'La donna \u00e8 mobile', for example, which the elite thinks only brilliant and superficial, there is more substance and feeling than in the whole of [[Wagner]]'s [[Ring cycle]].\"<ref name=Brandenburg/>\n\n== Recordings and adaptations ==\n{{main|Rigoletto discography}}\n[[File:Caruso as Rigoletto-sans Theatre.png|thumb|[[Enrico Caruso]] in the role of the Duke]]\nThere have been dozens of commercial recordings of ''Rigoletto''.

On 15 April 1923, [[Lee DeForest]] presented 18 short films in his sound-on-film process [[Phonofilm]], including an excerpt of Act Two of ''Rigoletto'' with Eva Leoni and Company. One of the most famous films based on the opera is the 1982 film<ref name=\"JPP\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253590/ IMDB entry].

Some film versions, such as the 1993 children's film ''[[Rigoletto (1993 film)|Rigoletto]]'', are based on the opera's plot, but do not use Verdi's music. Curtiss Clayton's 2003 film ''[[Rick (film)|Rick]]'', set in modern-day New York, has a plot based on ''Rigoletto'', but apart from \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" heard in the background during a restaurant scene, does not include any other music from the opera. In the 21st century, the opera was filmed as ''Rigoletto Story'' directed by [[Vittorio Sgarbi]] with costumes by [[Vivienne Westwood]]. First screened at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2004, it subsequently received two [[Grammy]] nominations. In September 2010, [[RAI Television]] filmed the opera on location in Mantua with the court scenes taking place in the [[Palazzo del Te|Palazzo Te]]. The film faithfully followed Verdi's original specification for the action to take place over two days, and each act was performed at the time of day indicated in the libretto.

The Italian [[libretto]] was written by [[Francesco Maria Piave]] based on the play ''[[Le roi s'amuse]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]]. Despite serious initial problems with the [[Austrians|Austrian]] censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere at [[La Fenice]] in Venice on 11 March 1851.\n\nThe work, Verdi's sixteenth in the genre, is widely considered to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi's middle-to-late career. Its tragic story revolves around the licentious [[Duchy of Mantua|Duke of Mantua]], his hunch-backed [[court jester]] Rigoletto, and Rigoletto's beautiful daughter Gilda. The opera's original title, ''La maledizione'' (The Curse), refers to a curse placed on both the Duke and Rigoletto by a courtier whose daughter the Duke has seduced with Rigoletto's encouragement. The curse comes to fruition when Gilda falls in love with the Duke and sacrifices her life to save him from the assassin hired by her father.\n\n==Composition history==\n[[File:Verdi-1850s.jpg|thumb|Verdi around 1850]]\n[[La Fenice]] of [[Venice]] commissioned Verdi in 1850 to compose a new opera. He was prominent enough by this time to enjoy some freedom in choosing texts to set to music. He initially asked [[Francesco Maria Piave]] (with whom he had already created ''[[Ernani]]'', ''[[I due Foscari]]'', ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'', ''[[Il Corsaro]]'' and ''[[Stiffelio]]'') to examine the play ''Kean'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]], but soon came to believe that they needed to find a more energetic subject.<ref name = \"PM265\">Phillips-Matz (1993) p. 265</ref>\n\nThat came in the form of [[Victor Hugo]]'s controversial five-act play ''[[Le roi s'amuse]]'' (\"The king amuses himself\"). Verdi later explained that \"The subject is grand, immense, and there is a character that is one of the greatest creations that the theatre can boast of, in any country and in all history.\"<ref name=\"VtoP1850\">Verdi to Piave, 28 April 1850, in Phillips-Matz, p. 265</ref> However, Hugo's depiction of a venal, cynical, womanizing king ([[Francis I of France]]) was considered unacceptably scandalous. The play had been banned in France following its premiere nearly twenty years earlier (not to be staged again until 1882);<ref>Hugo (1863) pp. 163\u2013164</ref> now it was to come before the Austrian Board of [[Censors]] (as Austria [[History of Austria#The Nineteenth Century(1815-1918)|at that time]] directly [[History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification#Foreign domination (16th-18th centuries)|controlled much of Northern Italy]].)\n\nFrom the beginning, both composer and librettist knew this step would not be easy. As Verdi wrote in a letter to Piave: \"Use four legs, run through the town and find me an influential person who can obtain the permission for making ''Le Roi s'amuse''.\"<ref name=\"VtoP1850\"/>  Guglielmo Brenna, secretary of La Fenice, promised the duo that they would not have problems with the censors. He was wrong, and rumours began to spread in early summer that the production would be forbidden. In August, Verdi and Piave retired to [[Busseto]], Verdi's hometown, to prepare a defensive scheme as they continued work on the opera. Despite their best efforts, including frantic correspondence with La Fenice, the Austrian censor De Gorzkowski emphatically denied consent to the production of \"La Maledizione\" (its working title) in a December 1850 letter, calling the opera \"a repugnant [example of] immorality and obscene triviality.\"<ref>Phillips-Matz (1993) p. 270</ref>\n[[File:Rigoletto premiere poster.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[La Fenice]]'s poster for the world premiere of ''Rigoletto'']]\nPiave set to work revising the libretto, eventually pulling from it another opera, ''Il Duca di Vendome'', in which the sovereign was a duke and both the hunchback and the curse disappeared. Verdi was completely against this proposed solution, preferring to negotiate directly with the censors over each and every point of the work.<ref name = PM272>Phillips-Matz (1993) p. 272</ref> Brenna, La Fenice's sympathetic secretary, mediated the dispute by showing the Austrians some letters and articles depicting the bad character, but great value, of the artist. By January 1851 the parties had settled on a compromise: the action of the opera would be moved, and some of the characters would be renamed. In the new version, the Duke would preside over [[Mantua]] and belong to the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] family. (The House of Gonzaga had long been extinct by the mid-19th century, and the Dukedom of Mantua no longer existed.) The scene in which he retired to Gilda's bedroom would be deleted, and his visit to the ''Taverna'' (inn) would no longer be intentional, but the result of a trick. The hunchbacked jester (originally called [[Triboulet]]) was renamed Rigoletto (from the French word ''rigoler'') from a parody of a comedy by [[Jules-\u00c9douard Alboize de Pujol]]: ''Rigoletti, ou Le dernier des fous'' (Rigoletti, or The last of the fools) of 1835.<ref>\"Rigolo\" is a French word meaning \"funny\"</ref> By 14 January, the opera's definitive title had become ''Rigoletto''.<ref>Phillips-Matz (1993) p. 273</ref>\n\nVerdi finally completed the composition on 5 February 1851, a little more than a month before the premiere. Piave had already arranged for the sets to be designed while Verdi was still working on the final stages of Act 3. The singers were given some of their music to learn on 7 February. However, Verdi kept at least a third of the score at Busseto. He brought it with him when he arrived in Venice for the rehearsals on 19 February, and would continue refining the orchestration throughout the rehearsal period.<ref>Phillips-Matz (1993) pp. 278, 281, 283</ref> For the premi\u00e8re, La Fenice had cast [[Felice Varesi]] as Rigoletto, the young tenor [[Raffaele Mirate]] as the Duke, and [[Teresa Brambilla]] as Gilda (although Verdi would have preferred [[Teresa De Giuli Borsi]]).<ref>Budden (1984) p. 482</ref> Due to a high risk of unauthorised copying, Verdi demanded extreme secrecy from all his singers and musicians, particularly Mirate: the \"Duke\" had the use of his score for only a few evenings before the premi\u00e8re, and was made to swear that he would not sing or even whistle the tune of \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" except during rehearsal.<ref>Downes (1918) p. 38</ref>\n\n== Performance history ==\n[[File:Felice Varesi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|[[Felice Varesi]], the first Rigoletto]]\n[[File:Teresa Brambilla 1845.jpg|upright=0.55|thumb|[[Teresa Brambilla]], the first Gilda]]\n\n=== 19th-century productions ===\n''Rigoletto'' premiered on 11 March 1851 in a sold-out La Fenice as the first part of a double bill with [[Giacomo Panizza]]'s ballet ''Faust''.

Varesi was very uncomfortable with the false hump he had to wear; he was so uncertain that, even though he was quite an experienced singer, he had a panic attack when it was his turn to enter the stage. Verdi immediately realised he was paralysed and roughly pushed him on the stage, so he appeared with a clumsy tumble. The audience, thinking it was an intentional gag, was very amused.<ref>Kimbell (1985) p. 279</ref>\n\n''Rigoletto'' was a great box-office success for La Fenice and Verdi's first major Italian triumph since the 1847 premiere of ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' in Florence. It initially had a run of 13 performances and was revived in Venice the following year, and again in 1854. Despite a rather disastrous production in [[Bergamo]] shortly after its initial run at La Fenice, the opera soon entered the repertory of Italian theatres. By 1852, it had premiered in all the major cities of Italy, although sometimes under different titles due to the vagaries of censorship (e.g. as ''Viscardello'', ''Lionello'', and ''Clara de Perth'').<ref>The opera was performed as ''Viscardello'' in Bologna and as both ''Lionello'' and ''Clara de Perth'' in Naples.</ref> From 1852, it also began to be performed in major cities worldwide, reaching as far afield as [[Alexandria]] and [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] in 1854 and both [[Montevideo]] and [[Havana]] in 1855. The UK premiere took place on 14 May 1853 at what is now the [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden in London with [[Giovanni Matteo Mario]] as the Duke of Mantua and [[Giorgio Ronconi]] as Rigoletto.

A magnificent hall in the ducal palace. Doors at the back open into other rooms, splendidly lit up. A crowd of lords and ladies in grand costumes are seen walking about in the rear rooms; page boys come and go.  The festivities are at their height. Music is heard from offstage. The Duke and Borsa enter from a  door in the back.''\n[[File:Roi s'amuse-Hugo.png|thumb|left|220px|Act 1, sc. 1: Victor Hugo's ''Le Roi s'amuse'']]\nAt a ball in his palace, the Duke sings of a life of pleasure with as many women as possible, and mentions that he particularly enjoys cuckolding his courtiers: \"''Questa o quella''\" (\"This woman or that\"). He mentions to Borsa that he has seen an unknown beauty in church and desires to possess her, but he also wishes to seduce the Countess of Ceprano. Rigoletto, the Duke's hunchbacked court jester, mocks the husbands of the ladies to whom the Duke is paying attention, including the Count Ceprano, and advises the Duke to get rid of him by prison or death.  The Duke laughs indulgently, but Ceprano is not amused. Marullo, one of the guests at the ball, informs the courtiers that Rigoletto has a \"lover\", which astonishes them. (Marullo is not aware that the \"lover\" is actually Rigoletto's daughter.) The courtiers, at Ceprano's suggestion, resolve to take vengeance on Rigoletto for making fun of them. The festivities are interrupted by the arrival of the elderly Count Monterone, whose daughter the Duke had seduced. Rigoletto provokes him further by making fun of his helplessness to avenge his daughter's honor.  Monterone confronts the Duke, and is immediately arrested by the Duke's guards.  Before being led off to prison, Monterone curses both the Duke for the attack on his daughter and Rigoletto for having mocked his righteous anger. The curse terrifies Rigoletto, who believes the popular superstition that an old man's curse has real power.\n[[File:Rigoletto premiere stage set for Act 1, Scene 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Act 1, Scene 2 stage set by Giuseppe Bertoja for the world premiere of ''Rigoletto'']]\n\n''Scene 2: The end of a dead-end street. On the left, a house of discreet appearance with one small courtyard surrounded by walls. In the yard there is one tall tree and a marble seat; in the wall, a door that leads to the street; above the wall, a terrace supported by arches. The second floor door opens on to the said terrace, which can also be reached by a staircase in front. To the right of the street is the very high wall of the garden and a side of the Ceprano palace. It is night.''\n\nPreoccupied with the old man's curse, Rigoletto approaches the house where he is concealing his daughter from the world and is accosted by the hit-man Sparafucile, who walks up to him and offers his services. Rigoletto declines for the moment, but leaves open the possibility of hiring Sparafucile later, should the need arise.  Sparafucile wanders off, after repeating his own name a few times. Rigoletto contemplates the similarities between the two of them: \"Pari siamo!\" (\"We are alike!\"); Sparafucile kills men with his sword, and Rigoletto uses \"a tongue of malice\" to stab his victims. Rigoletto opens a door in the wall and embraces his daughter Gilda. They greet each other warmly: \"Figlia!\" \"Mio padre!\" (\"Daughter!\" \"My father!\"). Rigoletto has been concealing his daughter from the Duke and the rest of the city, and she does not know her father's occupation. Since he has forbidden her to appear in public, she has been nowhere except to church and does not even know her own father's name.\n\nWhen Rigoletto has gone, the Duke appears and overhears Gilda confess to her nurse Giovanna that she feels guilty for not having told her father about a young man she had met at the church. She says that she fell in love with him, but that she would love him even more if he were a student and poor. As she declares her love, the Duke enters, overjoyed. Gilda, alarmed, calls for Giovanna, unaware that the Duke had sent her away. Pretending to be a student, the Duke convinces Gilda of his love: \"\u00c8 il sol dell'anima\" (\"Love is the sunshine of the soul\"). When she asks for his name, he hesitantly calls himself Gualtier Mald\u00e8. Hearing sounds and fearing that her father has returned, Gilda sends the Duke away after they quickly trade vows of love: \"Addio, addio\" (\"Farewell, farewell\"). Alone, Gilda meditates on her love for the Duke, whom she believes is a student: \"Gualtier Mald\u00e8!... [[Caro nome che il mio cor]]\" (\"Dearest name\").\n\nLater, Rigoletto returns: \"Riedo!... perch\u00e9?\" (\"I've returned!... why?\"), while the hostile courtiers outside the walled garden (believing Gilda to be the jester's mistress, unaware she is his daughter) get ready to abduct the helpless girl. They tell Rigoletto that they are actually abducting the Countess Ceprano.  He sees that they are masked and asks for a mask for himself; while they are tying the mask onto his face, they also blindfold him.  Blindfolded and deceived, he holds the ladder steady while they climb up to Gilda's room: Chorus: \"Zitti, zitti\" (\"Softly, softly\"). With her father's unknowing assistance Gilda is carried away by the courtiers. Left alone, Rigoletto removes his mask and blindfold, and realizes that it was in fact Gilda who was carried away. He collapses in despair, remembering the old man's curse.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\n{{listen\n|title=\"Cortigiani, vil razza dannata\"\"\n|filename=ICBSA Verdi - Rigoletto, Cortigiani vil razza.ogg\n|description=Sung by [[Titta Ruffo]]\n}}\n''A room in the ducal palace. There are doors on both sides as well as a larger one at the far end by the sides of which hang full length portraits of the Duke and his wife.  There is one high-backed chair at a table covered with velvet and other furnishings.''\n\nThe Duke is concerned that Gilda has disappeared: \"Ella mi fu rapita!\" (\"She was stolen from me!\") and \"Parmi veder le lagrime\" (\"I seem to see tears\"). The courtiers then enter and inform him that they have captured Rigoletto's mistress: Chorus: \"Scorrendo uniti\" (\"We went together at nightfall\"). By their description, he recognizes it to be Gilda and rushes off to the room where she is held: \"Possente amor mi chiama\" (\"Mighty love beckons me\"). Rigoletto enters singing and feigning nonchalance, but also looking anxiously for any trace of Gilda, whom he fears may have fallen into the hands of the Duke.  The courtiers pretend not to notice his anxiety, but quietly laugh at him with each other.  A [[Page (servant)|page boy]] arrives with a message from the Duke's wife - the Duchess wishes to speak to her husband - but the courtiers reply suggestively that the Duke cannot be disturbed at the moment. Rigoletto realizes this must mean that Gilda is with the Duke.  To the courtiers' surprise, he reveals that Gilda is his daughter. He first demands, then tearfully pleads with the courtiers to return her to him: \"Cortigiani, vil razza dannata\" (\"Accursed race of courtiers\"). Rigoletto attempts to run into the room in which Gilda is being held, but the courtiers block his way.  After a time, Gilda enters, and Rigoletto orders the courtiers to leave him alone with her. The courtiers leave the room, believing Rigoletto has gone mad. Gilda describes to her father what has happened to her in the palace: \"Tutte le feste al tempio\" (\"On all the holy days\") and he attempts to console her. Monterone is led across the room on the way to prison and pauses in front of the portrait of the Duke to regret that his curse on the libertine has had no effect. As the guards lead Monterone away, Rigoletto mutters that the old man is mistaken; he, Rigoletto, the dishonored buffoon, shall make thunder and lightning rain from heaven onto the offender's head. He repeats this vow as Gilda pleads for mercy for her lover the Duke: Duet:\"S\u00ec! Vendetta, tremenda vendetta!\" (\"Yes! Revenge, terrible revenge!\").\n\n=== Act 3 ===\n''The right bank of the river [[Mincio]]. On the left is a two-story house, half ruined. Through a large arch on the ground floor a rustic tavern can be seen as well as a rough stone staircase that leads to an attic room with a small bed which is in full view as there are no shutters. In the wall downstairs that faces the street is a door that opens to the inside. The wall is so full of holes and cracks that everything that happens inside is easily seen from the exterior. At the back of the stage are deserted areas by the river which flows behind a parapet that has half collapsed into ruins. Beyond the river is Mantua. It is night. Gilda and Rigoletto, both uneasy, are standing in the road; Sparafucile is seated at a table in the tavern.''\n\n{{listen\n|title=\"La donna \u00e8 mobile\"\n|filename=La Donna E Mobile Rigoletto.ogg\n|description=[[Enrico Caruso]] singing \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\".

Rigoletto and Gilda arrive outside. The Duke's voice can be heard from inside, singing \"[[La donna \u00e8 mobile]]\" (\"Woman is fickle\").  Sparafucile's sister, Maddalena, has lured him to the house. Rigoletto and Gilda listen from outside as the Duke flirts with Maddalena. Gilda laments that the Duke is unfaithful; Rigoletto assures her that he is arranging revenge: \"[[Bella figlia dell\u2019amore]]\" (\"Beautiful daughter of love\").\n\nRigoletto orders Gilda to put on a man's clothes to prepare to leave for [[Verona]] and tells her that he plans to follow later. After she leaves, he completes his bargain with the assassin, who is ready to murder his guest for 20 [[scudi]].  Rigoletto then withdraws.\n\nWith falling darkness, a thunderstorm approaches and the Duke decides to spend the rest of the night in the house. Sparafucile directs him to the upstairs sleeping quarters, resolving to kill him in his sleep.\n\nGilda, who still loves the Duke despite knowing him to be unfaithful, returns dressed as a man and stands outside the house. Maddalena, who is smitten with the Duke, begs Sparafucile to spare his life: \"\u00c8 amabile invero cotal giovinotto/ Ah, pi\u00f9 non ragiono!...\".  Sparafucile reluctantly promises her that if by midnight another victim can be found, he will kill the other instead of the Duke. Gilda, overhearing this exchange, resolves to sacrifice herself for the Duke, and enters the house: \"Trio: Se pria ch\u2019abbia il mezzo la notte toccato\".  Sparafucile stabs her and she collapses, mortally wounded.\n\nAt midnight, when Rigoletto arrives with money, he receives a corpse wrapped in a sack, and rejoices in his triumph. Weighting it with stones, he is about to cast the sack into the river when he hears the voice of the Duke, sleepily singing a reprise of his \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" aria. Bewildered, Rigoletto opens the sack and, to his despair, discovers his dying daughter. For a moment, she revives and declares she is glad to die for her beloved: \"V'ho ingannato\" (\"Father, I deceived you\"). She dies in his arms.

The Duke sings the cynical \"Questa o quella\" to a flippant tune and then further contrast is again achieved as he attempts to seduce the Countess Ceprano while the strings of a chamber orchestra onstage play an elegant [[minuet]].<ref name=Grove/> The off stage dance music resumes as an ensemble builds between Rigoletto, the angry courtiers and the Duke, interrupted by the furious entry of Monterone. Slithery effects in the strings accompany Rigoletto as he brutally mocks the old man, who responds with his curse, leading to a final dramatic ensemble.\n\nIn its great variety of tone and texture, its use of instrumental resources (the orchestra in the pit, an offstage band, and a chamber ensemble of strings on the stage), its dramatic pacing and the way the music is continuous rather than consisting of  one \"number\" after another, this concise opening scene is unprecedented in Italian opera.<ref name=Grove/>\n\nThe duet between Rigoletto and Sparafucile that opens the second scene of the first act is also unprecedented in its structure, being a free-ranging dialogue with melodies not in the voices but in the orchestra, on a solo cello, solo bass, and low woodwinds to create a distinctive sinister atmosphere.<ref name=Grove/>\n\nThe famous quartet in act three is actually a double duet with each of the characters given a musical identity\u2014the ardent wooing of the Duke, with the main melody, as Maddalena laughingly puts him off, while outside Gilda has a sobbing figure in her vocal line and her father implacably urges revenge.<ref name=\"Brandenburg\">{{cite book |last1=Brandenburg |first1=Daniel |title=Verdi:Rigoletto |date=2012 |publisher=B\u00e4renreiter |isbn=9783761822258}}</ref> Victor Hugo resented his play, which had been banned in France, being transformed into an Italian opera and considered it plagiarism (there were no copyright restrictions against this at the time).<ref name=\"Csampai\">{{cite book |last1=Csampai |first1=Attila |title=Giuseppe Verdi, Rigoletto: Texte, Materialien, Kommentare |date=1982 |publisher=Rowohlt |isbn=9783499174872}}</ref> When Hugo attended a performance of the opera in Paris, however, he marveled at the way Verdi's music in the quartet allowed the emotions of the four different characters to be heard together and yet distinguished clearly from each other at the same time and wished that he could achieve such an effect in a spoken drama.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schwarm |first1=Betsy |title=Rigoletto |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rigoletto |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe section following the quartet, marked \"Scena e Terzetto Tempesta\" (scene and storm trio) is also, as [[Julian Budden]] has written,\"without any antecedent\".<ref>Budden</ref> Very different from the storm music that can be heard in [[Rossini]]'s  ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' or ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' , that of the storm in ''Rigoletto'' is not an interlude between acts or scenes, but is totally integrated into the unfolding of the plot, with its strings in the bass register, its interventions of oboe and piccolo,and especially the male chorus behind the scenes humming through closed mouths to create the sound of the wind, a completely original effect. Composer and professor of experimental music [[Dieter Schnebel]] (1930\u20132018) wrote of this scene\n\n<blockquote>The central storm scene is, so to speak, a film with sound, whose moving images show an exterior and interior drama. The furtive encounters between people in the darkness, irregularly broken by lightning, are exposed by the empty fifths, the tremolos of strings, the brief breakthroughs of the wind instruments, the thunderclaps and the sinister sighs of the chorus, which express as well an external process that is internal: death arrives with thunderclaps. The music always passes in this scene from jerky recitatives to fluid arias...<ref name=\"Csampai\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Musicologist]] Julian Budden regards the opera as \"revolutionary\", just as [[Beethoven]]' ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'' Symphony was: \"the barriers between formal melody and recitative are down as never before. In the whole opera, there is only one conventional double aria [...and there are...] no concerted act finales.\"<ref name=\"BUDD483\">Budden, pp. 483\u2013487</ref> Verdi used that same word\u2014\"revolutionary\"\u2014in a letter to Piave,<ref>Verdi to Piave, October 1854, in Budden, p. 484</ref> and Budden also refers to a letter which Verdi wrote in 1852 in which the composer states that \"I conceived ''Rigoletto'' almost without arias, without finales but only an unending string of duets.\"<ref>Verdi to Borsi, in Budden, p. 483</ref>\n\nBudden's conclusions about this opera and its place in Verdi's output are summed up by noting that:\n\n<blockquote>Just after 1850 at the age of 38 Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with ''Rigoletto''. The so-called ''ottocento'' in music is finished. Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas, but in a totally new spirit.<ref>Budden, p. 510</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAlthough immensely successful  with audiences from the beginning, many critics in various countries condemned the work for its dark and bitterly tragic plot combined with a succession of mere popular tunes, as they thought of the music.

The first LP edition of ''Rigoletto'' (also the very first opera recording on LP) was released by [[RCA Victor]] in 1950 conducted by [[Renato Cellini]] and featured [[Leonard Warren]] in the title role. The opera has also been recorded in German with [[Wilhelm Sch\u00fcchter]] conducting the orchestra and chorus of the [[Berlin State Opera]] in a 1953 recording for [[EMI Records]] and in English with [[Mark Elder]] conducting the orchestra and chorus of the [[English National Opera]] in a 1983 recording for EMI.

On 15 April 1923, [[Lee DeForest]] presented 18 short films in his sound-on-film process [[Phonofilm]], including an excerpt of Act Two of ''Rigoletto'' with Eva Leoni and Company. One of the most famous films based on the opera is the 1982 film<ref name=\"JPP\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253590/ IMDB entry]. Retrieved 14 March 2015</ref> by [[Jean-Pierre Ponnelle]] starring [[Luciano Pavarotti]] as The Duke and [[Ingvar Wixell]] as Rigoletto.  Some film versions, such as the 1993 children's film ''[[Rigoletto (1993 film)|Rigoletto]]'', are based on the opera's plot, but do not use Verdi's music. Curtiss Clayton's 2003 film ''[[Rick (film)|Rick]]'', set in modern-day New York, has a plot based on ''Rigoletto'', but apart from \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" heard in the background during a restaurant scene, does not include any other music from the opera. In the 21st century, the opera was filmed as ''Rigoletto Story'' directed by [[Vittorio Sgarbi]] with costumes by [[Vivienne Westwood]]. First screened at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2004, it subsequently received two [[Grammy]] nominations. In September 2010, [[RAI Television]] filmed the opera on location in Mantua with the court scenes taking place in the [[Palazzo del Te|Palazzo Te]]. The film faithfully followed Verdi's original specification for the action to take place over two days, and each act was performed at the time of day indicated in the libretto. Broadcast live to 148 countries, the film starred [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] in the title role, and [[Vittorio Grigolo]] as The Duke.<ref>Ozorio (8 September 2010)</ref> The plot of the film ''[[Quartet (2012 film)|Quartet]]'' revolves around the quartet \"[[Bella figlia dell\u2019amore]]\", with which the film concludes.\n\nAdaptations of the opera's music include [[Franz Liszt]]'s ''[[Rigoletto Paraphrase]]'', a [[piano transcription]] of \"Bella figlia dell\u2019amore\" (the famous quartet from Act 3) and a [[Fantasia (music)|Fantasia]] on ''Rigoletto'' (Op.82) by [[Sigismond Thalberg]] which was published in Paris in the 1860s.\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Cited sources ===\n* [[Julian Budden|Budden, Julian]] (1984).

Co-produced by [[Mike Hedges]] and the band's [[Robert Smith (singer)|Robert Smith]], it was released as a single from the band's second album ''[[Seventeen Seconds]]'' on 8 April 1980. It was their debut entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching number 31. The accompanying music video was first shown on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' programme on 24 April 1980.\n\nRecorded and mixed over seven days, along with the rest of the songs from the album, \"A Forest\" is representative of the Cure's early-1980s [[gothic rock]] phase. The song has featured on the band's setlists for many years. Several versions have appeared on concert albums, and it was remixed and released as a single from ''[[Mixed Up (The Cure album)|Mixed Up]]'' in 1990.\n\n==Background and recording==\n[[Mike Hedges]] co-produced the album ''[[Seventeen Seconds]]'' as well as \"A Forest\" with the Cure's [[Robert Smith (singer)|Robert Smith]]. Hedges had first worked with the band on the track \"[[Killing an Arab]]\". Interviewed in 2004, he did not recall any demos existing for ''Seventeen Seconds''; the band generally played the track in the studio before laying down a backing track to which overdubs were added.<ref name=\"SOS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec04/articles/classictracks.htm |title=Classic Tracks: The Cure 'A Forest' |last=Buskin |first=Richard |date=December 2004 |work=soundonsound.com |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref> At the time of the recording of the album, bass guitarist [[Simon Gallup]] and keyboardist [[Matthieu Hartley]] had been added to the band's lineup. Gallup had replaced [[Michael Dempsey]], who had departed to join [[The Associates (band)|The Associates]].<ref name=\"SOS\"/> Gallup and Hartley joined remaining Cure members Smith (vocals) and [[Lol Tolhurst]] (drums) in late 1979 during the group's Future Pastimes tour, on which \"A Forest\" was one of the new songs added to their setlist.<ref>Apter, p.&nbsp;109\u2013112</ref>\n\nDue to budgetary restraints, ''Seventeen Seconds'' was recorded and mixed in seven days on a budget of between \u00a32000 and \u00a33000, which resulted in the band working 16 or 17 hours a day to complete the album. Hedges and Robert Smith knew the song would take more work to complete than other songs on the album, and would require more overdubs. The song was one of the last tracks recorded; the backing tracks were recorded first, followed by touch-ups to the individual parts, then Smith's vocals.<ref name=\"SOS\"/> [[Fiction Records]] owner [[Chris Parry (producer)|Chris Parry]] told Smith that the song had the potential to be a hit if they made it sound \"radio friendly\", but Smith refused, stating that the way the track sounded was the sound he envisioned in his head, dismissing concerns about radio friendliness.<ref>Apter, p. 117</ref> Work on mixing \"A Forest\" took up much of the final day of sessions for the album.<ref name=\"SOS\"/>\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"A Forest\" and its parent album ''Seventeen Seconds'' are representative of the Cure's [[gothic rock]] phase in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref name=\"SOS\"/> Cure biographer Jeff Apter refers to \"A Forest\" as \"the definitive early Cure mood piece\" and he argued the song is the centrepiece of the album. Smith's intention with \"A Forest\" was to make a song that was \"really atmospheric\". He has stated that it was a pivotal recording for the group, and represented \"the archetypal Cure sound\".<ref name=\"apter116\">Apter, p. 116</ref>\n\n\"A Forest\" is performed in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[A minor]].<ref name=\"Rooksby98\">Rooksby, p. 98</ref> Initially only the synth, guitar and drums are heard, followed by the introduction of the bass guitar and a second guitar part.<ref>Rooksby (p. 98) claims a drum machine is heard on the song</ref> The song initially follows an Am\u2013C\u2013F\u2013Dm progression. Later on the track, its bridge contains a B\u2013C\u2013F#m\u2013C\u2013B\u2013C sequence, which ends with a chromatic movement to the F chord before returning to Am. Following the echoing repetition of the word \"again\", a guitar solo appears which avoids string bends and moving in a [[pentatonic]] manner. The single version of the song fades out at around four minutes, while on the longer (album) version the instruments exit one by one, concluding with the sound of the bass guitar at 4.46\".<ref>Rooksby, p.&nbsp;98\u201399</ref> The sound of Smith's guitar was a departure from that prevalent in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Rooksby98\"/> Mike Hedges favored the use of [[flanging]] at the time, and he estimated that there were seven flanger devices used on \"A Forest\".<ref name=\"SOS\"/> Rikki Rooksby said that the slow phase effect heard on the guitar in \"A Forest\" \"almost became a Smith trademark for a while\".<ref name=\"Rooksby98\"/> Simon Gallup said that his playing on the track was intended to be reminiscent of the bass work in the music of [[The Stranglers]], whose bassist [[Jean-Jacques Burnel]] was a major influence on him.<ref>Strickland, Britt. \"Simon Gallup: A Cure for the Common Bass\". ''Bass Player''. October 2004.</ref>\n\nSmith has given varying explanations behind his lyrics for \"A Forest\". He has said that the lyrics were based upon a dream he had as a child where he was lost in the woods unable to escape but later denied it and stated, \"It's just about a forest\".<ref name=\"apter116\"/>\n\n==Release and promotion==\n\"A Forest\" was released as a single on 5 April 1980. Its B-side was \"Another Journey by Train\", an instrumental remake of the Cure's \"[[Jumping Someone Else's Train]]\". The single received a mixed critical reception, though commercially its sales were an improvement for the band.<ref>Apter, p. 119</ref> In early 1980, it spent eight weeks in the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at number 31 on 12 April of that year.<ref name=\"UKCHARTS\">[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/cure/ Cure].

Co-produced by [[Mike Hedges]] and the band's [[Robert Smith (singer)|Robert Smith]], it was released as a single from the band's second album ''[[Seventeen Seconds]]'' on 8 April 1980. It was their debut entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching number 31. The accompanying music video was first shown on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' programme on 24 April 1980.\n\nRecorded and mixed over seven days, along with the rest of the songs from the album, \"A Forest\" is representative of the Cure's early-1980s [[gothic rock]] phase. The song has featured on the band's setlists for many years. Several versions have appeared on concert albums, and it was remixed and released as a single from ''[[Mixed Up (The Cure album)|Mixed Up]]'' in 1990.\n\n==Background and recording==\n[[Mike Hedges]] co-produced the album ''[[Seventeen Seconds]]'' as well as \"A Forest\" with the Cure's [[Robert Smith (singer)|Robert Smith]]. Hedges had first worked with the band on the track \"[[Killing an Arab]]\". Interviewed in 2004, he did not recall any demos existing for ''Seventeen Seconds''; the band generally played the track in the studio before laying down a backing track to which overdubs were added.<ref name=\"SOS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec04/articles/classictracks.htm |title=Classic Tracks: The Cure 'A Forest' |last=Buskin |first=Richard |date=December 2004 |work=soundonsound.com |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref> At the time of the recording of the album, bass guitarist [[Simon Gallup]] and keyboardist [[Matthieu Hartley]] had been added to the band's lineup. Gallup had replaced [[Michael Dempsey]], who had departed to join [[The Associates (band)|The Associates]].<ref name=\"SOS\"/> Gallup and Hartley joined remaining Cure members Smith (vocals) and [[Lol Tolhurst]] (drums) in late 1979 during the group's Future Pastimes tour, on which \"A Forest\" was one of the new songs added to their setlist.<ref>Apter, p.&nbsp;109\u2013112</ref>\n\nDue to budgetary restraints, ''Seventeen Seconds'' was recorded and mixed in seven days on a budget of between \u00a32000 and \u00a33000, which resulted in the band working 16 or 17 hours a day to complete the album. Hedges and Robert Smith knew the song would take more work to complete than other songs on the album, and would require more overdubs. The song was one of the last tracks recorded; the backing tracks were recorded first, followed by touch-ups to the individual parts, then Smith's vocals.<ref name=\"SOS\"/> [[Fiction Records]] owner Chris Parry told Smith that the song had the potential to be a hit if they made it sound \"radio friendly\", but Smith refused, stating that the way the track sounded was the sound he envisioned in his head, dismissing concerns about radio friendliness.<ref>Apter, p. 117</ref> Work on mixing \"A Forest\" took up much of the final day of sessions for the album.<ref name=\"SOS\"/>\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"A Forest\" and its parent album ''Seventeen Seconds'' are representative of the Cure's [[gothic rock]] phase in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref name=\"SOS\"/> Cure biographer Jeff Apter refers to \"A Forest\" as \"the definitive early Cure mood piece\" and he argued the song is the centrepiece of the album. Smith's intention with \"A Forest\" was to make a song that was \"really atmospheric\". He has stated that it was a pivotal recording for the group, and represented \"the archetypal Cure sound\".<ref name=\"apter116\">Apter, p. 116</ref>\n\n\"A Forest\" is performed in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[A minor]].<ref name=\"Rooksby98\">Rooksby, p. 98</ref> Initially only the synth, guitar and drums are heard, followed by the introduction of the bass guitar and a second guitar part.<ref>Rooksby (p. 98) claims a drum machine is heard on the song</ref> The song initially follows an Am\u2013C\u2013F\u2013Dm progression. Later on the track, its bridge contains a B\u2013C\u2013F#m\u2013C\u2013B\u2013C sequence, which ends with a chromatic movement to the F chord before returning to Am. Following the echoing repetition of the word \"again\", a guitar solo appears which avoids string bends and moving in a [[pentatonic]] manner. The single version of the song fades out at around four minutes, while on the longer (album) version the instruments exit one by one, concluding with the sound of the bass guitar at 4.46\".<ref>Rooksby, p.&nbsp;98\u201399</ref> The sound of Smith's guitar was a departure from that prevalent in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Rooksby98\"/> Mike Hedges favored the use of [[flanging]] at the time, and he estimated that there were seven flanger devices used on \"A Forest\".<ref name=\"SOS\"/> Rikki Rooksby said that the slow phase effect heard on the guitar in \"A Forest\" \"almost became a Smith trademark for a while\".<ref name=\"Rooksby98\"/> Simon Gallup said that his playing on the track was intended to be reminiscent of the bass work in the music of [[The Stranglers]], whose bassist [[Jean-Jacques Burnel]] was a major influence on him.<ref>Strickland, Britt. \"Simon Gallup: A Cure for the Common Bass\". ''Bass Player''. October 2004.</ref>\n\nSmith has given varying explanations behind his lyrics for \"A Forest\". He has said that the lyrics were based upon a dream he had as a child where he was lost in the woods unable to escape but later denied it and stated, \"It's just about a forest\".<ref name=\"apter116\"/>\n\n==Release and promotion==\n\"A Forest\" was released as a single on 5 April 1980. Its B-side was \"Another Journey by Train\", an instrumental remake of the Cure's \"[[Jumping Someone Else's Train]]\". The single received a mixed critical reception, though commercially its sales were an improvement for the band.<ref>Apter, p. 119</ref> In early 1980, it spent eight weeks in the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at number 31 on 12 April of that year.<ref name=\"UKCHARTS\">[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/cure/ Cure].

He was taken by both the music and vocals, and was especially drawn to Smith's guitar work and the keyboard melody, which he described as \"haunting\".

The project floundered in [[development hell]] for many years; [[Jon Cohen (writer)|Jon Cohen]], [[Todd Alcott]], and [[Joss Whedon]], among others, were also attached to the project at various points. Warner Bros. announced the film in 2010 and Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Inspiration for ''Wonder Woman'' was drawn from Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]]'s 1940s stories and [[George P\u00e9rez]]'s 1980s stories about Wonder Woman, as well as [[the New 52]] incarnation of the character. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before finishing on May 6, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of Marston's birth. Additional filming took place in November 2016.\n\n''Wonder Woman'' had its world premiere in Shanghai on May 15, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 2, 2017, in 2D, [[Real D 3D]], and [[IMAX 3D]] by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received largely positive <!--DO ''not'' PUT ACCLAIM --> reviews, with praise for its direction, acting, visuals, action sequences, and musical score. <ref name=\"reviews\" /> However, it also received criticism for the main villain and the climax.

A plot summary for a film article should be 400\u2013700 words, and should not go below or exceed the required limit. -->\nIn present-day [[Paris]], [[Wonder Woman|Diana]] receives a [[photographic plate]] from [[Wayne Enterprises]] of herself and four men taken during [[World War I]], prompting her to recall her past. The daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], Diana is raised on the hidden island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], home to the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazonian]] women warriors created by [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]] to protect mankind. Hippolyta explains the Amazonian history to Diana, including how [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat. Before dying, Zeus left the Amazons the island and a weapon, the \"Godkiller\", to prepare them for Ares's return.\n\nAlthough she initially forbids Diana to be trained as a warrior, Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let General [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]], Hippolyta's sister and Diana's aunt, train her, only more rigorously than any other warrior.\n\nIn 1918, Diana, now a young woman, rescues US pilot Captain [[Steve Trevor]] when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by [[Imperial German Navy|German]] soldiers that had been pursuing Steve. The Amazons kill the crew, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the [[Lasso of Truth|Lasso of Hestia]] and reveals that a [[World War I|great war]] is consuming the outside world and that he is an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] spy. He has stolen a notebook of the chief chemist [[Doctor Poison|Dr. Isabel Maru]], who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of [[mustard gas]] under the orders of General [[Erich Ludendorff]] from a weapon facility in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the \"Godkiller\" sword, the lasso, and armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and stop Ares for good.\n\nIn [[London]], they deliver Maru's notebook to the [[Supreme War Council]], where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an [[armistice]] with [[German Empire|Germany]]. Diana translates Maru's notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Morgan, recruits Moroccan spy Sameer, Scottish marksman Charlie, and Native American smuggler Chief Napi to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in [[Belgium in World War I|Belgium]]. Diana goes alone through [[No Man's Land]] and captures the enemy trench, allowing the Allied forces to help her liberate the nearby village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates, taking a photograph in the village, while Diana and Steve begin to fall in love.\n\nThe team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German High Command]]. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, and Diana hoping to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills him, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.\n\nMorgan appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in the process, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the \"Godkiller\" sword, he destroys it, then reveals to Diana that she herself is the \"Godkiller\", as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind in order to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, blowing up the plane. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares's lightning into him, killing him for good. Later, the team celebrates the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|end of the war]]. \n\nIn the present day, Diana sends an email to [[Bruce Wayne]] thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve. She continues to fight and give on the world's behalf, understanding that only love can truly save the world.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--STOP! The characters are listed as they are in the film's credits.

In an August 2017 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Cameron qualifies Jenkins's vision of Wonder Woman as \"an objectified icon\" and called the film \"a step backwards\". In contrast, he states, his character Sarah Connor (from his [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'']] films) \"was not a beauty icon.

The project floundered in [[development hell]] for many years; [[Jon Cohen (writer)|Jon Cohen]], [[Todd Alcott]], and [[Joss Whedon]], among others, were also attached to the project at various points. Warner Bros. announced the film in 2010 and Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Inspiration for ''Wonder Woman'' was drawn from Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]]'s 1940s stories and [[George P\u00e9rez]]'s 1980s stories about Wonder Woman, as well as [[the New 52]] incarnation of the character. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before finishing on May 6, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of Marston's birth. Additional filming took place in November 2016.\n\n''Wonder Woman'' had its world premiere in Shanghai on May 15, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 2, 2017, in 2D, [[Real D 3D]], and [[IMAX 3D]] by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received largely positive <!--DO ''not'' PUT ACCLAIM --> reviews, with praise for its direction, acting, visuals, action sequences, and musical score. <ref name=\"reviews\" /> However, it also received criticism for the main villain and the climax.

A plot summary for a film article should be 400\u2013700 words, and should not go below or exceed the required limit. -->\nIn present-day [[Paris]], [[Wonder Woman|Diana]] receives a [[photographic plate]] from [[Wayne Enterprises]] of herself and four men taken during [[World War I]], prompting her to recall her past. The daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], Diana is raised on the hidden island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], home to the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazonian]] women warriors created by [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]] to protect mankind. Hippolyta explains the Amazonian history to Diana, including how [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat. Before dying, Zeus left the Amazons the island and a weapon, the \"Godkiller\", to prepare them for Ares's return.\n\nAlthough she initially forbids Diana to be trained as a warrior, Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let General [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]], Hippolyta's sister and Diana's aunt, train her, only more rigorously than any other warrior.\n\nIn 1918, Diana, now a young woman, rescues US pilot Captain [[Steve Trevor]] when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by [[Imperial German Navy|German]] soldiers that had been pursuing Steve. The Amazons kill the crew, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the [[Lasso of Truth|Lasso of Hestia]] and reveals that a [[World War I|great war]] is consuming the outside world and that he is an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] spy. He has stolen a notebook of the chief chemist [[Doctor Poison|Dr. Isabel Maru]], who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of [[mustard gas]] under the orders of General [[Erich Ludendorff]] from a weapon facility in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the \"Godkiller\" sword, the lasso, and armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and stop Ares for good.\n\nIn [[London]], they deliver Maru's notebook to the [[Supreme War Council]], where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an [[armistice]] with [[German Empire|Germany]]. Diana translates Maru's notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Morgan, recruits Moroccan spy Sameer, Scottish marksman Charlie, and Native American smuggler Chief Napi to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in [[Belgium in World War I|Belgium]]. Diana goes alone through [[No Man's Land]] and captures the enemy trench, allowing the Allied forces to help her liberate the nearby village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates, taking a photograph in the village, while Diana and Steve begin to fall in love.\n\nThe team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German High Command]]. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, and Diana hoping to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills him, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.\n\nMorgan appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in the process, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the \"Godkiller\" sword, he destroys it, then reveals to Diana that she herself is the \"Godkiller\", as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind in order to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, blowing up the plane. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares's lightning into him, killing him for good. Later, the team celebrates the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|end of the war]]. \n\nIn the present day, Diana sends an email to [[Bruce Wayne]] thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve. She continues to fight and give on the world's behalf, understanding that only love can truly save the world.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--STOP! The characters are listed as they are in the film's credits.
