Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. For centuries it was a dominion of [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]], and was then part of France between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the [[Piedmont-Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] until its re-annexation by France in 1860.\n\nThe natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century, when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending their winters there. The city's main seaside promenade, the [[Promenade des Anglais]] (\"Walkway of the English\") owes its name to visitors to the resort.<ref>Alain Ruggiero, op. cit., p. 137</ref>\nThe clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, such as [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Arman]].

Pestilence appeared again in 1550 and 1580.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1600, Nice was briefly taken by the [[House of Guise|Duke of Guise]]. By opening the ports of the county to all nations, and proclaiming full freedom of trade (1626), the commerce of the city was given great stimulus, the noble families taking part in its mercantile enterprises.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nCaptured by [[Nicolas Catinat]] in 1691, Nice was restored to [[Savoy]] in 1696; but [[Siege of Nice (1705)|it was again besieged by the French in 1705]], and in the following year its [[citadel]] and [[Defensive wall|rampart]]s were demolished.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)]] once more gave the city back to the Duke of Savoy, who was on that same occasion recognised as King of Sicily. In the peaceful years which followed, the \"new town\" was built. From 1744 until the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]] the French and Spaniards were again in possession. In 1775 the king, who in 1718 had swapped his sovereignty of Sicily for the Kingdom of Sardinia, destroyed all that remained of the ancient liberties of the [[Commune in France|commune]]. Conquered in 1792 by the armies of the [[First French Republic]], the County of Nice continued to be part of France until 1814; but after that date it reverted to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===French Nice===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]] was signed in 1860 between the [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Sardinian king]] and [[Napoleon III]], the County was again and definitively ceded to France as a territorial reward for French assistance in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], which saw [[Lombardy]] united with [[Piedmont-Sardinia]]. The cession was ratified by a regional [[referendum]]: over 25,000 electors out of a total of 30,700 were in favour of the attachment to [[France]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Nice (France)|volume=19|pages=646\u2013647|inline=1}}</ref> Savoy was also transferred to the French crown by similar means.

By the 1930s more bus connections were added in the area.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the 1930s, Nice hosted international car racing in the [[Formula Libre]] (predecessor to [[Formula One]]) on the so-called Circuit Nice. The circuit started along the waterfront just south of the Jardin Albert I, then headed westward along the [[Promenade des Anglais]] followed by a hairpin turn at the [[Hotel Negresco]] to come back eastward and around the Jardin Albert I before heading again east along the beach on the Quai des Etats-Unis.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bestofniceblog.com/history-nice-france/nice-grand-prix/|title=Nice Grand Prix|access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs war broke out in September 1939, Nice became a city of refuge for many displaced foreigners, notably Jews fleeing the Nazi progression into Eastern Europe. From Nice many sought further shelter in the [[French colonial empire|French colonies]], Morocco and North and South America. After July 1940 and the establishment of the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]], [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] aggressions accelerated the exodus, starting in July 1941 and continuing through 1942. On 26 August 1942, 655 Jews of foreign origin were rounded up by the Laval government and interned in the Auvare barracks. Of these, 560 were deported to [[Drancy internment camp]] on 31 August 1942. Due to the activity of the Jewish banker [[Angelo Donati]] and of the Capuchin friar [[P\u00e8re Marie-Beno\u00eet]] the local authorities hindered the application of anti-Jewish Vichy laws.<ref>L\u00e9on Poliakov, ''La conditions des Juifs sous l'occupation italienne'', Paris, CDJC, 1946 and bibliographies of [[Angelo Donati]] and [[P\u00e8re Marie-Beno\u00eet]]</ref>\n\nThe first [[French Resistance|''r\u00e9sistants'']] to the new regime were a group of High School seniors of the Lyc\u00e9e de Nice, now {{ill|Lyc\u00e9e Mass\u00e9na|fr}}, in September 1940, later arrested and executed in 1944 near [[Verdon Gorge|Castellane]]. The first public demonstrations occurred on 14 July 1942 when several hundred protesters took to the streets along the Avenue de la Victoire and in the Place Mass\u00e9na. In November 1942 German troops moved into most of unoccupied France, but Italian troops moved into a smaller zone including Nice. A certain ambivalence remained among the population, many of whom were recent immigrants of Italian ancestry. However, the resistance gained momentum after the Italian surrender in 1943 when the German army occupied the former Italian zone. Reprisals intensified between December 1943 and July 1944, when many partisans were tortured and executed by the local [[Gestapo]] and the [[Milice|French Milice]]. Nice was also heavily bombarded by American aircraft in preparation for the Allied [[Operation Dragoon|landing in Provence]] (1000 dead or wounded and more than 5600 people homeless) and famine ensued during summer 1944.\nAmerican paratroopers entered the city on 30 August 1944 and Nice was finally liberated.\nThe consequences of the war were heavy: the population decreased by 15% {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and economic life was totally disrupted.\n[[File:Colline du chateau waterfall.jpg|thumb|The waterfall on the Colline du Ch\u00e2teau (Castle Hill)]]\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Nice enjoyed an economic boom primarily driven by tourism and construction. Two men dominated this period: [[Jean M\u00e9decin]], [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] for 33 years from 1928 to 1943 and from 1947 to 1965, and his son [[Jacques M\u00e9decin|Jacques]], mayor for 24 years from 1966 to 1990. Under their leadership, there was extensive urban renewal, including many new constructions. These included the convention centre, theatres, new thoroughfares and expressways. The arrival of the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]], refugees from Algeria after 1962 independence, also gave the city a boost and somewhat changed the make-up of its population and traditional views. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} By the late 1980s, rumors of political corruption in the city government surfaced; and eventually formal accusations against Jacques M\u00e9decin forced him to flee France in 1990. Later arrested in [[Uruguay]] in 1993, he was extradited back to France in 1994, convicted of several counts of corruption and associated crimes and sentenced to imprisonment.\n\nOn 16 October 1979, a [[landslide]] and an undersea slide caused two [[tsunami]]s that hit the western coast of Nice; these [[1979 Nice events|events]] killed between 8 and 23 people.\n\nIn February 2001, European leaders met in Nice to negotiate and sign what is now the [[Treaty of Nice]], amending the institutions of the European Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/irish-referendum-on-nice-treaty-doomed-to-fail-again-189539.html|title=Irish referendum on Nice Treaty 'doomed to fail again'|work=[[The Independent]]|date=23 May 2002|first=Shawn|last=Pogatchnik|accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, local Chief [[Prosecutor]] [[\u00c9ric de Montgolfier]] alleged that some judicial cases involving local personalities had been suspiciously derailed by the local judiciary, which he suspected of having unhealthy contacts through [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lodges with the defendants.

[[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] sits on an enclosed bay, while the main expanse of the city lies between the old port city and the Aeroport de C\u00f4te d'Azur, across a gently curving bay. The city rises from the flat beach into gentle rising hills, then is bounded by surrounding mountains that represent the Southern and nearly the Western extent of the [[Ligurian Alps]] range.\n\n===Flora===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nThe natural vegetation of Nice is typical for a Mediterranean landscape, with a heavy representation of broadleaf evergreen shrubs. Trees tend to be scattered but form dense forests in some areas. Large native tree species include evergreens such as [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]], [[stone pine]] and [[arbutus]]. Many introduced species grow in parks and gardens. [[Palm tree|Palm]]s, [[eucalyptus]] and [[citrus fruit]]s are among the trees which give Nice a subtropical appearance. But there are also species familiar to temperate areas around the world; examples include [[Horse-chestnut (tree)|horse chestnut]], [[Tilia|linden]] and even [[Norway spruce]].\n\n===Climate===\nNice has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Csa'') with characteristics of a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] : ''Csb''), enjoying mild winters with moderate rainfall. It is one of the warmest Mediterranean climates for its latitude. Summers are warm to hot, dry, and sunny. Rainfall is rare in this season, and a typical July month only records one or two days with measurable rainfall. The temperature is typically above {{convert|26|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} but rarely above {{convert|32|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. The climate data is recorded from the airport, located just metres from the sea. Summer temperatures, therefore, are often higher in the city. The average maximum temperature in the warmest months of July and August is about {{convert|27|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. The highest recorded temperature  was {{convert|37.7|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}} on 1 August 2006. Autumn generally starts sunny in September and becomes more cloudy and rainy towards October, while temperatures usually remain above {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} until November where days start to cool down to around {{convert|17|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nWinters are characterised by mild days ({{convert|11|to|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}), cool nights ({{convert|4|to|9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}), and variable weather. Days can be either sunny and dry or damp and rainy. The average minimum temperature in January is around {{convert|5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Frost is unusual and snowfalls are rare. The most recent snowfall in Nice was on 26 February 2018.<ref>\"[https://www.thelocal.fr/20180226/in-pictures-french-riviera-in-the-snow French Riviera hit by snowfall]\". ''The Local fr''.

tourism==\n[[File:NiceVieuxCartier.JPG|thumb|View of the old town]]\nNice is the seat of the [[Chambre de commerce et d'industrie Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur]], which manages the Port of Nice. Investors from France and abroad can benefit from the assistance of the C\u00f4te d'Azur Economic Development Agency [[Team C\u00f4te d'Azur]].\n\nNice has one conference centre: the [[Palais des Congr\u00e8s Acropolis]]. The city also has several business parks, including [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise L' Arenas|l'Arenas]], [[Districts of Ni\u00e7oise Nice businesses Plaine|Nice the Plain]], [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise Nice M\u00e9ridia|Nice M\u00e9ridia]], [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise Saint Isidore|Saint Isidore]], and the Northern Forum.\n\nIn addition, the city features several shopping centres such as Nicetoile, Nice TNL, Nice Lingosti\u00e8re, Northern Forum, St-Isidore, the Trinity (around the [[Auchan]] [[hypermarket]]), Cap3000 in [[Saint-Laurent-du-Var]] and [[Polygone Riviera]] in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].\n\n[[Sophia Antipolis]] is a technology park northwest of [[Antibes]]. Much of the park is within the commune of [[Valbonne]]. Established between 1970 and 1984, it primarily houses companies in the fields of computing, electronics, pharmacology and biotechnology. Several institutions of higher learning are also located here, along with the European headquarters of W3C.\n\nThe Nice metropolitan area had a [[List of cities by GDP|GDP amounting to $47.7 billion]], and $34,480 per capita,<ref name=\"Brookings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|title=Global city GDP 2011|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=4 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605135349/http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|archivedate=5 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> slightly lower than the French average.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Port===\n[[File:Hafen von Nizza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Port of Nice]]\nThe main port of Nice is also known as Lympia port. This name comes from the Lympia spring which fed a small lake in a marshy zone where work on the port was started in 1745. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Today this is the principal harbour installation of Nice \u2013 there is also a small port in the Carras district. The port is the first port cement manufacturer in France, linked to the treatment plants of the rollers of the valley of Paillon. Fishing activities remain but the number of professional fishermen is now less than 10. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Nice, being the point of continental France nearest to [[Corsica]], has ferry connections with the island developed with the arrival of NGV (''navires \u00e0 grande vitesse'') or [[high-speed craft]]. The connections are provided by [[Corsica Ferries - Sardinia Ferries]]. Located in front of the port, the Place Cassini has been renamed Place of Corsica.\n\n===Airport===\n\n[[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]] is the third busiest airport in France after [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and [[Orly Airport]], both near Paris. It is on the [[Promenade des Anglais]], near l'Ar\u00e9nas and has two [[Airport terminal|terminals]]. Due to its proximity to the Principality of [[Monaco]], it also serves as that city\u2013state's airport. A helicopter service provided by [[Heli Air Monaco]] and [[Monacair]] links the city and airport. It is run by the ACA (A\u00e9roports C\u00f4te d'Azur), which includes [[Cannes - Mandelieu Airport]] and [[La M\u00f4le \u2013 Saint-Tropez Airport]]. Public transportation into the city proper is serviced by the [[Nice tramway|Tramway]] line 2 (T2).\n\n===Rail===\n\nThe main railway station is [[Gare de Nice-Ville|Nice-Ville]], served both by high speed [[TGV]] trains connecting Paris and Nice in less than 6 hours and by local commuter [[TER Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur|TER]] services. [[Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles|Marseille]] is reached in 2.5 hours. Nice also has international connections to Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, and Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11400917|title=French Riviera train for Russia|work=BBC News  |date=23 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref> Nice is also served by several suburban stations including [[Gare de Nice-Saint-Augustin|Nice St-Augustin]], Nice St-Roch and [[Gare de Nice-Riquier|Nice Riquier]].\n\nNice is also the southern terminus of the independently run [[Chemins de Fer de Provence]] railway line which connects the city with [[Digne]] in approximatively 4 hours. A metro-like suburban service is also provided on the southern part of the line.\n\n===Tram===\n[[Trams in Nice|Tramway de Nice]] began operating horse-drawn trams in 1879. Electrified in 1900, the combined length of the network reached {{convert|144|km|2|abbr=on}} by 1930. The replacement of trams with [[trolleybus]]es began in 1948 and was completed in 1953.\n\nIn 2007, the new [[Nice tramway|Tramway de Nice]] linked the northern and eastern suburbs via the city centre. Two other lines are currently under construction and partly operating. The second line runs east-west from [[Avenue Jean M\u00e9decin|Jean M\u00e9decin]] to the [[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]] (and will reach the Port at the end of 2019), while the third line will provide a connection to the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin and to Lingosti\u00e8re railway station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |title=Dates et chiffres cl\u00e9s / La ligne 1 / Accueil \u2013 Tramway de la Communaut\u00e9 Urbaine Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur |language=fr |publisher=Tramway.nice.fr |date= |accessdate=15 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906064924/http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |archivedate=6 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A fourth line is set to run from the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin to [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].\n\n===Road===\n\nThe [[A8 autoroute]] and the [[Route nationale 7]] pass through the Nice agglomeration.\n\n==Sights==\n{{wide image|Nice Panorama Beachfront Cropped.jpg|900px|alt=|align-cap=center|Panorama of the town (including many main sights, like Hotel Negresco) and the beach}}\n{{wide image|Nice from Castle Hill 01.jpg|900px|alt=|align-cap=center|Panorama of Nice from Colline du Ch\u00e2teau}}\n[[File:Hotel Negresco (2).JPG|thumb|[[Hotel Negresco]]]]\n[[File:Nice-seafront.jpg|thumb|Seafront of the city]]\nThe [[Promenade des Anglais]] (\"Promenade of the English\") is a promenade along the Baie des Anges (\"Bay of the Angels\"), which is a bay of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], in Nice. Before Nice was urbanised, the coastline at Nice was just bordered by a deserted stretch of [[shingle beach]] (covered with large pebbles). The first houses were located on higher ground well away from the sea, as wealthy tourists visiting Nice in the 18th century did not come for the beach, but for the gentle winter weather. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The areas close to the water were home to Nice's dockworkers and fishermen.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, many wealthy English people took to spending the winter in Nice, enjoying the panorama along the coast. When a particularly harsh winter up north brought an influx of beggars to Nice, some of the rich Englishmen proposed a useful project for them: the construction of a walkway (''chemin de promenade'') along the sea. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe city of Nice, intrigued by the prospect of a pleasant promenade, greatly increased the scope of the work. The Promenade was first called the ''Camin dei Angl\u00e8s'' (the English Way) by the Ni\u00e7ois in their native dialect, [[Ni\u00e7ard|Nissart]]. After the annexation of Nice by France in 1860 it was rechristened ''La Promenade des Anglais'', replacing the former Nissart name with its French translation. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe [[Hotel Negresco]] on the Promenade des Anglais was named after [[Henri Negresco]] (1868\u20131920) who had the palatial hotel constructed in 1912. In keeping with the conventions of the time, when the Negresco first opened in 1913 its front opened on the side opposite the Mediterranean. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAnother place worth mentioning is the small street parallel to the Promenade des Anglais, leading from Nice's downtown, beginning at Place Mass\u00e9na and running parallel to the promenade in the direction of the airport for a short distance of about 4 blocks. This section of the city is referred to as the \"Zone Pietonne\", or \"Pedestrian Zone\". Cars are not allowed (with exception to delivery trucks), making this avenue a popular walkway.\n\nOld Nice is also home to the [[Op\u00e9ra de Nice]]. It was constructed at the end of the 19th century under the design of Fran\u00e7ois Aune, to replace King Charles F\u00e9lix's Maccarani Theater. Today, it is open to the public and provides a regular program of performances.\n\nOther sights include:\n* [[Castle of Nice|Ch\u00e2teau]]\n* ''Monument aux morts''\n* The port\n* ''Cours Saleya''\n* ''[[Jardin botanique de la Ville de Nice]]'' (botanical garden)\n* '' Musee Massena''\n* ''March\u00e9 aux fleurs''\n* Old Nice\n* ''Grand H\u00f4tel Imp\u00e9rial''\n* Fort of Mont Alban\n\n===Squares===\n\n====Place Mass\u00e9na====\n[[File:Placemassena1.JPG|thumb|View of the Place Mass\u00e9na]]\n[[File:Place Massena by night.jpg|thumb|Place Mass\u00e9na by night, 2012]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThe ''Place Mass\u00e9na'' is the main square of the city. Before the [[Paillon]] River was covered over, the Pont-Neuf was the only practicable way between the old town and the modern one. The square was thus divided into two parts (North and South) in 1824. With the demolition of the Mass\u00e9na Casino in 1979, the Place Mass\u00e9na became more spacious and less dense and is now bordered by red ochre buildings of [[Italian architecture]].\n\nThe recent rebuilding of the tramline gave the square back to the pedestrians, restoring its status as a real Mediterranean square. It is lined with palm trees and stone pines, instead of being the rectangular roundabout of sorts it had become over the years. Since its construction, the Place Mass\u00e9na has always been the spot for great public events. It is used for concerts, and particularly during the summer festivals, the ''[[Nice Carnival|Corso carnavalesque]]'' (carnival parade) in February, the military procession of 14 July (Bastille Day) or other traditional celebrations and banquets.\n\nThe Place Mass\u00e9na is a two-minute walk from the [[Promenade des Anglais]], old town, town centre, and Albert I Garden (''Jardin Albert Ier''). It is also a large crossroads between several of the main streets of the city: [[avenue Jean M\u00e9decin]], ''avenue F\u00e9lix Faure'', ''boulevard Jean Jaur\u00e8s'', ''avenue de Verdun'' and ''rue Gioffredo''.\n\n====Place Garibaldi====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Nice Place Garibaldi 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Garibaldi's monument, Place Garibaldi]]\nThe ''Place Garibaldi'' also stands out for its architecture and history. It is named after [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], hero of the [[Italian unification]] (born in Nice in 1807 when Nice was part of the Napoleonic Empire, before reverting to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia). The square was built at the end of the 18th century and served as the entry gate to the city and end of the road to Turin. It took several names between 1780 and 1870 (Pla\u00e7a Pairouli\u00e8ra, Place de la R\u00e9publique, Place Napol\u00e9on, Place d'Armes, Place Saint-Augustin, Piazza Vittorio) and finally Place Garibaldi in September 1870.\n\nA statue of Garibaldi, who was fiercely in favour of the union of Nice with Italy, stands in the centre of the square. The recent rebuilding of the area to accommodate the new tramway line gave mostly the entire square to pedestrians. The architecture is in line with the Turin model, which was the norm of urban renewal throughout the entire realm of the House of Savoy.\n[[File:Nice tramway place Garibaldi.jpg|thumb|left|Place Garibaldi, pedestrian since the introduction of the Nice tramway.]]\n\nIt is a crossroads between the ''Vieux Nice'' (old town) and the town centre. Place Garibaldi is close to the eastern districts of Nice, ''Port Lympia'' (Lympia Harbour), and the TNL commercial centre. This square is also a junction of several important streets: the ''boulevard Jean-Jaur\u00e8s'', the ''avenue de la R\u00e9publique'', the ''rue Cassini'' and the ''rue Catherine-S\u00e9gurane''.\n\n====Place Rossetti====\n[[File:Cath\u00e9drale Sainte R\u00e9parate in Nice.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral]]\nEntirely enclosed and pedestrianised, this square is located in the heart of the old town. With typical buildings in red and yellow ochres surrounding the square, the ''cath\u00e9drale Sainte-R\u00e9parate'' and the fountain in the centre, ''place Rossetti'' is a must-see spot in the old town. By day, the place is invaded by the terraces of traditional restaurants and the finest ice-cream makers. By night, the environment changes radically, with tourists and youths flocking to the square, where music reverberates on the walls of the small square. The square's lighting at night gives it a magical aspect.\n\nPlace Rossetti is in the centre of the old town, streets ''Jesus'', ''Rossetti'', ''Masco\u00efnat'' and the ''Pont-vieux'' (old bridge)\n\n====Cours Saleya====\n[[File:Saleya nice.jpg|thumb|Saleya Course (2007)]]\nThe Cours Saleya is situated parallel to the ''Quai des \u00c9tats-Unis''. In the past, it belonged to the upper classes. It is probably the most traditional square of the town, with its daily flower market. The ''Cours Saleya'' also opens on the ''Palais des Rois Sardes'' (Palace of the Kings of Sardinia). In the present, the ''court'' is mostly a place of entertainment.\n\n====Place du Palais====\n[[File:NIKAIA-palaisN5.jpg|thumb|Place du Palais view of the Rusca palace]]\nAs its name indicates, the ''Place du Palais'' is where the ''Palais de la Justice'' (Law courts) of Nice is located. On this square, there also is the ''Palais Rusca'', which also belongs to the justice department (home of the ''tribunal de grande instance'').\n\nThe square is also notable due to the presence of the city clock. Today, the ''Place du Palais'' is alive day and night. Often, groups of youths will hangout on the steps leading to the ''Palais de la Justice''. Concerts, films, and other major public events frequently occur in this space.\n\nIt is situated halfway between the ''Cours Saleya'' and ''Place Mass\u00e9na''.\n\n===Religious===\n[[File:2006.09.30 St Martin-kirken bak Colline du Chateau.JPG|thumb|The Church of St. Martin in Nice]]\n* [[Nice Cathedral|Sainte-R\u00e9parate Cathedral]], 17th century\n* [[Russian Orthodox Cathedral, Nice|Russian Orthodox Cathedral]]\n* [[Notre-Dame de Nice]]\n* [[Sainte Jeanne d'Arc Church (Nice, France)|Sainte Jeanne d'Arc Church]], 20th century\n\n===Sports and entertainment===\n* [[Stade du Ray]] (demolished) \n* [[Allianz Riviera]]\n* [[Stade Charles-Ehrmann]]\n* [[Palais Nikaia]]\n* [[Nice Jazz Festival]]\n\n==Sport==\n* The city's major [[association football|football]] club is [[OGC Nice]]. They play in [[Ligue 1]] (the top division in France).\n* The [[Olympic Nice]] swimming club ({{lang-fr|Olympic Nice Natation}}) is also notable; [[Camille Muffat]] and [[Yannick Agnel]] used to train there for example.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympicnice.com/|title=Olympic Nice Natation homepage|publisher=Olympic Nice Natation|language=French}}</ref>\n* Nice hosts the finish of the annual [[bicycle road racing|cycling race]] [[Paris\u2013Nice]].\n* The Nice Hockey \u00c9lite club play in [[Ligue Magnus]], the top men's division of the French ice hockey pyramid.\n* The [[Stade Ni\u00e7ois]] is an rugby club playing in [[F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1]].\n\n==Population==\n{{Update section|date=January 2017}}\n{{Table Population Town}}\nThe metropolitan area of Nice, defined by INSEE, is home to 888,784 inhabitants (fifth most populous in France) and its urban area totals 933,080 inhabitants, which makes it the sixth largest in France.\n\n[[File:Nice vietnamese restaurant 3630.JPG|thumb|Nice residents of [[Vietnam]]ese descent stand in front of one of the many Vietnamese restaurants of the city.]]\n\nSince the 1970s, the number of inhabitants has not changed significantly; the relatively high migration to Nice is balanced by a natural negative growth of the population.\n\n==Observatory==\n[[File:Coupole Bischoffsheim.jpg|thumb|View of the Bischoffsheim cupola, the main cupola of [[Nice Observatory]]]]\nThe ''Observatoire de Nice'' ([[Nice Observatory]]) is located on the summit of Mont Gros. The observatory was established in 1879 by the banker [[Rapha\u00ebl Bischoffsheim]]. The architect was [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]; [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed the main dome.\n\nThe 76-cm (30-inch) [[refractor telescope]] that became operational in 1888 was at that time the world's largest telescope.\n\n==Culture==\nTerra-Amata, an archaeological site dating from the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] age, is situated near Nice. Nice itself was established by the ancient [[Greeks]]. There was also an independent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, Cemenelum, near Nice, where the hill of Cimiez is located. It is an archaeological site with treasures, of which only a small part has been excavated. The excavated site includes thermal baths, arenas and Roman road.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nSince the 2nd century AD, the light of the city has attracted painters and sculptors such as [[Chagall]], [[Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Yves Klein|Klein]], [[Arman]] and [[Sacha Sosno|Sosno]]. Nice inspired many composers and intellectuals in different countries e.g. [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]],  [[Rossini]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], etc.\n\nNice also has numerous museums of all kinds: [[Mus\u00e9e Marc Chagall]], [[Mus\u00e9e Matisse (Nice)|Mus\u00e9e Matisse]] (arenas of Cimiez containing Roman ruins), [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nice|Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts]], [[Mus\u00e9e international d'Art na\u00eff Anatole Jakovsky]], Mus\u00e9e Terra-Amata, Museum of Asian Art, [[Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne et d'art contemporain]] which devotes much space to the well-known '' \u00c9cole of Nice ''\u201d), Museum of Natural History, Mus\u00e9e Mass\u00e9na, Naval Museum and ''Galerie des Ponchettes''.\n\nBeing a vacation resort, Nice hosts many festivals throughout the year, such as the [[Nice Carnival]] and the [[Nice Jazz Festival]].\n\nNice has a distinct culture due to its unique history. The local language ''[[Ni\u00e7ard]] (Nissart)'' is an [[Occitan]] dialect (but some Italian scholars argue that it is a [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] dialect).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} It is still spoken by a substantial minority {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. Strong [[Italian culture|Italian]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Corsica]]n influences make it more intelligible to speakers of Italian than to other extant Proven\u00e7al dialects.\n\nIn the past, Nice welcomed many immigrants from [[Italy]] (who continue to make up a large proportion of the population), as well as Spanish and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] immigrants. However, in the past few decades immigration has been opened to include immigrants from all over the world, particularly those from former Northern and Western African colonies, as well as southeast Asia{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Traditions are still alive, especially in [[folk music]] and dances, including the [[farandole]] \u2013 an open-chain community dance.\n\nSince 1860 a cannon (based at the Ch\u00e2teau east of Old Nice) is shot at twelve o'clock sharp. The detonation can be heard almost all over the city. This tradition goes back to Sir Thomas Coventry, who intended to remind the citizens of having lunch on time.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130411000725/http://www.francemonthly.com/nice-french-riviera/ Nice \u2013 French Riviera: Noon on the Dot] from ''francemonthly.com''. Retrieved 11 February 2013.</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\nThe cuisine of Nice is especially close to those of [[Provence]] but also [[Liguria]] and [[Piedmont]] and uses local ingredients ([[olive oil]], [[anchovies]], fruit and vegetables) but also those from more remote regions, in particular from Northern Europe, because ships which came to pick up olive oil arrived full of food products, such as dried [[haddock]].\n\nNice has a few local dishes. There is a local tart made with onions and [[anchovies]] (or anchovy paste), named \"[[Pissaladi\u00e8re]]\". ''[[Socca]]'' is a type of pancake made from [[chickpea]] flour. ''[[Farcis ni\u00e7ois]]'' is a dish made from vegetables stuffed with a mixture of breadcrumbs, meat (generally sausage and ground beef), and herbs; and ''[[salade ni\u00e7oise]]'' is a tomato salad with green peppers of the \"Corne\" variety, baked eggs, tuna or anchovies, and olives.\n\nLocal meat comes from neighbouring valleys, such as the sheep of [[Sisteron]]. Local fish, such as mullets, bream, sea urchins, and anchovies (alevins) are used to a great extent, so much so that it has given birth to a proverb: \"fish are born in the sea and die in oil\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=What Caesar Did For My Salad: The Secret Meanings of our Favourite Dishes|last=Jack|first=Albert|publisher=Penguin

[[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport|Nice's airport]] serves as a gateway to the region.\n\nThe city is nicknamed ''Nice la Belle'' (''[[Nissa La Bella]]'' in [[Ni\u00e7ard]]), which means ''Nice the Beautiful'', which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, written by [[Menica Rondelly]] in 1912. The area of today's Nice contains [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]], an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago.

Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. For centuries it was a dominion of [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]], and was then part of France between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the [[Piedmont-Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] until its re-annexation by France in 1860.\n\nThe natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century, when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending their winters there. The city's main seaside promenade, the [[Promenade des Anglais]] (\"Walkway of the English\") owes its name to visitors to the resort.<ref>Alain Ruggiero, op. cit., p. 137</ref>\nThe clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, such as [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Arman]].

The city soon became one of the busiest trading ports on the Ligurian coast; but it had an important rival in the Roman town of [[Cemenelum]], which continued to exist as a separate city until the time of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] invasions.<ref name=EB1911/> The ruins of Cemenelum are in [[Cimiez]], now a district of Nice.\n\n===Early development===\n{{See also|Roman Catholic Diocese of Nice|County of Nice}}\n[[File:Nice tour Saint-Francois.jpg|thumb|upright|The Tower of St Fran\u00e7ois]]\n\nIn the 7th century, Nice joined the [[Genoa|Genoese]] League formed by the towns of [[Liguria]]. In 729 the city repulsed the [[Saracens]]; but in 859 and again in 880 the Saracens pillaged and burned it, and for most of the 10th century remained masters of the surrounding country.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], Nice participated in the wars and [[history of Italy]]. As an ally of [[Pisa]] it was the enemy of [[Genoa]], and both the [[King of France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] endeavoured to subjugate it; but in spite of this it maintained its municipal liberties. During the 13th and 14th centuries the city fell more than once into the hands of the [[Counts of Provence]],<ref name=EB1911/> but it regained its independence even though related to Genoa.\n\n[[File:Italia 1494-es.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Duchy of Savoy (red) and other independent Italian states in 1494]]\n\n===Defences===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nThe medieval city walls surrounded the Old Town.

Another river flowed into the port on the east side of Castle Hill.

Pestilence appeared again in 1550 and 1580.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1600, Nice was briefly taken by the [[House of Guise|Duke of Guise]]. By opening the ports of the county to all nations, and proclaiming full freedom of trade (1626), the commerce of the city was given great stimulus, the noble families taking part in its mercantile enterprises.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nCaptured by [[Nicolas Catinat]] in 1691, Nice was restored to [[Savoy]] in 1696; but [[Siege of Nice (1705)|it was again besieged by the French in 1705]], and in the following year its [[citadel]] and [[Defensive wall|rampart]]s were demolished.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)]] once more gave the city back to the Duke of Savoy, who was on that same occasion recognised as King of Sicily. In the peaceful years which followed, the \"new town\" was built. From 1744 until the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]] the French and Spaniards were again in possession. In 1775 the king, who in 1718 had swapped his sovereignty of Sicily for the Kingdom of Sardinia, destroyed all that remained of the ancient liberties of the [[Commune in France|commune]]. Conquered in 1792 by the armies of the [[First French Republic]], the County of Nice continued to be part of France until 1814; but after that date it reverted to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===French Nice===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]] was signed in 1860 between the [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Sardinian king]] and [[Napoleon III]], the County was again and definitively ceded to France as a territorial reward for French assistance in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], which saw [[Lombardy]] united with [[Piedmont-Sardinia]]. The cession was ratified by a regional [[referendum]]: over 25,000 electors out of a total of 30,700 were in favour of the attachment to [[France]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Nice (France)|volume=19|pages=646\u2013647|inline=1}}</ref> Savoy was also transferred to the French crown by similar means.

By the 1930s more bus connections were added in the area.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the 1930s, Nice hosted international car racing in the [[Formula Libre]] (predecessor to [[Formula One]]) on the so-called Circuit Nice. The circuit started along the waterfront just south of the Jardin Albert I, then headed westward along the [[Promenade des Anglais]] followed by a hairpin turn at the [[Hotel Negresco]] to come back eastward and around the Jardin Albert I before heading again east along the beach on the Quai des Etats-Unis.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bestofniceblog.com/history-nice-france/nice-grand-prix/|title=Nice Grand Prix|access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs war broke out in September 1939, Nice became a city of refuge for many displaced foreigners, notably Jews fleeing the Nazi progression into Eastern Europe. From Nice many sought further shelter in the [[French colonial empire|French colonies]], Morocco and North and South America. After July 1940 and the establishment of the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]], [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] aggressions accelerated the exodus, starting in July 1941 and continuing through 1942. On 26 August 1942, 655 Jews of foreign origin were rounded up by the Laval government and interned in the Auvare barracks. Of these, 560 were deported to [[Drancy internment camp]] on 31 August 1942. Due to the activity of the Jewish banker [[Angelo Donati]] and of the Capuchin friar [[P\u00e8re Marie-Beno\u00eet]] the local authorities hindered the application of anti-Jewish Vichy laws.<ref>L\u00e9on Poliakov, ''La conditions des Juifs sous l'occupation italienne'', Paris, CDJC, 1946 and bibliographies of [[Angelo Donati]] and [[P\u00e8re Marie-Beno\u00eet]]</ref>\n\nThe first [[French Resistance|''r\u00e9sistants'']] to the new regime were a group of High School seniors of the Lyc\u00e9e de Nice, now {{ill|Lyc\u00e9e Mass\u00e9na|fr}}, in September 1940, later arrested and executed in 1944 near [[Verdon Gorge|Castellane]]. The first public demonstrations occurred on 14 July 1942 when several hundred protesters took to the streets along the Avenue de la Victoire and in the Place Mass\u00e9na. In November 1942 German troops moved into most of unoccupied France, but Italian troops moved into a smaller zone including Nice. A certain ambivalence remained among the population, many of whom were recent immigrants of Italian ancestry. However, the resistance gained momentum after the Italian surrender in 1943 when the German army occupied the former Italian zone. Reprisals intensified between December 1943 and July 1944, when many partisans were tortured and executed by the local [[Gestapo]] and the [[Milice|French Milice]]. Nice was also heavily bombarded by American aircraft in preparation for the Allied [[Operation Dragoon|landing in Provence]] (1000 dead or wounded and more than 5600 people homeless) and famine ensued during summer 1944.\nAmerican paratroopers entered the city on 30 August 1944 and Nice was finally liberated.\nThe consequences of the war were heavy: the population decreased by 15% {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and economic life was totally disrupted.\n[[File:Colline du chateau waterfall.jpg|thumb|The waterfall on the Colline du Ch\u00e2teau (Castle Hill)]]\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Nice enjoyed an economic boom primarily driven by tourism and construction. Two men dominated this period: [[Jean M\u00e9decin]], [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] for 33 years from 1928 to 1943 and from 1947 to 1965, and his son [[Jacques M\u00e9decin|Jacques]], mayor for 24 years from 1966 to 1990. Under their leadership, there was extensive urban renewal, including many new constructions. These included the convention centre, theatres, new thoroughfares and expressways. The arrival of the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]], refugees from Algeria after 1962 independence, also gave the city a boost and somewhat changed the make-up of its population and traditional views. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} By the late 1980s, rumors of political corruption in the city government surfaced; and eventually formal accusations against Jacques M\u00e9decin forced him to flee France in 1990.

The eagle standing over the three hills is a depiction of Savoy, referring to its domination over the country around Nice.<ref name=\"schor_22_23\"/> The combination of silver and red (argent and gules) is a reference to the colours of the [[Savoy|flag of Savoy]].<ref name=\"schor_22_23\"/> The three mountains symbolise a territorial honour, without concern for geographic realism.<ref name=\"schor_22_23\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n\nNice consists of two large bays. [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] sits on an enclosed bay, while the main expanse of the city lies between the old port city and the Aeroport de C\u00f4te d'Azur, across a gently curving bay. The city rises from the flat beach into gentle rising hills, then is bounded by surrounding mountains that represent the Southern and nearly the Western extent of the [[Ligurian Alps]] range.\n\n===Flora===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nThe natural vegetation of Nice is typical for a Mediterranean landscape, with a heavy representation of broadleaf evergreen shrubs. Trees tend to be scattered but form dense forests in some areas. Large native tree species include evergreens such as [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]], [[stone pine]] and [[arbutus]]. Many introduced species grow in parks and gardens. [[Palm tree|Palm]]s, [[eucalyptus]] and [[citrus fruit]]s are among the trees which give Nice a subtropical appearance. But there are also species familiar to temperate areas around the world; examples include [[Horse-chestnut (tree)|horse chestnut]], [[Tilia|linden]] and even [[Norway spruce]].\n\n===Climate===\nNice has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Csa'') with characteristics of a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] : ''Csb''), enjoying mild winters with moderate rainfall. It is one of the warmest Mediterranean climates for its latitude. Summers are warm to hot, dry, and sunny. Rainfall is rare in this season, and a typical July month only records one or two days with measurable rainfall. The temperature is typically above {{convert|26|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} but rarely above {{convert|32|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. The climate data is recorded from the airport, located just metres from the sea. Summer temperatures, therefore, are often higher in the city. The average maximum temperature in the warmest months of July and August is about {{convert|27|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. The highest recorded temperature  was {{convert|37.7|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}} on 1 August 2006. Autumn generally starts sunny in September and becomes more cloudy and rainy towards October, while temperatures usually remain above {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} until November where days start to cool down to around {{convert|17|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nWinters are characterised by mild days ({{convert|11|to|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}), cool nights ({{convert|4|to|9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}), and variable weather. Days can be either sunny and dry or damp and rainy. The average minimum temperature in January is around {{convert|5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Frost is unusual and snowfalls are rare. The most recent snowfall in Nice was on 26 February 2018.<ref>\"[https://www.thelocal.fr/20180226/in-pictures-french-riviera-in-the-snow French Riviera hit by snowfall]\". ''The Local fr''.

tourism==\n[[File:NiceVieuxCartier.JPG|thumb|View of the old town]]\nNice is the seat of the [[Chambre de commerce et d'industrie Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur]], which manages the Port of Nice. Investors from France and abroad can benefit from the assistance of the C\u00f4te d'Azur Economic Development Agency [[Team C\u00f4te d'Azur]].\n\nNice has one conference centre: the [[Palais des Congr\u00e8s Acropolis]]. The city also has several business parks, including [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise L' Arenas|l'Arenas]], [[Districts of Ni\u00e7oise Nice businesses Plaine|Nice the Plain]], [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise Nice M\u00e9ridia|Nice M\u00e9ridia]], [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise Saint Isidore|Saint Isidore]], and the Northern Forum.\n\nIn addition, the city features several shopping centres such as Nicetoile, Nice TNL, Nice Lingosti\u00e8re, Northern Forum, St-Isidore, the Trinity (around the [[Auchan]] [[hypermarket]]), Cap3000 in [[Saint-Laurent-du-Var]] and [[Polygone Riviera]] in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].\n\n[[Sophia Antipolis]] is a technology park northwest of [[Antibes]]. Much of the park is within the commune of [[Valbonne]]. Established between 1970 and 1984, it primarily houses companies in the fields of computing, electronics, pharmacology and biotechnology. Several institutions of higher learning are also located here, along with the European headquarters of W3C.\n\nThe Nice metropolitan area had a [[List of cities by GDP|GDP amounting to $47.7 billion]], and $34,480 per capita,<ref name=\"Brookings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|title=Global city GDP 2011|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=4 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605135349/http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|archivedate=5 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> slightly lower than the French average.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Port===\n[[File:Hafen von Nizza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Port of Nice]]\nThe main port of Nice is also known as Lympia port. This name comes from the Lympia spring which fed a small lake in a marshy zone where work on the port was started in 1745. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Today this is the principal harbour installation of Nice \u2013 there is also a small port in the Carras district. The port is the first port cement manufacturer in France, linked to the treatment plants of the rollers of the valley of Paillon. Fishing activities remain but the number of professional fishermen is now less than 10. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Nice, being the point of continental France nearest to [[Corsica]], has ferry connections with the island developed with the arrival of NGV (''navires \u00e0 grande vitesse'') or [[high-speed craft]]. The connections are provided by [[Corsica Ferries - Sardinia Ferries]]. Located in front of the port, the Place Cassini has been renamed Place of Corsica.\n\n===Airport===\n\n[[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]] is the third busiest airport in France after [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and [[Orly Airport]], both near Paris. It is on the [[Promenade des Anglais]], near l'Ar\u00e9nas and has two [[Airport terminal|terminals]]. Due to its proximity to the Principality of [[Monaco]], it also serves as that city\u2013state's airport. A helicopter service provided by [[Heli Air Monaco]] and [[Monacair]] links the city and airport. It is run by the ACA (A\u00e9roports C\u00f4te d'Azur), which includes [[Cannes - Mandelieu Airport]] and [[La M\u00f4le \u2013 Saint-Tropez Airport]]. Public transportation into the city proper is serviced by the [[Nice tramway|Tramway]] line 2 (T2).\n\n===Rail===\n\nThe main railway station is [[Gare de Nice-Ville|Nice-Ville]], served both by high speed [[TGV]] trains connecting Paris and Nice in less than 6 hours and by local commuter [[TER Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur|TER]] services. [[Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles|Marseille]] is reached in 2.5 hours. Nice also has international connections to Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, and Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11400917|title=French Riviera train for Russia|work=BBC News  |date=23 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref> Nice is also served by several suburban stations including [[Gare de Nice-Saint-Augustin|Nice St-Augustin]], Nice St-Roch and [[Gare de Nice-Riquier|Nice Riquier]].\n\nNice is also the southern terminus of the independently run [[Chemins de Fer de Provence]] railway line which connects the city with [[Digne]] in approximatively 4 hours. A metro-like suburban service is also provided on the southern part of the line.\n\n===Tram===\n[[Trams in Nice|Tramway de Nice]] began operating horse-drawn trams in 1879. Electrified in 1900, the combined length of the network reached {{convert|144|km|2|abbr=on}} by 1930. The replacement of trams with [[trolleybus]]es began in 1948 and was completed in 1953.\n\nIn 2007, the new [[Nice tramway|Tramway de Nice]] linked the northern and eastern suburbs via the city centre. Two other lines are currently under construction and partly operating. The second line runs east-west from [[Avenue Jean M\u00e9decin|Jean M\u00e9decin]] to the [[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]] (and will reach the Port at the end of 2019), while the third line will provide a connection to the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin and to Lingosti\u00e8re railway station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |title=Dates et chiffres cl\u00e9s / La ligne 1 / Accueil \u2013 Tramway de la Communaut\u00e9 Urbaine Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur |language=fr |publisher=Tramway.nice.fr |date= |accessdate=15 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906064924/http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |archivedate=6 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A fourth line is set to run from the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin to [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].\n\n===Road===\n\nThe [[A8 autoroute]] and the [[Route nationale 7]] pass through the Nice agglomeration.\n\n==Sights==\n{{wide image|Nice Panorama Beachfront Cropped.jpg|900px|alt=|align-cap=center|Panorama of the town (including many main sights, like Hotel Negresco) and the beach}}\n{{wide image|Nice from Castle Hill 01.jpg|900px|alt=|align-cap=center|Panorama of Nice from Colline du Ch\u00e2teau}}\n[[File:Hotel Negresco (2).JPG|thumb|[[Hotel Negresco]]]]\n[[File:Nice-seafront.jpg|thumb|Seafront of the city]]\nThe [[Promenade des Anglais]] (\"Promenade of the English\") is a promenade along the Baie des Anges (\"Bay of the Angels\"), which is a bay of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], in Nice. Before Nice was urbanised, the coastline at Nice was just bordered by a deserted stretch of [[shingle beach]] (covered with large pebbles). The first houses were located on higher ground well away from the sea, as wealthy tourists visiting Nice in the 18th century did not come for the beach, but for the gentle winter weather. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The areas close to the water were home to Nice's dockworkers and fishermen.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, many wealthy English people took to spending the winter in Nice, enjoying the panorama along the coast. When a particularly harsh winter up north brought an influx of beggars to Nice, some of the rich Englishmen proposed a useful project for them: the construction of a walkway (''chemin de promenade'') along the sea. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe city of Nice, intrigued by the prospect of a pleasant promenade, greatly increased the scope of the work. The Promenade was first called the ''Camin dei Angl\u00e8s'' (the English Way) by the Ni\u00e7ois in their native dialect, [[Ni\u00e7ard|Nissart]]. After the annexation of Nice by France in 1860 it was rechristened ''La Promenade des Anglais'', replacing the former Nissart name with its French translation. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe [[Hotel Negresco]] on the Promenade des Anglais was named after [[Henri Negresco]] (1868\u20131920) who had the palatial hotel constructed in 1912. In keeping with the conventions of the time, when the Negresco first opened in 1913 its front opened on the side opposite the Mediterranean. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAnother place worth mentioning is the small street parallel to the Promenade des Anglais, leading from Nice's downtown, beginning at Place Mass\u00e9na and running parallel to the promenade in the direction of the airport for a short distance of about 4 blocks. This section of the city is referred to as the \"Zone Pietonne\", or \"Pedestrian Zone\". Cars are not allowed (with exception to delivery trucks), making this avenue a popular walkway.\n\nOld Nice is also home to the [[Op\u00e9ra de Nice]]. It was constructed at the end of the 19th century under the design of Fran\u00e7ois Aune, to replace King Charles F\u00e9lix's Maccarani Theater. Today, it is open to the public and provides a regular program of performances.\n\nOther sights include:\n* [[Castle of Nice|Ch\u00e2teau]]\n* ''Monument aux morts''\n* The port\n* ''Cours Saleya''\n* ''[[Jardin botanique de la Ville de Nice]]'' (botanical garden)\n* '' Musee Massena''\n* ''March\u00e9 aux fleurs''\n* Old Nice\n* ''Grand H\u00f4tel Imp\u00e9rial''\n* Fort of Mont Alban\n\n===Squares===\n\n====Place Mass\u00e9na====\n[[File:Placemassena1.JPG|thumb|View of the Place Mass\u00e9na]]\n[[File:Place Massena by night.jpg|thumb|Place Mass\u00e9na by night, 2012]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThe ''Place Mass\u00e9na'' is the main square of the city. Before the [[Paillon]] River was covered over, the Pont-Neuf was the only practicable way between the old town and the modern one. The square was thus divided into two parts (North and South) in 1824. With the demolition of the Mass\u00e9na Casino in 1979, the Place Mass\u00e9na became more spacious and less dense and is now bordered by red ochre buildings of [[Italian architecture]].\n\nThe recent rebuilding of the tramline gave the square back to the pedestrians, restoring its status as a real Mediterranean square. It is lined with palm trees and stone pines, instead of being the rectangular roundabout of sorts it had become over the years. Since its construction, the Place Mass\u00e9na has always been the spot for great public events. It is used for concerts, and particularly during the summer festivals, the ''[[Nice Carnival|Corso carnavalesque]]'' (carnival parade) in February, the military procession of 14 July (Bastille Day) or other traditional celebrations and banquets.\n\nThe Place Mass\u00e9na is a two-minute walk from the [[Promenade des Anglais]], old town, town centre, and Albert I Garden (''Jardin Albert Ier''). It is also a large crossroads between several of the main streets of the city: [[avenue Jean M\u00e9decin]], ''avenue F\u00e9lix Faure'', ''boulevard Jean Jaur\u00e8s'', ''avenue de Verdun'' and ''rue Gioffredo''.\n\n====Place Garibaldi====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Nice Place Garibaldi 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Garibaldi's monument, Place Garibaldi]]\nThe ''Place Garibaldi'' also stands out for its architecture and history. It is named after [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], hero of the [[Italian unification]] (born in Nice in 1807 when Nice was part of the Napoleonic Empire, before reverting to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia). The square was built at the end of the 18th century and served as the entry gate to the city and end of the road to Turin. It took several names between 1780 and 1870 (Pla\u00e7a Pairouli\u00e8ra, Place de la R\u00e9publique, Place Napol\u00e9on, Place d'Armes, Place Saint-Augustin, Piazza Vittorio) and finally Place Garibaldi in September 1870.\n\nA statue of Garibaldi, who was fiercely in favour of the union of Nice with Italy, stands in the centre of the square. The recent rebuilding of the area to accommodate the new tramway line gave mostly the entire square to pedestrians. The architecture is in line with the Turin model, which was the norm of urban renewal throughout the entire realm of the House of Savoy.\n[[File:Nice tramway place Garibaldi.jpg|thumb|left|Place Garibaldi, pedestrian since the introduction of the Nice tramway.]]\n\nIt is a crossroads between the ''Vieux Nice'' (old town) and the town centre. Place Garibaldi is close to the eastern districts of Nice, ''Port Lympia'' (Lympia Harbour), and the TNL commercial centre. This square is also a junction of several important streets: the ''boulevard Jean-Jaur\u00e8s'', the ''avenue de la R\u00e9publique'', the ''rue Cassini'' and the ''rue Catherine-S\u00e9gurane''.\n\n====Place Rossetti====\n[[File:Cath\u00e9drale Sainte R\u00e9parate in Nice.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral]]\nEntirely enclosed and pedestrianised, this square is located in the heart of the old town. With typical buildings in red and yellow ochres surrounding the square, the ''cath\u00e9drale Sainte-R\u00e9parate'' and the fountain in the centre, ''place Rossetti'' is a must-see spot in the old town. By day, the place is invaded by the terraces of traditional restaurants and the finest ice-cream makers. By night, the environment changes radically, with tourists and youths flocking to the square, where music reverberates on the walls of the small square. The square's lighting at night gives it a magical aspect.\n\nPlace Rossetti is in the centre of the old town, streets ''Jesus'', ''Rossetti'', ''Masco\u00efnat'' and the ''Pont-vieux'' (old bridge)\n\n====Cours Saleya====\n[[File:Saleya nice.jpg|thumb|Saleya Course (2007)]]\nThe Cours Saleya is situated parallel to the ''Quai des \u00c9tats-Unis''. In the past, it belonged to the upper classes. It is probably the most traditional square of the town, with its daily flower market. The ''Cours Saleya'' also opens on the ''Palais des Rois Sardes'' (Palace of the Kings of Sardinia). In the present, the ''court'' is mostly a place of entertainment.\n\n====Place du Palais====\n[[File:NIKAIA-palaisN5.jpg|thumb|Place du Palais view of the Rusca palace]]\nAs its name indicates, the ''Place du Palais'' is where the ''Palais de la Justice'' (Law courts) of Nice is located. On this square, there also is the ''Palais Rusca'', which also belongs to the justice department (home of the ''tribunal de grande instance'').\n\nThe square is also notable due to the presence of the city clock. Today, the ''Place du Palais'' is alive day and night. Often, groups of youths will hangout on the steps leading to the ''Palais de la Justice''. Concerts, films, and other major public events frequently occur in this space.\n\nIt is situated halfway between the ''Cours Saleya'' and ''Place Mass\u00e9na''.\n\n===Religious===\n[[File:2006.09.30 St Martin-kirken bak Colline du Chateau.JPG|thumb|The Church of St. Martin in Nice]]\n* [[Nice Cathedral|Sainte-R\u00e9parate Cathedral]], 17th century\n* [[Russian Orthodox Cathedral, Nice|Russian Orthodox Cathedral]]\n* [[Notre-Dame de Nice]]\n* [[Sainte Jeanne d'Arc Church (Nice, France)|Sainte Jeanne d'Arc Church]], 20th century\n\n===Sports and entertainment===\n* [[Stade du Ray]] (demolished) \n* [[Allianz Riviera]]\n* [[Stade Charles-Ehrmann]]\n* [[Palais Nikaia]]\n* [[Nice Jazz Festival]]\n\n==Sport==\n* The city's major [[association football|football]] club is [[OGC Nice]].

The observatory was established in 1879 by the banker [[Rapha\u00ebl Bischoffsheim]]. The architect was [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]; [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed the main dome.\n\nThe 76-cm (30-inch) [[refractor telescope]] that became operational in 1888 was at that time the world's largest telescope.\n\n==Culture==\nTerra-Amata, an archaeological site dating from the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] age, is situated near Nice. Nice itself was established by the ancient [[Greeks]]. There was also an independent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, Cemenelum, near Nice, where the hill of Cimiez is located. It is an archaeological site with treasures, of which only a small part has been excavated. The excavated site includes thermal baths, arenas and Roman road.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nSince the 2nd century AD, the light of the city has attracted painters and sculptors such as [[Chagall]], [[Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Yves Klein|Klein]], [[Arman]] and [[Sacha Sosno|Sosno]]. Nice inspired many composers and intellectuals in different countries e.g. [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]],  [[Rossini]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], etc.\n\nNice also has numerous museums of all kinds: [[Mus\u00e9e Marc Chagall]], [[Mus\u00e9e Matisse (Nice)|Mus\u00e9e Matisse]] (arenas of Cimiez containing Roman ruins), [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nice|Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts]], [[Mus\u00e9e international d'Art na\u00eff Anatole Jakovsky]], Mus\u00e9e Terra-Amata, Museum of Asian Art, [[Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne et d'art contemporain]] which devotes much space to the well-known '' \u00c9cole of Nice ''\u201d), Museum of Natural History, Mus\u00e9e Mass\u00e9na, Naval Museum and ''Galerie des Ponchettes''.\n\nBeing a vacation resort, Nice hosts many festivals throughout the year, such as the [[Nice Carnival]] and the [[Nice Jazz Festival]].\n\nNice has a distinct culture due to its unique history. The local language ''[[Ni\u00e7ard]] (Nissart)'' is an [[Occitan]] dialect (but some Italian scholars argue that it is a [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] dialect).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} It is still spoken by a substantial minority {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. Strong [[Italian culture|Italian]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Corsica]]n influences make it more intelligible to speakers of Italian than to other extant Proven\u00e7al dialects.\n\nIn the past, Nice welcomed many immigrants from [[Italy]] (who continue to make up a large proportion of the population), as well as Spanish and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] immigrants. However, in the past few decades immigration has been opened to include immigrants from all over the world, particularly those from former Northern and Western African colonies, as well as southeast Asia{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Traditions are still alive, especially in [[folk music]] and dances, including the [[farandole]] \u2013 an open-chain community dance.\n\nSince 1860 a cannon (based at the Ch\u00e2teau east of Old Nice) is shot at twelve o'clock sharp. The detonation can be heard almost all over the city. This tradition goes back to Sir Thomas Coventry, who intended to remind the citizens of having lunch on time.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130411000725/http://www.francemonthly.com/nice-french-riviera/ Nice \u2013 French Riviera: Noon on the Dot] from ''francemonthly.com''. Retrieved 11 February 2013.</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\nThe cuisine of Nice is especially close to those of [[Provence]] but also [[Liguria]] and [[Piedmont]] and uses local ingredients ([[olive oil]], [[anchovies]], fruit and vegetables) but also those from more remote regions, in particular from Northern Europe, because ships which came to pick up olive oil arrived full of food products, such as dried [[haddock]].\n\nNice has a few local dishes. There is a local tart made with onions and [[anchovies]] (or anchovy paste), named \"[[Pissaladi\u00e8re]]\". ''[[Socca]]'' is a type of pancake made from [[chickpea]] flour. ''[[Farcis ni\u00e7ois]]'' is a dish made from vegetables stuffed with a mixture of breadcrumbs, meat (generally sausage and ground beef), and herbs; and ''[[salade ni\u00e7oise]]'' is a tomato salad with green peppers of the \"Corne\" variety, baked eggs, tuna or anchovies, and olives.\n\nLocal meat comes from neighbouring valleys, such as the sheep of [[Sisteron]]. Local fish, such as mullets, bream, sea urchins, and anchovies (alevins) are used to a great extent, so much so that it has given birth to a proverb: \"fish are born in the sea and die in oil\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=What Caesar Did For My Salad: The Secret Meanings of our Favourite Dishes|last=Jack|first=Albert|publisher=Penguin

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Contemporary Christians generally agree that heresy and dissent are not punishable offenses.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine and his Bishop Alcuin had a short term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought==\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|ISBN=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Tertullian|Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.  It was primarily an effort to convince pagan readers that Christianity should be allowed into the religious \u2018market-place\u2019 that John North says second century Rome had become.<ref name=\"Stroumsa\"/>  On the other hand, G.Stroumsa says Tertullian also knew co-existence meant competition, so he attempted to delegitimize that competition through images of idolatry and Christian identity at the same time he advocated for tolerance.<ref name=\"Stroumsa\"/> It is not known exactly when Tertullian wrote his [[Apologeticus|''Apologeticus pro Christianis'']], but it was during the same era when [[Irenaeus]] (130-202 CE) wrote [[Adversus Haereses|''Adversus Haereses'']], and [[Justin Martyr]] (100-165) wrote the [[First Apology of Justin Martyr|''First Apology'']] which were both polemics against heretics.

The Edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose.

The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

There were new religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.

It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

Voltaire pointed the readers of his ''Trait\u00e9 sur la Tol\u00e9rance'' (1763) specifically to the examples of Carolina and Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> People like [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[John Adams]] stood self-consciously in the tradition of Milton, Sidney and Locke, and extended their tolerationism further to also apply to Catholics and atheists.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\">Coffey 2000: 208.</ref> Coffey considers it possible to argue, \"that the tolerationist tradition of seventeenth-century England reached its fulfilment in the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the American Constitution]].\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\"/>\n\nThat the North American colonies and later the United States provided a refuge for religious minorities from Europe partly explains the higher degree of religiosity in the contemporary United States and the \"unusual sectarian quality of U.S. Protestantism\".<ref name=\"Phillips06-104\">Kevin Phillips (2006): ''American Theocracy.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine and his Bishop Alcuin had a short term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s.

The Edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose.

Attempts to reconcile the Donatists, made by Constantine, a number of Popes and councils, and respected religious leaders such as Augustine of Hippo, all failed.

Literature was eclectic, blending Christian ideas with classical tgought, often mixing genres.  The philosopher Boethius translated much of Aristotle's writings into Latin.  Gregory of Tours and Bede were historians who strove for historical accuracy and objectivity. Aachen wrote a biography of Charlemagne which was a major literary achievement of the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|202}} \n\nOne event that impacted Christian thought on tolerance, took place in 782 in what had been Roman Gaul and would one day be modern France. Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

This was the accepted position of Christian thought at this time but that began to change by the end of this era.\n\nIn 1095 at the Council of Claremont, in response to an appeal for help from the Patriarch of Constantinople, Urban II preached a sermon urging his listeners to undertake an expedition to the Near East, under papal leadership. It is probably the most studied sermon in history.  This is problematic, since the original has been lost and the three writers who attended the Council of Clermont recorded three different versions which are each quite distinctive in content and style.<ref name=\"Strack\">{{cite journal|last=Strack|first=Georg|title=The Sermon of Urban II in Clermont and the Tradition of Papal Oratory|journal=medieval sermon studies|volume=5|year=2012|pages=30-45|url=https://www.mag.geschichte.uni-muenchen.de/downloads/strack_urban.pdf|access-date= April 22, 2020}}</ref>. \n\nHowever, there is some consensus that a comparison of the best 5 versions of the sermon (the three witnesses and two they told personally) makes it possible to identify the subjects Urban discussed.

The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis ''merged view'' is also supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]].

Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

The escalation and erosion of the lull arrangement, 4 November to the time of this writing, December 172: On 4 November the IDF carried out a military action close to the border security fence on the Gazan side to prevent an abduction planned by Hamas, which had dug a tunnel under the fence to that purpose. Seven Hamas terrorist operatives were killed during the action. In retaliation, Hamas and the other terrorist organizations attacked Israel with a massive barrage of rockets.... During the second period a new dynamic was created which replaced the former relative calm: Hamas and the other terrorist organizations extended their attacks (rocket and mortar shell fire, IEDs and light-arms fire), the IDF operated to prevent attacks within the Gaza Strip (Israeli Air Force attacks, firing at terrorist squads within the Gaza Strip near the border), the terrorist organizations responded with barrages of rocket and mortar shell fire to retaliate for their losses and continued daily sporadic fire, in response to which Israel closed the border crossings, exerting pressure on Hamas and the Gaza Strip residents.... With the escalation in rocket and mortar shell attacks which began on 4 November, Israel began closing the crossings for longer periods.

In certain cases, he added, such choice of means would be less harmful for civilian population than other munitions, provided that the use of white phosphorus withstands the proportionality test. In discussing the principle of proportionality he said that the legality of using white phosphorus in an urban setting could only be decided on a case-by-case basis taking into account \"the precise circumstances of its use, not in general, generically, but based on that target, at that time\". He stressed that the humanitarian implications were vital in this assessment giving the example that using white phosphorus on a school yard would have different implications to its use on another area. He also said that in his view white phosphorus munition is neither chemical nor incendiary weapon and is not intended to cause damage.

He is of the view that some weapons systems used in the conflict had some sort of DIME component to reduce the effect on the ground. Colonel Lane explained that the idea behind a Focused Lethality Munition (FLM), which is an example of a DIME munition, is that the fragments produced stay within a safety radius of about 6 meters, so anybody outside that radius is safe, while those within the area of dispersal will be affected severely. He commented on the documentations where medics described unusual amputations saying that he was no medical expert, but the use of a metal like tungsten and cobalt at short distances would likely have that effect.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/2009.07.07PM_Session.doc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219084642/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/2009.07.07PM_Session.doc|url-status=dead|title=OHCHR.org|archivedate=19 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Goldstone Report]] wrote that the Mission found that the allegations that DIME weapons were used by Israeli armed forces required further clarification and they were unable to ascertain their usage, though it received reports from Palestinian and foreign doctors who had operated in Gaza during the military operations of a high percentage of patients with injuries compatible with their impact.

Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire.... The escalation and erosion of the lull arrangement, 4 November to the time of this writing, December 172: On 4 November the IDF carried out a military action close to the border security fence on the Gazan side to prevent an abduction planned by Hamas, which had dug a tunnel under the fence to that purpose. Seven Hamas terrorist operatives were killed during the action. In retaliation, Hamas and the other terrorist organizations attacked Israel with a massive barrage of rockets.... During the second period a new dynamic was created which replaced the former relative calm: Hamas and the other terrorist organizations extended their attacks (rocket and mortar shell fire, IEDs and light-arms fire), the IDF operated to prevent attacks within the Gaza Strip (Israeli Air Force attacks, firing at terrorist squads within the Gaza Strip near the border), the terrorist organizations responded with barrages of rocket and mortar shell fire to retaliate for their losses and continued daily sporadic fire, in response to which Israel closed the border crossings, exerting pressure on Hamas and the Gaza Strip residents.... With the escalation in rocket and mortar shell attacks which began on 4 November, Israel began closing the crossings for longer periods. That led to shortages of basic goods in the Gaza Strip and to disruptions in the supply of various types of fuel (although electrical power was not cut off, since the plant in Ashqelon, which supplies 65% of the Gaza Strip's electricity, provided an uninterrupted flow of power).'</ref> According to the Telegraph, writing as Cast Lead began, the 4 November operation \"sealed the fate of the ceasefire.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Israel attack on Gaza: Fragile peace shattered again|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/3981502/Israel-attack-on-Gaza-Fragile-peace-shattered-again.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=December 27, 2008 |access-date=March 24, 2020}}</ref> The raid, according to [[Mark LeVine]] was unprovoked.<ref name=\"LeVine\" >[[Mark LeVine]], [http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/war_on_gaza/2009/01/2009110112723260741.html \"Who will save Israel from itself?\"], [[Al Jazeera]] 27 December 2009</ref> Israel stated its aim was to destroy what it said was a tunnel on the Gaza-Israel border dug by militants to infiltrate into Israel and abduct soldiers.

In certain cases, he added, such choice of means would be less harmful for civilian population than other munitions, provided that the use of white phosphorus withstands the proportionality test. In discussing the principle of proportionality he said that the legality of using white phosphorus in an urban setting could only be decided on a case-by-case basis taking into account \"the precise circumstances of its use, not in general, generically, but based on that target, at that time\". He stressed that the humanitarian implications were vital in this assessment giving the example that using white phosphorus on a school yard would have different implications to its use on another area. He also said that in his view white phosphorus munition is neither chemical nor incendiary weapon and is not intended to cause damage. He said its use was not prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention.<ref name=\"Public hearings \u2013 Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009\"/>\n\nAn article by Mark Cantora examining the legal implications of the use of white phosphorus munitions by the IDF, published in 2010 in the ''[[Gonzaga Journal of International Law]]'', argues that Israel's use of white phosphorus in Gaza was technically legal under existing international humanitarian laws and \"Therefore, it is imperative for the international community to convene a White Phosphorus Convention Conference in order to address these issues and fill this substantial gap in international humanitarian law.\"<ref>Mark Cantora, Israel and White Phosphorus During Operation Cast Lead: A Case Study in Adherence to Inadequate Humanitarian Laws, 13:1 ''Gonzaga Journal of International Law'' (2010), available at {{cite web |url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/194/26/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329005840/http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/194/26/ |archivedate=29 March 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Dense inert metal explosives (DIME)====\n[[Dense Inert Metal Explosive]] (DIME) is a type of bomb developed to minimize collateral damage.<ref name=Haaretz_new_weapon>Amira Hass, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/norwegian-doctor-israel-used-new-type-of-weapon-in-gaza-1.268394 \"Norwegian doctor: Israel used new type of weapon in Gaza\"].

He is of the view that some weapons systems used in the conflict had some sort of DIME component to reduce the effect on the ground. Colonel Lane explained that the idea behind a Focused Lethality Munition (FLM), which is an example of a DIME munition, is that the fragments produced stay within a safety radius of about 6 meters, so anybody outside that radius is safe, while those within the area of dispersal will be affected severely. He commented on the documentations where medics described unusual amputations saying that he was no medical expert, but the use of a metal like tungsten and cobalt at short distances would likely have that effect.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/2009.07.07PM_Session.doc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219084642/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/2009.07.07PM_Session.doc|url-status=dead|title=OHCHR.org|archivedate=19 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Goldstone Report]] wrote that the Mission found that the allegations that DIME weapons were used by Israeli armed forces required further clarification and they were unable to ascertain their usage, though it received reports from Palestinian and foreign doctors who had operated in Gaza during the military operations of a high percentage of patients with injuries compatible with their impact.
