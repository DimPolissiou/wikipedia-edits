He created swords and daggers, known in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as [[tachi]] and [[tant\u014d]] respectively, in the ''[[Sagami Province|Soshu]]'' tradition. No exact dates are known for Masamune's life. It is generally agreed that he made most of his swords in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, 1288\u20131328. Some stories list his family name as Okazakii, but some experts believe this is a fabrication to enhance the standing of the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawa family]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Fujishiro| first = Yoshio |author2=Fujishiro Matsuo | title = Nihon Toko Jiten | year = 1935 | pages = 387}}</ref>\n\nMasamune is believed to have worked in [[Sagami Province]] during the last part of the [[Kamakura period]] (1288\u20131328), and it is thought that he was trained by swordsmiths from [[Bizen Province|Bizen]] and [[Yamashiro Province|Yamashiro]] provinces, such as Saburo Kunimune, Awataguchi Kunitsuna and [[Shint\u014dgo Kunimitsu]]. He was the father<ref>[http://www.jssus.org/nkb/nkb.php?id=MAS590 Masamune Info]</ref> of [[Hikoshiro Sadamune]], considered by many to be an almost as famous S\u014dsh\u016b master.\n\nAn award for swordsmiths called the Masamune Prize is awarded at the ''Japanese Sword Making Competition''. Although not awarded every year, it is presented to a swordsmith who has created an exceptional work.<ref>[http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/compet.htm Japanese Sword Making Competition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116224530/http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/compet.htm |date=January 16, 2007 }} [http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/miyairi.htm THE MIYAIRI SCHOOL] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116224934/http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/miyairi.htm |date=January 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Style ==\nThe swords of Masamune possess a reputation for superior beauty and quality, remarkable in a period where the [[steel]] necessary for swords was often impure. He is considered to have brought to perfection the art of {{nihongo|\"''nie''\"|\u9335||[[Martensite|martensitic]] [[crystal]]s embedded in [[pearlite]] [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]], thought to resemble stars in the night sky}}.\n\nMasamune studied under [[Shint\u014dgo Kunimitsu]] and made blades in ''suguha'' (straight [[tempering (metallurgy)|temper]] line) but he made ''[[hamon (swordsmithing)|notare hamon]]'', where the finish on the leading edge of blade slowly undulates where it was [[quenched]]. There are also some blades with ''ko-midare'' (small irregularities), a style which appears to have been copied from the Old [[Bizen Province|Bizen]] and [[H\u014dki Province]] styles. His works are well-characterized by striking ''chikei'' (dark lines following the grain pattern in the steel above the hamon), ''kinsuji'' (lightning shaped lines of nie) and ''nie'' (crystals of martensite embedded in a pearlite matrix).\n\nSwords created by Masamune often are referred to with the smith's name (as with other pieces of artwork), often with a name for the individual sword as well. The \"Honjo Masamune\", a symbol of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and passed down from sh\u014dgun to sh\u014dgun, is perhaps the best known Masamune sword.\n\nSigned works of Masamune are rare. The examples \"Fudo Masamune\", \"Ky\u014dgoku Masamune\", and \"Daikoku Masamune\" are accepted as his genuine works. Judging from his style, he was active from the late [[Kamakura period]] to the [[Nanboku-ch\u014d period]].\n\nHis swords are the most frequently cited among those listed in the ''Ky\u014dho Meibutsu Cho'',<ref name=MasaHist>http://internal.tbi.net/~max/ff9ref2.htm History of Masamune by Jim Kurrasch   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428153827/http://internal.tbi.net/~max/ff9ref2.htm |date=April 28, 2007 }}</ref> a catalogue of excellent swords in the collections of [[daimy\u014d]] edited during the [[Ky\u014dh\u014d]] era by the Hon'ami family of sword appraisers and polishers. The catalogue was created on the orders of the [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]] of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1714 and consists of three books. The first book, known as the ''Nihon Sansaku'', is a list of the three greatest swordsmiths in the eyes of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] including Etchu Matsukura Go Umanosuke Yoshihiro, Awataguchi Toshiro Yoshimitsu, and lists forty-one blades by Masamune. The three books together list sixty-one blades by Masamune. There are far more blades listed for Masamune than the next two swordsmiths combined. It is known that Hideyoshi had a passion for Soshu swordsmiths which may explain this. A third of all swords listed are Soshu blades by many of the greatest Soshu masters including Masamune's students.\n\n==Legends of Masamune and Muramasa==\nA [[legend]] tells of a test where [[Muramasa]] challenged his master, Masamune, to see who could make a finer sword. They both worked tirelessly and eventually, when both swords were finished, they decided to test the results. The contest was for each to suspend the blades in a small creek with the cutting edge facing against the current. Muramasa's sword, the {{nihongo|''Juuchi Yosamu''|\u5341\u5343\u591c\u5bd2||\"10,000 Cold Nights\"}} cut everything that passed its way; fish, leaves floating down the river, the very air which blew on it. Highly impressed with his pupil's work, Masamune lowered his sword, the {{nihongo|''Yawarakai-Te''|\u67d4\u3089\u304b\u3044\u624b||\"Tender Hands\"}}, into the current and waited patiently. Only leaves were cut. However, the fish swam right up to it, and the air hissed as it gently blew by the blade. After a while, Muramasa began to scoff at his master for his apparent lack of skill in the making of his sword. Smiling to himself, Masamune pulled up his sword, dried it, and sheathed it. All the while, Muramasa was heckling him for his sword's inability to cut anything. A monk, who had been watching the whole ordeal, walked over and bowed low to the two sword masters. He then began to explain what he had seen.\n\n{{quote|The first of the swords was by all accounts a fine sword, however it is a blood thirsty, evil blade, as it does not discriminate as to who or what it will cut. It may just as well be cutting down butterflies as severing heads. The second was by far the finer of the two, as it does not needlessly cut that which is innocent and undeserving.}}\n\nIn another account of the story, both blades cut the leaves that went down on the river's current equally well, but the leaves would stick to the blade of Muramasa whereas they would slip on past Masamune's after being sliced. Or alternatively both leaves were cut, but those cut by Masamune's blade would reform as it traveled down the stream. Yet another version has leaves being sliced by Muramasa's blade while the leaves were repelled by Masamune's, and another again has leaves being sliced by Muramasa's blade and healed by Masamune's.\n\nIn yet another story Muramasa and Masamune were summoned to make swords for the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' or Emperor and the finished swords were held in a waterfall. The result is the same as the other stories, and Masamune's swords are deemed holy swords. In one version of the story Muramasa is killed for creating evil swords.\n\nWhile all known legends of the two ever having met are historically impossible, both smiths are widely regarded as symbols for their respective eras.\n\n== Students ==\nMasamune is believed to have trained a great number of sword smiths; 15 are known, 10 of whom are considered to be the ''Juttetsu'' or \"Ten Famous Students\" or \"10 Great Disciples of Masamune\".\n\n=== Great Juttetsu ===\n\n==== Chogi ====\n(\u5099\u5dde\u9577\u8239\u4f4f\u9577\u7fa9\u4f5c\u2014Bishu Osafune Ju Nagayoshi Saku) (\u5099\u5dde\u570b\u9577\u8239\u4f4f\u9577\u7fa9\u2014Bizen Kuni Osafune Ju Nagayoshi)<br />\nAlthough probably not a direct student of Masamune<ref name=\"JSSUS\">[http://www.jssus.org/ The Japanese Sword Society of the United States]</ref> due to the dates when he was forging, his works are greatly influenced by Masamune's work and the Soshu tradition as well as the work of the Soden Bizen swordsmiths.

Kanemitsu produced swords used by renowned men and generals. He likely wasn't taught directly by Masamune, however, but was influenced by the Soshu, crafting swords in addition to serving himself as a leader in the Soden Bizen revolution.\n\n==== Shizu Saburo Kaneuji ====\n(\u517c\u6c0f\u2014Kaneuji)<br />\nLived in Yamato province before going to Mino to study under Masamune where his style radically changed.

He is also known as Kaneshige using the Japanese pronunciation of his name. He and Kaneuji are founders of the [[Mino Province|Mino]] style. He was a monk at the [[Seisen-ji]] in [[Tsuruga]], and led to the creation of [[Echizen Province|Echizen]] swordmaking like [[Kuniyuki]], moving to [[Mino Province|Mino]] around the time of [[Ryakuo]] (1338\u20131342) creating the [[Seki, Gifu|Seki]] tradition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nihontocraft.com/Ura_Nihon_no_Toko.html |title=Ura Nihon no Toko |first=Yoshikawa |last=Kentaro |access-date=1 October 2018 |work=Nihontocraft}}</ref>\n\n==== Kunishige ====\n(\u9577\u8c37\u90e8\u56fd\u91cd\u2014Hasebe Kunishige)<br />\nCreated the Hasebe school producing swords in the style of the second period of Soshu and Yamashiro. His swords are considered by some to be equal to Akihiro and Hiromitsu. He created the ''Heshikiri Hasebe'' (The Forceful Cutter) listed in the Kyoho Meibutsu Cho, owned by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and then by [[Oda Nobunaga]]. It bears a gold appraisal inlay of Honami Kotoku called a Kinzogan (\u91d1\u8c61\u5d4c). Today the sword is a family heirloom of the Kuroda Daimy\u014d Ke.

However, current research indicates that he was a senior student to Masamune, junior to Yukimitsu, under the great teacher Shint\u014dgo Kunimitsu. He, like Go, hails from Etchu province and is well known as the only smith to have mastered the style of matsukawa-hada (pine tree bark pattern steel), making his work unique.\n\n==== Go Yoshihiro ====\n(\u90f7(\u6c5f)\u2014Go, \u7fa9\u5f18\u2014Yoshihiro)<br />\nVery few works exist by this swordsmith due to his death at the young age of 27, No known signed works exist. He is believed to have gone by the names of Go Yoshihiro or simply Go, the name of the town from which he came. As well as being a Soshu swordsmith he is a member of the Etchu tradition. He is considered to have the highest skill in forging swords among the Masamune Juttetsu [https://web.archive.org/web/20110524110233/http://www.touken.or.jp/english/nihon_koto_shi/%2813%29%20No.559.htm].\n\n==== Naotsuna ====\n(\u77f3\u5dde\u51fa\u7fbd\u76f4\u7db1\u4f5c\u2014Sekishu Izuwa Naotsuna Saku) (\u76f4\u7db1\u4f5c\u2014Naotsuna Saku)<br />\nMany theories exist that he may in fact have been a student of Saemonzaburo among others.

It is one of the best known of the swords created by Masamune, and is believed to be among the finest Japanese swords ever made. It was made a [[National Treasures of Japan|Japanese National Treasure]] (''Kokuh\u014d'') in 1939.\n\nThe name Honj\u014d possibly came about due to this sword's connection to the general [[Honj\u014d Shigenaga]] who gained the sword in battle.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Honj\u014d Shigenaga, general of [[Uesugi Kenshin]]<ref name=MasaHist/> in the 16th century, was attacked by Umanosuke who already possessed a number of trophy heads. Shigenaga was attacked with the Honj\u014d Masamune which split his helmet, but he survived and took the sword as a prize. The blade had a number of chips from the great battle but was still usable. It was kept by Shigenaga until he was sent to [[Fushimi Castle]], [[Bunroku]] around 1592\u20131595.\n\nShigenaga was later forced to sell the sword to [[Toyotomi Hidetsugu]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s nephew and retainer. It was bought for 13 Mai, 13 [[Koban (coin)|\u014dban]], which was 13 large gold coins. The blade was later valued in the Kyoho Meibutsu Cho at 1,000 Mai. It then went to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Shimazu Yoshihiro]], again to Hideyoshi, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], [[Tokugawa Yorinobu]], and finally [[Tokugawa Ietsuna]]. It remained in the Kii (\u7d00\u4f0a) branch of the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawa family]], the last known owner being [[Tokugawa Iemasa]] at the end of World War II.\n\nUnder the United States occupation at the end of World War II all production of nihont\u014d with edges was banned except under police or government permit. Apparently, Tokugawa Iemasa gave the Honj\u014d Masamune and 14 other swords to a police station at [[Mejiro, Toshima, Tokyo|Mejiro]] in December 1945. Shortly thereafter in January 1946, the Mejiro police gave these swords to a man identified as \"Sgt. Coldy Bimore\" (possibly a garbled [[phonetic]] spelling of the man's name) of the Foreign Liquidations Commission of AFWESPAC (Army Forces, Western Pacific). In an episode of ''[[Expedition Unknown]]'', [[Josh Gates]] traveled to Japan in search of the Honj\u014d Masamune,<ref>Josh Gates</ref> and learned that there were no records of a \"Sgt. Coldy Bimore\" listed to have received the sword.  The Honj\u014d Masamune is the most important of the missing [[Japanese swords]] and its current location remains unknown, but there are theories of who may possess the sword.<ref>Jim Kurrach, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030707112255/http://members.cox.net/jkk/mismasam.htm Honjo Masamune] and [http://www.sydneytokenkai.com/10.htm Important Missing Nihonto], Japanese Sword Society of Southern California newsletter, 1996</ref>\n\n===Fudo Masamune===\nThis is one of the few blades signed by Masamune that is not in question.

[[Maeda Toshitsune]] presented it again to the Sh\u014dgun, possibly on his retirement. Later, the sword was handed down among the [[Owari Tokugawa]]. This blade is a [[tant\u014d]] approximately 25&nbsp;cm (8 sun 6.5 bun) with a carving of roots on the Omote (Front, outer edge) side. It also has chopstick-like grooves (Gomabashi \u8b77\u6469\u7bb8) on the back and a Dragon at the ura part of blade (Kurikara \u5036\u5229\u4f3d\u7f85).

Soon after seeing it passed from hand to hand throughout the 20th Century, the Musashi Masamune finally made its way to the [[Nihon Bijutsu Token Hozon Kyokai]] in the year 2000 by Motoo Otsuyasu. The Musashi Masamune is a tachi, measuring 74&nbsp;cm (2 korai-shaku, 1 sun, 4.2 bun), and noted to have nearly all of the characteristics of Masamune's signature features; though it is debated that its o-kissaki is not that of his style, it is compared to blades made in his later career, which shows the transition of the Kamakura styles into the Nanbokucho era. It is of rumor that, while the blade is named after [[Musashi Province]], where Edo and current day Tokyo stands, its origins stems from being once in the possession of [[Miyamoto Musashi]], who is considered Japan's most famous swordsman. The sword is classified as a meibutsu National Treasure of Japan.\n\n===H\u014dch\u014d Masamune===\nThe \"H\u014dch\u014d\" Masamune refers to any one of three particular and unusual [[tant\u014d]]<ref name=\"swordpics\">[https://archive.is/20070109174058/http://www.universalswordsman.com/Swords-SmithPages/Masamune2006.html Site containing pictures of his blades and a portrait of Masamune]</ref> attributed to Masamune. These tant\u014d have a wide body, unlike his normal slim and elegant work, making them appear quite similar to a [[Japanese cutlery|Japanese cooking knife]]. One of the three blades has a Gomabashi in cutout (Sukashi). It was restored around 1919 and sold for approximately 10 ''hiki'' (a certain number of ''[[Japanese mon (currency)|mon]]''); this was worth roughly 14\u00a2 US at the time, meaning that the price was remarkably low. It is presently on display in the [[Tokugawa Art Museum]].<ref>[http://www.tokugawa-art-museum.jp/english/parmanent/room1/tachi2.html Tanto:\"Hocho Masamune\"].

No exact dates are known for Masamune's life. It is generally agreed that he made most of his swords in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, 1288\u20131328. Some stories list his family name as Okazakii, but some experts believe this is a fabrication to enhance the standing of the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawa family]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Fujishiro| first = Yoshio |author2=Fujishiro Matsuo | title = Nihon Toko Jiten | year = 1935 | pages = 387}}</ref>\n\nMasamune is believed to have worked in [[Sagami Province]] during the last part of the [[Kamakura period]] (1288\u20131328), and it is thought that he was trained by swordsmiths from [[Bizen Province|Bizen]] and [[Yamashiro Province|Yamashiro]] provinces, such as Saburo Kunimune, Awataguchi Kunitsuna and [[Shint\u014dgo Kunimitsu]]. He was the father<ref>[http://www.jssus.org/nkb/nkb.php?id=MAS590 Masamune Info]</ref> of [[Hikoshiro Sadamune]], considered by many to be an almost as famous S\u014dsh\u016b master.\n\nAn award for swordsmiths called the Masamune Prize is awarded at the ''Japanese Sword Making Competition''.

He is considered to have brought to perfection the art of {{nihongo|\"''nie''\"|\u9335||[[Martensite|martensitic]] [[crystal]]s embedded in [[pearlite]] [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]], thought to resemble stars in the night sky}}.\n\nMasamune studied under [[Shint\u014dgo Kunimitsu]] and made blades in ''suguha'' (straight [[tempering (metallurgy)|temper]] line) but he made ''[[hamon (swordsmithing)|notare hamon]]'', where the finish on the leading edge of blade slowly undulates where it was [[quenched]]. There are also some blades with ''ko-midare'' (small irregularities), a style which appears to have been copied from the Old [[Bizen Province|Bizen]] and [[H\u014dki Province]] styles. His works are well-characterized by striking ''chikei'' (dark lines following the grain pattern in the steel above the hamon), ''kinsuji'' (lightning shaped lines of nie) and ''nie'' (crystals of martensite embedded in a pearlite matrix).\n\nSwords created by Masamune often are referred to with the smith's name (as with other pieces of artwork), often with a name for the individual sword as well. The \"Honjo Masamune\", a symbol of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and passed down from sh\u014dgun to sh\u014dgun, is perhaps the best known Masamune sword.\n\nSigned works of Masamune are rare. The examples \"Fudo Masamune\", \"Ky\u014dgoku Masamune\", and \"Daikoku Masamune\" are accepted as his genuine works. Judging from his style, he was active from the late [[Kamakura period]] to the [[Nanboku-ch\u014d period]].\n\nHis swords are the most frequently cited among those listed in the ''Ky\u014dho Meibutsu Cho'',<ref name=MasaHist>http://internal.tbi.net/~max/ff9ref2.htm History of Masamune by Jim Kurrasch   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428153827/http://internal.tbi.net/~max/ff9ref2.htm |date=April 28, 2007 }}</ref> a catalogue of excellent swords in the collections of [[daimy\u014d]] edited during the [[Ky\u014dh\u014d]] era by the Hon'ami family of sword appraisers and polishers. The catalogue was created on the orders of the [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]] of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1714 and consists of three books. The first book, known as the ''Nihon Sansaku'', is a list of the three greatest swordsmiths in the eyes of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] including Etchu Matsukura Go Umanosuke Yoshihiro, Awataguchi Toshiro Yoshimitsu, and lists forty-one blades by Masamune. The three books together list sixty-one blades by Masamune. There are far more blades listed for Masamune than the next two swordsmiths combined. It is known that Hideyoshi had a passion for Soshu swordsmiths which may explain this. A third of all swords listed are Soshu blades by many of the greatest Soshu masters including Masamune's students.\n\n==Legends of Masamune and Muramasa==\nA [[legend]] tells of a test where [[Muramasa]] challenged his master, Masamune, to see who could make a finer sword. They both worked tirelessly and eventually, when both swords were finished, they decided to test the results. The contest was for each to suspend the blades in a small creek with the cutting edge facing against the current. Muramasa's sword, the {{nihongo|''Juuchi Yosamu''|\u5341\u5343\u591c\u5bd2||\"10,000 Cold Nights\"}} cut everything that passed its way; fish, leaves floating down the river, the very air which blew on it. Highly impressed with his pupil's work, Masamune lowered his sword, the {{nihongo|''Yawarakai-Te''|\u67d4\u3089\u304b\u3044\u624b||\"Tender Hands\"}}, into the current and waited patiently. Only leaves were cut. However, the fish swam right up to it, and the air hissed as it gently blew by the blade. After a while, Muramasa began to scoff at his master for his apparent lack of skill in the making of his sword. Smiling to himself, Masamune pulled up his sword, dried it, and sheathed it. All the while, Muramasa was heckling him for his sword's inability to cut anything. A monk, who had been watching the whole ordeal, walked over and bowed low to the two sword masters. He then began to explain what he had seen.\n\n{{quote|The first of the swords was by all accounts a fine sword, however it is a blood thirsty, evil blade, as it does not discriminate as to who or what it will cut. It may just as well be cutting down butterflies as severing heads. The second was by far the finer of the two, as it does not needlessly cut that which is innocent and undeserving.}}\n\nIn another account of the story, both blades cut the leaves that went down on the river's current equally well, but the leaves would stick to the blade of Muramasa whereas they would slip on past Masamune's after being sliced. Or alternatively both leaves were cut, but those cut by Masamune's blade would reform as it traveled down the stream. Yet another version has leaves being sliced by Muramasa's blade while the leaves were repelled by Masamune's, and another again has leaves being sliced by Muramasa's blade and healed by Masamune's.\n\nIn yet another story Muramasa and Masamune were summoned to make swords for the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' or Emperor and the finished swords were held in a waterfall. The result is the same as the other stories, and Masamune's swords are deemed holy swords. In one version of the story Muramasa is killed for creating evil swords.\n\nWhile all known legends of the two ever having met are historically impossible, both smiths are widely regarded as symbols for their respective eras.\n\n== Students ==\nMasamune is believed to have trained a great number of sword smiths; 15 are known, 10 of whom are considered to be the ''Juttetsu'' or \"Ten Famous Students\" or \"10 Great Disciples of Masamune\".\n\n=== Great Juttetsu ===\n\n==== Chogi ====\n(\u5099\u5dde\u9577\u8239\u4f4f\u9577\u7fa9\u4f5c\u2014Bishu Osafune Ju Nagayoshi Saku) (\u5099\u5dde\u570b\u9577\u8239\u4f4f\u9577\u7fa9\u2014Bizen Kuni Osafune Ju Nagayoshi)<br />\nAlthough probably not a direct student of Masamune<ref name=\"JSSUS\">[http://www.jssus.org/ The Japanese Sword Society of the United States]</ref> due to the dates when he was forging, his works are greatly influenced by Masamune's work and the Soshu tradition as well as the work of the Soden Bizen swordsmiths. Though the kanji characters are pronounced in Japanese as 'Nagayoshi', by convention the Chinese pronunciation of 'Chogi' is used for this smith, and a handful of others (less commonly for his student Kanenaga, pronounced in Chinese as 'Kencho').\n\n==== Kanemitsu ====\n(\u5099\u524d\u570b\u9577\u8239\u4f4f\u517c\u5149\u2014Bizen Kuni Osafune Ju Kanemitsu) (\u5099\u524d\u9577\u8239\u4f4f\u517c\u5149\u2014Bishu Osafune ju Kanemitsu) (\u5099\u524d\u570b\u9577\u8239\u4f4f\u5de6\u885b\u9580\u5c09\u85e4\u539f\u517c\u5149\u2014Bizen no Kuni Osafune ju Saemonjo Fujiwara Kanemitsu)<br />\nConsidered to have created some of the sharpest swords ever known, he is one of a handful of smiths rated at ''Sai-jo O-wazamono'' (grandmaster of great sharpness)<ref>[http://www.jp-sword.com/files/wazamono/wazamono.html]</ref> with famous swords named ''Kabutowari'' (Helmet Cutter), ''Ishikiri'' (Stone Cutter), and ''Teppokiri'' (Gun Cutter) as relayed in Fujishiro's writings. Kanemitsu produced swords used by renowned men and generals. He likely wasn't taught directly by Masamune, however, but was influenced by the Soshu, crafting swords in addition to serving himself as a leader in the Soden Bizen revolution.\n\n==== Shizu Saburo Kaneuji ====\n(\u517c\u6c0f\u2014Kaneuji)<br />\nLived in Yamato province before going to Mino to study under Masamune where his style radically changed. His swords are most like those of Masamune and quite often confused with his. The Mishina school can trace its history back to Kaneuji and through him back to Masamune.<ref>[http://www.samuraisword.com/articles/mishina_school.htm Mishina School]</ref>\n\n====Kinju ====\n(\u91d1\u91cd) <br />\nKinju, like Chogi, by convention is pronounced in Chinese. He is also known as Kaneshige using the Japanese pronunciation of his name. He and Kaneuji are founders of the [[Mino Province|Mino]] style. He was a monk at the [[Seisen-ji]] in [[Tsuruga]], and led to the creation of [[Echizen Province|Echizen]] swordmaking like [[Kuniyuki]], moving to [[Mino Province|Mino]] around the time of [[Ryakuo]] (1338\u20131342) creating the [[Seki, Gifu|Seki]] tradition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nihontocraft.com/Ura_Nihon_no_Toko.html |title=Ura Nihon no Toko |first=Yoshikawa |last=Kentaro |access-date=1 October 2018 |work=Nihontocraft}}</ref>\n\n==== Kunishige ====\n(\u9577\u8c37\u90e8\u56fd\u91cd\u2014Hasebe Kunishige)<br />\nCreated the Hasebe school producing swords in the style of the second period of Soshu and Yamashiro. His swords are considered by some to be equal to Akihiro and Hiromitsu. He created the ''Heshikiri Hasebe'' (The Forceful Cutter) listed in the Kyoho Meibutsu Cho, owned by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and then by [[Oda Nobunaga]]. It bears a gold appraisal inlay of Honami Kotoku called a Kinzogan (\u91d1\u8c61\u5d4c). Today the sword is a family heirloom of the Kuroda Daimy\u014d Ke. The sword takes its name from the story of Oda Nobunaga drawing it to cut through a table to kill Kannai, a tea master who betrayed him.\n\n==== Kunitsugu ====\n(\u6765\u6e90\u56fd\u6b21\u2014Rai Minamoto Kunitsugu)<br />\nAlso goes by the name Kamakura Rai as he is the grandson of Rai Kuniyuki. The influence of the Soshu and Yamashiro traditions can be observed in his works.\n\n==== Saemonzaburo ====\n(\u5de6\u2014Sa) (\u7b51\u5dde\u5de6\u2014Chikushu Sa) (\u7b51\u524d\u570b\u4f4f\u5de6\u2014Chikuzen no Kuni ju Sa)<br />\nBelieved to go by the name Yasuyoshi but signed his work using the first two letters of his given name. Considered by some to be one of the greatest of Masamune's students. As well as being a Soshu swordsmith he also created the Chikuzen tradition.\n\n==== Saeki Norishige ====\n(\u5247\u91cd\u2014Norishige, \u4f50\u4f2f\u2014Saeki)<br />\nHistorically considered one of the best of Masamune's students, he is numbered among the Juttetsu. However, current research indicates that he was a senior student to Masamune, junior to Yukimitsu, under the great teacher Shint\u014dgo Kunimitsu. He, like Go, hails from Etchu province and is well known as the only smith to have mastered the style of matsukawa-hada (pine tree bark pattern steel), making his work unique.\n\n==== Go Yoshihiro ====\n(\u90f7(\u6c5f)\u2014Go, \u7fa9\u5f18\u2014Yoshihiro)<br />\nVery few works exist by this swordsmith due to his death at the young age of 27, No known signed works exist. He is believed to have gone by the names of Go Yoshihiro or simply Go, the name of the town from which he came. As well as being a Soshu swordsmith he is a member of the Etchu tradition. He is considered to have the highest skill in forging swords among the Masamune Juttetsu [https://web.archive.org/web/20110524110233/http://www.touken.or.jp/english/nihon_koto_shi/%2813%29%20No.559.htm].\n\n==== Naotsuna ====\n(\u77f3\u5dde\u51fa\u7fbd\u76f4\u7db1\u4f5c\u2014Sekishu Izuwa Naotsuna Saku) (\u76f4\u7db1\u4f5c\u2014Naotsuna Saku)<br />\nMany theories exist that he may in fact have been a student of Saemonzaburo among others. His work is considered by many to have been influenced by Soshu(\u76f8\u5dde) even if not taught by Masamune directly, he is also influenced by the Soden Bizen(\u5099\u524d) and Iwami province (\u77f3\u5dde) style.\n\n=== Other students ===\n\n* [[Hiromitsu]] (\u76f8\u6a21\u570b\u4f4f\u4eba\u5ee3\u5149\u2014Sagami Kuni Junin Hiromitsu): Along with Akihiro brought about the second period of the Soshu style.\n* [[Sadamune]]: A student and possibly son or adopted son of Masamune.

It is one of the best known of the swords created by Masamune, and is believed to be among the finest Japanese swords ever made. It was made a [[National Treasures of Japan|Japanese National Treasure]] (''Kokuh\u014d'') in 1939.\n\nThe name Honj\u014d possibly came about due to this sword's connection to the general [[Honj\u014d Shigenaga]] who gained the sword in battle.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Honj\u014d Shigenaga, general of [[Uesugi Kenshin]]<ref name=MasaHist/> in the 16th century, was attacked by Umanosuke who already possessed a number of trophy heads. Shigenaga was attacked with the Honj\u014d Masamune which split his helmet, but he survived and took the sword as a prize. The blade had a number of chips from the great battle but was still usable. It was kept by Shigenaga until he was sent to [[Fushimi Castle]], [[Bunroku]] around 1592\u20131595.\n\nShigenaga was later forced to sell the sword to [[Toyotomi Hidetsugu]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s nephew and retainer. It was bought for 13 Mai, 13 [[Koban (coin)|\u014dban]], which was 13 large gold coins. The blade was later valued in the Kyoho Meibutsu Cho at 1,000 Mai. It then went to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Shimazu Yoshihiro]], again to Hideyoshi, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], [[Tokugawa Yorinobu]], and finally [[Tokugawa Ietsuna]]. It remained in the Kii (\u7d00\u4f0a) branch of the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawa family]], the last known owner being [[Tokugawa Iemasa]] at the end of World War II.\n\nUnder the United States occupation at the end of World War II all production of nihont\u014d with edges was banned except under police or government permit. Apparently, Tokugawa Iemasa gave the Honj\u014d Masamune and 14 other swords to a police station at [[Mejiro, Toshima, Tokyo|Mejiro]] in December 1945. Shortly thereafter in January 1946, the Mejiro police gave these swords to a man identified as \"Sgt. Coldy Bimore\" (possibly a garbled [[phonetic]] spelling of the man's name) of the Foreign Liquidations Commission of AFWESPAC (Army Forces, Western Pacific). In an episode of ''[[Expedition Unknown]]'', [[Josh Gates]] traveled to Japan in search of the Honj\u014d Masamune,<ref>Josh Gates</ref> and learned that there were no records of a \"Sgt. Coldy Bimore\" listed to have received the sword.  The Honj\u014d Masamune is the most important of the missing [[Japanese swords]] and its current location remains unknown, but there are theories of who may possess the sword.<ref>Jim Kurrach, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030707112255/http://members.cox.net/jkk/mismasam.htm Honjo Masamune] and [http://www.sydneytokenkai.com/10.htm Important Missing Nihonto], Japanese Sword Society of Southern California newsletter, 1996</ref>\n\n===Fudo Masamune===\nThis is one of the few blades signed by Masamune that is not in question. It was bought by [[Toyotomi Hidetsugu]]<ref name=MasaHist/> in 1601 for 500 Kan and was passed to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu|Sh\u014dgun Ieyasu]] and from him to [[Maeda Toshiie]]. [[Maeda Toshitsune]] presented it again to the Sh\u014dgun, possibly on his retirement. Later, the sword was handed down among the [[Owari Tokugawa]]. This blade is a [[tant\u014d]] approximately 25&nbsp;cm (8 sun 6.5 bun) with a carving of roots on the Omote (Front, outer edge) side. It also has chopstick-like grooves (Gomabashi \u8b77\u6469\u7bb8) on the back and a Dragon at the ura part of blade (Kurikara \u5036\u5229\u4f3d\u7f85). The blade features an engraving of [[Fud\u014d My\u014d-\u014d]], the [[Buddhism|buddhist]] deity which gives this blade its name.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}.\n\n===Musashi Masamune===\nA peculiar work of Masamune, once in the possession of the Tokugawa Shogunate through the [[Kish\u016b Domain|Kii Domain]] and gifted to the main Tokugawa family line in Edo in its prime.<ref name=\"musashi\">https://markussesko.com/2013/02/27/the-musashi-masamune-one-blade-four-oshigata/ The Musashi Masamune - One blade, four oshigata</ref> Upon the end of the Tokugawa Era marked by the [[Bakumatsu]], the Musashi Masamune was presented as a gift by [[Tokugawa Iesato]] in honor of [[Yamaoka Tessh\u016b]]'s efforts to facilitate peaceful negotiation with [[Katsu Kaish\u016b]] to [[Saig\u014d Takamori]], sparing Edo from war and needless destruction; however, Yamaoka was humbled upon being given such a masterpiece, and had passed it down to statesman [[Iwakura Tomomi]]. Soon after seeing it passed from hand to hand throughout the 20th Century, the Musashi Masamune finally made its way to the [[Nihon Bijutsu Token Hozon Kyokai]] in the year 2000 by Motoo Otsuyasu. The Musashi Masamune is a tachi, measuring 74&nbsp;cm (2 korai-shaku, 1 sun, 4.2 bun), and noted to have nearly all of the characteristics of Masamune's signature features; though it is debated that its o-kissaki is not that of his style, it is compared to blades made in his later career, which shows the transition of the Kamakura styles into the Nanbokucho era. It is of rumor that, while the blade is named after [[Musashi Province]], where Edo and current day Tokyo stands, its origins stems from being once in the possession of [[Miyamoto Musashi]], who is considered Japan's most famous swordsman. The sword is classified as a meibutsu National Treasure of Japan.\n\n===H\u014dch\u014d Masamune===\nThe \"H\u014dch\u014d\" Masamune refers to any one of three particular and unusual [[tant\u014d]]<ref name=\"swordpics\">[https://archive.is/20070109174058/http://www.universalswordsman.com/Swords-SmithPages/Masamune2006.html Site containing pictures of his blades and a portrait of Masamune]</ref> attributed to Masamune. These tant\u014d have a wide body, unlike his normal slim and elegant work, making them appear quite similar to a [[Japanese cutlery|Japanese cooking knife]]. One of the three blades has a Gomabashi in cutout (Sukashi). It was restored around 1919 and sold for approximately 10 ''hiki'' (a certain number of ''[[Japanese mon (currency)|mon]]''); this was worth roughly 14\u00a2 US at the time, meaning that the price was remarkably low. It is presently on display in the [[Tokugawa Art Museum]].<ref>[http://www.tokugawa-art-museum.jp/english/parmanent/room1/tachi2.html Tanto:\"Hocho Masamune\"].

In this case Kote is contracted word of  Yugote (\u5f13\u7c60\u624b), items of samurai that is equipped with his finger for using a bow. This  name comes from an episode that Asakura Ujikage cut an opposing  samurai's yugote in the battle of Toji in [[Kyoto|Ky\u00f4to]]. [[Oda Nobunaga]] gained possession of this sword and had it shortened to its present length. In 1615 it eventually passed down to the Maeda clan who in 1882 presented it as a gift to [[Emperor Meiji]], a known sword collector.<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = Zukai Nihonto jiten\n  | publisher = Kabushiki kaisha Gakushuu Kenkyujo\n  | year = 2007\n  | page = 282\n  | isbn = 4-05-403276-1 }}</ref>\n\n===Masamune in Harry S.

Presbyterian denominations tracing their history to the Covenanters and often incorporating the name continue the ideas and traditions in [[Scotland]] and internationally.\n\nThey derived their name from the word ''[[wikt:covenant]]'' meaning a bond, legal document or agreement, with particular reference to the [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]] between God and the Israelites in the Old Testament.<ref>{{harvnb|Furgol|1983|p=20}}<br>In the summer of 1643, the Scottish parliament and General Assembly of the Church entered into negotiations for an alliance with the English Parliament. Historians have concentrated on the clauses of the Solemn League and Covenant, the treaty which resulted from those deliberations.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Currie|2009|pp=17\u201319}}<br>\"Following the outbreak of the Civil War in England, in 1642, a committee of noblemen and clergy from both Scotland and England composed a document entitled the 'Solemn League and Covenant'. It was signed between September and October, in both countries, and later in the same year, in Ireland. This committed the Scots to supply an army to aid the Parliamentarian Par against the Royalists in the Civil War. As in the National Covenant, the signatories pledged to 'amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the example of a real Reformation'. As with the National Covenant they entered into a mutual contract with God where the signatory promised to reform his or her person, in this case, not only for the upholding of 'the Religion', but that 'the Lord may tu away his wrath, and heavy indignation'. (All quotations are from 'The Solemn League and Covenant', reprinted in SB, ILL, pp.122-5). The success of the Scottish National Covenant was thought by many sectarians and clergy alike to have been the direct result of the process of mutual bonding between the nation and God. Thus, at a time of rising religious schism, a threatened invasion of Irish Catholics and Royalist-Parliamentarian hostilities, the English Parliamentarians bound themselves to the same course that had appeared to guarantee the Scots 'virtually unmitigated success' (Edward J. Cowan, 'The Making of the National Covenant', in John Morrell, ed. (1988), p.75).</ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nThe Covenanters are so named for the series of bonds or covenants by which the adherents bound themselves to maintain the Presbyterian doctrine and polity as the sole form of religion of their country. The first \"godly bond\" of the [[Lords of the Congregation]] and their followers is dated December 1557; but more important is the [[s:National Covenant of the Church of Scotland|National Covenant of the Church of Scotland]] (1581), drawn up by [[John Craig (minister)|John Craig]] in consequence of the strenuous efforts [[Roman Catholic]]s were making to regain their hold upon Scotland, and called the King's Confession or Negative Confession.  Based on the [[Scots Confession|Scots Confession of Faith of 1560]], this document denounced the [[Pope]] and the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church in no measured terms. It was adopted by the General Assembly of the [[Church of Scotland]], signed by King [[James I of England|James VI]] and his household, and enjoined on persons of all ranks and classes, and was subscribed to again in 1590 and 1596.<ref>{{cite news |last1=MacPherson |first1=Hamish |title=How the defiance of the Covenanters changed history |url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/15658853.How_the_defiance_of_the_Covenanters_changed_history/ |accessdate=17 August 2018 |agency=The National |date=14 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Upheaval and the Wars of the Three Kingdoms==\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\nIn 1637, Scotland was in a state of turmoil. [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], met with a reverse in their efforts to impose a new liturgy on the Scots. The new liturgy had been devised by a panel of Scottish bishops, including [[John Spottiswoode|Archbishop Spottiswoode]] of St. Andrews, but a riot against its use was orchestrated in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], Edinburgh, ostensibly started by [[Jenny Geddes]]. Fearing further measures on the part of the king, it occurred to [[Archibald Johnston]] (Lord Warriston) to revive the Negative Confession of 1581 in a form suited to the times. Together with the cooperation of [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)|Alexander Henderson]], this National Covenant (as it was called) was finalized in early 1638.\n\n[[File:Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] where the National Covenant was signed in 1638]]\n[[File:The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, by [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]] ]]\n[[File:The National Covenant of 1638.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Edinburgh's copy of the National Covenant]]\nAdditional matter intended to suit the document to the special circumstances of the time was added, primarily a recital of the acts of parliament against \"superstitious and papistical rites\" and an elaborate oath to maintain the reformed religion. The Covenant was adopted and signed by a large gathering in the [[Greyfriars Kirkyard|kirkyard]] of [[Greyfriars Kirk]] in [[Edinburgh]], on 28 February 1638, after which copies were sent throughout the country for signing. The subscribers engaged by oath to maintain religion in the form that it existed in 1580, and to reject all innovations introduced since that time, while also professing loyalty to the king. It did not specifically reject episcopacy but in effect undermined it. Further subscriptions and swearing ceremonies took place across Scotland, emotionally charged events evoking mass crying and yelling.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Scottish Puritanism, 1590-1638|last=Mullan|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-19-826997-8|location=Oxford|pages=288-289}}</ref> The year 1638 marked an apex of events for the Covenanters, for it was the time of broad confrontations with the established church supported by the monarchy. Confrontations occurred in several parts of Scotland, such as the one with the [[Bishops of Aberdeen]] by a high level assembly of Covenanters staging their operations from [[Muchalls Castle]]. The General Assembly of 1638 was composed of ardent Covenanters, and in 1640 the Covenant was adopted by the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish parliament]], its subscription being made a requirement for all citizens. Before this date, the Covenanters were usually referred to as Supplicants, but from about this time the former designation began to prevail. The Covenanters raised an army to resist Charles I's religious reforms, and defeated him in the [[Bishops' Wars]]. The crisis that this caused to the Stuart monarchy helped bring about the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], which included the [[English Civil War]], the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scottish Civil War]] and [[Irish Confederate Wars]].\n\nFor the following ten years of civil war in Britain, the Covenanters were the ''[[de facto]]'' government of Scotland. In 1642, they sent an army to [[Ulster]] in Ireland to protect the Scottish settlers there from the Irish Catholic rebels who had attacked them in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. The Scottish army remained in Ireland until the end of the civil wars, but was confined to its garrison around [[Carrickfergus]] after its defeat at the [[Battle of Benburb]] in 1646.\n\n[[File:The Solemn League And Covenant.jpg|thumb|The Solemn League And Covenant, as publicised in England]]\n{{wikisource|Solemn League and Covenant}}\nA further Covenanter military intervention began in 1643. The leaders of the English Parliament, worsted in the English Civil War, implored the aid of the Scots, which was promised on condition that the Scottish system of church government would be adopted in England. Following considerable debate, a document called the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] was drawn up. This was in effect a treaty between England and Scotland which called for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland and the reformation of religion in England and Ireland \"according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches\", and the extirpation of [[popery]] and [[prelacy]]. It did not explicitly mention [[Presbyterianism]] and included some ambiguous formulations that left the door open to Independency. It was subscribed to by many in both kingdoms and also in Ireland. It was approved by the English Parliament. With some slight modifications it was approved by the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]]. This agreement meant that the Covenanters sent another army south to England to fight on the Parliamentarian side in the [[First English Civil War]]. The Scottish armies in England were instrumental in bringing about the victory of the English Parliament over the king.<ref>{{cite news |last1=MacPherson |first1=Hamish |title=How the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643 changed our islands forever |url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/15673067.How_the_Solemn_League_and_Covenant_of_1643_changed_our_islands_forever/ |accessdate=17 August 2018 |agency=The National |date=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn turn, this sparked the outbreak of civil war in Scotland in 1644\u201347, as Scottish [[Cavalier|Royalist]] opponents of the Covenanters took up arms against them. Royalism was most common among Scottish Roman Catholics and [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalians]], who were opposed to the Covenanters' imposition of their religious settlement on the country.  The Covenanters' enemies, led by [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]] and aided by an Irish expeditionary force and Highland clans led by [[Alasdair Mac Colla]] won a series of victories over hastily raised Covenanter forces in 1644\u201345. However, the Scottish Royalists were ultimately defeated in September 1645, at the [[Battle of Philiphaugh]], near [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]]. The disaster at Philiphaugh was largely due to the Royalists' own disunity and the return of the main Covenanter armies from England. The civil war in Scotland was a bitter episode which exposed the religious divisions between Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Catholics, the political divisions between Royalists and Covenanters and the cultural divisions between the Highlands and Lowlands.\n\n[[File:Replica Covenanter flag, Royal Scottish Museum.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Replica Covenanter flag, National Museum of Scotland]]\nThe end of the first civil wars in Scotland and England left the Covenanters hopeful that their Solemn League and Covenant would be implemented in the Three Kingdoms. However, Charles I refused to accept it when he surrendered himself to the Scots in 1646. He was taken to Newcastle, where several attempts were made to persuade him to take the Covenants.  When this failed, he was handed over to the commissioners of Parliament in early 1647. However, many Covenanters, led by [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton|James Hamilton]], were suspicious of their English allies' intentions and opened secret negotiations with Charles I. He made important concessions to them in the \"[[engagers|Engagement]]\" made with the Scots in December 1647. The Engagement was rejected by the militant Covenanters known as the [[Kirk Party]], who wanted the king to endorse their agenda explicitly before an alliance could be reached. A Scottish army invaded England in support of the Engagement, but was routed at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]], leaving the Kirk Party in the ascendant in Scotland. The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], which had been submitted for ratification in 1646, was in part adopted by act of the English Parliament in 1648 as the Articles of Christian Religion, while in Scotland it was approved with minor reservations in August 1647 and ratified by the Scottish Parliament in February 1649.\n\nThe Covenanters' insistence on dictating the future of both Scotland and England eventually led to all-out war with their erstwhile allies, the English Parliament, and to the Covenanters signing an alliance with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] known as the [[Treaty of Breda (1650)|Treaty of Breda]]. Charles II, before landing in Scotland in June 1650, declared by a solemn oath his approbation of both covenants, and this was renewed on the occasion of his coronation at Scone in the following January.\n\nHowever, the Covenanters were utterly defeated in 1650\u201352 by the forces of the English Parliament under [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Lowland Scotland was occupied by the [[New Model Army]] and the Covenanters were sidelined. From 1638 to 1651 the Covenanters, led by [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll]], had been the dominant party in Scotland, directing policy both at home and abroad. Their power had been seriously weakened, however, by Cromwell's victory at [[battle of Dunbar (1650)|Dunbar]] in September 1650 and was practically destroyed after the [[Battle of Worcester]] and the English occupation of Lowland Scotland. Under Cromwell's [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], Scotland was forced into a temporary union with England and the General Assembly of the Kirk lost all civil power.\n\n==Restoration and \"The Killing Time\"==\n{{main|The Killing Time}}\n[[File:Murder scene, Archbishop Sharp Memorial, St. Andrews.JPG|thumb|The murder of Archbishop Sharp on his memorial at St. Andrews]]\n[[File:A Covenanters' Conventicle, from a children's history book.jpg|thumb|A conventicle in progress, from a children's history book published in 1906]]\n[[File:Covenanter Bible.jpg|thumb|A Covenanter's bible in the National Museum of Scotland]]\n[[File:Covenanters Prison, Greyfriars Kirkyard - geograph.org.uk - 1351472.jpg|thumb|Covenanters Prison, Greyfriars Kirkyard]]\nWorse was to come for the Covenanters when Charles II was [[Restoration (Scotland)|restored]] nine years later.  Firmly seated upon the throne, Charles renounced the covenants, which in 1662 were declared unlawful oaths to be abjured by all persons holding public offices. Argyll himself was executed for treason, [[episcopacy]] was restored, [[James Sharp (bishop)|James Sharp]] was appointed [[Archbishop of St Andrews]] and Primate of Scotland, the court of high commission was revived, and ministers who refused to recognize the authority of the bishops were expelled from their livings. Archbishop Sharp survived an assassination attempt in 1668 only to be killed by another group of Covenanters in 1679.\n\nFollowing the restoration of Episcopacy, rebel ministers began to preach at secret open-air meetings in the countryside known as \"[[conventicles]]\". A period of sustained persecution began. Oppressive measures against these illegal field assemblies where attendance was made a capital offence<ref name=Covenanters>{{cite web|url=http://www.sorbie.net/covenanters.htm |title=The Covenanters, The Fifty Years Struggle 1638-1688 |publisher=Sorbie.net |date=1920-07-26 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref> led to an outbreak of armed rebellion in 1666, originating in Galloway. Advancing from the west towards Edinburgh, a small force of poorly armed Covenanters was defeated at the [[Battle of Rullion Green]] in the [[Pentland Hills]], a location which caused the whole tragic episode to be misleadingly named the Pentland Rising. To quell unrest in south-west Scotland, the government brought in 6,000 [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] soldiers, described by its enemies as an \"inhumane and barbarous Highland host\", which were quartered on suspected Covenanters and were accused of committing many atrocities.<ref name=Covenanters/>\n\nA further rebellion broke out in 1679, after the unexpected success of a group of covenanters, armed with pitch forks and the like, against government forces led by [[John Graham of Claverhouse]] at the [[Battle of Drumclog]]. For a time the authorities looked in danger of losing control of the south west of Scotland, as more and more people joined the rebel camp at Bothwell near [[Glasgow]]; but only a few weeks after Drumclog the rebels were defeated at the [[Battle of Bothwell Brig]]. In the weeks before the battle the Covenanters spent more time arguing among themselves than preparing for the inevitable counterstroke, which did much to contribute towards their downfall. Of 1,200 captured rebels taken to Edinburgh, some 400 were imprisoned in an area of Greyfriars Kirkyard over the winter months.<ref name=greyfriars>{{cite web |url=http://www.covenanter.org.uk/Greyfriars/ |title=Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh |publisher=Covenanter.org.uk |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513123235/http://www.covenanter.org.uk/Greyfriars/ |archivedate=2013-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nInevitably, the government behaved harshly at first towards some of those caught in arms. On the initiative of [[James, Duke of Monmouth]], who led the king's army to victory at Bothwell Brig, a more conciliatory policy was followed for a time, though this met with limited success.\n\nThrough the period of repression the Covenanters held their convictions with a zeal that was only intensified by the persecution. For them it was a matter of belief. For the government, in contrast, the whole conventicle movement was seen as a problem of public order, which they attempted to deal with often using very inadequate resources. However, after the collapse of the 1679 rebellion a more dangerous element entered into the whole equation.  \n[[File:Condemned Covenanters on Their Way to Execution in the West Bow, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|A painting showing the last Covenanter martyr [[James Renwick (Covenanter)|James Renwick]] being taken to execution in 1688]]\n\nIn 1680 a more extreme mood appeared among sections of the Covenanter underground, which found expression in a document known as the ''[[Sanquhar Declaration]]''.  This was the manifesto of the followers of the Reverend [[Richard Cameron (Covenanter)|Richard Cameron]], soon to be known as the [[Cameronian]]s. Hitherto, many in the Covenanter underground maintained an outward loyalty to the king, despite their opposition to the religious policy of his government; but the Cameronians took matters to a new height, renouncing their allegiance to Charles and denouncing his brother, James, as a papist. One extreme position inevitably led to another: the government in attempting to stamp out sedition authorized field executions without trial. This was the beginning of what [[Robert Wodrow]] later called [[the Killing Time]]. Cameron himself was killed in a clash with government forces at [[Airds Moss]] in July 1680, but his followers, now a tiny part of the Covenanter movement, continued to exist. After the accession of [[James II of England|James VII]] in 1685 the King issued a series of ''Letters of Indulgence'' allowing such \"ousted ministers as had lived peaceably and orderly to return to their livings\".<ref name=catenc>[http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/c/covenanters.html Covenanters] ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]''</ref> This succeeded in luring many ministers away from the struggle, but those remaining became more determined. When [[William III of England|William of Orange]] summoned a ''Convention of the Estates'' which met on 14 March 1689 in Edinburgh to consider whether Scotland should recognise him or James, forces of Cameronians arrived to bolster William's support. In the subsequent [[Dundee's rising|Jacobite rising]], the [[26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot|Cameronian Guard]] helped to defeat the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Highlanders, particularly at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]]. Although the Cameronians had helped to defend the Revolution, they were disappointed that their religious views were not adopted by the new government. The binding obligation of the National Covenant (1638) and the Solemn League and Covenant (1643) was passed over since the acts of parliament in favour of these had been rescinded by Charles and were not revived under William and Mary. For some Covenanters even William of Orange was an \"uncovenanted\" King since he was head of the Church of England which was an episcopal church. Perhaps 1000 people in the south west made an issue of the failure to maintain the covenants and also, with some justification, viewed the new establishment as tainted by [[Thomas Erastus|Erastianism]]. They formed the ''United Societies'' refusing to recognise the \"usurped\" Church of Scotland.<ref name=crpc>{{cite web |author=Covie |url=http://www.covenanter.org/RPCCov/aboutrpcc.htm |title=Who are the Covenanted Reformed Presbyterian Church? |publisher=Covenanter.org |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609050403/http://www.covenanter.org/RPCCov/aboutrpcc.htm |archivedate=2012-06-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Martyrs and memorials==\n\nThough the rebellion had ended and a degree of Presbyterian tolerance for other faiths had been suggested by thanks given for James's Indulgence of 1687, for allowing all \"to serve God after their own way and manner\",<ref name=catenc/> memories of \"[[the Killing Time]]\" were now kept alive by monuments and tombstones at the many [[martyr]] graves across the south of Scotland, particularly the south west. \"For the word of God and Scotland's work of Reformation.

In North America Covenanters became known as members of the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterian Church]]. They were among the most vocal agitators for independence from Great Britain and volunteered in large numbers as soldiers in the revolutionary armies.

Historians have concentrated on the clauses of the Solemn League and Covenant, the treaty which resulted from those deliberations.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Currie|2009|pp=17\u201319}}<br>\"Following the outbreak of the Civil War in England, in 1642, a committee of noblemen and clergy from both Scotland and England composed a document entitled the 'Solemn League and Covenant'. It was signed between September and October, in both countries, and later in the same year, in Ireland. This committed the Scots to supply an army to aid the Parliamentarian Par against the Royalists in the Civil War. As in the National Covenant, the signatories pledged to 'amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the example of a real Reformation'. As with the National Covenant they entered into a mutual contract with God where the signatory promised to reform his or her person, in this case, not only for the upholding of 'the Religion', but that 'the Lord may tu away his wrath, and heavy indignation'. (All quotations are from 'The Solemn League and Covenant', reprinted in SB, ILL, pp.122-5). The success of the Scottish National Covenant was thought by many sectarians and clergy alike to have been the direct result of the process of mutual bonding between the nation and God. Thus, at a time of rising religious schism, a threatened invasion of Irish Catholics and Royalist-Parliamentarian hostilities, the English Parliamentarians bound themselves to the same course that had appeared to guarantee the Scots 'virtually unmitigated success' (Edward J. Cowan, 'The Making of the National Covenant', in John Morrell, ed. (1988), p.75).</ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nThe Covenanters are so named for the series of bonds or covenants by which the adherents bound themselves to maintain the Presbyterian doctrine and polity as the sole form of religion of their country. The first \"godly bond\" of the [[Lords of the Congregation]] and their followers is dated December 1557; but more important is the [[s:National Covenant of the Church of Scotland|National Covenant of the Church of Scotland]] (1581), drawn up by [[John Craig (minister)|John Craig]] in consequence of the strenuous efforts [[Roman Catholic]]s were making to regain their hold upon Scotland, and called the King's Confession or Negative Confession.  Based on the [[Scots Confession|Scots Confession of Faith of 1560]], this document denounced the [[Pope]] and the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church in no measured terms. It was adopted by the General Assembly of the [[Church of Scotland]], signed by King [[James I of England|James VI]] and his household, and enjoined on persons of all ranks and classes, and was subscribed to again in 1590 and 1596.<ref>{{cite news |last1=MacPherson |first1=Hamish |title=How the defiance of the Covenanters changed history |url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/15658853.How_the_defiance_of_the_Covenanters_changed_history/ |accessdate=17 August 2018 |agency=The National |date=14 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Upheaval and the Wars of the Three Kingdoms==\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\nIn 1637, Scotland was in a state of turmoil. [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], met with a reverse in their efforts to impose a new liturgy on the Scots. The new liturgy had been devised by a panel of Scottish bishops, including [[John Spottiswoode|Archbishop Spottiswoode]] of St. Andrews, but a riot against its use was orchestrated in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], Edinburgh, ostensibly started by [[Jenny Geddes]]. Fearing further measures on the part of the king, it occurred to [[Archibald Johnston]] (Lord Warriston) to revive the Negative Confession of 1581 in a form suited to the times. Together with the cooperation of [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)|Alexander Henderson]], this National Covenant (as it was called) was finalized in early 1638.\n\n[[File:Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] where the National Covenant was signed in 1638]]\n[[File:The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, by [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]] ]]\n[[File:The National Covenant of 1638.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Edinburgh's copy of the National Covenant]]\nAdditional matter intended to suit the document to the special circumstances of the time was added, primarily a recital of the acts of parliament against \"superstitious and papistical rites\" and an elaborate oath to maintain the reformed religion. The Covenant was adopted and signed by a large gathering in the [[Greyfriars Kirkyard|kirkyard]] of [[Greyfriars Kirk]] in [[Edinburgh]], on 28 February 1638, after which copies were sent throughout the country for signing. The subscribers engaged by oath to maintain religion in the form that it existed in 1580, and to reject all innovations introduced since that time, while also professing loyalty to the king. It did not specifically reject episcopacy but in effect undermined it. Further subscriptions and swearing ceremonies took place across Scotland, emotionally charged events evoking mass crying and yelling.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Scottish Puritanism, 1590-1638|last=Mullan|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-19-826997-8|location=Oxford|pages=288-289}}</ref> The year 1638 marked an apex of events for the Covenanters, for it was the time of broad confrontations with the established church supported by the monarchy. Confrontations occurred in several parts of Scotland, such as the one with the [[Bishops of Aberdeen]] by a high level assembly of Covenanters staging their operations from [[Muchalls Castle]]. The General Assembly of 1638 was composed of ardent Covenanters, and in 1640 the Covenant was adopted by the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish parliament]], its subscription being made a requirement for all citizens. Before this date, the Covenanters were usually referred to as Supplicants, but from about this time the former designation began to prevail. The Covenanters raised an army to resist Charles I's religious reforms, and defeated him in the [[Bishops' Wars]]. The crisis that this caused to the Stuart monarchy helped bring about the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], which included the [[English Civil War]], the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scottish Civil War]] and [[Irish Confederate Wars]].\n\nFor the following ten years of civil war in Britain, the Covenanters were the ''[[de facto]]'' government of Scotland. In 1642, they sent an army to [[Ulster]] in Ireland to protect the Scottish settlers there from the Irish Catholic rebels who had attacked them in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. The Scottish army remained in Ireland until the end of the civil wars, but was confined to its garrison around [[Carrickfergus]] after its defeat at the [[Battle of Benburb]] in 1646.\n\n[[File:The Solemn League And Covenant.jpg|thumb|The Solemn League And Covenant, as publicised in England]]\n{{wikisource|Solemn League and Covenant}}\nA further Covenanter military intervention began in 1643. The leaders of the English Parliament, worsted in the English Civil War, implored the aid of the Scots, which was promised on condition that the Scottish system of church government would be adopted in England. Following considerable debate, a document called the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] was drawn up. This was in effect a treaty between England and Scotland which called for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland and the reformation of religion in England and Ireland \"according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches\", and the extirpation of [[popery]] and [[prelacy]]. It did not explicitly mention [[Presbyterianism]] and included some ambiguous formulations that left the door open to Independency. It was subscribed to by many in both kingdoms and also in Ireland. It was approved by the English Parliament. With some slight modifications it was approved by the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]]. This agreement meant that the Covenanters sent another army south to England to fight on the Parliamentarian side in the [[First English Civil War]]. The Scottish armies in England were instrumental in bringing about the victory of the English Parliament over the king.<ref>{{cite news |last1=MacPherson |first1=Hamish |title=How the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643 changed our islands forever |url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/15673067.How_the_Solemn_League_and_Covenant_of_1643_changed_our_islands_forever/ |accessdate=17 August 2018 |agency=The National |date=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn turn, this sparked the outbreak of civil war in Scotland in 1644\u201347, as Scottish [[Cavalier|Royalist]] opponents of the Covenanters took up arms against them. Royalism was most common among Scottish Roman Catholics and [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalians]], who were opposed to the Covenanters' imposition of their religious settlement on the country.  The Covenanters' enemies, led by [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]] and aided by an Irish expeditionary force and Highland clans led by [[Alasdair Mac Colla]] won a series of victories over hastily raised Covenanter forces in 1644\u201345. However, the Scottish Royalists were ultimately defeated in September 1645, at the [[Battle of Philiphaugh]], near [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]]. The disaster at Philiphaugh was largely due to the Royalists' own disunity and the return of the main Covenanter armies from England. The civil war in Scotland was a bitter episode which exposed the religious divisions between Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Catholics, the political divisions between Royalists and Covenanters and the cultural divisions between the Highlands and Lowlands.\n\n[[File:Replica Covenanter flag, Royal Scottish Museum.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Replica Covenanter flag, National Museum of Scotland]]\nThe end of the first civil wars in Scotland and England left the Covenanters hopeful that their Solemn League and Covenant would be implemented in the Three Kingdoms. However, Charles I refused to accept it when he surrendered himself to the Scots in 1646. He was taken to Newcastle, where several attempts were made to persuade him to take the Covenants.  When this failed, he was handed over to the commissioners of Parliament in early 1647. However, many Covenanters, led by [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton|James Hamilton]], were suspicious of their English allies' intentions and opened secret negotiations with Charles I. He made important concessions to them in the \"[[engagers|Engagement]]\" made with the Scots in December 1647. The Engagement was rejected by the militant Covenanters known as the [[Kirk Party]], who wanted the king to endorse their agenda explicitly before an alliance could be reached. A Scottish army invaded England in support of the Engagement, but was routed at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]], leaving the Kirk Party in the ascendant in Scotland. The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], which had been submitted for ratification in 1646, was in part adopted by act of the English Parliament in 1648 as the Articles of Christian Religion, while in Scotland it was approved with minor reservations in August 1647 and ratified by the Scottish Parliament in February 1649.\n\nThe Covenanters' insistence on dictating the future of both Scotland and England eventually led to all-out war with their erstwhile allies, the English Parliament, and to the Covenanters signing an alliance with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] known as the [[Treaty of Breda (1650)|Treaty of Breda]]. Charles II, before landing in Scotland in June 1650, declared by a solemn oath his approbation of both covenants, and this was renewed on the occasion of his coronation at Scone in the following January.\n\nHowever, the Covenanters were utterly defeated in 1650\u201352 by the forces of the English Parliament under [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Lowland Scotland was occupied by the [[New Model Army]] and the Covenanters were sidelined. From 1638 to 1651 the Covenanters, led by [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll]], had been the dominant party in Scotland, directing policy both at home and abroad. Their power had been seriously weakened, however, by Cromwell's victory at [[battle of Dunbar (1650)|Dunbar]] in September 1650 and was practically destroyed after the [[Battle of Worcester]] and the English occupation of Lowland Scotland. Under Cromwell's [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], Scotland was forced into a temporary union with England and the General Assembly of the Kirk lost all civil power.\n\n==Restoration and \"The Killing Time\"==\n{{main|The Killing Time}}\n[[File:Murder scene, Archbishop Sharp Memorial, St. Andrews.JPG|thumb|The murder of Archbishop Sharp on his memorial at St. Andrews]]\n[[File:A Covenanters' Conventicle, from a children's history book.jpg|thumb|A conventicle in progress, from a children's history book published in 1906]]\n[[File:Covenanter Bible.jpg|thumb|A Covenanter's bible in the National Museum of Scotland]]\n[[File:Covenanters Prison, Greyfriars Kirkyard - geograph.org.uk - 1351472.jpg|thumb|Covenanters Prison, Greyfriars Kirkyard]]\nWorse was to come for the Covenanters when Charles II was [[Restoration (Scotland)|restored]] nine years later.  Firmly seated upon the throne, Charles renounced the covenants, which in 1662 were declared unlawful oaths to be abjured by all persons holding public offices. Argyll himself was executed for treason, [[episcopacy]] was restored, [[James Sharp (bishop)|James Sharp]] was appointed [[Archbishop of St Andrews]] and Primate of Scotland, the court of high commission was revived, and ministers who refused to recognize the authority of the bishops were expelled from their livings. Archbishop Sharp survived an assassination attempt in 1668 only to be killed by another group of Covenanters in 1679.\n\nFollowing the restoration of Episcopacy, rebel ministers began to preach at secret open-air meetings in the countryside known as \"[[conventicles]]\". A period of sustained persecution began. Oppressive measures against these illegal field assemblies where attendance was made a capital offence<ref name=Covenanters>{{cite web|url=http://www.sorbie.net/covenanters.htm |title=The Covenanters, The Fifty Years Struggle 1638-1688 |publisher=Sorbie.net |date=1920-07-26 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref> led to an outbreak of armed rebellion in 1666, originating in Galloway. Advancing from the west towards Edinburgh, a small force of poorly armed Covenanters was defeated at the [[Battle of Rullion Green]] in the [[Pentland Hills]], a location which caused the whole tragic episode to be misleadingly named the Pentland Rising. To quell unrest in south-west Scotland, the government brought in 6,000 [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] soldiers, described by its enemies as an \"inhumane and barbarous Highland host\", which were quartered on suspected Covenanters and were accused of committing many atrocities.<ref name=Covenanters/>\n\nA further rebellion broke out in 1679, after the unexpected success of a group of covenanters, armed with pitch forks and the like, against government forces led by [[John Graham of Claverhouse]] at the [[Battle of Drumclog]]. For a time the authorities looked in danger of losing control of the south west of Scotland, as more and more people joined the rebel camp at Bothwell near [[Glasgow]]; but only a few weeks after Drumclog the rebels were defeated at the [[Battle of Bothwell Brig]]. In the weeks before the battle the Covenanters spent more time arguing among themselves than preparing for the inevitable counterstroke, which did much to contribute towards their downfall. Of 1,200 captured rebels taken to Edinburgh, some 400 were imprisoned in an area of Greyfriars Kirkyard over the winter months.<ref name=greyfriars>{{cite web |url=http://www.covenanter.org.uk/Greyfriars/ |title=Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh |publisher=Covenanter.org.uk |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513123235/http://www.covenanter.org.uk/Greyfriars/ |archivedate=2013-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nInevitably, the government behaved harshly at first towards some of those caught in arms. On the initiative of [[James, Duke of Monmouth]], who led the king's army to victory at Bothwell Brig, a more conciliatory policy was followed for a time, though this met with limited success.\n\nThrough the period of repression the Covenanters held their convictions with a zeal that was only intensified by the persecution. For them it was a matter of belief. For the government, in contrast, the whole conventicle movement was seen as a problem of public order, which they attempted to deal with often using very inadequate resources. However, after the collapse of the 1679 rebellion a more dangerous element entered into the whole equation.  \n[[File:Condemned Covenanters on Their Way to Execution in the West Bow, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|A painting showing the last Covenanter martyr [[James Renwick (Covenanter)|James Renwick]] being taken to execution in 1688]]\n\nIn 1680 a more extreme mood appeared among sections of the Covenanter underground, which found expression in a document known as the ''[[Sanquhar Declaration]]''.  This was the manifesto of the followers of the Reverend [[Richard Cameron (Covenanter)|Richard Cameron]], soon to be known as the [[Cameronian]]s. Hitherto, many in the Covenanter underground maintained an outward loyalty to the king, despite their opposition to the religious policy of his government; but the Cameronians took matters to a new height, renouncing their allegiance to Charles and denouncing his brother, James, as a papist. One extreme position inevitably led to another: the government in attempting to stamp out sedition authorized field executions without trial. This was the beginning of what [[Robert Wodrow]] later called [[the Killing Time]]. Cameron himself was killed in a clash with government forces at [[Airds Moss]] in July 1680, but his followers, now a tiny part of the Covenanter movement, continued to exist. After the accession of [[James II of England|James VII]] in 1685 the King issued a series of ''Letters of Indulgence'' allowing such \"ousted ministers as had lived peaceably and orderly to return to their livings\".<ref name=catenc>[http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/c/covenanters.html Covenanters] ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]''</ref> This succeeded in luring many ministers away from the struggle, but those remaining became more determined. When [[William III of England|William of Orange]] summoned a ''Convention of the Estates'' which met on 14 March 1689 in Edinburgh to consider whether Scotland should recognise him or James, forces of Cameronians arrived to bolster William's support. In the subsequent [[Dundee's rising|Jacobite rising]], the [[26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot|Cameronian Guard]] helped to defeat the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Highlanders, particularly at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]]. Although the Cameronians had helped to defend the Revolution, they were disappointed that their religious views were not adopted by the new government. The binding obligation of the National Covenant (1638) and the Solemn League and Covenant (1643) was passed over since the acts of parliament in favour of these had been rescinded by Charles and were not revived under William and Mary. For some Covenanters even William of Orange was an \"uncovenanted\" King since he was head of the Church of England which was an episcopal church. Perhaps 1000 people in the south west made an issue of the failure to maintain the covenants and also, with some justification, viewed the new establishment as tainted by [[Thomas Erastus|Erastianism]]. They formed the ''United Societies'' refusing to recognise the \"usurped\" Church of Scotland.<ref name=crpc>{{cite web |author=Covie |url=http://www.covenanter.org/RPCCov/aboutrpcc.htm |title=Who are the Covenanted Reformed Presbyterian Church? |publisher=Covenanter.org |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609050403/http://www.covenanter.org/RPCCov/aboutrpcc.htm |archivedate=2012-06-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Martyrs and memorials==\n\nThough the rebellion had ended and a degree of Presbyterian tolerance for other faiths had been suggested by thanks given for James's Indulgence of 1687, for allowing all \"to serve God after their own way and manner\",<ref name=catenc/> memories of \"[[the Killing Time]]\" were now kept alive by monuments and tombstones at the many [[martyr]] graves across the south of Scotland, particularly the south west. \"For the word of God and Scotland's work of Reformation.

Having come to Ireland for religious, economic, and political reasons throughout the Seventeenth Century, Scottish Presbyterians, including Covenanters, once again for religious, economic, and political reasons felt compelled to migrate again. The migration is usually dated from the year 1717, when preacher [[William Tennent]], founder of [[Log College]], the first Presbyterian seminary in North America, came with his family to the [http://Philadelphia Philadelphia] area. In North America Covenanters became known as members of the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterian Church]]. They were among the most vocal agitators for independence from Great Britain and volunteered in large numbers as soldiers in the revolutionary armies. The Covenanters were opposed to slavery, and in 1800 the Reformed Church voted to outlaw slave-holding among its members.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Calvinism|Christianity|Scotland|History|Religion}}\n* [[Religion in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]\n* [[Plantation of Ulster]]\n* [[Samuel Rutherford]]\n* [[Archibald Johnston]]\n* [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)]]\n* [[James Sharp (bishop)]]\n* [[The Killing Time]]\n* [[David Hackston]]\n* [[Richard Cameron (Covenanter)]]\n* [[Donald Cargill]]\n* [[Alexander Peden]]\n* [[James Renwick (Covenanter)]]\n* [[List of Christian denominations#Presbyterian and Reformed Churches|List of Presbyterian and Reformed denominations]]\n* [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland]]\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Buckroyd, J.

On Concept Formation tasks, the individual has to apply concepts by inferring the underlying \"rules\" for solving visual puzzles that are presented in increasing levels of difficulty. Individuals at the preschool level have to point to a shape that is different from others in a set. As the level of difficulty increases, individuals increasingly demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes a key difference (or the \"rule\") for solving puzzles involving one to one comparisons, and on later items identifying common differences among a set of items. For more difficult items, individuals need to understand the concept of \"and\" (e.g. solution must have some of this and some of that) and the concept of \"or\" (e.g. to be inside a box, the item must be either this or that). The most difficult items require fluid transformations and cognitive shifting between the various types of concept puzzles that the examinee has worked with previously.<ref name=\"Schrank\">{{cite book |last1=Schrank |first1=F.

In the Analysis-Synthesis test, the individual has to learn and orally state the solutions to incomplete logic puzzles that mimic a miniature mathematics system. The test also contains some of the features involved in using symbolic formulations in other fields such as chemistry and logic. The individual is presented with a set of logic rules, a \"key\" that is used to solve the puzzles. The individual has to determine the missing colors within each of the puzzles using the key. Complex items present puzzles that require two or more sequential mental manipulations of the key to derive a final solution.

This task assesses the child's ability to discover the underlying characteristic (e.g. rule, concept, trend, class membership) that governs a set of materials. Matrix Reasoning also tests this ability as well as the ability to start with stated rules, premises, or conditions and to engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a novel problem (deduction). In the Matrix Reasoning test, children are presented a series or sequence of pictures with one picture missing. Their task is to choose the picture that fits the series or sequence from an array of five options. Since Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts involve the use of visual stimuli and do not require expressive language, they are considered to be non-verbal tests of Gf.<ref name=\"Flanagan\" />\n\nWithin the corporate environment, fluid intelligence is a predictor of a person's capacity to work well in environments characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity.

On Concept Formation tasks, the individual has to apply concepts by inferring the underlying \"rules\" for solving visual puzzles that are presented in increasing levels of difficulty. Individuals at the preschool level have to point to a shape that is different from others in a set. As the level of difficulty increases, individuals increasingly demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes a key difference (or the \"rule\") for solving puzzles involving one to one comparisons, and on later items identifying common differences among a set of items. For more difficult items, individuals need to understand the concept of \"and\" (e.g. solution must have some of this and some of that) and the concept of \"or\" (e.g. to be inside a box, the item must be either this or that). The most difficult items require fluid transformations and cognitive shifting between the various types of concept puzzles that the examinee has worked with previously.<ref name=\"Schrank\">{{cite book |last1=Schrank |first1=F.

In the Analysis-Synthesis test, the individual has to learn and orally state the solutions to incomplete logic puzzles that mimic a miniature mathematics system. The test also contains some of the features involved in using symbolic formulations in other fields such as chemistry and logic. The individual is presented with a set of logic rules, a \"key\" that is used to solve the puzzles. The individual has to determine the missing colors within each of the puzzles using the key. Complex items present puzzles that require two or more sequential mental manipulations of the key to derive a final solution.

This task assesses the child's ability to discover the underlying characteristic (e.g. rule, concept, trend, class membership) that governs a set of materials. Matrix Reasoning also tests this ability as well as the ability to start with stated rules, premises, or conditions and to engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a novel problem (deduction). In the Matrix Reasoning test, children are presented a series or sequence of pictures with one picture missing. Their task is to choose the picture that fits the series or sequence from an array of five options. Since Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts involve the use of visual stimuli and do not require expressive language, they are considered to be non-verbal tests of Gf.<ref name=\"Flanagan\" />\n\nWithin the corporate environment, fluid intelligence is a predictor of a person's capacity to work well in environments characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity.
