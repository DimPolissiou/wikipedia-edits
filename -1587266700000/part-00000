Gradually dinner began to migrate, amid much controversy, until by about 1900 it arrived at its present timing in the evening.  The earliest \"tea\" meals were often in the early evening, some three or four hours after dinner, or even later, after a supper and before bed.

However, in most of the [[South of England]], the midday meal is almost universally called \"lunch\", with \"dinner\" being the evening meal, regardless of social class.\n\nHigh tea typically consists of a hot dish, followed by cakes and bread, butter and jam. Occasionally there will be cold cuts of meat, such as ham salad. The term was first used around 1825, and \"high\" tea is taken on a high (dining) table; by contrast, low tea, which was more of a light snack, was served on a low table{{spaced ndash}} what would be called a coffee table in North America.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Oxford | title = English Dictionary | edition = 2nd}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = A Dictionary of Food and Nutrition | edition = 3rd | first = David A | last = Bender | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-19-923487-5 | quote = An afternoon meal; may consist of a light meal (especially in southern Britain), or be a substantial meal (high tea) as in northern Britain; introduced by Anna, Duchess of Bedford, in 1840 because of the long interval between a light luncheon and dinner at 8 pm. | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/dictionaryoffood00bend }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= The Diner\u2019s Dictionary |edition = 2nd |first = John | last= Ayto |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn = 978-0-19-964024-9 |quote=Tea seems first to have established for itself a particular niche in the day in the 1740s, by which time it had become the fashionable breakfast drink.  It was also drunk after dinner, and as the usual time for dinner progressed during the eighteenth century towards the evening a gap opened up for a late-afternoon refreshment, filled by what has since become the traditional English afternoon tea, a meal in its own right, with sandwiches and cake as well as cups of tea (amongst the earliest references to it are these by Fanny Burney in {{Citation | title = Evelina | year = 1778}}: \u2018I was relieved by a summons to tea,\u2019 and by John Wesley in 1789: \u2018At breakfast and at tea\u2026  I met all the [[Methodist Society|Society]]\u2019; [[Anna Maria Russell]], Duchess of Bedford (1783\u20131857), famously claimed to have originated the fashion, but as can be seen, it was around well before she was in a position to have any influence over it). In various other parts of the English-speaking world, teatime has assumed other connotations: in Jamaica, for instance, it is the first meal of the day, while for Australians and New Zealanders it is a cooked evening meal\u2014a usage reflected in the tea, and more specifically the \u2018high tea\u2019, of certain British dialects, predominantly those of the working class and of the North (the term high tea dates from the early nineteenth century).}}</ref>\n\nA stereotypical expression \"You'll have had your tea\" is used to parody people from Edinburgh as being rather stingy with hospitality.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/on-glasgow-and-edinburgh-by-robert-crawford-8587693.html |title=On Glasgow and Edinburgh, By Robert Crawford |first=Brian |last=Morton |work=[[The Independent]] |date=26 April 2013 |accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref> A [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy series [[You'll Have Had Your Tea|of this name]] was made by [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Barry Cryer]].\n\n== Tea break ==\n{{Main|Break (work)}}\nNot a meal as such, but a chance to \"down tools\" (or get away from the computer) and relax from work for 10\u201315 minutes.

Other than the name, the meal is not different from those eaten as [[dinner]] or [[supper]].  More generally, a high tea was and is often the last meal of the day for young children, before an early bedtime.\n\n==Australian and New Zealand usages of \"tea\"==\nIn [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], any short break for tea in the afternoon is referred to as \"afternoon tea\", though this turn of phrase is becoming antiquated.

In rural areas, ''dinner'' is still used quite often for the midday meal; ''tea'' is around 6 pm, and ''supper'' is either a very late meal at night, or food served at night at a social function, such as the town's annual Christmas dance and supper. These phraesologies have fallen somewhat out of favour amongst young people.

In Australia, this is commonly referred to as Devonshire Tea.\n\n== Evening high tea ==\nHigh Tea is a name for the evening meal, usually associated with the [[working class]], and is typically eaten between 5&nbsp;pm and 7&nbsp;pm.

However, in most of the [[South of England]], the midday meal is almost universally called \"lunch\", with \"dinner\" being the evening meal, regardless of social class.\n\nHigh tea typically consists of a hot dish, followed by cakes and bread, butter and jam. Occasionally there will be cold cuts of meat, such as ham salad. The term was first used around 1825, and \"high\" tea is taken on a high (dining) table; by contrast, low tea, which was more of a light snack, was served on a low table{{spaced ndash}} what would be called a coffee table in North America.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Oxford | title = English Dictionary | edition = 2nd}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = A Dictionary of Food and Nutrition | edition = 3rd | first = David A | last = Bender | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-19-923487-5 | quote = An afternoon meal; may consist of a light meal (especially in southern Britain), or be a substantial meal (high tea) as in northern Britain; introduced by Anna, Duchess of Bedford, in 1840 because of the long interval between a light luncheon and dinner at 8 pm. | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/dictionaryoffood00bend }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= The Diner\u2019s Dictionary |edition = 2nd |first = John | last= Ayto |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn = 978-0-19-964024-9 |quote=Tea seems first to have established for itself a particular niche in the day in the 1740s, by which time it had become the fashionable breakfast drink.  It was also drunk after dinner, and as the usual time for dinner progressed during the eighteenth century towards the evening a gap opened up for a late-afternoon refreshment, filled by what has since become the traditional English afternoon tea, a meal in its own right, with sandwiches and cake as well as cups of tea (amongst the earliest references to it are these by Fanny Burney in {{Citation | title = Evelina | year = 1778}}: \u2018I was relieved by a summons to tea,\u2019 and by John Wesley in 1789: \u2018At breakfast and at tea\u2026  I met all the [[Methodist Society|Society]]\u2019; [[Anna Maria Russell]], Duchess of Bedford (1783\u20131857), famously claimed to have originated the fashion, but as can be seen, it was around well before she was in a position to have any influence over it).

In rural areas, ''dinner'' is still used quite often for the midday meal; ''tea'' is around 6 pm, and ''supper'' is either a very late meal at night, or food served at night at a social function, such as the town's annual Christmas dance and supper.

During this era, the campus grew, with the construction of 25 new dormitories located on two new residential college greens, with radio and television stations, research and classroom facilities, and the construction of a 13,000-seat sports arena (the Convocation Center).  It is now America's 25th largest{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} residential college campus.\n\nIn 1964, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] publicly referenced his [[Great Society]] [[modern liberalism|initiative]] for the first time on the College Green, giving the university exposure across America and internationally.\n\nIn 1975, Ohio established its medical school, known as the Ohio University Heritage College of Medicine. Heritage is the only [[medical school|medical college]] in the state to award the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]] degree. In 2011, the college received the largest private donation ever to be given to a medical college in the U.S.  Approximately 240,000 living alumni now consider Ohio their alma mater, with Governors, Senators, Astronauts and media celebrities amongst its ranks.

The newer College Gate, built in the 1960s, features words taken from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 regarding public education and its founding as one of America's first public universities. The bronze university seal, embedded at the college gate, maintains the tradition that freshman must avoid stepping upon it or risk bad fortune. The nearby chimes and bells from the Cutler bell-tower's cupola ring out on the hour and sound the university Alma Mater at noon, which can be heard throughout the surrounding town and valley, as they have since 1820.\n\n====John Calhoun Baker University Center====\n{{Main|John Calhoun Baker University Center}}\nThe John Calhoun Baker University Center, which opened in January 2007, is named after the 14th president of the university.

The building features [[Georgian architecture|Federal architecture]] and large windows that admit a great deal of natural light and afford expansive views of campus. In contrast to the exterior's red brick and white columns, the interior has a more contemporary style with high domed ceilings, ergonomic furniture and a color scheme of sage, plum and mocha. [[Terrazzo]] mosaics of aspects of the earth's globe are embedded in the Grand Atrium of the main entrance to the building, which features a rotunda with curved walls, wood monumental staircase and large free-form chandelier.   An unusual acoustical quality of the building is the fact that any individual standing at the exact center of the inlaid arrow on the floor of the entering rotunda and facing its entrance, speaking or even whispering, produces a unique reverberating echo similar to the effect created at the center of the [[United States Capitol Rotunda]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Another unique feature is the fountain escalator system, the only operating escalator in [[southeast Ohio]], intersecting the huge atrium and connecting College Green and West Green. An outdoor second floor, featuring terraced patio dining, presides over a picturesque natural pond as well as a partial view of Peden Stadium and Byrd Arena.\n\nBaker Center contains a large food court called West 82; a pub bistro called Latitude 39; a Grand Ballroom; The Honors Collegium, The Wall of Presidents, the Bobcat Student Lounge, a shop called Bobcat Depot that sells apparel, computers, and accessories; a theater seating 400; study areas; computer labs; administrative offices; and numerous conference rooms. The Frontier Room, a large coffee house named after a former popular university [[rathskeller]], features a stage, artwork and a community fireplace. It serves Starbucks products and university bakery items and is housed on the fourth floor, which opens onto its own outside terrace as well as onto the intersection of Park Place and Court Streets, making it a hot spot for students between classes.

Cutler had served as a [[chaplain]] in Washington's [[Continental Army]]. The institution's first name was American University.<ref group=\"1\" name=\"Ohio University College of Arts & Sciences\"/>  President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s policy initiatives included a westward expansion of the new nation, with the addition of several territories to [[U.S. statehood]].\n\nIn 1797, settlers from [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] traveled downstream on the Ohio River and up the [[Hocking River]] to establish a location for the school, founding [[Athens, Ohio|Athens]] due to its location directly between the original capital of [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]] and Marietta.  In 1802 approval was granted by the territorial government for the establishment of the American Western University, but the school was not operated under that name.\n\nOhio University was recognized by the new state on February 18, 1804, as its charter was certified by the [[Ohio General Assembly|General Assembly of the new state]]. This last approval happened eleven months after Ohio was admitted to the Union.  The first three students enrolled in 1809.  The first two bachelor's degrees were granted in 1815.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=786|title=Ohio University|publisher=Ohio History Central: An Online Encyclopedia of Ohio History|accessdate=February 22, 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Manasseh Cutler Hall, Ohio University.jpg|left|thumb|[[Manasseh Cutler Hall, Ohio University|Manasseh Cutler Hall]], completed in 1819, was the first academic building in the [[Northwest Territory]].]]\n\n===20th century===\nThe 20th century saw dramatic growth in student enrollment, academic offerings, and research facilities.  Between 1955 and 1970, undergraduate enrollment tripled (from 7,000 to 20,000).    During this era, the campus grew, with the construction of 25 new dormitories located on two new residential college greens, with radio and television stations, research and classroom facilities, and the construction of a 13,000-seat sports arena (the Convocation Center).  It is now America's 25th largest{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} residential college campus.\n\nIn 1964, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] publicly referenced his [[Great Society]] [[modern liberalism|initiative]] for the first time on the College Green, giving the university exposure across America and internationally.\n\nIn 1975, Ohio established its medical school, known as the Ohio University Heritage College of Medicine. Heritage is the only [[medical school|medical college]] in the state to award the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]] degree. In 2011, the college received the largest private donation ever to be given to a medical college in the U.S.  Approximately 240,000 living alumni now consider Ohio their alma mater, with Governors, Senators, Astronauts and media celebrities amongst its ranks. Ohio is consistently classified among the top public universities in ''U.S. News & World Report'' ranking of \"Best American Colleges,\" and named by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] as a Doctoral/High Research Activity institution.

Development of the campus began in 1812 with the erection of the university's central building, [[Manasseh Cutler Hall]], a  registered national landmark, and built only 20 years after the White House.\n\n===College Green===\n{{Main|College Green of Ohio University}}\nThe historic College Green is the central quadrangle lawn and location of significant campus buildings:  [[Manasseh Cutler Hall]], the Office of the President; Wilson Hall, the [[Ohio University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]; McGuffey Hall, named for [[William McGuffey]]; and the College Gateway.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.ohio.edu/athens/bldgs/wilsonadm.html|title= Wilson Hall, College Green, Ohio University|publisher= Ohio University |year=2013|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref>  These three original primary structures are featured elements of the official current university logo and maintain true to their original design of over 200 years ago. The College Green has changed little in the past two centuries, which contributes to the university's colonial appearance.  The green, inspired by the university founders, is based upon the classic layout of traditional English and New England towns and similar to university quadrangles.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.ohio.edu/students/history.cfm|title= History and Traditions of Ohio University|publisher= Ohio University |year=2013|accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe College Green features Galbreath Chapel, the spire of which, topped with a brass weather vane, is modeled after that of the portico of Nash's [[All Souls Church, Langham Place|All Souls Church]] in London. Other buildings on the College Green include Chubb Hall, home to Undergraduate Admissions as well as the Offices of the Bursar and Registrar; Ellis Hall, home to the departments of [[English studies|English]], [[Classics]] and World Religions, and Philosophy; Templeton-Blackburn Memorial Auditorium; as well as Bryan Hall, an upperclassman residence hall.  The College Green is framed by two main university gateways. Alumni Gateway, built in 1915, features verses well known to the university community which may be read upon entering and leaving campus.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.athensnews.com/ohio/article-32774-college-green-landmark-was-a-magnet-for-lovers.html|title= College Green landmark was a magnet for lovers|publisher= The Athens News |date=13 December 2010|accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref>  The words over the gateway (\u201cThat thou Mayest Grow In Knowledge, Wisdom and Love\u201d) are borrowed from the Latin phrase inscribed over a gateway to the University of Padua, Italy, and was dedicated at the beginning of the 20th century upon the 100th anniversary of the university's first graduating class. The newer College Gate, built in the 1960s, features words taken from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 regarding public education and its founding as one of America's first public universities. The bronze university seal, embedded at the college gate, maintains the tradition that freshman must avoid stepping upon it or risk bad fortune. The nearby chimes and bells from the Cutler bell-tower's cupola ring out on the hour and sound the university Alma Mater at noon, which can be heard throughout the surrounding town and valley, as they have since 1820.\n\n====John Calhoun Baker University Center====\n{{Main|John Calhoun Baker University Center}}\nThe John Calhoun Baker University Center, which opened in January 2007, is named after the 14th president of the university. The facility replaced the original Baker Center located on East Union Street across from College Green and serves as the hub of campus activity.  Electronic maps and virtual university e-tours, available at center information desks and online, direct visitors across campus.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.ohio.edu/tour/|title= Ohio University Virtual Tour|publisher= Ohio University, www.ohio.edu |year=2013|accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Grand Hallway.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|right|[[University president|Hallway of Presidents]], often called the Grand Hallway with its [[piano]].]]\nThe five-story facility has been praised by The Association of College Unions International for its visual appeal and consistency with the campus' historic overall classic theme. The building features [[Georgian architecture|Federal architecture]] and large windows that admit a great deal of natural light and afford expansive views of campus. In contrast to the exterior's red brick and white columns, the interior has a more contemporary style with high domed ceilings, ergonomic furniture and a color scheme of sage, plum and mocha. [[Terrazzo]] mosaics of aspects of the earth's globe are embedded in the Grand Atrium of the main entrance to the building, which features a rotunda with curved walls, wood monumental staircase and large free-form chandelier.   An unusual acoustical quality of the building is the fact that any individual standing at the exact center of the inlaid arrow on the floor of the entering rotunda and facing its entrance, speaking or even whispering, produces a unique reverberating echo similar to the effect created at the center of the [[United States Capitol Rotunda]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Another unique feature is the fountain escalator system, the only operating escalator in [[southeast Ohio]], intersecting the huge atrium and connecting College Green and West Green. An outdoor second floor, featuring terraced patio dining, presides over a picturesque natural pond as well as a partial view of Peden Stadium and Byrd Arena.\n\nBaker Center contains a large food court called West 82; a pub bistro called Latitude 39; a Grand Ballroom; The Honors Collegium, The Wall of Presidents, the Bobcat Student Lounge, a shop called Bobcat Depot that sells apparel, computers, and accessories; a theater seating 400; study areas; computer labs; administrative offices; and numerous conference rooms. The Frontier Room, a large coffee house named after a former popular university [[rathskeller]], features a stage, artwork and a community fireplace. It serves Starbucks products and university bakery items and is housed on the fourth floor, which opens onto its own outside terrace as well as onto the intersection of Park Place and Court Streets, making it a hot spot for students between classes.  Other amenities include a United States Post Office<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohio.edu/eventservices/baker/offices/|title=Offices|website=www.ohio.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-25}}</ref> and the Trisolini Art Gallery, named after a prominent fine arts faculty member.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohio.edu/athens/bldgs/trisolini.html|title=Trisolini Gallery|website=www.ohio.edu|access-date=2017-02-25}}</ref>\n\n====Vernon R.

Released in January 1977 as a double-LP as Grunt CYL2-1255, it is a compilation of Jefferson Airplane and Airplane-related tracks, including tracks by [[Jefferson Starship]] and [[Hot Tuna]], as well as solo tracks by [[Paul Kantner]], [[Grace Slick]], and [[Jorma Kaukonen]]. Although primarily a compilation album, the album includes one previously unreleased song: \"Please Come Back\" written by [[Ron Nagle]] and performed by Jefferson Starship.  \"Please Come Back\" is not available on any other release.\n\nAmong the session musicians featured on the album are two members of the [[Grateful Dead]] and one member of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].  David Crosby appears on one track, and [[Jerry Garcia]] plays on three tracks, two of which also feature [[Mickey Hart]].\n\nThe album included a lavish 12-page full-color, full-size (12 sq.in.) booklet, containing photographs of the band throughout the period covered by the compilation. It also contained a detailed history of the band, written by Patrick Snyder of [[Rolling Stone]] magazine.\n\n''Flight Log'' was first reissued on CD by BMG Japan on October 22, 2008 as a part of the \"Paper Sleeve Collection\" reissue series (BVCM-35468-9). The release features an exact reproduction of the Grunt 1977 edition of the LP packaging including a reduced scale reproduction of the original booklet and inner sleeve jackets for the CDs.  Also included is a second booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The only omission by BMG Japan was not reproducing the original GRUNT label on the CDs. The audio quality is as good as the original master tapes available for the Japanese LP pressing and features JVC K2 24 Bit Remastering. However, it sounds as if the master tapes had been damaged on at least three songs, and significantly obvious on the introduction of \"Silver Spoon\". CD 1 contains Side A and B, and CD 2 contains Side C and D.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, BGO Records released a remastered edition of Flight Log in a standard jewel case with cardboard slip cover. The BGO version is said to be a sonic improvement on the BMG/Sony edition, nonetheless, certain tape defects such as on Silver Spoon still exist.\n\n==Track listing (with artist)==\n{{tracklist\n|

Released in January 1977 as a double-LP as Grunt CYL2-1255, it is a compilation of Jefferson Airplane and Airplane-related tracks, including tracks by [[Jefferson Starship]] and [[Hot Tuna]], as well as solo tracks by [[Paul Kantner]], [[Grace Slick]], and [[Jorma Kaukonen]]. Although primarily a compilation album, the album includes one previously unreleased song: \"Please Come Back\" written by [[Ron Nagle]] and performed by Jefferson Starship.  \"Please Come Back\" is not available on any other release.\n\nAmong the session musicians featured on the album are two members of the [[Grateful Dead]] and one member of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].  David Crosby appears on one track, and [[Jerry Garcia]] plays on three tracks, two of which also feature [[Mickey Hart]].\n\nThe album included a lavish 12-page full-color, full-size (12 sq.in.) booklet, containing photographs of the band throughout the period covered by the compilation. It also contained a detailed history of the band, written by Patrick Snyder of [[Rolling Stone]] magazine.\n\n''Flight Log'' was first reissued on CD by BMG Japan on October 22, 2008 as a part of the \"Paper Sleeve Collection\" reissue series (BVCM-35468-9). The release features an exact reproduction of the Grunt 1977 edition of the LP packaging including a reduced scale reproduction of the original booklet and inner sleeve jackets for the CDs.  Also included is a second booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The only omission by BMG Japan was not reproducing the original GRUNT label on the CDs. The audio quality is as good as the original master tapes available for the Japanese LP pressing and features JVC K2 24 Bit Remastering. However, it sounds as if the master tapes had been damaged on at least three songs, and significantly obvious on the introduction of \"Silver Spoon\". CD 1 contains Side A and B, and CD 2 contains Side C and D.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, BGO Records released a remastered edition of Flight Log in a standard jewel case with cardboard slip cover. The BGO version is said to be a sonic improvement on the BMG/Sony edition, nonetheless, certain tape defects such as on Silver Spoon still exist.\n\n==Track listing (with artist)==\n{{tracklist\n|

The heroic Yatterman duo make their entrance with Yatterwoof (Yamadera, voice), a sentient dog-shaped [[mecha]] and Toybotty (Takahashi, voice), their robot sidekick. After a series of slapstick combat scenes, the Doronbo trio flee back to their mecha to defeat Yatterwan. Cheering at their first victory, the villains accidentally hit the mecha's self-destruct button. When the chaos clears, a teenage girl emerges from the ruins with a blue object in her hands.\n\nThe Narrator (Yamadera) explains Gan Takada (a.k.a. Yatterman #1, Sakurai) and his girlfriend, Ai Kaminari (a.k.a. Yatterman #2, Fukuda), live a double life as crime-fighting heroes. They are based under Takada Toys, founded by Gan's father. Gan built Toybotty and Yatterwoof, the latter an abandoned plan from his father. The girl they found in the ruins was Shoko Kaieda (Okamoto), daughter of Dr. Kaieda (Abu), an [[archaeologist]]. The piece of blue stone Shoko carries is a part of the Skull Stone, a legendary object now split into four pieces. Dr Kaieda, who is on a quest to find them, is attacked in the forest of Narway by Skullobey (Takeguchi), a black-clad being with an oversized skull.\n\nThe Doronbo Trio is then introduced. The gang includes Doronjo, the sexy female boss; Boyacky (Namase), the clever but lecherous mecha genius; and Tonzra, the gluttonous, [[kansai-ben]]-speaking strongman. Skullobey sends them orders to find the Skull Stone pieces, and will punish them should they fail. The trio open a wedding store called \"Doro Merry\" to raise money to build a new mecha: the {{nihongo|Bridesmaidiot|\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc|B\u0101jin R\u014dd\u0101|Virgin Roader}}, a very feminine-looking construction. A robot skull arrives to deliver Skullobey's message: another Stone is in Ogypt, and the Doronbo trio must find it without losing Shoko. The skull self-destructs. Unknown to the trio, Toybotty witnesses everything and reports back to Gan and Ai. The duo transform into Yatterman and set off for Ogypt. When the group discover the missing piece, the villains arrive on the scene. They again use their mecha to damage Yatterwoof. After consuming a Mechanade thrown by Gan, the dog robot releases a swarm of ant robots which destroy the Bridesmaidiot, dragging Yatterwoof with it.\n\nBack home, Gan tries to rebuild Yatterwoof while Ai, jealous of Shoko and Doronjo goes out for a walk. The trio receive another message that another piece of the Stone is in the Southern Halps. It is then revealed that Skullobey wants Doronjo for himself. Meanwhile, things around the world start to disappear, and before he can tell the truth behind the Skull Stone pieces, Toybotty, who has been analyzing the Stone, disappears, as well.  Ai discovers another scam by the villains, involving a sushi restaurant, to raise money for their new robot, a giant squid. She also overhears that the last piece is hidden in the Southern Halps. The Doronbo trio then set out in a Squid mecha.\n\nUpon returning to base, Gan reads the analysis made by Toybotty before it disappeared: the Skull pieces, put back together, will destroy the flow of time itself, causing the disappearance of all things. The only way to stop this is to destroy the Stone when the pieces are reunited. The Yatterman duo set out with Shoko riding Yatterking, an upgraded Yatterwoof. The trio find the final piece. When the heroes arrive, Skullobey encases them in a giant dome filled with [[clockworks]]. Doronjo zaps Ai to force the Yatterman duo apart, only to finally discover the true love between Gan and Ai.\n\nShoko realizes Skullobey has possessed her father and due to her pleas, Dr. Kaieda is able to free himself from Skullobey and reveal his true form.

The heroic Yatterman duo make their entrance with Yatterwoof (Yamadera, voice), a sentient dog-shaped [[mecha]] and Toybotty (Takahashi, voice), their robot sidekick. After a series of slapstick combat scenes, the Doronbo trio flee back to their mecha to defeat Yatterwan. Cheering at their first victory, the villains accidentally hit the mecha's self-destruct button. When the chaos clears, a teenage girl emerges from the ruins with a blue object in her hands.\n\nThe Narrator (Yamadera) explains Gan Takada (a.k.a. Yatterman #1, Sakurai) and his girlfriend, Ai Kaminari (a.k.a. Yatterman #2, Fukuda), live a double life as crime-fighting heroes. They are based under Takada Toys, founded by Gan's father. Gan built Toybotty and Yatterwoof, the latter an abandoned plan from his father. The girl they found in the ruins was Shoko Kaieda (Okamoto), daughter of Dr. Kaieda (Abu), an [[archaeologist]]. The piece of blue stone Shoko carries is a part of the Skull Stone, a legendary object now split into four pieces. Dr Kaieda, who is on a quest to find them, is attacked in the forest of Narway by Skullobey (Takeguchi), a black-clad being with an oversized skull.\n\nThe Doronbo Trio is then introduced. The gang includes Doronjo, the sexy female boss; Boyacky (Namase), the clever but lecherous mecha genius; and Tonzra, the gluttonous, [[kansai-ben]]-speaking strongman. Skullobey sends them orders to find the Skull Stone pieces, and will punish them should they fail. The trio open a wedding store called \"Doro Merry\" to raise money to build a new mecha: the {{nihongo|Bridesmaidiot|\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc|B\u0101jin R\u014dd\u0101|Virgin Roader}}, a very feminine-looking construction. A robot skull arrives to deliver Skullobey's message: another Stone is in Ogypt, and the Doronbo trio must find it without losing Shoko. The skull self-destructs. Unknown to the trio, Toybotty witnesses everything and reports back to Gan and Ai. The duo transform into Yatterman and set off for Ogypt. When the group discover the missing piece, the villains arrive on the scene. They again use their mecha to damage Yatterwoof. After consuming a Mechanade thrown by Gan, the dog robot releases a swarm of ant robots which destroy the Bridesmaidiot, dragging Yatterwoof with it.\n\nBack home, Gan tries to rebuild Yatterwoof while Ai, jealous of Shoko and Doronjo goes out for a walk. The trio receive another message that another piece of the Stone is in the Southern Halps. It is then revealed that Skullobey wants Doronjo for himself. Meanwhile, things around the world start to disappear, and before he can tell the truth behind the Skull Stone pieces, Toybotty, who has been analyzing the Stone, disappears, as well.  Ai discovers another scam by the villains, involving a sushi restaurant, to raise money for their new robot, a giant squid. She also overhears that the last piece is hidden in the Southern Halps. The Doronbo trio then set out in a Squid mecha.\n\nUpon returning to base, Gan reads the analysis made by Toybotty before it disappeared: the Skull pieces, put back together, will destroy the flow of time itself, causing the disappearance of all things. The only way to stop this is to destroy the Stone when the pieces are reunited. The Yatterman duo set out with Shoko riding Yatterking, an upgraded Yatterwoof. The trio find the final piece. When the heroes arrive, Skullobey encases them in a giant dome filled with [[clockworks]]. Doronjo zaps Ai to force the Yatterman duo apart, only to finally discover the true love between Gan and Ai.\n\nShoko realizes Skullobey has possessed her father and due to her pleas, Dr. Kaieda is able to free himself from Skullobey and reveal his true form. Fighting as a unit again, Yatterman #1 and #2 team up with a reformed Doronbo Gang defeat Skullobey to trap him in the other world. Later, Gan and Ai bid Shoko and her father farewell, who leave to explore the world some more while the Doronbo Gang goes their separate ways.

Metro Denver Greens</ref> She lives in Oakland, California.\n\n==Early life==\n\nElaine Brown grew up in the inner city of North Philadelphia with her mother Dorothy Clark and an absent father. Despite desperate poverty, Brown\u2019s mother worked hard to provide for Elaine\u2019s private schooling, music lessons, and nice clothing. During her childhood, she studied classical piano and ballet for many years at a predominantly white experimental elementary school. As a young woman, Elaine had very few African-American friends and instead spent most of her time with her white friends. After graduating from [[Philadelphia High School for Girls]], a public preparatory school for gifted young women, she studied at [[Temple University]] for less than a semester. After withdrawing from Temple, Brown moved to Los Angeles, California, to try being a professional songwriter.\nWhile in Los Angeles, Brown enrolled in the [[University of California Los Angeles]] in September 1968. She later went on to briefly attend [[Mills College]] and Southwestern University School of Law.<ref>Brown, Elaine. ''A Taste of Power: A Black Woman\u2019s Story'' (New York: Doubleday, 1992), pp. 70-72.</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in California with little money and few contacts, Brown got work as a cocktail waitress at the strip club The Pink Pussycat. While working at the Pink Pussycat she met [[Jay Richard Kennedy]], a married white fiction writer, and the two became lovers. Kennedy was the first person to politicize and radicalize Brown. Because of the thorough education on the Civil Rights Movement, Capitalism, and Communism, that Kennedy provided to her, Brown became involved with the Black Liberation Movement. After living together for a brief time in the Hollywood Hills Hotel, the pair parted ways.<ref>Brown, Elaine. ''A Taste of Power: A Black Woman\u2019s Story'' (New York: Doubleday, 1992).</ref> After this pivotal relationship, Brown's involvement in politics grew and she began working for the radical newspaper ''[[Harambee (African-American newspaper)|Harambee]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Scot | year = 2001 | title = The US Organization, Black Power Vanguard Politics, And The United Front Ideal: Los Angeles And Beyond | url = | journal = Black Scholar | volume = 31 | issue = 3/4| page = 21 | doi=10.1080/00064246.2001.11431153}}</ref> Soon after, Brown became the first representative of the Black Student Alliance to the Black Congress in California. In April 1968, after the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Junior]], she attended her first meeting of the Los Angeles chapter of the [[Black Panther Party]].<ref name=\"blackpast1943\">{{cite web |url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aaw/brown-elaine-1943 |title=Brown, Elaine (1943- ) &#124; The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |publisher=The Black Past |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>\n\n==Involvement with the Black Panther Party==\n\nIn 1968, Brown joined the [[Black Panther Party]] as a rank-and-file member, studying revolutionary literature, selling [[Black Panther Party]] newspapers, and cleaning guns, among other tasks. She soon helped the Party set up its first Free Breakfast for Children program in Los Angeles, as well as the Party\u2019s initial Free Busing to Prisons Program and Free Legal Aid Program.<ref name=\"elainebrown.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elainebrown.org/ElaineBio.htm |title=More About Elaine |publisher=Elaine Brown |accessdate=2010-08-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128085324/http://elainebrown.org/ElaineBio.htm |archivedate=2010-11-28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Brown was commissioned by [[David Hilliard]], the Party chief of staff, to record her songs, a request resulting in the album ''Seize the Time''. She eventually assumed the role of editor of the Black Panther publication in the Southern California Branch of the Party. In 1971, Brown became a member of the Party's Central Committee as Minister of Information, replacing the expelled [[Eldridge Cleaver]]. In 1973, Brown was commissioned to record more songs by national party founder and Minister of Defense [[Huey P. Newton]]. These songs resulted in the album ''Until We're Free''.\n\nAs part of a directive by [[Black Panther Party]] leader Huey Newton, Brown unsuccessfully ran for the [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] city council in 1973, getting 30 percent of the vote. She ran again in 1975, losing again with 44 percent of the vote.<ref name=\"blackpast1943\"/>\n\nWhen Newton fled to [[Cuba]] in 1974 in the face of murder charges, he appointed Brown to lead the Party. The only woman to do so, Elaine Brown chaired the [[Black Panther Party]] from 1974 until 1977. In her 1992 memoir ''[[A Taste of Power]]'', she wrote about the experience:\n\n\"A woman in the [[Black Power]] movement was considered, at best, irrelevant. A woman asserting herself was a pariah. If a black woman assumed a role of leadership, she was said to be eroding black manhood, to be hindering the progress of the black race. She was an enemy of the black people....<ref>Spencer, Robyn C. \"ENGENDERING THE BLACK FREEDOM STRUGGLE: Revolutionary Black Womanhood and the Black Panther Party in the Bay Area, California.\" Journal of Women's History, vol. 20, no. 1, 2008, pp. 90-113.</ref> I knew I would have to muster something mighty to manage the [[Black Panther Party]].<ref>Brown, Elaine.

In 1977, she managed [[Lionel Wilson (politician)|Lionel Wilson]]\u2019s victorious campaign to become Oakland\u2019s first black mayor.<ref name=\"elainebrown.org\"/> Also, Brown developed the Panther's Liberation School, which was recognized by the state of California as a model school.<ref>https://thetransmetropolitanreview.wordpress.com/2019/03/02/a-complete-idiots-guide-to-u-s-and-russian-meddling/</ref>\n\nBrown stepped down from chairing the Black Panther Party less than a year after Newton\u2019s return from Cuba in 1977 when Newton authorized the beating of [[Regina Davis]], an administrator of the Panther Liberation School, because she reprimanded a coworker when he did not do an assignment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://socialism.com/drupal-6.8/?q=node/2291|title=Voices of Color\u2014Invisible Women: Sexism in the Black Panther Party - www.socialism.com|publisher=}}</ref>  This incident was the point at which Brown could no longer tolerate the [[sexism]] and [[patriarchy]] of the [[Black Panther Party]].<ref>Brown, Elaine.

She eventually returned to the struggle for black liberation, especially espousing the need for radical prison reform. From 1980 to 1983 she attended [[Southwestern University School of Law]] in Los Angeles.\nFrom 1990 to 1996, she lived in [[France]].<ref>[http://www.seizethetime.com/elainebrown.htm \"Seize the Time: Elaine Brown.\"] Seize the Time: Women in Power Seminars.</ref> In 1996, Brown moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and founded Fields of Flowers, Inc., a non-profit organization committed to providing educational opportunities for [[impoverished African-American]] children. In 1998, she co-founded the grassroots group Mothers Advocating Juvenile Justice to advocate for children being prosecuted as adults in the state of Georgia. Around the same time, she continued her advocacy for incarcerated youth by founding and leading the Michael Lewis Legal Defense Committee. Michael Lewis, also known as \u201cLittle B,\u201d was sentenced to life in prison at the age of 14 for a murder that Brown believes he did not commit. Brown would eventually write a [[non-fiction novel]], ''The Condemnation of Little B'', that analyzes the prosecution of Lewis as part of the greater problem of the increased imprisonment of black youth.<ref>\"The Condemnation of Little B.\" Fleming, Robert, ''[[Black Issues Book Review]]'', 15220524, May/Jun2002, Vol. 4, Issue 3.</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Brown co-founded the National Alliance for Radical Prison Reform, which helps thousands of prisoners find housing after they are released on parole, facilitates transportation for family visits to prisons, helps prisoners find employment, and raises money for prisoner phone calls and gifts.<ref name=\"elainebrown.org\"/>   \nIn 2005, while protesting a [[G-8 Summit]] in [[Sea Island, Georgia]], Brown learned of the massive poverty in the nearby city of [[Brunswick, Georgia]]. Brown then attempted to run for mayor of Brunswick against [[Bryan Thompson (politician)|Bryan Thompson]]. Running on the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] ticket, Brown hoped to become mayor in order to use her influence to bring the Michael Lewis case to prominence, as well as to empower blacks in Brunswick by using her elected office to create a base of economic power for the city's majority black and poor population through redistribution of the city's revenues. Though Brown was eventually disqualified from running and voting in Brunswick because she failed to establish residency in the city, her efforts brought widespread attention to Michael Lewis\u2019s case. She later became a co-founder of the Brunswick Women's Association for a People's Blueprint.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elainebrown.org/MayoralRaceBrunswick.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128085759/http://elainebrown.org/MayoralRaceBrunswick.htm |archivedate=2010-11-28 }}</ref>\n\nBrown has continued her prison reform advocacy by lecturing frequently at colleges and universities in the US.

Brown felt that a campaign was necessary to promote the interests of those not represented by the major political parties, especially the interests of women under 30 and African Americans. Her platform focused on the needs of working-class families, promoting living wages for all, free health care, more funding for public education, more affordable housing, removal of troops from Iraq, improving the environment, and promoting equality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://panafricannews.blogspot.com/2007/03/former-panther-leader-elaine-brown.html |title=Pan-African News Wire: Former Panther Leader Elaine Brown Seeks Green Party Presidential Nomination For 2008 |publisher=Panafricannews.blogspot.com |date=2007-03-09 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref> Brown intended on using her campaign to bring many minorities to the Green Party in the hope that it would better represent a revolutionary force for social justice.

Metro Denver Greens</ref> She lives in Oakland, California.\n\n==Early life==\n\nElaine Brown grew up in the inner city of North Philadelphia with her mother Dorothy Clark and an absent father. Despite desperate poverty, Brown\u2019s mother worked hard to provide for Elaine\u2019s private schooling, music lessons, and nice clothing. During her childhood, she studied classical piano and ballet for many years at a predominantly white experimental elementary school. As a young woman, Elaine had very few African-American friends and instead spent most of her time with her white friends. After graduating from [[Philadelphia High School for Girls]], a public preparatory school for gifted young women, she studied at [[Temple University]] for less than a semester. After withdrawing from Temple, Brown moved to Los Angeles, California, to try being a professional songwriter.\nWhile in Los Angeles, Brown enrolled in the [[University of California Los Angeles]] in September 1968. She later went on to briefly attend [[Mills College]] and Southwestern University School of Law.<ref>Brown, Elaine. ''A Taste of Power: A Black Woman\u2019s Story'' (New York: Doubleday, 1992), pp. 70-72.</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in California with little money and few contacts, Brown got work as a cocktail waitress at the strip club The Pink Pussycat. While working at the Pink Pussycat she met [[Jay Richard Kennedy]], a married white fiction writer, and the two became lovers. Kennedy was the first person to politicize and radicalize Brown. Because of the thorough education on the Civil Rights Movement, Capitalism, and Communism, that Kennedy provided to her, Brown became involved with the Black Liberation Movement. After living together for a brief time in the Hollywood Hills Hotel, the pair parted ways.<ref>Brown, Elaine. ''A Taste of Power: A Black Woman\u2019s Story'' (New York: Doubleday, 1992).</ref> After this pivotal relationship, Brown's involvement in politics grew and she began working for the radical newspaper ''[[Harambee (African-American newspaper)|Harambee]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Scot | year = 2001 | title = The US Organization, Black Power Vanguard Politics, And The United Front Ideal: Los Angeles And Beyond | url = | journal = Black Scholar | volume = 31 | issue = 3/4| page = 21 | doi=10.1080/00064246.2001.11431153}}</ref> Soon after, Brown became the first representative of the Black Student Alliance to the Black Congress in California. In April 1968, after the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Junior]], she attended her first meeting of the Los Angeles chapter of the [[Black Panther Party]].<ref name=\"blackpast1943\">{{cite web |url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aaw/brown-elaine-1943 |title=Brown, Elaine (1943- ) &#124; The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |publisher=The Black Past |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>\n\n==Involvement with the Black Panther Party==\n\nIn 1968, Brown joined the [[Black Panther Party]] as a rank-and-file member, studying revolutionary literature, selling [[Black Panther Party]] newspapers, and cleaning guns, among other tasks. She soon helped the Party set up its first Free Breakfast for Children program in Los Angeles, as well as the Party\u2019s initial Free Busing to Prisons Program and Free Legal Aid Program.<ref name=\"elainebrown.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elainebrown.org/ElaineBio.htm |title=More About Elaine |publisher=Elaine Brown |accessdate=2010-08-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128085324/http://elainebrown.org/ElaineBio.htm |archivedate=2010-11-28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Brown was commissioned by [[David Hilliard]], the Party chief of staff, to record her songs, a request resulting in the album ''Seize the Time''. She eventually assumed the role of editor of the Black Panther publication in the Southern California Branch of the Party. In 1971, Brown became a member of the Party's Central Committee as Minister of Information, replacing the expelled [[Eldridge Cleaver]]. In 1973, Brown was commissioned to record more songs by national party founder and Minister of Defense [[Huey P. Newton]]. These songs resulted in the album ''Until We're Free''.\n\nAs part of a directive by [[Black Panther Party]] leader Huey Newton, Brown unsuccessfully ran for the [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] city council in 1973, getting 30 percent of the vote. She ran again in 1975, losing again with 44 percent of the vote.<ref name=\"blackpast1943\"/>\n\nWhen Newton fled to [[Cuba]] in 1974 in the face of murder charges, he appointed Brown to lead the Party. The only woman to do so, Elaine Brown chaired the [[Black Panther Party]] from 1974 until 1977. In her 1992 memoir ''[[A Taste of Power]]'', she wrote about the experience:\n\n\"A woman in the [[Black Power]] movement was considered, at best, irrelevant. A woman asserting herself was a pariah. If a black woman assumed a role of leadership, she was said to be eroding black manhood, to be hindering the progress of the black race. She was an enemy of the black people....<ref>Spencer, Robyn C. \"ENGENDERING THE BLACK FREEDOM STRUGGLE: Revolutionary Black Womanhood and the Black Panther Party in the Bay Area, California.\" Journal of Women's History, vol. 20, no. 1, 2008, pp. 90-113.</ref> I knew I would have to muster something mighty to manage the [[Black Panther Party]].<ref>Brown, Elaine. ''A Taste of Power: A Black Woman\u2019s Story'' (New York: Doubleday, 1992), p.&nbsp;357\n</ref>\n\nDuring Brown's leadership of the Black Panther Party, she focused on electoral politics and community service. In 1977, she managed [[Lionel Wilson (politician)|Lionel Wilson]]\u2019s victorious campaign to become Oakland\u2019s first black mayor.<ref name=\"elainebrown.org\"/> Also, Brown developed the Panther's Liberation School, which was recognized by the state of California as a model school.<ref>https://thetransmetropolitanreview.wordpress.com/2019/03/02/a-complete-idiots-guide-to-u-s-and-russian-meddling/</ref>\n\nBrown stepped down from chairing the Black Panther Party less than a year after Newton\u2019s return from Cuba in 1977 when Newton authorized the beating of [[Regina Davis]], an administrator of the Panther Liberation School, because she reprimanded a coworker when he did not do an assignment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://socialism.com/drupal-6.8/?q=node/2291|title=Voices of Color\u2014Invisible Women: Sexism in the Black Panther Party - www.socialism.com|publisher=}}</ref>  This incident was the point at which Brown could no longer tolerate the [[sexism]] and [[patriarchy]] of the [[Black Panther Party]].<ref>Brown, Elaine.

She eventually returned to the struggle for black liberation, especially espousing the need for radical prison reform. From 1980 to 1983 she attended [[Southwestern University School of Law]] in Los Angeles.\nFrom 1990 to 1996, she lived in [[France]].<ref>[http://www.seizethetime.com/elainebrown.htm \"Seize the Time: Elaine Brown.\"] Seize the Time: Women in Power Seminars.</ref> In 1996, Brown moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and founded Fields of Flowers, Inc., a non-profit organization committed to providing educational opportunities for [[impoverished African-American]] children. In 1998, she co-founded the grassroots group Mothers Advocating Juvenile Justice to advocate for children being prosecuted as adults in the state of Georgia. Around the same time, she continued her advocacy for incarcerated youth by founding and leading the Michael Lewis Legal Defense Committee. Michael Lewis, also known as \u201cLittle B,\u201d was sentenced to life in prison at the age of 14 for a murder that Brown believes he did not commit. Brown would eventually write a [[non-fiction novel]], ''The Condemnation of Little B'', that analyzes the prosecution of Lewis as part of the greater problem of the increased imprisonment of black youth.<ref>\"The Condemnation of Little B.\" Fleming, Robert, ''[[Black Issues Book Review]]'', 15220524, May/Jun2002, Vol. 4, Issue 3.</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Brown co-founded the National Alliance for Radical Prison Reform, which helps thousands of prisoners find housing after they are released on parole, facilitates transportation for family visits to prisons, helps prisoners find employment, and raises money for prisoner phone calls and gifts.<ref name=\"elainebrown.org\"/>   \nIn 2005, while protesting a [[G-8 Summit]] in [[Sea Island, Georgia]], Brown learned of the massive poverty in the nearby city of [[Brunswick, Georgia]]. Brown then attempted to run for mayor of Brunswick against [[Bryan Thompson (politician)|Bryan Thompson]]. Running on the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] ticket, Brown hoped to become mayor in order to use her influence to bring the Michael Lewis case to prominence, as well as to empower blacks in Brunswick by using her elected office to create a base of economic power for the city's majority black and poor population through redistribution of the city's revenues. Though Brown was eventually disqualified from running and voting in Brunswick because she failed to establish residency in the city, her efforts brought widespread attention to Michael Lewis\u2019s case. She later became a co-founder of the Brunswick Women's Association for a People's Blueprint.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elainebrown.org/MayoralRaceBrunswick.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128085759/http://elainebrown.org/MayoralRaceBrunswick.htm |archivedate=2010-11-28 }}</ref>\n\nBrown has continued her prison reform advocacy by lecturing frequently at colleges and universities in the US. From 1995 to the present, she has lectured at more than forty colleges and universities, as well as numerous conferences.<ref name=\"elainebrown.org\"/>\n\n==2007 Green Party role ==\nIn March 2007, Brown announced her bid to be the 2008 Green Party presidential nominee. Brown felt that a campaign was necessary to promote the interests of those not represented by the major political parties, especially the interests of women under 30 and African Americans. Her platform focused on the needs of working-class families, promoting living wages for all, free health care, more funding for public education, more affordable housing, removal of troops from Iraq, improving the environment, and promoting equality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://panafricannews.blogspot.com/2007/03/former-panther-leader-elaine-brown.html |title=Pan-African News Wire: Former Panther Leader Elaine Brown Seeks Green Party Presidential Nomination For 2008 |publisher=Panafricannews.blogspot.com |date=2007-03-09 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref> Brown intended on using her campaign to bring many minorities to the Green Party in the hope that it would better represent a revolutionary force for social justice.

Going up step by step in the hierarchy, he finished there his career in 1945, as a senior foreman.\n\nHis first works in [[philately]] are, in 1919, the drawing of the famous series \u201cHelmeted King\u201d and, in 1922, the engraving of King [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]]\u2019s effigy (\u201cHouyoux\u201d type).\n\nIn 1926, the Belgian sovereigns realized the artist\u2019s value, following the issue of a stamp for the benefit of the fight against [[tuberculosis]]. In accordance with the wish of the King, a competition was organized between four [[Prix de Rome]] and De Bast, who was the winner. From that time onwards, the direction of the Postal Services stopped to appeal to foreign artists, and De Bast became its appointed engraver.\n\nWhile keeping his office at the Postage Stamps Printing-house, De Bast worked then as a free engraver, realizing works of very high quality.\n\nIn 1952, he had a disagreement with the direction of the Postal Services, which had retouched without his agreement the original matrix of a stamp bearing the effigy of King [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Baudouin]]. The stamp so issued was so mediocre that it received a bad appreciation from the press and was rapidly withdrawn from sale.\n\nBeing in bad terms with the [[Mail|Postal Service]], De Bast waited for several years before being entrusted again with stamp engraving. He put an end to his engraver\u2019s career in 1967, at the age of 84. In 1964 and 1965, two of his stamps received a golden medal in Paris: \u201cInfant Christ with John the Baptist and two angels\u201d (after [[Peter Paul Rubens]]) and \u201cThe daughters of the painter Cornelis De Vos\u201d.\n\nOn the whole, between 1926 and 1967, he engraved more than one hundred postage stamps, ten or a dozen stamps for the [[Rail transport|Railways]], and 5 fiscal stamps for the Ministry of Finance.\n\nThis master engraver, who, by his exceptional expertise, raised his work to the level of Art, obtained numerous distinctions both for his work and his behaviour as a patriot during the war. Ten years after his death, on the occasion of the \u201cJourn\u00e9e du timbre\u201d (Stamp\u2019s day), the Postal Service paid homage to him by issuing a stamp showing him at work.\n\n==Works==\nAll those stamps have been printed by [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] (also called copperplate printing).

Going up step by step in the hierarchy, he finished there his career in 1945, as a senior foreman.\n\nHis first works in [[philately]] are, in 1919, the drawing of the famous series \u201cHelmeted King\u201d and, in 1922, the engraving of King [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]]\u2019s effigy (\u201cHouyoux\u201d type).\n\nIn 1926, the Belgian sovereigns realized the artist\u2019s value, following the issue of a stamp for the benefit of the fight against [[tuberculosis]]. In accordance with the wish of the King, a competition was organized between four [[Prix de Rome]] and De Bast, who was the winner. From that time onwards, the direction of the Postal Services stopped to appeal to foreign artists, and De Bast became its appointed engraver.\n\nWhile keeping his office at the Postage Stamps Printing-house, De Bast worked then as a free engraver, realizing works of very high quality.\n\nIn 1952, he had a disagreement with the direction of the Postal Services, which had retouched without his agreement the original matrix of a stamp bearing the effigy of King [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Baudouin]]. The stamp so issued was so mediocre that it received a bad appreciation from the press and was rapidly withdrawn from sale.\n\nBeing in bad terms with the [[Mail|Postal Service]], De Bast waited for several years before being entrusted again with stamp engraving. He put an end to his engraver\u2019s career in 1967, at the age of 84. In 1964 and 1965, two of his stamps received a golden medal in Paris: \u201cInfant Christ with John the Baptist and two angels\u201d (after [[Peter Paul Rubens]]) and \u201cThe daughters of the painter Cornelis De Vos\u201d.\n\nOn the whole, between 1926 and 1967, he engraved more than one hundred postage stamps, ten or a dozen stamps for the [[Rail transport|Railways]], and 5 fiscal stamps for the Ministry of Finance.\n\nThis master engraver, who, by his exceptional expertise, raised his work to the level of Art, obtained numerous distinctions both for his work and his behaviour as a patriot during the war. Ten years after his death, on the occasion of the \u201cJourn\u00e9e du timbre\u201d (Stamp\u2019s day), the Postal Service paid homage to him by issuing a stamp showing him at work.\n\n==Works==\nAll those stamps have been printed by [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] (also called copperplate printing). Since 1959, some of them have been printed by combination of intaglio and [[rotogravure]] (also called heliography, screen printing or photogravure).\n\n===Belgian postage stamps===\n* \"Antituberculeux\" (fight against [[tuberculosis]]), 6 December 1926: lion and [[Cross of Lorraine]] printed in [[typography]].

''Inuyashiki'' debuted in the January 2014 issue of [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Seinen manga|seinen]]'' manga magazine, ''[[Evening (magazine)|Evening]]'' and ended in July 2017. Ten compilation volumes have been published.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation produced by [[MAPPA (studio)|MAPPA]] aired on [[Fuji TV]]'s late night programming block [[Noitamina]] from October to December 2017. A [[Inuyashiki (film)|live-action film adaptation]] premiered in Japan in April 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nInuyashiki Ichiro is an older, friendless man with an uncaring family. One fateful evening in a nearly empty public park, he is struck by an explosion of extraterrestrial origin, and his body is replaced by an incredibly powerful, but still outwardly human, mechanical body. He quickly realizes the extent of his body's powers, and after saving a homeless man being beaten by a pack of teenagers, he decides to dedicate himself to doing good, using his powers to heal those with incurable diseases and fight crime.\n\nHowever, a teenager who was with him at the time of the explosion, Shishigami Hiro, had the same fate as Ichiro, but unlike Inuyashiki, Shishigami becomes a psychopath who goes about using his newfound abilities to murder various people, from classmates that annoy him to innocent families, including young children, just for amusement. His acts of merciless cruelty bring him the attention of the police, who can do nothing to stop him. Hiro becomes the most wanted criminal in the country.\n\nThe series follows these two different individuals who once shared the same bizarre experience, as their paths are destined to clash.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Ichir\u014d Inuyashiki|\u72ac\u5c4b\u6577 \u58f1\u90ce|Inuyashiki Ichir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fumiyo Kohinata]]<ref name=\"Main-Cast\">{{cite web|title=Inuyashiki Anime's Promo Video Reveals Cast, Man With a Mission Theme Song|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-08-24/inuyashiki-anime-promo-video-reveals-cast-man-with-a-mission-theme-song/.120512|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=August 24, 2017|date=August 24, 2017}}</ref>}}\n:Played by: [[Noritake Kinashi]]\n:The head of the Inuyashiki family who looks older than his age, being 58 years old.

His standard method of killing someone is making a [[finger gun]] and saying 'Bang!', which has the same effect as shooting someone with an actual gun. This will work on anyone who witnesses it, even if played on a television screen. He can also imitate a machine gun by shouting \"da-da-da\" while pretending to hold one, which will have the same effect. This is an ability he shares with Ichir\u014d.\n;{{Nihongo|Naoyuki And\u014d|\u5b89\u5802 \u76f4\u884c|And\u014d Naoyuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kanata Hong\u014d]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-09-01/inuyashiki-anime-adds-kanata-hongou-to-cast/.120811|title=Inuyashiki Anime Adds Kanata Hongou to Cast|website=Anime News Network|date=September 1, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref>}}\n:Played by: [[Kanata Hong\u014d]]\n:Hiro's childhood friend who initially shut himself in at home after being bullied at school.

One fateful evening in a nearly empty public park, he is struck by an explosion of extraterrestrial origin, and his body is replaced by an incredibly powerful, but still outwardly human, mechanical body. He quickly realizes the extent of his body's powers, and after saving a homeless man being beaten by a pack of teenagers, he decides to dedicate himself to doing good, using his powers to heal those with incurable diseases and fight crime.\n\nHowever, a teenager who was with him at the time of the explosion, Shishigami Hiro, had the same fate as Ichiro, but unlike Inuyashiki, Shishigami becomes a psychopath who goes about using his newfound abilities to murder various people, from classmates that annoy him to innocent families, including young children, just for amusement. His acts of merciless cruelty bring him the attention of the police, who can do nothing to stop him. Hiro becomes the most wanted criminal in the country.\n\nThe series follows these two different individuals who once shared the same bizarre experience, as their paths are destined to clash.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Ichir\u014d Inuyashiki|\u72ac\u5c4b\u6577 \u58f1\u90ce|Inuyashiki Ichir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fumiyo Kohinata]]<ref name=\"Main-Cast\">{{cite web|title=Inuyashiki Anime's Promo Video Reveals Cast, Man With a Mission Theme Song|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-08-24/inuyashiki-anime-promo-video-reveals-cast-man-with-a-mission-theme-song/.120512|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=August 24, 2017|date=August 24, 2017}}</ref>}}\n:Played by: [[Noritake Kinashi]]\n:The head of the Inuyashiki family who looks older than his age, being 58 years old.

When he takes his wife and children to their new modest home, the children are unimpressed. After a visit to the doctor where he is diagnosed with stomach cancer and given 3 months to live, he is unable to tell his self-absorbed family. One evening, while walking his dog in a park on a hill, he breaks down and cries. Suddenly he and a youth standing nearby are struck by a mysterious explosion apparently of extraterrestrial origin. His body is replaced by an incredibly powerful, but still outwardly human, mechanical body. He realizes some of his body's powers after saving a homeless man being beaten by a pack of teenagers. The electronics within his body also manage to identify and expose the teenagers. He then realizes that even though his body is now an [[electromechanical]] [[cyborg]], he still thinks and feels like a human.\n| LineColor           = 4B0082\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Hiro Shishigami\n| TranslitTitle       = Shishigami Hiro\n| NativeTitle         = \u7345\u5b50\u795e\u7693\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Hirokazu Yamada\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = Student Hiro Shishigami remarks that one of his friends, Naoyuki Andou,&nbsp;has been absent from school and goes to visit him.

Naoyuki is impressed until Hiro causes cars to start crashing in the street and realizes they are not just tricks. Hiro reveals his cyborg body and convinces Naoyuki to return to school, calmly offering to kill the student who beat him up. Naoyuki however is fearful about Hiro's mental state and powers. After leaving, Hiro picks a house at random and casually kills the occupants by shooting an invisible beam while making a [[finger gun]] gesture. He remarks that he feels 'alive'. When the daughter comes home, he threatens to kill her, and Inuyashiki hears her screams of fear. He drives, following the voice he hears in his head, until, while stopped in traffic, hears her die. He finally arrives at the house, finding the bodies, but is confronted by Hiro who shoots him in the head.

He then hears the voices of people trapped in a building on fire, and tries to invoke the flying mechanism he saw Hiro use. Desperately trying he sings the [[Astro Boy]] theme song and takes off but has difficulty controlling the jets. He eventually reaches the scene, rescuing those trapped inside. He remarks that he feels 'so happy'. Hiro finally convinces Naoyuki to return to school, but when the bullies threaten him, Hiro intervenes and forces them to back off. Later that afternoon he kills four of the boys at a distance as Naoyuki watches. Hiro describes his many powers, including control over electronic devices, including [[Gaming the system|milking]] an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]. Naoyuki then says he can no longer be friends with someone who kills and steals, and Hiro walks off. That evening Inuyashiki discovers his healing power when he revives a cat that had been run over and thanks God.

Examples of the First Style include the [[House of the Faun]] and the [[House of Sallust]] in Pompeii.  }}\n\n{{term|1= Fourth Style |content= [[Pompeian_Styles#Fourth_Style:_Intricate|Fourth Style]] }}\n{{defn|1= Characterized as a Baroque reaction to the Third Style's mannerism, the Fourth Style in Roman wall painting (c. 60\u201379 AD) , developed as a consequence of the decoration of Nero's [[Domus Aurea]] follwing the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in 64 CE, is generally less ornamented than its predecessor. It revived large-scale narrative painting and panoramic vistas while retaining the architectural details of the Second and First Styles. In the Julio-Claudian phase (c. 20\u201354 CE), a textile-like quality dominates and tendrils seem to connect all the elements on the wall. The colors warm up once again, and they are used to advantage in the depiction of scenes drawn from mythology, landscapes, and other images.  Intricate paintings appeared busier and used the wall in its entirety to be complete.The overall feeling of the walls typically formed a mosaic of framed pictures. The lower zones of these walls tended to be composed of the First Style. Panels were also used with floral designs on the walls. A prime example of the Fourth Style is the Ixion Room in the [[House of the Vettii]] in Pompeii.The House of the Prince of Naples is also an example in a more modest structure.  }}\n\n{{term|1= Fresco |content= [[Fresco]] }}\n{{defn|1= mural painting executed upon freshly laid, or wet lime plaster.  }}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{glossary end}}\n\n==G==\n{{glossary}}\n\n{{term|1= Garum |content= [[Garum]] }}\n{{defn|1= Fermented fish sauce used as a condiment in the cuisines of ancient Greece, Rome, Carthage and later Byzantium  }}\n\n{{term|1= Graffito |content= [[Graffito_(archaeology)|Graffito]] }}\n{{defn|1= Deliberate mark made by scratching or engraving on a large surface such as a wall.

They also added objects that are commonly seen in real life such as vases and shelves along with items that appeared to be sticking out of the wall. The style evolved during the reign of Augustus.

Extremely wealthy Romans inset expensive stone like marble into the walls while the less fortunate had their walls painted to resemble marble. The marble-like look was acquired by the use of stucco moldings, which caused portions of the wall to appear raised. Other simulated elements such as suspended alabaster discs in vertical lines, 'wooden' beams in yellow and 'pillars', 'cornices' in white and the use of vivid color also combined to achieve the effect.

It revived large-scale narrative painting and panoramic vistas while retaining the architectural details of the Second and First Styles. In the Julio-Claudian phase (c. 20\u201354 CE), a textile-like quality dominates and tendrils seem to connect all the elements on the wall. The colors warm up once again, and they are used to advantage in the depiction of scenes drawn from mythology, landscapes, and other images.  Intricate paintings appeared busier and used the wall in its entirety to be complete.The overall feeling of the walls typically formed a mosaic of framed pictures. The lower zones of these walls tended to be composed of the First Style. Panels were also used with floral designs on the walls. A prime example of the Fourth Style is the Ixion Room in the [[House of the Vettii]] in Pompeii.The House of the Prince of Naples is also an example in a more modest structure.  }}\n\n{{term|1= Fresco |content= [[Fresco]] }}\n{{defn|1= mural painting executed upon freshly laid, or wet lime plaster.  }}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{glossary end}}\n\n==G==\n{{glossary}}\n\n{{term|1= Garum |content= [[Garum]] }}\n{{defn|1= Fermented fish sauce used as a condiment in the cuisines of ancient Greece, Rome, Carthage and later Byzantium  }}\n\n{{term|1= Graffito |content= [[Graffito_(archaeology)|Graffito]] }}\n{{defn|1= Deliberate mark made by scratching or engraving on a large surface such as a wall.

Painters wanted to give off the illusion that the viewer was looking through a window at the scenery depicted. They also added objects that are commonly seen in real life such as vases and shelves along with items that appeared to be sticking out of the wall. The style evolved during the reign of Augustus. False architectural elements opened up wide expanses with which to paint artistic compositions.

For most of his career he was a member of the [[New York Knickerbockers]]. He first played for the New York Base Ball Club in 1840 and started his Knickerbockers career five years later, continuing to play for the club into his forties and to take part in inter-squad practice games and matches against opposing teams. Researchers have called Adams the creator of the [[shortstop]] position, which he used to field short throws from [[outfielder]]s. In addition to his playing career, Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw [[Baseball bat|bat]] production; he also occasionally acted as an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]].\n\nFrom 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-[[inning]] games. When the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [[Baseball field#Specifications|bases]] should be {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [[Out (baseball)|outs]]. He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''; by 1993, researcher [[John Thorn]] had written about Adams' role. Other historians have given him credit for helping to develop the sport, and Thorn has called Adams \"first among the Fathers of Baseball\".{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=7}}\n\nA graduate of [[Yale University]] and [[Harvard Medical School]], Adams began working in the medical field in the late 1830s, and practiced in New York City during his time as a member of the Knickerbockers. In 1865, he left medicine and later became a bank president and member of the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|Connecticut legislature]]. He and his wife had five children.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Mont Vernon, New Hampshire|Mont Vernon]], New Hampshire, on November 1, 1814, Adams was the fourth of [[Daniel Adams (physician)|Daniel]] and Nancy Adams' five children.{{sfn|Smith|1907|pp=255\u2013256}} The elder Daniel Adams was a physician and author; he wrote a math textbook that was widely used in the United States in the early- to mid-1800s. After being schooled at [[Kimball Union Academy]] in New Hampshire from 1826 to 1828 and [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], Massachusetts' Mount Pleasant Classical Institution, Adams attended three colleges from 1831 to 1838.

In an 1896 interview in ''[[Sporting News|The Sporting News]]'', Adams said that \"soon after going to New York I began to play base ball just for exercise, with a number of other young medical men.\"{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=6}} Starting in 1840, he was a player with the New York Base Ball Club.<ref name=\"founder\"/> This team had been founded in 1837, eight years earlier than the [[New York Knickerbockers]],{{sfn|Morris, Ryczek, Finkel, Levin & Malatzky|2013|pp=46, 49}} who are credited in several baseball histories as pioneering the modern version of baseball.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=5}} Adams played an early form of the game, but Thorn writes that he \"understood [it] to be baseball, no matter what it was called\".{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Knickerbocker practice.jpg|thumb|upright|The Knickerbockers during a practice session, as depicted by [[Homer Davenport]]. Adams took leadership in pushing other club members to attend practice.|alt=A drawing of several members of the New York Knickerbockers baseball team. One player is holding a baseball bat, while behind him three members are sitting or standing in front of a house.]]\nAdams received an invitation to become a member of the Knickerbockers a month or so after the team's September 23, 1845, creation. He accepted and joined the club along with other men in the medical field; he later said that players from the New York Base Ball Club were behind the formation of the Knickerbockers.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=30\u201331, 36}} Records of the club's practice games indicate that he was a member of the Knickerbockers by November 18, 1845. In an inter-squad game held that day, which was the Knickerbockers' last of the year, Adams scored nine [[Run (baseball)|runs]] for his team as they defeated a side picked by [[William Wheaton|William R. Wheaton]], 51\u201342.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=11}} The club organized its first game against outside opposition in 1846; at a June 5 meeting Adams was selected to a three-man committee whose aim was to set up a game against the New York Base Ball Club. The committee's efforts were successful, and a game was scheduled on June 19.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|pp=12\u201313}} Adams participated in the contest, which the Knickerbockers lost 23\u20131. Batting second in the Knickerbockers' [[Batting order (baseball)|lineup]], he made one [[Out (baseball)|out]] and did not score a run.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=45}}\n\nThe Knickerbockers did not play any known games against other clubs from 1847 to 1850. During these years, the team split its players into two squads, which played against each other twice per week.{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}} According to Adams, he often attempted to compel members of the Knickerbockers to attend the sessions. He was only occasionally successful, and when few Knickerbockers came, they played variants of baseball that required fewer players than regular games.{{sfn|Morris|2008|pp=30\u201331}} Twice in June 1851, the club played against the Washington Base Ball Club, winning by scores of 21\u201311 and 22\u201320. No individual statistics are available for the first game;{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=14}} Adams scored twice for the Knickerbockers in the second. In 1853, Adams played in two games against the Gotham Ball Club, tallying seven runs in a pair of victories.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=226\u2013227}} The two clubs met three times from June to October 1854, and Adams had one run in each game. After splitting the first two contests, their October 26, 1854, game lasted 12 innings before being suspended due to darkness with the score tied 12\u201312; both teams fell short of the 21 runs that were required to win a game under the rules of the time.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=227\u2013228}}{{sfn|Spink|2000|p=56}}\n\nFollowing two November games against the Eagle Base Ball Club that Adams is not known to have participated in, he returned to the Knickerbockers' lineup for a June 1, 1855, game against Gotham and scored three times, although Gotham prevailed, 21\u201312.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=228}}{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=16}} He took part in two other 1855 games against Eagle and Gotham, respectively, scoring five runs total as the Knickerbockers won both contests. Adams competed four times for the club against outside opponents in 1856 as it won once, lost twice, and had one tie; he scored ten times, and records for two games showed that his defensive position was [[shortstop]]. The Knickerbockers had a 2\u20132 win\u2013loss record in competitive games during 1857 that Adams participated in. Playing three times at shortstop and once at [[first base]] defensively, he contributed 12 runs offensively, including a six-run effort in the Knickerbockers' 37\u201323 victory over the Empire club on June 24. In 1858, Adams made four appearances for the Knickerbockers against outside opposition and scored nine runs, but the team went 1\u20133 in the games. He varied his defensive positioning between [[second base]], [[third base]], and shortstop.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=229\u2013233}}\n\n==Playing style==\n[[File:Baseball SS.svg|thumb|right|Adams has been credited as the creator of the shortstop position (highlighted).|alt=A diagram of a baseball field and defensive positions, with shortstop highlighted on the left side of the infield.]]\nAs a player, Adams created the concept of the shortstop position, according to Thorn and [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] researcher Freddy Berowski.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=33}}<ref name=\"invent\">{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Robert |title=The Ridgefield Man Who Helped Invent Baseball |work=The News-Times |date=September 26, 2009 |url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/The-Ridgefield-man-who-helped-invent-baseball-144965.php |accessdate=September 11, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gyHp93A4?url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/The-Ridgefield-man-who-helped-invent-baseball-144965.php |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> In the first five years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra [[outfielder]]s were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield, because of the balls' light weight. Adams' shortstop position, at which he started playing in about 1849 or 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=6}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Robert|title='Doc' Adams Legacy; The Position of Shortstop|work=The News-Times|date=September 26, 2009|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Doc-Adams-legacy-The-position-of-shortstop-144970.php|accessdate=December 2, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603143751/http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Doc-Adams-legacy-The-position-of-shortstop-144970.php|archivedate=June 3, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams moved toward the infield, since the distance the balls could travel increased.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=33}} Prior to the invention of the shortstop, large gaps existed in the defensive positioning of infields; defensive players tended to stand by bases, leaving empty space in between them for batters. The shortstop filled one of the two gaps.{{sfn|Schiff|2008|p=48}}\n\nAdams hit left-handed; he said that his batted balls occasionally went into a river by the [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey|Elysian Fields]], the ground in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], New Jersey, where the Knickerbockers practiced and played.{{sfn|Ward & Burns|1994|pp=4\u20135}} Adams had a long on-field career with the Knickerbockers; he remained a player with the team until 1859.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=106}} He did not limit his play to shortstop; he fielded at every position except [[pitcher]].{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}} Little is known about the relative performance of early baseball players, and the game was largely recreational, as opposed to competitive. Thorn speculates that Adams may have been \"the best player of the 1840s\", citing his lengthy playing career as evidence.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Equipment maker and umpire==\nIn addition to playing the game, Adams was involved in the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured [[Baseball (ball)|baseballs]] for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=6}}{{sfn|Schaefer|2009|pp=88\u201389}} According to author [[Peter Morris (writer)|Peter Morris]], Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls.{{sfn|Morris|2008|pp=10, 31}} In later years Adams gathered rubber from old [[galoshes]] for the insides of baseballs. A [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]] then used [[Glossary of baseball (H)#horsehide|horsehide]] to create the balls.<ref name=\"founder\"/> As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand.{{sfn|Hample|2011|p=94}} Adams also played a role in producing [[baseball bats]], choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.<ref name=\"founder\"/>\n\nAdams also worked occasionally as an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] in significant games.{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}} One notable example was the final contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29\u201318, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a [[Strike zone|strike]] to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in the strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=75, 116, 119}}{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=71}} Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its first few years of existence.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=181}}\n\n==Knickerbockers and NABBP executive==\n[[File:Knickerbocker baseball team.jpg|thumb|left|Adams standing in the middle of a group of New York Knickerbockers in 1859|alt=Seven members of the New York Knickerbockers baseball team standing on a field.

No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13\u201311 vote, in favor of a rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nA two-man committee was created with the aim of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games. [[Duncan Curry|Duncan F. Curry]] and William F. Ladd were chosen as the committee members, but Ladd withdrew and Adams was named as a substitute. His partner on the committee, Curry, had led the opposition to nine-man teams. Adams and Curry also differed on another issue: the length of games.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=51\u201352}} At the time, a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs; that team was awarded the victory.<ref name=\"founder\"/> A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after the suspended game in 1854.

These included a clarification of the prescribed distance between [[Base (baseball)|bases]], which under [[Knickerbocker Rules]] had been set at \"forty-two paces\" between home plate and second base, and \"forty-two paces, equidistant\" between first and third base.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|pp=6\u20137}} Historians differ on whether the bases were roughly {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} apart, or a shorter distance.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=34}} Thorn has written that the pace itself may have been \"an imprecise and variable measure, to gauge distances by 'stepping off',\" and Adams described the rule as \"rather vague.\"{{sfn|Thorn|1993|pp=6\u20137}} At the 1857 convention, it was decided that bases would be \"securely fastened upon the four corners of a square whose sides are roughly thirty yards.\"{{sfn|Hershberger|2013|p=33}} As rules committee chairman for the new NABBP, Adams made the baselines {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} from one base to another, the distance seen in modern baseball. He ruled on the distance between home plate and the pitcher's mound as well, making them {{convert|45|ft|m|sp=us}} apart.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=28, 35\u201336}} In addition, the committee mandated that clubs have nine players per side, which became the norm.<ref name=\"invent\"/>{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=51}} It also created the called strike rule, in an effort to reduce pitch totals and the time required to play games.{{sfn|Morris, Ryczek, Finkel, Levin & Malatzky|2013|p=3}}\n\nAdams campaigned for a further change in the rules of baseball, involving when outs were recorded. At the time, an out was allowed when the ball was caught by a fielder after one bounce; this was known as the \"bound rule\".{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=67}} Adams supported a ban on such outs, calling his preferred rule \"the fly-game\".{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=7}} Under the style of play he backed, when a [[Batted ball|fly ball]] was hit a fielder would have to catch the ball before it touched the ground for an out to be made. This was similar to rules on catches in [[cricket]], and would serve to increase the level of skill required from fielders.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=174\u2013175}} The Knickerbockers had enacted a rule mandating the \"fly-catch\" by 1857.{{sfn|Schiff|2008|p=54}}\n\nThe Knickerbockers attempted to introduce the fly rule more widely at the 1857 convention, with a proposal that permitted the continued use of the bound rule for [[foul ball]]s. Despite widespread support from sportswriters, the proposed rule change was voted down. Writer William Hershberger said that the decision showed \"the limits of the Knickerbockers' influence and divisions within the baseball fraternity.\"{{sfn|Hershberger|2013|pp=41\u201342}} The rule change was proposed to the NABBP annually by Adams but did not pass. At the 1858 NABBP convention, a vote on eliminating the bound rule was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=175}} Opponents raised concerns that the proposal would dramatically lengthen game times.{{sfn|Schiff|2008|p=54}} Despite his support for the fly rule, in 1858 Adams successfully motioned for NABBP regulations, including outs on bounces, to apply to the Knickerbockers. He did so because he was reluctant to oppose the rules of the NABBP. Shortly after his motion, he organized a Knickerbockers meeting to discuss the fly rule and \"obtain a reconsideration\" of the newly passed resolution. At the meeting, the Knickerbockers decided to exclude outs on bounces from their practice games and contests against teams that supported the fly rule.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=175}} In future years, the club remained an advocate of eliminating the bound rule, but Adams' continued efforts were rejected. A split in the rules and regulations committee caused it to avoid supporting the fly game at the NABBP's 1859 convention, and votes at the 1860 and 1861 conventions maintained the bound rule.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=175\u2013177}} Adams' final comments about the regulation at an NABBP convention indicated that he believed it would soon be modified.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=7}} The bound rule started losing support by 1863, after Adams left the Knickerbockers, and outs on bounced balls were outlawed in 1864.<ref name=\"founder\"/>{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=177\u2013178}}\n\n===Retirement===\nIn addition to his other roles, Adams regularly served as a delegate on behalf of the Knickerbockers at the NABBP's annual meetings.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=175}} He remained with the Knickerbockers in an executive role until March 26, 1862, when he retired having served 12 years overall in various non-playing capacities.{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}}{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=35}} Upon leaving his position, the club named him an honorary member.<ref name=\"invent\"/> He received a scroll from the Knickerbockers, which referred to him as \"The [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] of Ball Players\", alluding to a mythical king known for offering advice.<ref name=\"founder\"/><ref name=\"invent\"/> Adams also resigned from his role as rules committee chairman of the NABBP.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=35}}\n\n==Later life==\nAdams and Cornelia Cook married in 1861, and remained together until Adams' death.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> The couple had five children; the first, a son named Charles, died less than a month after his birth in 1864.

For most of his career he was a member of the [[New York Knickerbockers]]. He first played for the New York Base Ball Club in 1840 and started his Knickerbockers career five years later, continuing to play for the club into his forties and to take part in inter-squad practice games and matches against opposing teams. Researchers have called Adams the creator of the [[shortstop]] position, which he used to field short throws from [[outfielder]]s. In addition to his playing career, Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw [[Baseball bat|bat]] production; he also occasionally acted as an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]].\n\nFrom 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-[[inning]] games. When the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [[Baseball field#Specifications|bases]] should be {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [[Out (baseball)|outs]]. He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''; by 1993, researcher [[John Thorn]] had written about Adams' role. Other historians have given him credit for helping to develop the sport, and Thorn has called Adams \"first among the Fathers of Baseball\".{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=7}}\n\nA graduate of [[Yale University]] and [[Harvard Medical School]], Adams began working in the medical field in the late 1830s, and practiced in New York City during his time as a member of the Knickerbockers. In 1865, he left medicine and later became a bank president and member of the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|Connecticut legislature]]. He and his wife had five children.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Mont Vernon, New Hampshire|Mont Vernon]], New Hampshire, on November 1, 1814, Adams was the fourth of [[Daniel Adams (physician)|Daniel]] and Nancy Adams' five children.{{sfn|Smith|1907|pp=255\u2013256}} The elder Daniel Adams was a physician and author; he wrote a math textbook that was widely used in the United States in the early- to mid-1800s. After being schooled at [[Kimball Union Academy]] in New Hampshire from 1826 to 1828 and [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], Massachusetts' Mount Pleasant Classical Institution, Adams attended three colleges from 1831 to 1838.

In an 1896 interview in ''[[Sporting News|The Sporting News]]'', Adams said that \"soon after going to New York I began to play base ball just for exercise, with a number of other young medical men.\"{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=6}} Starting in 1840, he was a player with the New York Base Ball Club.<ref name=\"founder\"/> This team had been founded in 1837, eight years earlier than the [[New York Knickerbockers]],{{sfn|Morris, Ryczek, Finkel, Levin & Malatzky|2013|pp=46, 49}} who are credited in several baseball histories as pioneering the modern version of baseball.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=5}} Adams played an early form of the game, but Thorn writes that he \"understood [it] to be baseball, no matter what it was called\".{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Knickerbocker practice.jpg|thumb|upright|The Knickerbockers during a practice session, as depicted by [[Homer Davenport]]. Adams took leadership in pushing other club members to attend practice.|alt=A drawing of several members of the New York Knickerbockers baseball team. One player is holding a baseball bat, while behind him three members are sitting or standing in front of a house.]]\nAdams received an invitation to become a member of the Knickerbockers a month or so after the team's September 23, 1845, creation. He accepted and joined the club along with other men in the medical field; he later said that players from the New York Base Ball Club were behind the formation of the Knickerbockers.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=30\u201331, 36}} Records of the club's practice games indicate that he was a member of the Knickerbockers by November 18, 1845. In an inter-squad game held that day, which was the Knickerbockers' last of the year, Adams scored nine [[Run (baseball)|runs]] for his team as they defeated a side picked by [[William Wheaton|William R. Wheaton]], 51\u201342.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=11}} The club organized its first game against outside opposition in 1846; at a June 5 meeting Adams was selected to a three-man committee whose aim was to set up a game against the New York Base Ball Club. The committee's efforts were successful, and a game was scheduled on June 19.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|pp=12\u201313}} Adams participated in the contest, which the Knickerbockers lost 23\u20131. Batting second in the Knickerbockers' [[Batting order (baseball)|lineup]], he made one [[Out (baseball)|out]] and did not score a run.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=45}}\n\nThe Knickerbockers did not play any known games against other clubs from 1847 to 1850. During these years, the team split its players into two squads, which played against each other twice per week.{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}} According to Adams, he often attempted to compel members of the Knickerbockers to attend the sessions. He was only occasionally successful, and when few Knickerbockers came, they played variants of baseball that required fewer players than regular games.{{sfn|Morris|2008|pp=30\u201331}} Twice in June 1851, the club played against the Washington Base Ball Club, winning by scores of 21\u201311 and 22\u201320. No individual statistics are available for the first game;{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=14}} Adams scored twice for the Knickerbockers in the second. In 1853, Adams played in two games against the Gotham Ball Club, tallying seven runs in a pair of victories.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=226\u2013227}} The two clubs met three times from June to October 1854, and Adams had one run in each game. After splitting the first two contests, their October 26, 1854, game lasted 12 innings before being suspended due to darkness with the score tied 12\u201312; both teams fell short of the 21 runs that were required to win a game under the rules of the time.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=227\u2013228}}{{sfn|Spink|2000|p=56}}\n\nFollowing two November games against the Eagle Base Ball Club that Adams is not known to have participated in, he returned to the Knickerbockers' lineup for a June 1, 1855, game against Gotham and scored three times, although Gotham prevailed, 21\u201312.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=228}}{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=16}} He took part in two other 1855 games against Eagle and Gotham, respectively, scoring five runs total as the Knickerbockers won both contests. Adams competed four times for the club against outside opponents in 1856 as it won once, lost twice, and had one tie; he scored ten times, and records for two games showed that his defensive position was [[shortstop]]. The Knickerbockers had a 2\u20132 win\u2013loss record in competitive games during 1857 that Adams participated in.

A [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]] then used [[Glossary of baseball (H)#horsehide|horsehide]] to create the balls.<ref name=\"founder\"/> As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand.{{sfn|Hample|2011|p=94}} Adams also played a role in producing [[baseball bats]], choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.<ref name=\"founder\"/>\n\nAdams also worked occasionally as an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] in significant games.{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}} One notable example was the final contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29\u201318, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a [[Strike zone|strike]] to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in the strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=75, 116, 119}}{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=71}} Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its first few years of existence.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=181}}\n\n==Knickerbockers and NABBP executive==\n[[File:Knickerbocker baseball team.jpg|thumb|left|Adams standing in the middle of a group of New York Knickerbockers in 1859|alt=Seven members of the New York Knickerbockers baseball team standing on a field.

At the club's second election, held on May 5, 1846, Adams was named the Knickerbockers' vice president.

Adams was one of the three Knickerbockers members selected to be on the committee, and the clubs agreed on a set of rules, which were presented at the Knickerbockers' meeting on April 1, 1854. At the same meeting, Adams was voted into the position of club director.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=15}}\n\nAfter again being named a director in 1855, Adams became president of the Knickerbockers for the fourth time, winning an election held at the club's April 5, 1856, meeting.

No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13\u201311 vote, in favor of a rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nA two-man committee was created with the aim of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games.

His partner on the committee, Curry, had led the opposition to nine-man teams. Adams and Curry also differed on another issue: the length of games.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=51\u201352}} At the time, a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs; that team was awarded the victory.<ref name=\"founder\"/> A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after the suspended game in 1854.

These included a clarification of the prescribed distance between [[Base (baseball)|bases]], which under [[Knickerbocker Rules]] had been set at \"forty-two paces\" between home plate and second base, and \"forty-two paces, equidistant\" between first and third base.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|pp=6\u20137}} Historians differ on whether the bases were roughly {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} apart, or a shorter distance.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=34}} Thorn has written that the pace itself may have been \"an imprecise and variable measure, to gauge distances by 'stepping off',\" and Adams described the rule as \"rather vague.\"{{sfn|Thorn|1993|pp=6\u20137}} At the 1857 convention, it was decided that bases would be \"securely fastened upon the four corners of a square whose sides are roughly thirty yards.\"{{sfn|Hershberger|2013|p=33}} As rules committee chairman for the new NABBP, Adams made the baselines {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} from one base to another, the distance seen in modern baseball. He ruled on the distance between home plate and the pitcher's mound as well, making them {{convert|45|ft|m|sp=us}} apart.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=28, 35\u201336}} In addition, the committee mandated that clubs have nine players per side, which became the norm.<ref name=\"invent\"/>{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=51}} It also created the called strike rule, in an effort to reduce pitch totals and the time required to play games.{{sfn|Morris, Ryczek, Finkel, Levin & Malatzky|2013|p=3}}\n\nAdams campaigned for a further change in the rules of baseball, involving when outs were recorded. At the time, an out was allowed when the ball was caught by a fielder after one bounce; this was known as the \"bound rule\".{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=67}} Adams supported a ban on such outs, calling his preferred rule \"the fly-game\".{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=7}} Under the style of play he backed, when a [[Batted ball|fly ball]] was hit a fielder would have to catch the ball before it touched the ground for an out to be made. This was similar to rules on catches in [[cricket]], and would serve to increase the level of skill required from fielders.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=174\u2013175}} The Knickerbockers had enacted a rule mandating the \"fly-catch\" by 1857.{{sfn|Schiff|2008|p=54}}\n\nThe Knickerbockers attempted to introduce the fly rule more widely at the 1857 convention, with a proposal that permitted the continued use of the bound rule for [[foul ball]]s. Despite widespread support from sportswriters, the proposed rule change was voted down. Writer William Hershberger said that the decision showed \"the limits of the Knickerbockers' influence and divisions within the baseball fraternity.\"{{sfn|Hershberger|2013|pp=41\u201342}} The rule change was proposed to the NABBP annually by Adams but did not pass. At the 1858 NABBP convention, a vote on eliminating the bound rule was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=175}} Opponents raised concerns that the proposal would dramatically lengthen game times.{{sfn|Schiff|2008|p=54}} Despite his support for the fly rule, in 1858 Adams successfully motioned for NABBP regulations, including outs on bounces, to apply to the Knickerbockers. He did so because he was reluctant to oppose the rules of the NABBP. Shortly after his motion, he organized a Knickerbockers meeting to discuss the fly rule and \"obtain a reconsideration\" of the newly passed resolution. At the meeting, the Knickerbockers decided to exclude outs on bounces from their practice games and contests against teams that supported the fly rule.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=175}} In future years, the club remained an advocate of eliminating the bound rule, but Adams' continued efforts were rejected. A split in the rules and regulations committee caused it to avoid supporting the fly game at the NABBP's 1859 convention, and votes at the 1860 and 1861 conventions maintained the bound rule.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=175\u2013177}} Adams' final comments about the regulation at an NABBP convention indicated that he believed it would soon be modified.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=7}} The bound rule started losing support by 1863, after Adams left the Knickerbockers, and outs on bounced balls were outlawed in 1864.<ref name=\"founder\"/>{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=177\u2013178}}\n\n===Retirement===\nIn addition to his other roles, Adams regularly served as a delegate on behalf of the Knickerbockers at the NABBP's annual meetings.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=175}} He remained with the Knickerbockers in an executive role until March 26, 1862, when he retired having served 12 years overall in various non-playing capacities.{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}}{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=35}} Upon leaving his position, the club named him an honorary member.<ref name=\"invent\"/> He received a scroll from the Knickerbockers, which referred to him as \"The [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] of Ball Players\", alluding to a mythical king known for offering advice.<ref name=\"founder\"/><ref name=\"invent\"/> Adams also resigned from his role as rules committee chairman of the NABBP.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=35}}\n\n==Later life==\nAdams and Cornelia Cook married in 1861, and remained together until Adams' death.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> The couple had five children; the first, a son named Charles, died less than a month after his birth in 1864.

For instance, the [[maroon beret]] is mostly traditional headgear for elite [[airborne forces]] around the world with a few exceptions like the elite [[Russian Airborne Troops]] who instead wear a [[sky blue]] beret or the [[Portuguese Paratroopers]] that wear a [[green beret]].\n[[File:ComandosPT.jpg|thumb|Portuguese Army Commandos with red beret|555x555px]]\n[[File:Bastille Day 2014 Paris - Color guards 010.jpg|thumb|270px|A Ukrainian military cadet in a light blue beret.]]\n==History==\n[[File:C\u00e9sar PAYAN.jpg|thumb|right|A French ''[[chasseur alpin]]'' in World War I, with their distinctive large beret.]]\nThe use of beret-like headgear as a civilian headdress dates back hundreds of years, an early example being the Scottish Blue Bonnet, that became a ''de facto'' symbol of Scottish [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] forces in the 16th and 17th centuries. As an officially required military headdress, its use dates back to the [[Carlist Wars]] of Succession for the Spanish Crown in the 1830s by order of [[Carlism|Carlist]] General [[Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui]] who wanted a local and non-costly way to make headgear that was resistant to the mountain weather, easy to care for and could be used on formal occasions.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe French [[Chasseur Alpin|Chasseurs alpins]], created in the early 1880s, were the first regular unit to wear the military beret as a standard headgear.<ref>{{cite book|first=W.Y.|last=Carman|page=26|title=A Dictionary of Military Uniform|ISBN=0-684-15130-8}}</ref> These mountain troops were issued with a uniform which included several features which were innovative for the time, notably the large and floppy blue beret which they still retain.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Mollo|page=200|title=Military Fashion|ISBN=0-214-65349-8}}</ref> This was so unfamiliar a fashion outside France that it had to be described in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' of 1911 as \"a soft cap or [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]]\".<ref>\"Uniforms\", page 587, Volume XXVII ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911 Edition</ref>\n\nBerets have features that make them attractive to the military: they are cheap, easy to make in large numbers, can be manufactured in a wide range of colors, can be rolled up and stuffed into a pocket or beneath the shirt epaulette without damage, and can be worn with headphones (this is one of the reasons why early tank crews adopted the beret). The beret is not so useful in field conditions for the modern infantryman, who requires protective helmets, and non-camouflage versions are seldom seen on operations.\n\nThe beret was found particularly useful as a uniform for armored-vehicle crews, and the [[Royal Tank Regiment|British Tank Corps]] (later Royal Tank Corps) adopted the headdress as early as 1918.\n\nGerman AFV crews in the late 1930s also adopted a beret with the addition of a padded crash helmet inside. The colour black was worn by the Royal Tank Corps later Royal Tank Regiment, since it did not show oil stains picked up inside the interior of a vehicle. [[Black beret]]s continue to be worn by the Royal Tank Regiment, all other British armoured units wear [[blue beret]]s, regiments in many armies also adopted the wearing of berets.\n\nThe wearing of berets of distinctive colors by elite [[special forces]] originated with the British [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], whose [[maroon beret]] was officially approved in July 1942,<ref>{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=Rebecca |date=2010 |title=British Paratrooper 1940\u201345 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nLGdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 |location= |publisher=Osprey Publishing  |page=6 |isbn=978-1472805126 }}</ref> followed by the [[Commandos (United Kingdom)|Commando Forces]] whose [[green beret]] was approved in October of that year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bull |first=Stephen |date=2010 |title=Commando Tactics: The Second World War |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aH10gy_DENAC&pg=PA98 |location= |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |page=98 |isbn=978-1848840744 }}</ref> The [[United States Army Special Forces]] adopted a darker green beret in 1955, although it was not officially approved until 1961.<ref name=\"www.army.mil\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm |title=A Short History of the Use of Berets in the U.S. Army |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010624053826/https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm#History |archive-date=24 June 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Camouflage berets==\n[[File:Vietnam p05.jpg|thumb|right|A U.S. Navy SEAL in Vietnam with a camouflage beret]]\nA '''camouflage beret''' is  intended for use in the battlefield when wearing [[Battledress|combat fatigues]]. They are mostly issued to the likes of [[special forces]], particularly in jungle warfare operations.\n\n===History===\nCamouflage berets possibly originate from the General Service cap \"Cap, General Service\" issued to the British Army in a Khaki material before the introduction of Berets. It was first introduced under \"Army Council Instruction 1407\" of September 1943. This cap was designed to replace the \"Field Service cap\" or \"FS Cap\" that had been worn since the outbreak of war. These caps were issued in priority to units serving overseas. UK based units got theirs later on. It was at first unpopular due to its over large appearance. This cap was not a beret. It was made from several pieces of drab cloth material, whereas a beret was a one piece item. It was based on the Scottish balmoral bonnet in design. First issues were made from the same gaberdine cloth as the old \"FS\" cap. Badges worn on it were the conventional Officers bronze, and OR's badges in both plastic and metal. Units which had special distinctions could still wear these on the \"GS\" cap. The General Service cap was worn by regulation one inch above the eyebrows, with badge over the left eye and the cap pulled down to the right. But many wartime photos will show it worn pushed back on the head, which seemed to be a fashion with many soldiers late in the War.\n\nOfficers could only obtain the cap upon repayment to the RAOC.

The Chasseurs alpins wore a distinctive large beret (see above{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}) and Major-General Sir [[Hugh Elles]], the TC's Colonel, realised this style of headdress would be a practical option for his [[tank]] crews, forced to work in a reduced space. He thought, however, that the Chasseur beret was \"too sloppy\" and the [[Basque people|Basque]]-style beret of the French tank crews was \"too skimpy\", so a compromise based on the Scottish [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]] was designed and submitted for the approval of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in November 1923.

In response, from 1973 through 1979 HQDA permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing uniform distinctions, however these distinctions were only allowed to be worn on the post. Consequently, many units embraced various colored berets, for example Armor and Armored Cavalry units often adopted the black beret. Similarly many other units embraced various colored berets in an attempt to improve dwindling morale. In particular, the First Cavalry Division assigned various colored berets to its three pronged TRICAP approach. In this implementation, Armored Cavalry, Airmobile Infantry units, Air Cavalry units, Division Artillery units, and Division Support units all wore different colored berets, including black, light blue, kelly green, and red. The 101st Airborne Division was authorised a dark blue beret.\n\nIn 1975 all female soldiers of the [[Women's Army Corps]] were authorized to wear a black beret variant as standard headgear for the service uniform.<ref>Stanton, Shelby (1994).

Stackpole Books. p. 223.</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the 172nd Light Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson & Fort Wainwright, Alaska wore Olive Drab Berets.\n\nIn 2001, Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki ordered the black beret worn as standard headgear army-wide, a controversial decision because it was previously reserved for the Rangers. The Rangers were then authorized to wear a tan beret, exclusive to them. The decision was implemented in hopes of boosting morale among conventional units. However, many soldiers began complaining that the new black beret was not practical with the utility uniform. In June 2011, Army Secretary John McHugh, acting on the recommendations made by Chief of Staff Martin Dempsey and Sergeant Major of the Army Raymond F. Chandler, once again chose the traditional patrol cap to be worn with the utility uniform. The black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion for special ceremonies. The beret remains part of the Army's dress uniform for all units.\n\nUnited States Army berets now use the following distinctive colors:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <center><big>'''US Army'''</big></center>\n! colspan=\"2\" | Color || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00230D;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| [[Green beret|Rifle green]] || [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces qualified soldiers]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:tan;\"| || [[Tan beret|Tan]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] and the [[Ranger School|Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade]] (Soldiers that have served one year in the regiment and are assigned to a [[USASOC]] component may continue to wear the Tan Beret.)\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"| || [[Maroon beret|Maroon]] || Soldiers assigned to units on active \"jump status,\" better known as Airborne/Parachute units\n|-\n| style=\"background: SaddleBrown;\"| || [[Brown]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[Security Force Assistance Command]] and its subordinate units\n|-\n| style=\"background:#000;\"| || [[Black beret|Black]] || Worn by all soldiers with Army Service Uniform as standard headgear (The [[patrol cap]] is the standard headgear with utility uniforms such as the ACUs; however, the black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion.<ref>{{Cite news |first=C.

During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Navy created special boat teams, unofficially dubbed the [[brown-water navy]], to patrol coastlines, estuaries and rivers.

For instance, the [[maroon beret]] is mostly traditional headgear for elite [[airborne forces]] around the world with a few exceptions like the elite [[Russian Airborne Troops]] who instead wear a [[sky blue]] beret or the [[Portuguese Paratroopers]] that wear a [[green beret]].\n[[File:ComandosPT.jpg|thumb|Portuguese Army Commandos with red beret|555x555px]]\n[[File:Bastille Day 2014 Paris - Color guards 010.jpg|thumb|270px|A Ukrainian military cadet in a light blue beret.]]\n==History==\n[[File:C\u00e9sar PAYAN.jpg|thumb|right|A French ''[[chasseur alpin]]'' in World War I, with their distinctive large beret.]]\nThe use of beret-like headgear as a civilian headdress dates back hundreds of years, an early example being the Scottish Blue Bonnet, that became a ''de facto'' symbol of Scottish [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] forces in the 16th and 17th centuries. As an officially required military headdress, its use dates back to the [[Carlist Wars]] of Succession for the Spanish Crown in the 1830s by order of [[Carlism|Carlist]] General [[Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui]] who wanted a local and non-costly way to make headgear that was resistant to the mountain weather, easy to care for and could be used on formal occasions.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe French [[Chasseur Alpin|Chasseurs alpins]], created in the early 1880s, were the first regular unit to wear the military beret as a standard headgear.<ref>{{cite book|first=W.Y.|last=Carman|page=26|title=A Dictionary of Military Uniform|ISBN=0-684-15130-8}}</ref> These mountain troops were issued with a uniform which included several features which were innovative for the time, notably the large and floppy blue beret which they still retain.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Mollo|page=200|title=Military Fashion|ISBN=0-214-65349-8}}</ref> This was so unfamiliar a fashion outside France that it had to be described in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' of 1911 as \"a soft cap or [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]]\".<ref>\"Uniforms\", page 587, Volume XXVII ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911 Edition</ref>\n\nBerets have features that make them attractive to the military: they are cheap, easy to make in large numbers, can be manufactured in a wide range of colors, can be rolled up and stuffed into a pocket or beneath the shirt epaulette without damage, and can be worn with headphones (this is one of the reasons why early tank crews adopted the beret). The beret is not so useful in field conditions for the modern infantryman, who requires protective helmets, and non-camouflage versions are seldom seen on operations.\n\nThe beret was found particularly useful as a uniform for armored-vehicle crews, and the [[Royal Tank Regiment|British Tank Corps]] (later Royal Tank Corps) adopted the headdress as early as 1918.\n\nGerman AFV crews in the late 1930s also adopted a beret with the addition of a padded crash helmet inside. The colour black was worn by the Royal Tank Corps later Royal Tank Regiment, since it did not show oil stains picked up inside the interior of a vehicle. [[Black beret]]s continue to be worn by the Royal Tank Regiment, all other British armoured units wear [[blue beret]]s, regiments in many armies also adopted the wearing of berets.\n\nThe wearing of berets of distinctive colors by elite [[special forces]] originated with the British [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], whose [[maroon beret]] was officially approved in July 1942,<ref>{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=Rebecca |date=2010 |title=British Paratrooper 1940\u201345 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nLGdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 |location= |publisher=Osprey Publishing  |page=6 |isbn=978-1472805126 }}</ref> followed by the [[Commandos (United Kingdom)|Commando Forces]] whose [[green beret]] was approved in October of that year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bull |first=Stephen |date=2010 |title=Commando Tactics: The Second World War |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aH10gy_DENAC&pg=PA98 |location= |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |page=98 |isbn=978-1848840744 }}</ref> The [[United States Army Special Forces]] adopted a darker green beret in 1955, although it was not officially approved until 1961.<ref name=\"www.army.mil\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm |title=A Short History of the Use of Berets in the U.S. Army |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010624053826/https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm#History |archive-date=24 June 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Camouflage berets==\n[[File:Vietnam p05.jpg|thumb|right|A U.S. Navy SEAL in Vietnam with a camouflage beret]]\nA '''camouflage beret''' is  intended for use in the battlefield when wearing [[Battledress|combat fatigues]]. They are mostly issued to the likes of [[special forces]], particularly in jungle warfare operations.\n\n===History===\nCamouflage berets possibly originate from the General Service cap \"Cap, General Service\" issued to the British Army in a Khaki material before the introduction of Berets. It was first introduced under \"Army Council Instruction 1407\" of September 1943. This cap was designed to replace the \"Field Service cap\" or \"FS Cap\" that had been worn since the outbreak of war. These caps were issued in priority to units serving overseas. UK based units got theirs later on. It was at first unpopular due to its over large appearance. This cap was not a beret. It was made from several pieces of drab cloth material, whereas a beret was a one piece item. It was based on the Scottish balmoral bonnet in design. First issues were made from the same gaberdine cloth as the old \"FS\" cap. Badges worn on it were the conventional Officers bronze, and OR's badges in both plastic and metal. Units which had special distinctions could still wear these on the \"GS\" cap. The General Service cap was worn by regulation one inch above the eyebrows, with badge over the left eye and the cap pulled down to the right. But many wartime photos will show it worn pushed back on the head, which seemed to be a fashion with many soldiers late in the War.\n\nOfficers could only obtain the cap upon repayment to the RAOC. They were not allowed to buy the cap until their unit had been issued with it wholesale. Higher ranking Officers often got away with wearing a Khaki beret, which was against regulations. Fashion conscious OR's would also risk punishment from NCO's/officers buying one of these for \"walking out\".\n\nNot exactly camouflage but an early example is the Jungle Beret issued to the Australian Army during WW2.<ref>The Australian Army in World War II - Page 57 Mark Johnson {{ISBN|1472805224}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medalsgonemissing.com/index.php?params_to_parse=Uniform-Kit-issued-to-the-AIF-During-WW2/5|title=Uniform & Kit issued to the AIF During WW2|website=www.medalsgonemissing.com}}</ref><ref>http://www.austcdoassocvic.com/history1.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Users===\n*{{flagcountry|Argentina}} - Jungle Troops (Brigada de Monte XII \"General Manuel Obligado\")<ref>The other Cazadores de Monte brigades use Dark Green berets</ref>\n*{{flagcountry|Bolivia}} - Special Forces \"Bolivian Condors\"\n*{{flagcountry|Brazil}} - Jungle Troops\n*{{flagcountry|PRC}} - During the 80s, camo berets were issued to some of the recon forces of PLA.

The Chasseurs alpins wore a distinctive large beret (see above{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}) and Major-General Sir [[Hugh Elles]], the TC's Colonel, realised this style of headdress would be a practical option for his [[tank]] crews, forced to work in a reduced space. He thought, however, that the Chasseur beret was \"too sloppy\" and the [[Basque people|Basque]]-style beret of the French tank crews was \"too skimpy\", so a compromise based on the Scottish [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]] was designed and submitted for the approval of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in November 1923. It was adopted in March 1924.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the use of the black beret was extended to all the regiments of the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] in 1940. The [[maroon beret]] was adopted by the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] in 1941 and the [[green beret]] by the [[British Commandos|Commandos]] in late 1942.

In response, from 1973 through 1979 HQDA permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing uniform distinctions, however these distinctions were only allowed to be worn on the post. Consequently, many units embraced various colored berets, for example Armor and Armored Cavalry units often adopted the black beret. Similarly many other units embraced various colored berets in an attempt to improve dwindling morale. In particular, the First Cavalry Division assigned various colored berets to its three pronged TRICAP approach. In this implementation, Armored Cavalry, Airmobile Infantry units, Air Cavalry units, Division Artillery units, and Division Support units all wore different colored berets, including black, light blue, kelly green, and red. The 101st Airborne Division was authorised a dark blue beret.\n\nIn 1975 all female soldiers of the [[Women's Army Corps]] were authorized to wear a black beret variant as standard headgear for the service uniform.<ref>Stanton, Shelby (1994). ''US Army Uniforms of the Cold War 1948\u20131973''. Stackpole Books. p. 223.</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the 172nd Light Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson & Fort Wainwright, Alaska wore Olive Drab Berets.\n\nIn 2001, Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki ordered the black beret worn as standard headgear army-wide, a controversial decision because it was previously reserved for the Rangers. The Rangers were then authorized to wear a tan beret, exclusive to them. The decision was implemented in hopes of boosting morale among conventional units. However, many soldiers began complaining that the new black beret was not practical with the utility uniform. In June 2011, Army Secretary John McHugh, acting on the recommendations made by Chief of Staff Martin Dempsey and Sergeant Major of the Army Raymond F. Chandler, once again chose the traditional patrol cap to be worn with the utility uniform. The black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion for special ceremonies. The beret remains part of the Army's dress uniform for all units.\n\nUnited States Army berets now use the following distinctive colors:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <center><big>'''US Army'''</big></center>\n! colspan=\"2\" | Color || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00230D;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| [[Green beret|Rifle green]] || [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces qualified soldiers]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:tan;\"| || [[Tan beret|Tan]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] and the [[Ranger School|Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade]] (Solders that have served one year in the regiment and are assigned to a [[USASOC]] component may continue to wear the Tan Beret.)\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"| || [[Maroon beret|Maroon]] || Soldiers assigned to units on active \"jump status,\" better known as Airborne/Parachute units\n|-\n| style=\"background: SaddleBrown;\"| || [[Brown]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[Security Force Assistance Command]] and its subordinate units\n|-\n| style=\"background:#000;\"| || [[Black beret|Black]] || Worn by all soldiers with Army Service Uniform as standard headgear (The [[patrol cap]] is the standard headgear with utility uniforms such as the ACUs; however, the black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion.<ref>{{Cite news |first=C.

The black berets were phased out in October of that year due to a lack of widespread use and a desire by the U.S. Navy to make its uniforms more unisex in appearance. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Navy created special boat teams, unofficially dubbed the [[brown-water navy]], to patrol coastlines, estuaries and rivers. Naval personnel assigned to these teams wore black berets as part of their uniform, as portrayed in the movie ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.specwarnet.net/americas/sbu.htm |title=Special Boat Teams |publisher=Specwarnet.net |date=1979-03-01 |accessdate=2019-06-18}}</ref> U.S. Navy SEAL teams serving in Vietnam wore camouflage berets in the field, the only beret somewhat standardized in the SEALs.\n\n\n{{page break|label=}}\n\n===Uruguay===\n*Grey - Army 14th Parachute Battalion\n*Black - Police Coraceros Regiment\n*Green - Army 13th Armor Battalion (Combined Arms){{page break|label=}}\n\n===Vatican State===\nThe Pontifical [[Swiss Guard]] wears large black berets.[[File:Rom, Vatikan, Soldat der Schweizer Garde 1.jpg|thumb|upright|A member of the [[Swiss Guard#Pontifical Swiss Guard|Pontifical Swiss Guard]] with beret and [[halberd]]|alt=|left]]\n\n{{page break|label=}}\n\n===Venezuela===\n\nBerets are worn by some units in the [[National Armed Forces of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela|Venezuelan National Armed Forces]], with distinctive colors for some units or functions.
