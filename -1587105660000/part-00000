He said \u201c\u2026you can\u2019t vote for the M\u0101ori Party because you\u2019re not enrolled in the M\u0101ori electorate\u201d.

So hopefully that clears all of that up.\u201d\n\nThe M\u0101ori Party complaint was referred to the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) which upheld the complaint. The BSA ruled Hosking breached its accuracy standard when he said to his co-presenter, \"\u2026you can't vote for the M\u0101ori Party because you're not enrolled in the M\u0101ori electorate\". The comment was made on 23 August, just under a month out from the 2017 general election. The BSA found Hosking's comment could have misled voters. The BSA found that the potential harm caused by this broadcast, in leaving viewers misinformed about their ability to vote for the M\u0101ori Party, outweighed the broadcaster's right to freedom of expression. The BSA consider that Mr Hosking's statement during broadcast on 23 August 2017 was inaccurate and misleading, and that the clarification subsequently provided was confusing and insufficient to correct the inaccuracy. This was an important issue, particularly during the election period, and had the potential to significantly affect voters\u2019 understanding of the M\u0101ori roll and of New Zealand's electoral system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bsa.govt.nz/decisions/8273-mccaughan-and-television-new-zealand-ltd-2017-083-18-december-2017|title=McCaughan and Television New Zealand Ltd \u2013 2017-083 (18 December 2017)|author=Peter Radich, Chair Broadcasting Standards Authority|date=18 December 2017|publisher=BSA}}</ref>\n\nThe results of the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 general election]] saw the M\u0101ori Party lose its electorate seat.

Members of the M\u0101ori Party and the general public criticised his statement as being misleading.<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/96115275|title=Mike Hosking says he 'confused' the M\u0101ori Party by saying only M\u0101ori could vote for them|author=Jo Moir|date=24 August 2017|publisher=stuff.co.nz}}</ref> The M\u0101ori Party lodged formal complaints with broadcaster TVNZ and the Electoral Commission over Hosking's comments.<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/337919/maori-party-want-hosking-dumped-as-debate-moderator|title=M\u0101ori Party want Hosking dumped as debate moderator|author=Jane Patterson|date=24 August 2017|publisher=RadioNZ}}</ref>\n\nHosking made further comment the following night saying, \u201cThe fact that anyone can vote for [the M\u0101ori Party] as a list party I automatically assumed we all knew given we have been doing this for 20 years\u2026 and it went without saying. So hopefully that clears all of that up.\u201d\n\nThe M\u0101ori Party complaint was referred to the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) which upheld the complaint. The BSA ruled Hosking breached its accuracy standard when he said to his co-presenter, \"\u2026you can't vote for the M\u0101ori Party because you're not enrolled in the M\u0101ori electorate\". The comment was made on 23 August, just under a month out from the 2017 general election. The BSA found Hosking's comment could have misled voters. The BSA found that the potential harm caused by this broadcast, in leaving viewers misinformed about their ability to vote for the M\u0101ori Party, outweighed the broadcaster's right to freedom of expression. The BSA consider that Mr Hosking's statement during broadcast on 23 August 2017 was inaccurate and misleading, and that the clarification subsequently provided was confusing and insufficient to correct the inaccuracy. This was an important issue, particularly during the election period, and had the potential to significantly affect voters\u2019 understanding of the M\u0101ori roll and of New Zealand's electoral system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bsa.govt.nz/decisions/8273-mccaughan-and-television-new-zealand-ltd-2017-083-18-december-2017|title=McCaughan and Television New Zealand Ltd \u2013 2017-083 (18 December 2017)|author=Peter Radich, Chair Broadcasting Standards Authority|date=18 December 2017|publisher=BSA}}</ref>\n\nThe results of the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 general election]] saw the M\u0101ori Party lose its electorate seat.

For residential markets, [[voice over IP]] phone service is often cheaper than traditional [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) service and can remove geographic restrictions to telephone numbers, e.g., have a PSTN phone number in a New York area code ring in Tokyo.\n\nFor businesses, VoIP obviates separate voice and data pipelines, channelling both types of traffic through the IP network while giving the telephony user a range of advanced abilities.\n\n[[Softphone]]s are client devices for making and receiving voice and video calls over the [[IP network]] with the standard functions of most ''original'' telephones and usually allow integration with [[VoIP phone]]s and [[USB phone]]s instead of using a computer's microphone and speakers (or headset). Most softphone clients run on the open [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) supporting various codecs. [[Skype]] runs on a closed [[proprietary networking protocol]] but additional [[business telephone system]] (PBX) software can allow a SIP based telephone system to connect to the Skype network.<ref name=\"skypesip\">{{cite web|title=Skype Connect...|url=http://www.skype.com/en/features/skype-connect/|website=skype.com|publisher=Microsoft Corporation Inc.|accessdate=15 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111022420/http://www.skype.com/en/features/skype-connect/|archivedate=2014-11-11}}</ref> ''[[Online chat]]'' programs now also incorporate voice and video communications.\n\nOther VoIP software applications include conferencing servers, intercom systems, virtual [[Foreign exchange service (telecommunications)|foreign exchange service]]s (FXOs) and adapted telephony software which concurrently support VoIP and [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) like [[Interactive Voice Response]] (IVR) systems, dial in dictation, on hold and call recording servers.\n\nSome entries below are [[Web-based VoIP]]; most are standalone Desktop applications.\n\n== Desktop applications ==\n<!-- ########## EDITORS TAKE NOTE ###########\n\nIn the \"License\" column, please restrict entries to:\n* {{free|[[LicenseFreeType|abbreviation]]}}\n* {{proprietary}}\n* {{some|Mixed: [[LicenseFreeType|abbreviation]], [[Proprietary software|proprietary]]}} or {{some|Mixed: [[Proprietary software|proprietary]], [[LicenseFreeType|abbreviation]]}} depending on which form dominates\n\nADD NO LINKS TO WEBSITES.

Identical triplets are very rare.]]\nA '''multiple birth''' is the culmination of one multiple [[pregnancy]], wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to [[vertebrate]] species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in ''[[twin]]s'' and ''triplets''. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a ''[[Litter (animal)|litter]]'', and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.\n\nA multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these factors.  A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called ''monozygotic'', from two zygotes is called ''dizygotic'', or from three or more zygotes is called ''polyzygotic''. \nSimilarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.\n\nEach fertilized [[ovum|egg]] ([[zygote]]) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called ''fraternal'' and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called ''identical''. Identical twins are always the same sex, except in cases of [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (also known as XXY syndrome and 47,XXY syndrome).\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:TwinsTwins.JPG|right|thumb|Fraternal twins at two weeks old. The technical term for \"fraternal\" is \"polyzygotic\".]]\n[[File:Being a twin means you always have a pillow or blanket handy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap.

This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.\n\nRecent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by [[assisted reproductive technology]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kulkarni AD, Jamieson DJ, Jones HW, Kissin DM, Gallo MF, Macaluso M, Adashi EY | title = Fertility Treatments and Multiple Births in the United States | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 23 | pages = 2218\u20132225 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24304051 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1301467 }}</ref>\n\n===Twins===\n{{Main|Twin}}\n\nTwins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans.

The hyperovulation gene is the cause for having twins and is only a factor for the mother. Although the male does not influence his partner's chances of having twins, he could influence his children's chances for having twins. If a male carries the gene for hyperovulation and has a daughter, she may also have the gene for hyperovulation and then have twins herself.\n\nMonozygotic (identical) twins do not run in families. The twinning is random, due to the egg splitting, so all parents have an equal chance of conceiving identical twins.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bellefonds |first1=Colleen |title=Do Twins Really Run in Families? |url=https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/twins-and-multiples/do-twins-really-run-in-families/ |website=What to Expect |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Triplets===\n{{further|List of triplets}}\n[[File:TripletsGirls.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.]]\n[[File:Nurse checking triplets.jpg|thumb|A pediatric nurse checking recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria 2004]]\n[[File:UOTW 19 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound<ref>{{cite web|title=UOTW #19 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=23 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509073218/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|archivedate=9 May 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nTriplets can be either fraternal, identical, or a combination of both. The most common are strictly fraternal triplets, which come from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Less common are triplets from a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two identical fetuses, and the other does not. Least common are identical triplets; three fetuses from one egg. In this case the original zygote divides into two, and then one of those two zygotes divides again but the other does not.\n[[File:2004-03-29 Evangel Triplets 10 cropped.jpg|thumb|Recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria March 29, 2004.]]\nTriplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, \"No one really knows the incidence\".<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" />\n\nIdentical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets).

By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets.

Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.\n\nThe appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available.

A similar pair of twin sisters are [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] (of [[Trojan War#Elopement of Paris and Helen|Troy]]) and [[Clytemnestra]] (who are also sisters of [[Dioscuri|Castor and Polydeuces]]).

Out of all the assisted reproductive technology available that is currently in practice, in vitro fertilization has the highest chance of producing multiple offspring. Per each female egg, IVF currently has a 60-70% chance of conceiving. Fertilization is made possible by administering a fertility drug to the eggs or by directly injecting semen into the eggs.<ref name=\":0\" /> There is an increased chance for women over the age of 35 to have multiple births.<ref name=\"pmid16497698\" /> IVF is a common genetic and ethical topic.

[[Selective reduction]] usually occurs for pregnancies assisted by assisted reproductive technology (ART). The first multifetal pregnancy reductions to occur in a clinical setting took place in the 1980s. Multiple pregnancies do not occur from a genetic predisposition. The genetic biology that results in twins is the fertilization of an egg or more at the time of conception. The procedure aims to reduce pregnancies down to approximately one to two fetuses. The overarching purpose of the procedure is not primarily to simply terminate life, but to increase the survival and success of the mother and babies. However, multifetal pregnancy reduction raises some ethical questions. The main argument is similar to abortion ethics ([[Abortion debate]]) in reduction of fetus versus fetus life. The protection of maternal well being versus harm of newly formed fetal life is an extension of the aforementioned ethical question.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Radhika|date=August 2015|title=Selective Reduction: \"A Soft Cover for Hard Choices\" or Another Name for Abortion?|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=43|issue=2|pages=196\u2013205|doi=10.1111/jlme.12233|pmid=26242939|issn=1073-1105}}</ref> It can be viewed that all life is important and that no life should be terminated without consent from the life that is being terminated.

Identical triplets are very rare.]]\nA '''multiple birth''' is the culmination of one multiple [[pregnancy]], wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to [[vertebrate]] species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in ''[[twin]]s'' and ''triplets''. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a ''[[Litter (animal)|litter]]'', and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.\n\nA multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these factors.  A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called ''monozygotic'', from two zygotes is called ''dizygotic'', or from three or more zygotes is called ''polyzygotic''. \nSimilarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.\n\nEach fertilized [[ovum|egg]] ([[zygote]]) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called ''fraternal'' and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called ''identical''. Identical twins are always the same sex, except in cases of [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (also known as XXY syndrome and 47,XXY syndrome).\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:TwinsTwins.JPG|right|thumb|Fraternal twins at two weeks old.

This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.\n\nRecent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births.

The hyperovulation gene is the cause for having twins and is only a factor for the mother. Although the male does not influence his partner's chances of having twins, he could influence his children's chances for having twins. If a male carries the gene for hyperovulation and has a daughter, she may also have the gene for hyperovulation and then have twins herself.\n\nMonozygotic (identical) twins do not run in families.

The most common are strictly fraternal triplets, which come from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Less common are triplets from a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two identical fetuses, and the other does not. Least common are identical triplets; three fetuses from one egg.

Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two.

One of the twins ([[Castor and Pollux|Polydeuces]], [[Heracles]]) is the illegitimate son of the god [[Zeus]]; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] (of [[Trojan War#Elopement of Paris and Helen|Troy]]) and [[Clytemnestra]] (who are also sisters of [[Dioscuri|Castor and Polydeuces]]). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called ''[[superfecundation#Use in mythology|superfecundation]]''.\n\nIn certain medieval European [[chivalric romance]]s, such as [[Marie de France]]'s ''[[Le Fresne (lai)|Le Fresne]]'', a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children.<ref>Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p295, 244 New York Burt Franklin,1963</ref>  A similar effect occurs in the [[Knight of the Swan]] romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before [[Child abandonment#In fiction|exposing]] the children.<ref>Laura A.

Out of all the assisted reproductive technology available that is currently in practice, in vitro fertilization has the highest chance of producing multiple offspring. Per each female egg, IVF currently has a 60-70% chance of conceiving. Fertilization is made possible by administering a fertility drug to the eggs or by directly injecting semen into the eggs.<ref name=\":0\" /> There is an increased chance for women over the age of 35 to have multiple births.<ref name=\"pmid16497698\" /> IVF is a common genetic and ethical topic. Through IVF individuals can produce offspring successfully when natural procreation is not viable. However, in vitro can become genetically specific and allow for the selection of particular genes or expressible traits to be dominantly present in the formed embryo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sigalos|first=George \u0391.|last2=Triantafyllidou|first2=Olga|last3=Vlahos|first3=Nikos F.|date=2016-09-15|title=Novel embryo selection techniques to increase embryo implantation in IVF attempts|journal=Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics|volume=294|issue=6|pages=1117\u20131124|doi=10.1007/s00404-016-4196-5|pmid=27628754|issn=0932-0067}}</ref> Ethical dilemmas arise when determining health care coverage and the deviation from natural selection and gene variations.

[[Selective reduction]] usually occurs for pregnancies assisted by assisted reproductive technology (ART). The first multifetal pregnancy reductions to occur in a clinical setting took place in the 1980s. Multiple pregnancies do not occur from a genetic predisposition. The genetic biology that results in twins is the fertilization of an egg or more at the time of conception. The procedure aims to reduce pregnancies down to approximately one to two fetuses. The overarching purpose of the procedure is not primarily to simply terminate life, but to increase the survival and success of the mother and babies. However, multifetal pregnancy reduction raises some ethical questions. The main argument is similar to abortion ethics ([[Abortion debate]]) in reduction of fetus versus fetus life. The protection of maternal well being versus harm of newly formed fetal life is an extension of the aforementioned ethical question.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Radhika|date=August 2015|title=Selective Reduction: \"A Soft Cover for Hard Choices\" or Another Name for Abortion?|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=43|issue=2|pages=196\u2013205|doi=10.1111/jlme.12233|pmid=26242939|issn=1073-1105}}</ref> It can be viewed that all life is important and that no life should be terminated without consent from the life that is being terminated.
