The Choral Fantasy, Op. 80 (1808), basically a [[piano concerto]] movement, brings in a choir and vocal soloists near the end for the climax. The vocal forces sing a theme first played instrumentally, and this theme is reminiscent of the corresponding theme in the Ninth Symphony (for a detailed comparison, see [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]]).\n\nGoing further back, an earlier version of the Choral Fantasy theme is found in the song \"Gegenliebe\" (Returned Love) for piano and high voice, which dates from before 1795.{{sfn|Hopkins|1981|p=249}} According to Robert W.

After performing in Beethoven's 1824 premiere, Unger then found fame in Italy and Paris. Italian composers [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were known to have written roles specifically for her voice.<ref>[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] and Bourne, Joyce (1996).

However, two years earlier, Umlauf had watched as the composer's attempt to conduct a [[dress rehearsal]] of his opera ''[[Fidelio]]'' ended in disaster. So this time, he instructed the singers and musicians to ignore the almost totally deaf Beethoven. At the beginning of every part, Beethoven, who sat by the stage, gave the tempos. He was turning the pages of his score and beating time for an orchestra he could not hear.\n\nThere are a number of anecdotes about the premiere of the Ninth. Based on the testimony of the participants, there are suggestions that it was underrehearsed (there were only two full rehearsals) and rather scrappy in execution.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachs|2010|p=22}}</ref> On the other hand, the premiere was a great success. In any case, Beethoven was not to blame, as violinist [[Joseph B\u00f6hm]] recalled:\n\n{{quote|Beethoven himself conducted, that is, he stood in front of a conductor's stand and threw himself back and forth like a madman. At one moment he stretched to his full height, at the next he crouched down to the floor, he flailed about with his hands and feet as though he wanted to play all the instruments and sing all the chorus parts.\u2014The actual direction was in [Louis] Duport's{{refn|group=n|Presumably, B\u00f6hm meant the conductor Michael Umlauf}} hands; we musicians followed his baton only.<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=22}}</ref>}}\n\nWhen the audience applauded\u2014testimonies differ over whether at the end of the [[scherzo]] or symphony\u2014Beethoven was several bars off and still conducting. Because of that, the contralto Caroline Unger walked over and turned Beethoven around to accept the audience's cheers and applause. According to the critic for the ''Theater-Zeitung'', \"the public received the musical hero with the utmost respect and sympathy, listened to his wonderful, gigantic creations with the most absorbed attention and broke out in jubilant applause, often during sections, and repeatedly at the end of them.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=23}}</ref> The audience acclaimed him through [[standing ovation]]s five times; there were handkerchiefs in the air, hats, and raised hands, so that Beethoven, who could not hear the applause, could at least see the ovations.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachs|2010|pp=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\n===Editions===\nThe first German edition was printed by [[Schott Music|B.

[[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], too, had used this arrangement in a number of his own works such as the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Opus 33 No. 2|String Quartet No. 30 in E{{music|flat}} major]], as did [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] in three of the [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|Haydn Quartets]] and the [[String Quintet No. 4 (Mozart)|G minor String Quintet]].\n\n=== I. Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso ===\nThe first movement is in [[sonata form]] without an [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] [[Repeat sign|repeat]]. It begins with [[open fifth]]s (A and E) played ''[[Dynamics (music)#Dynamic markings|pianissimo]]'' by [[tremolo]] strings, steadily building up until the first main theme in [[D minor]] at m. 17.<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=28}}</ref>\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n    \\relative c''' {\n        \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n        \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 88\n        \\key d \\minor\n        \\time 2/4\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #17\n\n        \\partial 32 d32\\ff^\\markup \"First theme\"\n        a4~ a8.. f32\n        d8.. a32 f8. a32( f)\n        d4~ d16 f'-. e-. d-.\n        a'8-. g-. e-. a-.\n        d,8.\\sf\n    }\n</score>\n\nThe opening, with its perfect fifth quietly emerging, resembles the sound of an orchestra [[Musical tuning|tuning up]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/beethovenssympho0000youn|title=Beethoven's Symphonies: A Guided Tour|last=Young|first=John Bell|publisher=Amadeus Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1574671698|location=New York|oclc=180757068|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nAt the outset of the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] (which repeats the main melodic themes) in m. 301, the theme returns, this time played ''fortissimo'' and in D ''major'', rather than D ''minor''. The movement ends with a massive [[Coda (music)|coda]] that takes up nearly a quarter of the movement, as in Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphonies]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=30}}</ref>\n\nA typical performance lasts about 15 minutes.\n\n=== II. Molto vivace ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe second movement is a [[scherzo|scherzo and trio]]. Like the first movement, the scherzo is in D minor, with the introduction bearing a passing resemblance to the opening theme of the first movement, a pattern also found in the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' piano sonata]], written a few years earlier. At times during the piece, Beethoven specifies one downbeat every three bars\u2014perhaps because of the fast tempo\u2014with the direction ''ritmo di tre battute'' (rhythm of three beats) and one beat every four bars with the direction ''ritmo di quattro battute'' (rhythm of four beats). Beethoven had been criticized before for failing to adhere to standard Classical form for his compositions. He used this movement to answer his critics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Normally, a scherzo is in [[Triple metre|triple time]]. Beethoven wrote this piece in triple time but punctuated it in a way that, when coupled with the tempo, makes it sound as if it is in [[Duple and quadruple metre|quadruple time]].\n\nWhile adhering to the standard [[Ternary form#Compound ternary or trio form|compound ternary design]] (three-part structure) of a dance movement (scherzo-trio-scherzo or minuet-trio-minuet), the scherzo section has an elaborate internal structure; it is a complete sonata form. Within this sonata form, the first group of the exposition (the statement of the main melodic themes) starts out with a [[fugue]] in D minor on the subject below.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n    \\relative c''' {\n        \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n        \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2. = 116\n        \\key d \\minor\n        \\time 3/4\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #9\n        \\bar \"\"\n\n        a4.\\pp^\\markup \"First theme\" a,8 a4\n        d4-. e-. f-.\n        e-. f-. g-.\n        f-. e-. d-.\n        f e d\n        c b a\n        gis a b\n        a gis a\n    }\n</score>\n\nFor the second subject, it modulates to the unusual key of [[C major]]. The exposition then repeats before a short [[development section]], where Beethoven explores other ideas. The recapitulation (repeating of the melodic themes heard in the opening of the movement) further develops the exposition's themes, also containing timpani solos. A new development section leads to the repeat of the recapitulation, and the scherzo concludes with a brief [[Coda (music)#Codetta|codetta]].\n\nThe contrasting trio section is in [[D major]] and in duple time. The trio is the first time the trombones play. Following the trio, the second occurrence of the scherzo, unlike the first, plays through without any repetition, after which there is a brief reprise of the trio, and the movement ends with an abrupt coda.\n\nThe duration of the movement is about 12 minutes, but this may vary depending on whether two (frequently omitted) repeats are played.\n\n=== III. Adagio molto e cantabile ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe third movement is a lyrical, slow movement in [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]]\u2014a [[minor sixth]] away from the symphony's main key of D minor. It is in a [[Double variation|double variation form]], with each pair of variations progressively elaborating the rhythm and melodic ideas. The first variation, like the theme, is in {{music|time|4|4}} time, the second in {{music|time|12|8}}. The variations are separated by passages in {{music|time|3|4}}, the first in D major, the second in [[G major]], the third in [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]], and the fourth in [[B major]]. The final variation is twice interrupted by episodes in which loud [[fanfare]]s from the full orchestra are answered by octaves by the first violins. A prominent French horn solo is assigned to the fourth player.\n\nA performance lasts about 16 minutes.\n\n===IV. Finale===\nThe choral finale is Beethoven's musical representation of universal brotherhood based on the \"[[Ode to Joy]]\" theme and is in theme and [[Variation (music)|variations]] form.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\\new Score {\n  \\new Staff {\n    \\relative c {\n      \\set Staff.instrumentName = #\"Vc.\"\n      \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"cello\"\n      \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #92\n      \\time 4/4\n      \\key d \\major\n      \\clef bass\n      \\tempo \"Allegro assai\" 2 = 60\n      \\set Score.tempoHideNote=##t\n      \\bar \"\"\n        fis2\\p( g4 a) | a4( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | fis4.( e8) e2 |\n        fis2( g4 a) | a4( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | e4.( d8) d2 | \\break\n        e( fis4 d) | e( fis8 g fis4 d) | e( fis8 g fis4 e) | d( e a,) fis'~ |\n        fis fis( g a) | a( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | e4.( d8) d2\n    }\n  }\n}\n</score>\n\nThe movement starts with an introduction in which musical material from each of the preceding three movements\u2014though none are literal quotations of previous music<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=36}}</ref>\u2014are successively presented and then dismissed by [[Recitative#Instrumental recitative|instrumental recitatives]] played by the low strings. Following this, the \"Ode to Joy\" theme is finally introduced by the cellos and double basses. After three instrumental variations on this theme, the human voice is presented for the first time in the symphony by the baritone soloist, who sings words written by Beethoven himself: <nowiki>''</nowiki>''O Freunde, nicht diese T\u00f6ne!' Sondern la\u00dft uns angenehmere anstimmen, und freudenvollere''.<nowiki>''</nowiki> (\"Oh friends, not these sounds!

Indeed, it is longer than some entire symphonies of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. Its form has been disputed by musicologists, as [[Nicholas Cook]] explains:\n\n{{Quote|Beethoven had difficulty describing the finale himself; in letters to publishers, he said that it was like his Choral Fantasy, Op. 80, only on a much grander scale. We might call it a [[cantata]] constructed round a series of variations on the \"Joy\" theme. But this is rather a loose formulation, at least by comparison with the way in which many twentieth-century critics have tried to codify the movement's form. Thus there have been interminable arguments as to whether it should be seen as a kind of sonata form (with the [[Turkish music (style)|\"Turkish\" music]] of bar 331, which is in B{{music|flat}} major, functioning as a kind of second group), or a kind of [[Concerto|concerto form]] (with bars 1\u2013207 and 208\u2013330 together making up a double exposition), or even a conflation of four symphonic movements into one (with bars 331\u2013594 representing a Scherzo, and bars 595\u2013654 a slow movement). The reason these arguments are interminable is that each interpretation contributes something to the understanding of the movement, but does not represent the whole story.<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=34}}</ref>}}\n\nCook gives the following table describing the form of the movement:<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=35}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: Silver\"|Bar\n! style=\"background: Silver\" | Key\n! style=\"background: Silver\" | Stanza\n! style=\"background: Silver\" | Description\n|-\n|1\n|1{{refn|group=n|The second column of bar numbers refers to the editions in which the finale is subdivided.

It begins at ''Alla marcia'' (m. 331) and concludes with a {{music|time|6|8}} variation of the main theme with [[Choir|chorus]].\n* Third \"movement\": Slow meditation with a new theme on the text \"''Seid umschlungen, Millionen!''\" It begins at ''Andante maestoso'' (m. 595).\n* Fourth \"movement\": [[fugue|Fugato]] finale on the themes of the first and third \"movements\". It begins at ''Allegro energico'' (m. 763).\n\nThe movement has a thematic unity in which every part is based on either the main theme, the \"Seid umschlungen\" theme, or some combination of the two.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Indeed, Rosen also notes that the movement can also be analysed as a set of variations and simultaneously as a concerto sonata form with double exposition (with the fugato acting both as a development section and the second tutti of the concerto).<ref name=Rosen/>\n\n====Text of the fourth movement====\n[[File:Friedrich Schiller by Ludovike Simanowiz.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Friedrich Schiller]] by [[Ludovike Simanowiz]] (1794)]]\nThe text is largely taken from [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s \"[[Ode to Joy]]\", with a few additional introductory words written specifically by Beethoven (shown in italics).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raptusassociation.org/ode1785.html|title=Beethoven Foundation \u2013 Schiller's \"An die Freude\" and Authoritative Translation|access-date=5 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923211420/http://www.raptusassociation.org/ode1785.html|archive-date=23 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The text, without repeats, is shown below, with a translation into English.<ref>The translation is taken from the [[BBC Proms]] 2013 programme, for a concert held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/whats-on/2013/august-11/14710 Prom 38, 11 August 2013]).

Gutman, Mozart's K. 222 Offertory in D minor, \"Misericordias Domini\", written in 1775, contains a melody that foreshadows \"Ode to Joy\".<ref>Robert W.

However, two years earlier, Umlauf had watched as the composer's attempt to conduct a [[dress rehearsal]] of his opera ''[[Fidelio]]'' ended in disaster. So this time, he instructed the singers and musicians to ignore the almost totally deaf Beethoven. At the beginning of every part, Beethoven, who sat by the stage, gave the tempos. He was turning the pages of his score and beating time for an orchestra he could not hear.\n\nThere are a number of anecdotes about the premiere of the Ninth. Based on the testimony of the participants, there are suggestions that it was underrehearsed (there were only two full rehearsals) and rather scrappy in execution.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachs|2010|p=22}}</ref> On the other hand, the premiere was a great success. In any case, Beethoven was not to blame, as violinist [[Joseph B\u00f6hm]] recalled:\n\n{{quote|Beethoven himself conducted, that is, he stood in front of a conductor's stand and threw himself back and forth like a madman. At one moment he stretched to his full height, at the next he crouched down to the floor, he flailed about with his hands and feet as though he wanted to play all the instruments and sing all the chorus parts.\u2014The actual direction was in [Louis] Duport's{{refn|group=n|Presumably, B\u00f6hm meant the conductor Michael Umlauf}} hands; we musicians followed his baton only.<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=22}}</ref>}}\n\nWhen the audience applauded\u2014testimonies differ over whether at the end of the [[scherzo]] or symphony\u2014Beethoven was several bars off and still conducting. Because of that, the contralto Caroline Unger walked over and turned Beethoven around to accept the audience's cheers and applause. According to the critic for the ''Theater-Zeitung'', \"the public received the musical hero with the utmost respect and sympathy, listened to his wonderful, gigantic creations with the most absorbed attention and broke out in jubilant applause, often during sections, and repeatedly at the end of them.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=23}}</ref> The audience acclaimed him through [[standing ovation]]s five times; there were handkerchiefs in the air, hats, and raised hands, so that Beethoven, who could not hear the applause, could at least see the ovations.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachs|2010|pp=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\n===Editions===\nThe first German edition was printed by [[Schott Music|B.

[[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], too, had used this arrangement in a number of his own works such as the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Opus 33 No. 2|String Quartet No. 30 in E{{music|flat}} major]], as did [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] in three of the [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|Haydn Quartets]] and the [[String Quintet No. 4 (Mozart)|G minor String Quintet]].\n\n=== I. Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso ===\nThe first movement is in [[sonata form]] without an [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] [[Repeat sign|repeat]]. It begins with [[open fifth]]s (A and E) played ''[[Dynamics (music)#Dynamic markings|pianissimo]]'' by [[tremolo]] strings, steadily building up until the first main theme in [[D minor]] at m. 17.<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=28}}</ref>\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n    \\relative c''' {\n        \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n        \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 88\n        \\key d \\minor\n        \\time 2/4\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #17\n\n        \\partial 32 d32\\ff^\\markup \"First theme\"\n        a4~ a8.. f32\n        d8.. a32 f8. a32( f)\n        d4~ d16 f'-. e-. d-.\n        a'8-. g-. e-. a-.\n        d,8.\\sf\n    }\n</score>\n\nThe opening, with its perfect fifth quietly emerging, resembles the sound of an orchestra [[Musical tuning|tuning up]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/beethovenssympho0000youn|title=Beethoven's Symphonies: A Guided Tour|last=Young|first=John Bell|publisher=Amadeus Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1574671698|location=New York|oclc=180757068|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nAt the outset of the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] (which repeats the main melodic themes) in m. 301, the theme returns, this time played ''fortissimo'' and in D ''major'', rather than D ''minor''. The movement ends with a massive [[Coda (music)|coda]] that takes up nearly a quarter of the movement, as in Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphonies]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=30}}</ref>\n\nA typical performance lasts about 15 minutes.\n\n=== II. Molto vivace ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe second movement is a [[scherzo|scherzo and trio]]. Like the first movement, the scherzo is in D minor, with the introduction bearing a passing resemblance to the opening theme of the first movement, a pattern also found in the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' piano sonata]], written a few years earlier. At times during the piece, Beethoven specifies one downbeat every three bars\u2014perhaps because of the fast tempo\u2014with the direction ''ritmo di tre battute'' (rhythm of three beats) and one beat every four bars with the direction ''ritmo di quattro battute'' (rhythm of four beats). Beethoven had been criticized before for failing to adhere to standard Classical form for his compositions. He used this movement to answer his critics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Normally, a scherzo is in [[Triple metre|triple time]]. Beethoven wrote this piece in triple time but punctuated it in a way that, when coupled with the tempo, makes it sound as if it is in [[Duple and quadruple metre|quadruple time]].\n\nWhile adhering to the standard [[Ternary form#Compound ternary or trio form|compound ternary design]] (three-part structure) of a dance movement (scherzo-trio-scherzo or minuet-trio-minuet), the scherzo section has an elaborate internal structure; it is a complete sonata form. Within this sonata form, the first group of the exposition (the statement of the main melodic themes) starts out with a [[fugue]] in D minor on the subject below.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n    \\relative c''' {\n        \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n        \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2. = 116\n        \\key d \\minor\n        \\time 3/4\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #9\n        \\bar \"\"\n\n        a4.\\pp^\\markup \"First theme\" a,8 a4\n        d4-. e-. f-.\n        e-. f-. g-.\n        f-. e-. d-.\n        f e d\n        c b a\n        gis a b\n        a gis a\n    }\n</score>\n\nFor the second subject, it modulates to the unusual key of [[C major]]. The exposition then repeats before a short [[development section]], where Beethoven explores other ideas. The recapitulation (repeating of the melodic themes heard in the opening of the movement) further develops the exposition's themes, also containing timpani solos. A new development section leads to the repeat of the recapitulation, and the scherzo concludes with a brief [[Coda (music)#Codetta|codetta]].\n\nThe contrasting trio section is in [[D major]] and in duple time. The trio is the first time the trombones play. Following the trio, the second occurrence of the scherzo, unlike the first, plays through without any repetition, after which there is a brief reprise of the trio, and the movement ends with an abrupt coda.\n\nThe duration of the movement is about 12 minutes, but this may vary depending on whether two (frequently omitted) repeats are played.\n\n=== III. Adagio molto e cantabile ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe third movement is a lyrical, slow movement in [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]]\u2014a [[minor sixth]] away from the symphony's main key of D minor. It is in a [[Double variation|double variation form]], with each pair of variations progressively elaborating the rhythm and melodic ideas. The first variation, like the theme, is in {{music|time|4|4}} time, the second in {{music|time|12|8}}. The variations are separated by passages in {{music|time|3|4}}, the first in D major, the second in [[G major]], the third in [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]], and the fourth in [[B major]]. The final variation is twice interrupted by episodes in which loud [[fanfare]]s from the full orchestra are answered by octaves by the first violins. A prominent French horn solo is assigned to the fourth player.\n\nA performance lasts about 16 minutes.\n\n===IV. Finale===\nThe choral finale is Beethoven's musical representation of universal brotherhood based on the \"[[Ode to Joy]]\" theme and is in theme and [[Variation (music)|variations]] form.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\\new Score {\n  \\new Staff {\n    \\relative c {\n      \\set Staff.instrumentName = #\"Vc.\"\n      \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"cello\"\n      \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #92\n      \\time 4/4\n      \\key d \\major\n      \\clef bass\n      \\tempo \"Allegro assai\" 2 = 60\n      \\set Score.tempoHideNote=##t\n      \\bar \"\"\n        fis2\\p( g4 a) | a4( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | fis4.( e8) e2 |\n        fis2( g4 a) | a4( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | e4.( d8) d2 | \\break\n        e( fis4 d) | e( fis8 g fis4 d) | e( fis8 g fis4 e) | d( e a,) fis'~ |\n        fis fis( g a) | a( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | e4.( d8) d2\n    }\n  }\n}\n</score>\n\nThe movement starts with an introduction in which musical material from each of the preceding three movements\u2014though none are literal quotations of previous music<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=36}}</ref>\u2014are successively presented and then dismissed by [[Recitative#Instrumental recitative|instrumental recitatives]] played by the low strings. Following this, the \"Ode to Joy\" theme is finally introduced by the cellos and double basses. After three instrumental variations on this theme, the human voice is presented for the first time in the symphony by the baritone soloist, who sings words written by Beethoven himself: <nowiki>''</nowiki>''O Freunde, nicht diese T\u00f6ne!' Sondern la\u00dft uns angenehmere anstimmen, und freudenvollere''.<nowiki>''</nowiki> (\"Oh friends, not these sounds!

Indeed, it is longer than some entire symphonies of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. Its form has been disputed by musicologists, as [[Nicholas Cook]] explains:\n\n{{Quote|Beethoven had difficulty describing the finale himself; in letters to publishers, he said that it was like his Choral Fantasy, Op. 80, only on a much grander scale. We might call it a [[cantata]] constructed round a series of variations on the \"Joy\" theme. But this is rather a loose formulation, at least by comparison with the way in which many twentieth-century critics have tried to codify the movement's form.

He has an older sister Lee So-ra. Raised in a family that struggled financially, he was interested in street performing as a child. Inspired by the likes of [[H.O.T. (band)|H.O.T's]] [[Jang Woo-hyuk]], [[Michael Jackson]] and singer-dancer [[Steve Seungjun Yoo|Yoo Seung-jun]], Eunhyuk trained himself at a young age. In elementary school he started a dance crew, 'SRD', which stood for ''Song Rap and Dance''. The group consisted of him and his childhood friends [[Junsu|Kim Junsu]], Hwang Tae Jun, and Choi Min Seok.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jeon|first=Su Mi|title=Past Photos of Eunhyuk, JYJ Kim Junsu and Choi Yoon Young Revealed|url=http://enewsworld.mnet.com/enews/contents.asp?idx=7341|accessdate=1 June 2012|newspaper=enewsWorld|date=30 May 2012|agency=CJ E&M}}</ref> The crew's popularity prospered in their hometown; and when SRD appeared in a local newspaper, it was then that Eunhyuk cemented his dream to become a singer/performer.\n\nIn 1999, together with Junsu he auditioned for [[SM Entertainment]] through the company's ''Starlight Casting System'' at age 13. However he failed the audition in 1999 and entered again the following year and got in as a trainee. He began training in singing, dancing, acting, and had brief [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] language courses. He was also scouted with an interview offer from a top modelling agency in [[Seoul]], yet declined due to contract issues. In the midst of trainee life in 2000, he reached SM's master dance class and won the Goyang citywide dance competition in 2000.

He has an older sister Lee So-ra. Raised in a family that struggled financially, he was interested in street performing as a child. Inspired by the likes of [[H.O.T. (band)|H.O.T's]] [[Jang Woo-hyuk]], [[Michael Jackson]] and singer-dancer [[Steve Seungjun Yoo|Yoo Seung-jun]], Eunhyuk trained himself at a young age. In elementary school he started a dance crew, 'SRD', which stood for ''Song Rap and Dance''. The group consisted of him and his childhood friends [[Junsu|Kim Junsu]], Hwang Tae Jun, and Choi Min Seok.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jeon|first=Su Mi|title=Past Photos of Eunhyuk, JYJ Kim Junsu and Choi Yoon Young Revealed|url=http://enewsworld.mnet.com/enews/contents.asp?idx=7341|accessdate=1 June 2012|newspaper=enewsWorld|date=30 May 2012|agency=CJ E&M}}</ref> The crew's popularity prospered in their hometown; and when SRD appeared in a local newspaper, it was then that Eunhyuk cemented his dream to become a singer/performer.\n\nIn 1999, together with Junsu he auditioned for [[SM Entertainment]] through the company's ''Starlight Casting System'' at age 13.

He began training in singing, dancing, acting, and had brief [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] language courses. He was also scouted with an interview offer from a top modelling agency in [[Seoul]], yet declined due to contract issues. In the midst of trainee life in 2000, he reached SM's master dance class and won the Goyang citywide dance competition in 2000. In 2002, Eunhyuk, [[Junsu|Kim Junsu]], and another trainee [[Lee Sung-min (singer)|Sungmin]] were placed in a project [[R&B]] group. A year later, the group along with three future members from [[TRAX (band)|TRAX]] ([[Typhoon (Korean singer)|Jay Kim]], No Minwoo, Kang Jungwoo) made a brief appearance in a show called ''Heejun vs. [[Kangta]], Battle of the Century: Pop vs. Rock'', in which [[Moon Hee-joon]] and [[Kangta]] taught them techniques on different types of singing.
