It also presents the theory of [[comparative advantage]], the theory that [[free trade]] between two or more countries can be mutually beneficial, even when one country has an [[absolute advantage]] over the other countries in all areas of production.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, Ricardo grew weary of the Corn Laws, a tax imposed on wheat by the British that made it impossible to import wheat from the rest of Europe.<ref> \u201cCorn Meets Iron.\u201d A Little History of Economics, by Niall Kishtainy, Yale University Press, 2018, pp. 37\u201342. </ref> Ricardo, despite his wealth, supported those who could no longer afford grains and bread once the price floor was in effect to support farmers. In his argument, for what is now free trade, Ricardo highlights the idea that if a country can get a good from another country at a lower cost, it would behoove a country to source that item from the cheaper producing country than to produce the good locally.  \u201cTo produce the wine in Portugal, might require only the labour of 80 men for one year, and to produce the cloth in the same country, might require the labour of 90 men for the same time. It would therefore be advantageous for her to export wine in exchange for cloth.\u201d<ref>Ricardo, David. On The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. John Murray, 1817. </ref> Ricardo\u2019s theory demonstrates that a country, when choosing between two goods to produce and trade, could still achieve an advantage by focusing on the good requiring fewer resources to produce, even if the country does not have an absolute advantage in that good. This allow countries with an absolute advantage in multiple goods, or with no absolute advantage at all, to still benefit from international trade.  \n\nRicardo claims in the preface that [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], Stuart,{{who|date=April 2020}} [[Adam Smith]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[Sismondi]], and others had not written enough \"satisfactory information\" on the topics of rent, profit, and wages. ''Principles of Political Economy'' is Ricardo's effort to fill that gap in the literature. Regardless of whether the book achieved that goal, it secured, according to [[Ronald Max Hartwell]], Ricardo's position among the great classical economists [[Adam Smith]], [[Thomas Malthus]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Karl Marx]].\n\nIn his book ''Adam's Fallacy: A Guide to Economic Theology'', economist [[Duncan K. Foley]] highlights that in the ''Principles'' Ricardo criticizes Adam Smith's treatment of the theory of value and distribution for [[circular reasoning]], in particular as far as concerns [[economic rent|rent]], and that Ricardo considers the [[labor theory of value]], properly understood, a more logically sound basis for political economic reasoning.<ref name = \"Foley\"/>\n\nFoley also discusses the chapter ''On Machinery'', which Ricardo included in his third and final (1821) version of ''Principles''. Here Ricardo famously analysed the impact of the adoption of machinery on the different classes of society, revising his earlier view that [[mechanization]] could be expected to be of benefit to each of the classes of the society. The increase in productivity due to mechanization lowers the production costs and thus also the real prices of commodities. Whereas the landowning class and capitalists benefit from the lower prices, workers in contrast do not reap such benefit from the lower prices if capitalists reduce the wage fund in order to finance the expensive machinery, causing [[technological unemployment]] among workers. In this case, Ricardo points out, wages are forced down by competition among workers, and the introduction of new machines can lead to an overall decline in the well-being of the working class.<ref name = \"Foley\">[[Duncan K.

The negativity bias has been investigated within many different domains, including the [[impression formation|formation of impressions]] and general evaluations; attention, learning, and memory; and [[decision-making]] and risk considerations.\n\n==Explanations==\n[[Paul Rozin]] and Edward Royzman proposed four elements of the negativity bias in order to explain its manifestation: negative potency, steeper negative gradients, negativity dominance, and negative differentiation.<ref name = \"Rozin & Royzman 2001\" />\n\n'''Negative potency''' refers to the notion that, while possibly of equal magnitude or emotionality, negative and positive items/events/etc. are not equally salient.  Rozin and Royzman note that this characteristic of the negativity bias is only empirically demonstrable in situations with inherent measurability, such as comparing how positively or negatively a change in temperature is interpreted.\n\nWith respect to positive and negative gradients, it appears to be the case that negative events are thought to be perceived as increasingly more negative than positive events are increasingly positive the closer one gets (spatially or temporally) to the [[affect (psychology)|affective]] event itself.  In other words, there is a '''steeper negative gradient''' than positive gradient.  For example, the negative experience of an impending dental surgery is perceived as increasingly more negative the closer one gets to the date of surgery than the positive experience of an impending party is perceived as increasingly more positive the closer one gets to the date of celebration  (assuming for the sake of this example that these events are equally positive and negative).  Rozin and Royzman argue that this characteristic is distinct from that of negative potency because there appears to be evidence of steeper negative slopes relative to positive slopes even when potency itself is low.\n\n'''Negativity dominance''' describes the tendency for the combination of positive and negative items/events/etc. to skew towards an overall more negative interpretation than would be suggested by the summation of the individual positive and negative components.  Phrasing in more [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]]-friendly terms, the whole is more negative than the sum of its parts.\n\n'''Negative differentiation''' is consistent with evidence suggesting that the conceptualization of negativity is more elaborate and complex than that of positivity.  For instance, research indicates that negative vocabulary is more richly descriptive of the affective experience than that of positive vocabulary.<ref name=\"Peeters 1971\">{{cite journal |title=The positive-negative asymmetry: On cognitive consistency and positivity bias |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |year=1971 |last=Peeters |first=Guido |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=455\u2013474 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420010405 |url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/176069 }}</ref>  Furthermore, there appear to be more terms employed to indicate negative emotions than positive emotions.<ref>Averill, J.

Honesty is considered more easily tarnished by acts of dishonesty.

Even though the positive and negative elements of the words were immaterial to the color-naming task, participants were slower to name the color of negative traits than they were positive traits.  This difference in response latencies indicates that greater attention was devoted to processing the trait itself when it was negative.\n\nAside from studies of eye blinks and color naming, Baumeister and colleagues noted in their review of bad events versus good events <ref name = \"Baumeister et al. 2001\" /> that there is also easily accessible, real-world evidence for this attentional bias: bad news sells more papers and the bulk of successful novels are full of negative events and turmoil. When taken in conjunction with the laboratory-based experiments, there is strong support for the notion that negative information generally has a stronger pull on attention than does positive information.\n\n====Learning and memory====\nLearning and memory are direct consequences of attentional processing: the more attention is directed or devoted toward something, the more likely it is that it will be later learned and remembered.

Rozin and Royzman note that this characteristic of the negativity bias is only empirically demonstrable in situations with inherent measurability, such as comparing how positively or negatively a change in temperature is interpreted.\n\nWith respect to positive and negative gradients, it appears to be the case that negative events are thought to be perceived as increasingly more negative than positive events are increasingly positive the closer one gets (spatially or temporally) to the [[affect (psychology)|affective]] event itself.  In other words, there is a '''steeper negative gradient''' than positive gradient.  For example, the negative experience of an impending dental surgery is perceived as increasingly more negative the closer one gets to the date of surgery than the positive experience of an impending party is perceived as increasingly more positive the closer one gets to the date of celebration  (assuming for the sake of this example that these events are equally positive and negative).  Rozin and Royzman argue that this characteristic is distinct from that of negative potency because there appears to be evidence of steeper negative slopes relative to positive slopes even when potency itself is low.\n\n'''Negativity dominance''' describes the tendency for the combination of positive and negative items/events/etc. to skew towards an overall more negative interpretation than would be suggested by the summation of the individual positive and negative components.  Phrasing in more [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]]-friendly terms, the whole is more negative than the sum of its parts.\n\n'''Negative differentiation''' is consistent with evidence suggesting that the conceptualization of negativity is more elaborate and complex than that of positivity.  For instance, research indicates that negative vocabulary is more richly descriptive of the affective experience than that of positive vocabulary.<ref name=\"Peeters 1971\">{{cite journal |title=The positive-negative asymmetry: On cognitive consistency and positivity bias |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |year=1971 |last=Peeters |first=Guido |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=455\u2013474 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420010405 |url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/176069 }}</ref>  Furthermore, there appear to be more terms employed to indicate negative emotions than positive emotions.<ref>Averill, J.

Honesty is considered more easily tarnished by acts of dishonesty.

The Calthorpe family were forced to sell the property in 1933 not long after Mena and Bill were married and they moved to Sydney, where they bought a shop in Paddington, which was not successful.\n\nCalthorpe took up work in various office roles and continued to write in her spare time.

The Calthorpe family were forced to sell the property in 1933 not long after Mena and Bill were married and they moved to Sydney where they bought a shop in Paddington, which was not successful.\n\nCalthorpe took up work in various office roles and continued to write in her spare time. She joined the School of Modern Writers, a group which included Katharine Susannah Prichard, Sally Bannister and Dorothy Corke. She also attended meetings of the Fellowship of Australian Writers and befriended Dymphna and Mary Cusack and Florence James.\n\nCalthorpe had three novels published. Her first novel, ''The Dye House'' (1961), was short listed for the Miles Franklin Award and republished in 1982. Its subject was the harsh working conditions of her contemporaries and it has since been translated into German.\n\nCalthorpe's second novel, ''The Defectors'' (1969), is about a power struggle in Australian trade unions.\n\nCalthorpe received a grant from the Literature Board, [[Australia Council]] to assist with her third novel, ''The Plain of Ala'' (1989), which tells the story of four generations of an Irish family migrating to Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemdetailpaged.aspx?itemid=127894 | title=State Library of NSW Manuscripts, Oral History and Pictures Collection | accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nCalthorpe was involved in various literary societies and taught creative writing. She and her husband Bill built a house in [[Caringbah, New South Wales|Caringbah]] and she later moved to [[Jannali, New South Wales|Jannali]] where she lived until her death in 1996.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Edward Duyker |  title=Sutherland: Mapping A Literary Heritage | journal=National Library of Australia News | volume=VI | issue= 6 |date = March 1996| pages=14\u201318 }}</ref>\n\nShe told Giulia Giuffre.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Giuffre | first= Giulia |  title=A writing Life: interviews with Australian women writers | publisher=Allen and Unwin |  location=Sydney  | year=1990 | pages=27\u201339 }}</ref> that she and Bill lost their only child  during a caesarean birth. Though initially very upset she later became involved in the Playground movement and children\u2019s holiday camps through the Communist party. She said, of being childless: \"It\u2019s not a great sadness in my life.\"\n\nAlthough some of her short stories were published in newspapers and literary journals, most remain unpublished and the original works and her various interviews and biographical cuttings are stored in the local history collection of the Sutherland Library, the [[State Library of New South Wales]]<ref>http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=127894</ref> and at the [[National Library of Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/35877178?q=%22mena+calthorpe%22&c=collection |title=Mena Calthorpe Collection}}</ref>\n\n==Political involvement==\n\nCalthorpe says she had a politically conscious upbringing thanks to her father\u2019s influence and she joined the Communist Party when she came to Sydney in 1933.\n\nDespite his family\u2019s conservative political stance, her husband Bill\u2019s experiences during the Depression led to him becoming active in the Trade Union movement.\n\nMeanwhile, Mena Calthorpe found that she struggled to afford the cost of being an organiser in the Communist party \u2013 with fares, telephone calls and postage stamps adding up, and so she left the Party after four years.\n\nShe says that she joined the Labor party because she wanted to engage in the struggle between the Party\u2019s left wing and the Catholic Social Studies Movement known as the Groupers founded by [[B. A. Santamaria]]. The Groupers recruited Catholic activists to oppose Communism in the trade unions. Calthorpe says that she worked to defeat the Groupers\u2019 control over the Caringbah Branch of the Labor Party, then the largest ALP branch in New South Wales.\n\nCalthorpe was active in the proletarian women writer's movement of the 1950s and 1960s, with contemporaries [[Katharine Susannah Prichard]], Sally Bannister, and [[Dorothy Hewett]], and continued an active member of the [[Australian Labor Party]] <ref>{{Cite journal| author=Syson, Ian | title=It's my party and I'll cry if I want to: recent autobiographical writings of Australian women communists | journal=Hecate | volume=22 | issue= 2 | year=1996 | pages=144\u2013153 }}</ref> throughout her life.\n\n==Works==\n*''[[The Dyehouse]]'' (1961) Sydney : Ure Smith\n*''The Defectors'' (1969) Sydney : Australasian Book Society\n*''The Plain of Ala'' (1989) Sydney : Hale & Iremonger\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Calthorpe, Mena}}\n[[Category:20th-century Australian novelists]]\n[[Category:Australian activists]]\n[[Category:Australian communists]]\n[[Category:Australian feminist writers]]\n[[Category:Australian women short story writers]]\n[[Category:Australian women novelists]]\n[[Category:People from the Sutherland Shire]]\n[[Category:Socialist feminists]]\n[[Category:Writers from New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1905 births]]\n[[Category:1996 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian women]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian writers]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian short story writers]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "replaced: moved to Sydney \u2192 moved to Sydney,,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (6)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mena_Calthorpe"}

Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word. The Japanese leave and promise and then will constructure a steel bridge value that makes them stand and be courageous because of the Filipino hospitality.\n\nIn December 6, 1987, San Jorge were created as a new municipality respectively out of Gandara. 42 barangays were dissolved by the town of San Jorge including the Gandare\u00f1os owner of Atigbang Senibaran (Villaleona) to the new town administration.\n\n==Barangays==\n\n[[File:Barangays of Gandara.png|thumb|280px|Barangays of Gandara]]\nGandara is politically subdivided into 69 [[barangay]]s, listed here with its Philippine Standard Geographic Code.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Adela Heights ([[Poblacion]])\n* Arong\n* Balocawe\n* Bangahon\n* Beslig\n* Buao\n* Bunyagan\n* Burabod I ([[Poblacion]])\n* Burabod II ([[Poblacion]])\n* Calirocan\n* Canhumawid\n* Caparangasan\n* Caranas\n* Carmona\n* Casab-ahan\n* Casandig\n* Catorse De Agosto\n* Caugbusan\n* Concepcion\n* Diaz\n* Dumalo-ong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Elcano\n* Gerali\n* Gereganan\n* Giaboc\n* Hampton\n* Hetebac\n* Himamaloto\n* Hinayagan\n* Hinugacan\n* Hiparayan (Kinonongan)\n* Jasminez\n* Lungib\n* Mabuhay\n* Macugo\n* Malayog\n* Marcos\n* Minda ([[Poblacion]])\n* Nacube\n* Nalihugan\n* Napalisan\n* Natimonan\n* Ngoso\n* Palambrag\n* Palanas\n* Pi\u00f1aplata\n* Pizarro\n* Pologon\n* Purog\n* Rawis\n* Rizal\n* Samoyao\n* San Agustin\n* San Antonio\n* San Enrique\n* San Francisco\n* San Isidro (Dao)\n* San Jose\n* San Miguel\n* San Pelayo\n* San Ramon\n* Santa Elena\n* Santo Ni\u00f1o\n* Senibaran (Villa Leona)\n* Sidmon\n* Tagnao\n* Tambongan\n* Tawiran\n* Tigbawon\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Gandara, Samar\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 28\n| Jan low C  = 21\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Feb low C  = 21\n| Mar high C = 29\n| Mar low C  = 21\n| Apr high C = 31\n| Apr low C  = 22\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 24\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 24\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 29\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Dec low C  = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 72\n| Feb precipitation mm = 52\n| Mar precipitation mm = 65\n| Apr precipitation mm = 62\n| May precipitation mm = 87\n| Jun precipitation mm = 129\n| Jul precipitation mm = 153\n| Aug precipitation mm = 124\n| Sep precipitation mm = 147\n| Oct precipitation mm = 157\n| Nov precipitation mm = 139\n| Dec precipitation mm = 117\n| Jan rain days        = 17.4\n| Feb rain days        = 13.4\n| Mar rain days        = 16.8\n| Apr rain days        = 18.0\n| May rain days        = 22.0\n| Jun rain days        = 25.3\n| Jul rain days        = 26.2\n| Aug rain days        = 24.2\n| Sep rain days        = 24.9\n| Oct rain days        = 26.0\n| Nov rain days        = 23.3\n| Dec rain days        = 20.8\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/gandara_philippines_1713262\n| title =  Gandara: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 29 February 2020 \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Gandara\n| 1903 = 12014\n| 1918 = 14320\n| 1939 = 18507\n| 1948 = 25048\n| 1960 = 24883\n| 1970 = 28307\n| 1975 = 30600\n| 1980 = 24764\n| 1990 = 23673\n| 1995 = 27263\n| 2000 = 28866\n| 2007 = 31222\n| 2010 = 31943\n| 2015 = 34434\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote = Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] {{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nBased on latest 2014 survey, the total population was 33,264, consisting of 17,046 males and 16,218 females.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

It is located in the old town of Gandara ''(Brgy. Bangahon)''.\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the 9th century, after the Mesopotamian exploration the Hindus explored the Cambaye Island, they bring [https://web.archive.org/web/20120804005759/http://www.anagrasarkalyan.gov.in/htm/gallery_wadi.html Sabai Grass] seedlings, Negritos and the Hindus help together to grow the Grass, when the grass are ripe enough they harvest it and sundried it, Sabai fibres were extracted from Sabai Grasses, they weave the dried grass and turn it into dresses by using a [[catgut]] as a weaver.\n\nOn the 13th century an Arabian-British explorer built and structured this sea farer guide from an Scree with the help of a Negrito inhabitants located nearby with China White as an ingredient as building material, it is lit with a Western Incandescent lamp and powered by a [[Baghdad Battery|Baghdad Carbon Cell]], the said battery is charged by sun at day.\n \nGand\u00e6ra's colonial past is evident from the solitary watchtower, the Friars returned after the remaining crew of Magellan came back from Spain, and situated along the Village called Dapdap and their Shrine called Tinago in 1596, and created a Cabecera called Catbalogan, and the Bangahon Church, the [[relic]]s of the church and fragmented artworks. Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word. The Japanese leave and promise and then will constructure a steel bridge value that makes them stand and be courageous because of the Filipino hospitality.\n\nIn December 6, 1987, San Jorge were created as a new municipality respectively out of Gandara. 42 barangays were dissolved by the town of San Jorge including the Gandare\u00f1os owner of Atigbang Senibaran (Villaleona) to the new town administration.\n\n==Barangays==\n\n[[File:Barangays of Gandara.png|thumb|280px|Barangays of Gandara]]\nGandara is politically subdivided into 69 [[barangay]]s, listed here with its Philippine Standard Geographic Code.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Adela Heights ([[Poblacion]])\n* Arong\n* Balocawe\n* Bangahon\n* Beslig\n* Buao\n* Bunyagan\n* Burabod I ([[Poblacion]])\n* Burabod II ([[Poblacion]])\n* Calirocan\n* Canhumawid\n* Caparangasan\n* Caranas\n* Carmona\n* Casab-ahan\n* Casandig\n* Catorse De Agosto\n* Caugbusan\n* Concepcion\n* Diaz\n* Dumalo-ong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Elcano\n* Gerali\n* Gereganan\n* Giaboc\n* Hampton\n* Hetebac\n* Himamaloto\n* Hinayagan\n* Hinugacan\n* Hiparayan (Kinonongan)\n* Jasminez\n* Lungib\n* Mabuhay\n* Macugo\n* Malayog\n* Marcos\n* Minda ([[Poblacion]])\n* Nacube\n* Nalihugan\n* Napalisan\n* Natimonan\n* Ngoso\n* Palambrag\n* Palanas\n* Pi\u00f1aplata\n* Pizarro\n* Pologon\n* Purog\n* Rawis\n* Rizal\n* Samoyao\n* San Agustin\n* San Antonio\n* San Enrique\n* San Francisco\n* San Isidro (Dao)\n* San Jose\n* San Miguel\n* San Pelayo\n* San Ramon\n* Santa Elena\n* Santo Ni\u00f1o\n* Senibaran (Villa Leona)\n* Sidmon\n* Tagnao\n* Tambongan\n* Tawiran\n* Tigbawon\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Gandara, Samar\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 28\n| Jan low C  = 21\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Feb low C  = 21\n| Mar high C = 29\n| Mar low C  = 21\n| Apr high C = 31\n| Apr low C  = 22\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 24\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 24\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 29\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Dec low C  = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 72\n| Feb precipitation mm = 52\n| Mar precipitation mm = 65\n| Apr precipitation mm = 62\n| May precipitation mm = 87\n| Jun precipitation mm = 129\n| Jul precipitation mm = 153\n| Aug precipitation mm = 124\n| Sep precipitation mm = 147\n| Oct precipitation mm = 157\n| Nov precipitation mm = 139\n| Dec precipitation mm = 117\n| Jan rain days        = 17.4\n| Feb rain days        = 13.4\n| Mar rain days        = 16.8\n| Apr rain days        = 18.0\n| May rain days        = 22.0\n| Jun rain days        = 25.3\n| Jul rain days        = 26.2\n| Aug rain days        = 24.2\n| Sep rain days        = 24.9\n| Oct rain days        = 26.0\n| Nov rain days        = 23.3\n| Dec rain days        = 20.8\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/gandara_philippines_1713262\n| title =  Gandara: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 29 February 2020 \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Gandara\n| 1903 = 12014\n| 1918 = 14320\n| 1939 = 18507\n| 1948 = 25048\n| 1960 = 24883\n| 1970 = 28307\n| 1975 = 30600\n| 1980 = 24764\n| 1990 = 23673\n| 1995 = 27263\n| 2000 = 28866\n| 2007 = 31222\n| 2010 = 31943\n| 2015 = 34434\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote = Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] {{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nBased on latest 2014 survey, the total population was 33,264, consisting of 17,046 males and 16,218 females.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading.

His father, Professor of Mathematics at the [[Royal Naval Academy|Royal Naval College]], Portsmouth, sailed in Australian waters in 1803 as [[astronomer]] for [[Matthew Flinders]].  His mother, a daughter of Revd Richard Williams, rector of Oakham, Rutland, was a direct descendant of the mother of [[Sir Isaac Newton]] by her second husband.  His eldest brother, James Williams Inman, was headmaster of [[The King's School, Grantham]], Lincoln.  Inman was educated privately, then at St Paul's School, Southsea, his father being chairman of the school board.\n\n==Military service==\nIn 1833, at age 17, Inman enlisted for the Portuguese [[Liberal Wars]], in which England was formally neutral, first serving at the court of Empress Dona [[Maria II of Portugal]], and then as a cadet lancer.  Returning to England in 1834, in 1835 he joined the British [[Auxiliary Legion]] in the [[First Carlist War]] in Spain as a lieutenant in 1st (Queen Isabella's) Lancers, commanded by [[William Wakefield]].<ref>''United Service Journal'', 1839, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hw282c;view=1up;seq=376 Part&nbsp;I], p. 366-367</ref>  Wakefield's brother was influential in plans to establish a free colony in South Australia, where Inman's father, another supporter of the colony, was among the first land investors.  For individual gallantry in action Inman was awarded the [[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand]], then later promoted to captain and adjutant of the 8th Regiment.\n\n==Arrival at South Australia==\nAfter the war, carrying a letter of introduction from [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Colonel Torrens]], chairman of the Colonization Commission in England, to Colonel [[William Light]], [[Surveyor General]] in South Australia, Inman sailed for [[Adelaide]] on the ''[[Royal Admiral (1828 ship)|Royal Admiral]]'', intending to join Light's survey parties.<ref>[[State Library of South Australia]]: PRG 1/1/59</ref>  Arriving in January 1838, for the next four months Inman entered a short-lived partnership as a commission agent with two former ''Royal Admiral'' shipmates, Porter Helmore and Charles Calton.<ref>''[[Southern Australian]]'', 30 June 1838, p. 2</ref> He also became a fast friend of pioneer entrepreneur [[John Barton Hack|J. B. Hack]], who persuaded him not to join Light's hard-pressed surveyors.  Hack knew that the first [[Governor of South Australia]], [[John Hindmarsh]], had already sought permission from [[Lord Glenelg]] to form a police force, and was preparing a cost estimate.<ref>[[State Records of South Australia]]: GRG2/5/1</ref>\n\nThe Colonization Commissioners had originally postponed forming a regular police force, due to expense and lack of expected criminality from the initial cohort of free settlers; so there were only a few part-time [[special constable]]s, plus a small guard of disgruntled [[Royal Marines]] attached to the Governor.  Hindmarsh and the settlers were increasingly concerned that, without proper protection, escaped [[convict]]s from the eastern penal colonies would ravage them.  Unbeknown to those in Adelaide, in June 1838 the Colonization Commissioners recruited from the [[Metropolitan Police Service|London police]] two experienced sub-inspectors, James Stuart and William Baker Ashton, who were intended to create the force.  Unbeknown to those in London, these plans had already been precipitated following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838.  As a private citizen, Inman took part in the pursuit and capture of one suspect.<ref>Bull (1878, p. 67)</ref>\n\n==Foundation of South Australia Police==\nHindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (since renamed [[South Australia Police]]) on 28 April 1838, appointing 21-year-old Henry Inman as sole commander, with the rank of [[Inspector]].<ref>''[[South Australian Register|Register]]'', 28 April 1838</ref>  In effect, if not by title, Inman was its first [[Police Commissioner]].  Inman then recruited \u201ctwenty active young men\u201d and commenced founding the police, purchasing necessary horses and equipment.  It was the first centrally controlled police force in Australia, and the first with [[jurisdiction]] over an entire [[colony]].  In accordance with instructions from Hindmarsh, Inman organised the force into two distinct divisions; foot police for the town of Adelaide and a para-military [[mounted police]].  The latter, with [[cavalry]] standards, were fully armed and prepared for mobile operations at the frontiers of settlement.  At the time there was no exact parallel for such a police force, either in England or the other Australian colonies.  When sub-inspectors Stuart and Ashton arrived in November 1838 they found the police already formed and operating.  Both then served under Inman.\n\nOver the following two years Inman made a decisive contribution to the growth of the police force, opening a [[barracks]] in Adelaide and police stations at several country locations.  In August 1838 Inman led a police party in pursuit of two allegedly escaped convicts near [[Encounter Bay]], arresting one in an unnamed river valley that, by association, have both since borne his name: [[Inman Valley, South Australia|Inman Valley]] and Inman River.  In September 1838 Inman led the police party that accompanied [[Charles Sturt]] on an exploration to the Murray Mouth.<ref>''[[South Australian Register|Register]]'', 29 September 1838</ref>\n\nAfter the recall of Hindmarsh, Inman worked closely with his replacement, Governor [[George Gawler|Gawler]], who arrived in October 1838.  Gawler promoted Inman to [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] of Police, effective 17 October 1838.<ref>''[[South Australian Register|Register]]'', 27 October 1838</ref>  Among other things, the pair designed the first police uniforms.  In December 1838, Inman accompanied Gawler on an exploration of the Encounter Bay region.<ref>''[[South Australian Register|Register]]'', 5 January 1839</ref>\n\nTall and lanky, the strong and courageous Inman was an active and effective field commander, personally leading many investigations in the pursuit of [[bushrangers]] and other offenders.  He set a strong Christian moral tone, such that none of the police were indolent or corrupt.  However, he was such a disappointment as an administrator and financial manager that Gawler appointed a four-man Board of Police Commissioners in December 1839 to ensure oversight of the force.  That same month, Inman accompanied Gawler and Sturt on a [[Murray River]] expedition, during which they discovered [[Mount Bryan]], naming it after Henry Bryan, a fellow expeditioner who became lost and then perished.\n\nOn 19 January 1839 Henry Inman married at [[Holy Trinity Church, Adelaide]] to Mary Fooks Lipson (1820\u20131898). The daughter of Captain [[Thomas Lipson]] RN (1783\u20131863) and Elizabeth Emma Fooks (1790\u20131880), Mary was born at Rennes, Ille-et-Vilaine, Bretagne (Brittany), France, on 27 March 1820, while her father was on half-pay from the British Royal Navy. Her father had previously been commander of the Revenue cutter HMS ''Lapwing'' stationed at Mill Bay, Plymouth, Devon. In South Australia Thomas Lipson was prominently associated with the foundation of the marine affairs as first [[Harbourmaster]] and Collector of Customs.  Through the marriage of other Lipson sisters, Inman later became brother in law to John Allan, [[George Strickland Kingston]], and [[James Collins Hawker]], though he had close association with Allan and Hawker only. Allan was brother in law to [[John Baker (Australian politician)]].\n\n==Dismissal==\nWith Gawler's support, Inman had augmented the force to 70 men by April 1840.  Gawler dismissed Inman on 18 May 1840, after an inquiry revealed potential [[conflict of interest]] in supplying forage hay that Inman had bought from John Baker for the police horses.  Admitting imprudence, Inman vehemently denied any criminal intent.<ref>''[[South Australian Register|Register]]'', 6 June 1840</ref>  Appreciated but unlamented, Inman was replaced by [[Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran]] as first to bear the title [[Police Commissioner]].\n\n==Overlander==\nAt Hack's suggestion, Inman then embarked on [[overlanding]] for [[James Chisholm (politician)|James Chisholm]], a prominent pastoralist at [[Goulburn]] NSW. Accompanied by Chisholm's Adelaide agent Henry Field (1818\u20131909), their 11-man party, jointly led by Inman and Field, left Goulburn for Adelaide in late January 1841, droving 5,000 sheep. Through organisational folly, the party was undermanned and underarmed. They no sooner begun when Inman was attacked by [[Australian Aborigines]] on the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. Hit in the back by three spears, Inman was carried onward upon a cart litter but remarkably recovered. Seven weeks later, on 16 April 1841, at Chowilla near the NSW-SA border, about 300\u2013400 Aboriginals, enraged by earlier clashes with violent overlanders, attacked the weak party. The sheep and goods were plundered, while the drovers narrowly escaped with their lives.\n\nIn June 1841, Inman was appointed by Governor [[George Grey]] as one of the four captains of the [[special constable]] volunteers in a 68-man police expedition, led by O\u2019Halloran, that returned to the attack site to recover the sheep and protect other overlanders then due, in particular the party of Charles Langhorne (1812\u20131855). Upon arrival they found that Langhorne's party had been attacked at the [[Rufus River]] two days earlier, on 20 June 1841, resulting in the deaths of five Aboriginals and four Europeans. Although the Langhorne survivors and their cattle were rescued, none of the sheep were recovered and Inman was financially ruined. These events were a catalyst for further conflict at the Rufus in August 1841 resulting in at least 30 Aboriginal deaths\u2014a conflict known as the [[Rufus River Massacre]], part of the [[Australian frontier wars]].\n\n==Teacher and clergyman==\nInman moved to Goulburn in 1841, as a settler, where his family later joined him.  Unsuccessful as a settler, and being influenced by [[William Sowerby]] (1799\u20131875), first [[Anglican]] clergyman at Goulburn, Inman determined to take holy orders.  After several years of preparatory studies, amid teaching at Sowerby's school, Inman moved to Sydney, where on 1 October 1846 he was appointed Mathematical Master at Sydney College, precursor to [[Sydney Grammar School]].<ref>''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 25 September 1846</ref>  After a brief visit to Adelaide in 1847, he returned to England in 1848, along with his family, entering the Anglican ministry through [[St Bees Theological College]].  After ordination he served as a curate, first at [[Tarleton]], then at [[Newburgh, Lancashire]].\n\nIn 1859 he was appointed [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of All Saints, [[North Scarle]], Lincolnshire, where he was to serve 36 years, until his death there 18 November 1895.  Interred at All Saints churchyard, his obituarist stated that \u2018his quiet and inoffensive manner gained for himself the regard and esteem of many of his parishioners.  He was ever ready to render any assistance he possibly could: and in him the young especially will miss a true and kind-hearted friend when starting out in life\u2019.<ref>''[[The Lincolnshire Chronicle and General Advertiser|Lincolnshire Chronicle]]'', 23 November 1895</ref>  Inman never fully overcame his financial tribulations, declaring bankruptcy in 1862, and leaving his widow a net estate of \u00a3108.  Mary Inman died at nearby [[Swinderby]] on 20 January 1898.  Henry and Mary Inman had ten children, four boys and six girls.  Of their six daughters none had children, while only one married.  Their third son, Edward Master Lipson Inman, a Lieutenant in the 60th [[King's Royal Rifles]], was killed in action, aged 27, on 28 January 1881 in the heroic charge at the [[Battle of Laing's Nek]], Natal, South Africa, during the [[First Boer War]].<ref>''[[Northern Echo]]'', 2 February 1881</ref>\n\nThere is no known photograph or portrait of Henry Inman and he published no memoir.  Modern historians knew very little about Inman's life, and much of that quite inaccurate, until a biography was published in 2010.<ref>Slee, Max (2010), [http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/36918700?q&versionId=47932463 ''Inman: first commander of the South Australia Police''], Adelaide: Seaview Press {{ISBN|978-1-74008-559-5}}.\n</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* \"Despatch from [[Sir George Grey|Governor Grey]] to [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] (May 29, 1841)\", ''Accounts and Papers 1843'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d3VbAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Volume 3] (London: [[William Clowes Ltd.|William Clowes and Sons]]), pp. 267\u2013272.

His father, Professor of Mathematics at the [[Royal Naval Academy|Royal Naval College]], Portsmouth, sailed in Australian waters in 1803 as [[astronomer]] for [[Matthew Flinders]].  His mother, a daughter of Revd Richard Williams, rector of Oakham, Rutland, was a direct descendant of the mother of [[Sir Isaac Newton]] by her second husband.  His eldest brother, James Williams Inman, was headmaster of [[The King's School, Grantham]], Lincoln.  Inman was educated privately, then at St Paul\u2019s School, Southsea, his father being chairman of the school board.\n\n==Military service==\nIn 1833, at age 17, Inman enlisted for the Portuguese [[Liberal Wars]], in which England was formally neutral, first serving at the court of Empress Dona [[Maria II of Portugal]], and then as a cadet lancer.  Returning to England in 1834, in 1835 he joined the British [[Auxiliary Legion]] in the [[First Carlist War]] in Spain as a lieutenant in 1st (Queen Isabella\u2019s) Lancers, commanded by [[William Wakefield]].<ref>''United Service Journal'', 1839, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hw282c;view=1up;seq=376 Part&nbsp;I], p. 366-367</ref>  Wakefield\u2019s brother was influential in plans to establish a free colony in South Australia, where Inman\u2019s father, another supporter of the colony, was among the first land investors.  For individual gallantry in action Inman was awarded the [[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand]], then later promoted to captain and adjutant of the 8th Regiment.\n\n==Arrival at South Australia==\nAfter the war, carrying a letter of introduction from [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Colonel Torrens]], chairman of the Colonization Commission in England, to Colonel [[William Light]], [[Surveyor General]] in South Australia, Inman sailed for [[Adelaide]] on the ''[[Royal Admiral (1828 ship)|Royal Admiral]]'', intending to join Light\u2019s survey parties.<ref>[[State Library of South Australia]]: PRG 1/1/59</ref>  Arriving in January 1838, for the next four months Inman entered a short-lived partnership as a commission agent with two former ''Royal Admiral'' shipmates, Porter Helmore and Charles Calton.<ref>''[[Southern Australian]]'', 30 June 1838, p. 2</ref> He also became a fast friend of pioneer entrepreneur [[John Barton Hack|J. B. Hack]], who persuaded him not to join Light\u2019s hard-pressed surveyors.  Hack knew that the first [[Governor of South Australia]], [[John Hindmarsh]], had already sought permission from [[Lord Glenelg]] to form a police force, and was preparing a cost estimate.<ref>[[State Records of South Australia]]: GRG2/5/1</ref>\n\nThe Colonization Commissioners had originally postponed forming a regular police force, due to expense and lack of expected criminality from the initial cohort of free settlers; so there were only a few part-time [[special constable]]s, plus a small guard of disgruntled [[Royal Marines]] attached to the Governor.  Hindmarsh and the settlers were increasingly concerned that, without proper protection, escaped [[convict]]s from the eastern penal colonies would ravage them.  Unbeknown to those in Adelaide, in June 1838 the Colonization Commissioners recruited from the [[Metropolitan Police Service|London police]] two experienced sub-inspectors, James Stuart and William Baker Ashton, who were intended to create the force.  Unbeknown to those in London, these plans had already been precipitated following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838.  As a private citizen, Inman took part in the pursuit and capture of one suspect.<ref>Bull (1878, p. 67)</ref>\n\n==Foundation of South Australia Police==\nHindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (since renamed [[South Australia Police]]) on 28 April 1838, appointing 21-year-old Henry Inman as sole commander, with the rank of [[Inspector]].<ref>''[[South Australian Register|Register]]'', 28 April 1838</ref>  In effect, if not by title, Inman was its first [[Police Commissioner]].  Inman then recruited \u201ctwenty active young men\u201d and commenced founding the police, purchasing necessary horses and equipment.  It was the first centrally controlled police force in Australia, and the first with [[jurisdiction]] over an entire [[colony]].  In accordance with instructions from Hindmarsh, Inman organised the force into two distinct divisions; foot police for the town of Adelaide and a para-military [[mounted police]].  The latter, with [[cavalry]] standards, were fully armed and prepared for mobile operations at the frontiers of settlement.  At the time there was no exact parallel for such a police force, either in England or the other Australian colonies.  When sub-inspectors Stuart and Ashton arrived in November 1838 they found the police already formed and operating.  Both then served under Inman.\n\nOver the following two years Inman made a decisive contribution to the growth of the police force, opening a [[barracks]] in Adelaide and police stations at several country locations.  In August 1838 Inman led a police party in pursuit of two allegedly escaped convicts near [[Encounter Bay]], arresting one in an unnamed river valley that, by association, have both since borne his name: [[Inman Valley, South Australia|Inman Valley]] and Inman River.  In September 1838 Inman led the police party that accompanied [[Charles Sturt]] on an exploration to the Murray Mouth.<ref>''[[South Australian Register|Register]]'', 29 September 1838</ref>\n\nAfter the recall of Hindmarsh, Inman worked closely with his replacement, Governor [[George Gawler|Gawler]], who arrived in October 1838.  Gawler promoted Inman to [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] of Police, effective 17 October 1838.<ref>''[[South Australian Register|Register]]'', 27 October 1838</ref>  Among other things, the pair designed the first police uniforms.  In December 1838, Inman accompanied Gawler on an exploration of the Encounter Bay region.<ref>''[[South Australian Register|Register]]'', 5 January 1839</ref>\n\nTall and lanky, the strong and courageous Inman was an active and effective field commander, personally leading many investigations in the pursuit of [[bushrangers]] and other offenders.  He set a strong Christian moral tone, such that none of the police were indolent or corrupt.  However, he was such a disappointment as an administrator and financial manager that Gawler appointed a four-man Board of Police Commissioners in December 1839 to ensure oversight of the force.  That same month, Inman accompanied Gawler and Sturt on a [[Murray River]] expedition, during which they discovered [[Mount Bryan]], naming it after Henry Bryan, a fellow expeditioner who became lost and then perished.\n\nOn 19 January 1839 Henry Inman married at [[Holy Trinity Church, Adelaide]] to Mary Fooks Lipson (1820\u20131898). The daughter of Captain [[Thomas Lipson]] RN (1783\u20131863) and Elizabeth Emma Fooks (1790\u20131880), Mary was born at Rennes, Ille-et-Vilaine, Bretagne (Brittany), France, on 27 March 1820, while her father was on half-pay from the British Royal Navy. Her father had previously been commander of the Revenue cutter HMS ''Lapwing'' stationed at Mill Bay, Plymouth, Devon. In South Australia Thomas Lipson was prominently associated with the foundation of the marine affairs as first [[Harbourmaster]] and Collector of Customs.  Through the marriage of other Lipson sisters, Inman later became brother in law to John Allan, [[George Strickland Kingston]], and [[James Collins Hawker]], though he had close association with Allan and Hawker only. Allan was brother in law to [[John Baker (Australian politician)]].\n\n==Dismissal==\nWith Gawler\u2019s support, Inman had augmented the force to 70 men by April 1840.  Gawler dismissed Inman on 18 May 1840, after an inquiry revealed potential [[conflict of interest]] in supplying forage hay that Inman had bought from John Baker for the police horses.  Admitting imprudence, Inman vehemently denied any criminal intent.<ref>''[[South Australian Register|Register]]'', 6 June 1840</ref>  Appreciated but unlamented, Inman was replaced by [[Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran]] as first to bear the title [[Police Commissioner]].\n\n==Overlander==\nAt Hack\u2019s suggestion, Inman then embarked on [[overlanding]] for [[James Chisholm (politician)|James Chisholm]], a prominent pastoralist at [[Goulburn]] NSW. Accompanied by Chisholm\u2019s Adelaide agent Henry Field (1818\u20131909), their 11-man party, jointly led by Inman and Field, left Goulburn for Adelaide in late January 1841, droving 5,000 sheep. Through organisational folly, the party was undermanned and underarmed. They no sooner begun when Inman was attacked by [[Australian Aborigines]] on the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. Hit in the back by three spears, Inman was carried onward upon a cart litter but remarkably recovered. Seven weeks later, on 16 April 1841, at Chowilla near the NSW-SA border, about 300\u2013400 Aboriginals, enraged by earlier clashes with violent overlanders, attacked the weak party. The sheep and goods were plundered, while the drovers narrowly escaped with their lives.\n\nIn June 1841, Inman was appointed by Governor [[George Grey]] as one of the four captains of the [[special constable]] volunteers in a 68-man police expedition, led by O\u2019Halloran, that returned to the attack site to recover the sheep and protect other overlanders then due, in particular the party of Charles Langhorne (1812\u20131855). Upon arrival they found that Langhorne\u2019s party had been attacked at the [[Rufus River]] two days earlier, on 20 June 1841, resulting in the deaths of five Aboriginals and four Europeans. Although the Langhorne survivors and their cattle were rescued, none of the sheep were recovered and Inman was financially ruined. These events were a catalyst for further conflict at the Rufus in August 1841 resulting in at least 30 Aboriginal deaths\u2014a conflict known as the [[Rufus River Massacre]], part of the [[Australian frontier wars]].\n\n==Teacher and clergyman==\nInman moved to Goulburn in 1841, as a settler, where his family later joined him.  Unsuccessful as a settler, and being influenced by [[William Sowerby]] (1799\u20131875), first [[Anglican]] clergyman at Goulburn, Inman determined to take holy orders.  After several years of preparatory studies, amid teaching at Sowerby\u2019s school, Inman moved to Sydney where on 1 October 1846 he was appointed Mathematical Master at Sydney College, precursor to [[Sydney Grammar School]].<ref>''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 25 September 1846</ref>  After a brief visit to Adelaide in 1847, he returned to England in 1848, along with his family, entering the Anglican ministry through [[St Bees Theological College]].  After ordination he served as a curate, first at [[Tarleton]], then at [[Newburgh, Lancashire]].\n\nIn 1859 he was appointed [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of All Saints, [[North Scarle]], Lincolnshire, where he was to serve 36 years, until his death there 18 November 1895.  Interred at All Saints churchyard, his obituarist stated that \u2018his quiet and inoffensive manner gained for himself the regard and esteem of many of his parishioners.  He was ever ready to render any assistance he possibly could: and in him the young especially will miss a true and kind-hearted friend when starting out in life\u2019.<ref>''[[The Lincolnshire Chronicle and General Advertiser|Lincolnshire Chronicle]]'', 23 November 1895</ref>  Inman never fully overcame his financial tribulations, declaring bankruptcy in 1862, and leaving his widow a net estate of \u00a3108.  Mary Inman died at nearby [[Swinderby]] on 20 January 1898.  Henry and Mary Inman had ten children, four boys and six girls.  Of their six daughters none had children, while only one married.  Their third son, Edward Master Lipson Inman, a Lieutenant in the 60th [[King's Royal Rifles]], was killed in action, aged 27, on 28 January 1881 in the heroic charge at the [[Battle of Laing's Nek]], Natal, South Africa, during the [[First Boer War]].<ref>''[[Northern Echo]]'', 2 February 1881</ref>\n\nThere is no known photograph or portrait of Henry Inman and he published no memoir.  Modern historians knew very little about Inman's life, and much of that quite inaccurate, until a biography was published in 2010.<ref>Slee, Max (2010), [http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/36918700?q&versionId=47932463 ''Inman: first commander of the South Australia Police''], Adelaide: Seaview Press {{ISBN|978-1-74008-559-5}}.\n</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* \"Despatch from [[Sir George Grey|Governor Grey]] to [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] (May 29, 1841)\", ''Accounts and Papers 1843'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d3VbAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Volume 3] (London: [[William Clowes Ltd.|William Clowes and Sons]]), p. 267-272.

I should like to drive a Formula One machine, not for the grand prize, but just to see what it is like.  I should think it would be jolly good fun!</blockquote>\n\nWith a very pronounced Brummie accent (from his hometown of Birmingham, renowned for car manufacturing) combined with a seemingly obscure and sardonic sense of humour, he was affectionately known by his American racing crew as \"Teddy Teabag\" (for his tea drinking) or \"Sidebite\" (as he talked out of the side of his mouth). He played a key role in the development and success of the racing versions of the [[AC Cobra#AC 289 Sports|Shelby Cobra 289]] in SCCA, USRRC and FIA sports car racing between 1962 and 1965 as well as the [[Shelby Daytona|Daytona Coupe]] and 427 versions of the Cobra and the [[Ford GT40|Ford GT (GT40)]].\n\nHe became the chief test driver of [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American]] in 1963.<ref name=passaic />\n\nMiles had a \"reputation for courtesy on the track\" and was sometimes called the \"[[Stirling Moss]] of the West Coast\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Biographical Sketches of Drivers|last=Canadian Racing Drivers Association|date=1964|work=Player's 200 Media Kit}}</ref> While a member of the AC-Cobra Ford Team, Miles entered a [[Lotus 23]] in the 1964 Player's 200 at [[Mosport]]. [[File:Ford GT40 (rear).jpg|thumb|right|GT40 Mk II rear]]\n\nIn 1965, he shared a [[Ford GT40#Mk II|Ford GT Mk.II]] with [[Bruce McLaren]] at the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] but retired with gearbox trouble. Earlier in the year, also with McLaren, he had finished second at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].\n\nThe next year he won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], sharing the Ford GT Mk.II with [[Lloyd Ruby]], and then won the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. Several months later, sharing the drive with [[Denny Hulme]], Miles was leading the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]], but [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] executive Leo Beebe, desiring a publicity photo of three of their cars crossing the finish line together, instructed [[Carroll Shelby]] to order him to slow down, which Shelby agreed to. Accordingly, the next car from Ford driven by Bruce McLaren/[[Chris Amon]] and the third-place car from Ford drew up, and they cruised to the line together.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146340/hartford_courant/|title=McLaren, Amon Win at LeMans|newspaper=Hartford Courant|location=Hartford, Connecticut|date=20 June 1966|page=21|via=Newspapers.com|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> The French race officials, after initially agreeing to Ford's dead-heat \"photo-finish\", reneged during the final hour of the race. After first declaring Ken Miles and Denny Hulme the winner, the decision was reversed. Since the Ford driven by McLaren/Amon who finished #2 had started some 20 yards behind the Miles/Hulme #1 Car, it had travelled a further distance, and Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon were declared the winners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146062/daily_independent_journal/|title=Fords Humiliate Mighty Ferraris in Le Mans Race|agency=Associated Press|date=20 June 1966|newspaper=Daily Independent Journal|location=San Rafael, California|via=Newspapers.com|page=29}}</ref> Miles was denied the unique achievement of winning Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the same year.\n\n==Death==\nHe won . Finally, in August 1966, Shelby American resumed testing and development work with Miles serving as primary test driver. The J-car featured a breadvan-shaped rear section that experimented with [[Kammback]] aerodynamic theories, as well as a revolutionary (but untested) honeycomb panel design that was supposed to both lighten and stiffen the car, but the design remained unproved with high-speed prototype sports cars.\n\nAfter almost a day of testing at Riverside International Raceway in the brutally hot Southern California desert summer weather, Miles approached the end of the track's {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}}, downhill back straight at top speed (200-plus mph) when the car suddenly looped, flipped, crashed and caught fire. The car broke into pieces and ejected Miles, killing him instantly. The car had suffered precisely the sort of crash damage the honeycomb construction was designed to prevent. As a result, the aerodynamics of the J-car were greatly modified to correct the rear-end lift generated at race speeds. Ford officials, under pressure after the second of two fatal accidents in the program in five months, also ordered a NASCAR-style steel tube rollover cage to be installed in future versions of the car.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The death of 47-year-old Miles, following that of 46-year-old Hansgen, led Ford to favour younger drivers in subsequent race entries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The significantly revised J-car, renamed the [[Ford GT40#Mk IV|Ford Mk IV]], won the only two races in which it was entered: the 1967 Sebring (Fla.) 12 Hours, and the [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The steel roll cage in the Mk IV (mandated as a direct result of Miles's death) probably saved the life of [[Mario Andretti]], who crashed violently during the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans but escaped.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMiles is interred at the Abbey of the Psalms Mausoleum of the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\n==Awards and honours==\nMiles was posthumously inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2001.<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/ken-miles.html Ken Miles] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n===USAC Road Racing Championship results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

It was very successful in the SCCA F modified class on the west coast. Miles raced the \"Flying Shingle\" at Palm Springs in late March, finishing first overall against veteran driver Cy Yedor, also in an MG Special, and novice driver, actor [[James Dean]] in a [[Porsche 356]] Speedster. Miles was later disqualified on a technical infraction because his fenders were too wide, thus allowing Yedor and Dean to get 'bumped up' to first and second. During 1956, Miles raced John von Neumann's [[Porsche 550]] Spyder at most of the Cal Club and SCCA events.<ref>{{cite book|last=Raskin|first=Lee|title=James Dean: At Speed|year=2005|publisher=David Bull|location=Phoenix, Ariz.|isbn=978-1893618497|page=70}}</ref>\n\nFor the 1957 season (in co-operation with Otto Zipper), Miles engineered the installation of a Porsche 550S engine and transmission in a 1956 [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] chassis and body. It was the second successful race car to be known on the West Coast as \"the Pooper\", the first being an early 1950s Cooper chassis and body powered by a Porsche 356 power train that was built and campaigned by [[Pete Lovely]] of Tacoma, Washington. The resulting car dominated the F Modified class of SCCA on the west coast in the 1957 and 1958 seasons with Miles driving.\n\nDue to his great skill and talent, both as a driver and mechanical engineer, Miles was a key member of the [[Carroll Shelby|Shelby]]/[[AC Cobra|Cobra]] race team in the early 1960s. Miles described himself this way:<ref>Baime, A.J.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PqhXAwAAQBAJ Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans]'', p. 214 (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010).</ref>\n<blockquote>I am a mechanic. That has been the direction of my entire vocational life. Driving is a hobby, a relaxation for me, like golfing is to others.  I should like to drive a Formula One machine, not for the grand prize, but just to see what it is like.  I should think it would be jolly good fun!</blockquote>\n\nWith a very pronounced Brummie accent (from his hometown of Birmingham, renowned for car manufacturing) combined with a seemingly obscure and sardonic sense of humour, he was affectionately known by his American racing crew as \"Teddy Teabag\" (for his tea drinking) or \"Sidebite\" (as he talked out of the side of his mouth). He played a key role in the development and success of the racing versions of the [[AC Cobra#AC 289 Sports|Shelby Cobra 289]] in SCCA, USRRC and FIA sports car racing between 1962 and 1965 as well as the [[Shelby Daytona|Daytona Coupe]] and 427 versions of the Cobra and the [[Ford GT40|Ford GT (GT40)]].\n\nHe became the chief test driver of [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American]] in 1963.<ref name=passaic />\n\nMiles had a \"reputation for courtesy on the track\" and was sometimes called the \"[[Stirling Moss]] of the West Coast\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Biographical Sketches of Drivers|last=Canadian Racing Drivers Association|date=1964|work=Player's 200 Media Kit}}</ref> While a member of the AC-Cobra Ford Team, Miles entered a [[Lotus 23]] in the 1964 Player's 200 at [[Mosport]]. [[File:Ford GT40 (rear).jpg|thumb|right|GT40 Mk II rear]]\n\nIn 1965, he shared a [[Ford GT40#Mk II|Ford GT Mk.II]] with [[Bruce McLaren]] at the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] but retired with gearbox trouble. Earlier in the year, also with McLaren, he had finished second at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].\n\nThe next year he won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], sharing the Ford GT Mk.II with [[Lloyd Ruby]], and then won the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. Several months later, sharing the drive with [[Denny Hulme]], Miles was leading the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]], but [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] executive Leo Beebe, desiring a publicity photo of three of their cars crossing the finish line together, instructed [[Carroll Shelby]] to order him to slow down, which Shelby agreed to. Accordingly, the next car from Ford driven by Bruce McLaren/[[Chris Amon]] and the third-place car from Ford drew up, and they cruised to the line together.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146340/hartford_courant/|title=McLaren, Amon Win at LeMans|newspaper=Hartford Courant|location=Hartford, Connecticut|date=20 June 1966|page=21|via=Newspapers.com|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> The French race officials, after initially agreeing to Ford's dead-heat \"photo-finish\", reneged during the final hour of the race. After first declaring Ken Miles and Denny Hulme the winner, the decision was reversed. Since the Ford driven by McLaren/Amon who finished #2 had started some 20 yards behind the Miles/Hulme #1 Car, it had travelled a further distance, and Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon were declared the winners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146062/daily_independent_journal/|title=Fords Humiliate Mighty Ferraris in Le Mans Race|agency=Associated Press|date=20 June 1966|newspaper=Daily Independent Journal|location=San Rafael, California|via=Newspapers.com|page=29}}</ref> Miles was denied the unique achievement of winning Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the same year.\n\n==Death==\nThe Ford J-car was intended to be the successor to the all-conquering Ford GT40 Mk.II and, despite reliability problems, showed potential in the springtime Le Mans trials. After the death of [[Walt Hansgen]] in a J-car Ford while testing at Le Mans in April, the decision was made to shelve the J-car and focus on the proven Mk IIs, and little development was done for the rest of the 1966 World Sports Car Championship season. Finally, in August 1966, Shelby American resumed testing and development work with Miles serving as primary test driver. The J-car featured a breadvan-shaped rear section that experimented with [[Kammback]] aerodynamic theories, as well as a revolutionary (but untested) honeycomb panel design that was supposed to both lighten and stiffen the car, but the design remained unproved with high-speed prototype sports cars.\n\nAfter almost a day of testing at Riverside International Raceway in the brutally hot Southern California desert summer weather, Miles approached the end of the track's {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}}, downhill back straight at top speed (200-plus mph) when the car suddenly looped, flipped, crashed and caught fire. The car broke into pieces and ejected Miles, killing him instantly. The car had suffered precisely the sort of crash damage the honeycomb construction was designed to prevent. As a result, the aerodynamics of the J-car were greatly modified to correct the rear-end lift generated at race speeds. Ford officials, under pressure after the second of two fatal accidents in the program in five months, also ordered a NASCAR-style steel tube rollover cage to be installed in future versions of the car.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The death of 47-year-old Miles, following that of 46-year-old Hansgen, led Ford to favour younger drivers in subsequent race entries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The significantly revised J-car, renamed the [[Ford GT40#Mk IV|Ford Mk IV]], won the only two races in which it was entered: the 1967 Sebring (Fla.) 12 Hours, and the [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The steel roll cage in the Mk IV (mandated as a direct result of Miles's death) probably saved the life of [[Mario Andretti]], who crashed violently during the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans but escaped.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMiles is interred at the Abbey of the Psalms Mausoleum of the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\n==Awards and honours==\nMiles was posthumously inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2001.<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/ken-miles.html Ken Miles] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n===USAC Road Racing Championship results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!
