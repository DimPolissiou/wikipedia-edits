It was originally recorded in February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London and released as a single by his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in May 1971 on [[B&C Records]]. Bowie subsequently re-recorded the song later that year with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]]\u2014comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]\u2014for release on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. The re-recording was co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London in November 1971. On the album, the song directly introduces the character Ziggy Stardust, who describes himself as a [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] alien rock superstar who will save the Earth from the impending disaster described in the opening track \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\". It features saxophone played by Bowie and a guitar solo and string arrangement by Ronson.\n\nSince its release, \"Moonage Daydream\" has received critical acclaim, with many deeming Ronson's guitar work its clear standout. Bolder, Woodmansey and Scott have called it the best song on the album; retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs. He played it in concert throughout 1972\u201373 on the [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]] and on later tours. The ''Ziggy'' recording has since appeared on multiple [[compilation album]]s and in the 2014 film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', while the Arnold Corns' recording has appeared on reissues of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970) and ''Ziggy Stardust''. The ''Ziggy'' recording has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012, which was subsequently included as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set in 2015, along with the Arnold Corns' recording.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Moonage Daydream\" was written during Bowie's US promotional tour in early February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After the tour Bowie formed a short-lived band, [[Arnold Corns]], named after the [[Pink Floyd]] song \"[[Arnold Layne]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Led by Bowie, the band consisted of guitarist Mark Carr-Pritchard, bassist Peter DeSomogyi and drummer Tim Broadbent, who were known previously as a trio called Rungk.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Arnold Corns recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\" on 25&nbsp;February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Bowie later hired openly gay dress designer Freddie Burretti, for whom he wrote \"Moonage Daydream\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}} Burretti did not appear on either track's recording.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=605}} Biographer [[Peter Doggett]] writes, the original version had a \"playful science-fiction-inspired chorus, two nondescript verses with a single memorable line, and an arrangement that not only racked his voice like a martyr under the Inquisition but virtually defined the word 'shambolic'.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the Corns' version lacks  the \"lightness of touch\" of the second.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Like Doggett, Pegg criticises the recording's arrangement and Bowie's vocal, calling it a \"strained attempt\" at an American [[Rock and roll|rock'n'roll]] vocal, along with an additional \"come on, you mothers!\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} According to [[Marc Spitz]], the Corns' version is melodically the same as the ''Ziggy'' version, but with a slightly different chorus.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Doggett believes that had the track and \"Hang On to Yourself\" not been re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'', they would have been forgotten.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Author Kevin Cann writes that once the lyrics were revised and \"given the Ziggy treatment\", it became a \"glittering glam gem\" in the context of the album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=253}}\n\nBowie re-recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" on 12&nbsp;November 1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London for inclusion on ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}{{sfn|Woodmansey|2017|pp=88, 114}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], the lineup consisted of Bowie's backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]]\u2014comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\" /> The group recorded the track in two takes, as well as \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\", \"[[Lady Stardust]]\" and a re-recording of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Supermen]]\" during the session.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} The re-recording, like its parent album, is a [[glam rock]] song<ref>{{cite web|title=Masterpiece Reviews: \"David Bowie \u2013 The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And

metal]].{{sfn|Perone|2007|p=28}} Doggett writes that after learning from the \"vocal agonies\" of the Corns' recording, the Spiders decided to record the song three semitones lower than before.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Ronson begins it on guitar with a D chord described as an \"avalanche\",{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} a \"pile-driver\", and an \"opening thunderbolt\" that is Ronson's \"declaration of intent\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Pegg writes that the chord \"cuts across the fade-out\" of \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" taking the listener \"into the morass of sleazy sex and surreal science fiction that occupies the album's heart.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After a short pause, Bowie begins his vocal, which Doggett believes sounds far better than the \"metallic rasp\" of his 1970 recordings.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Bowie plays a saxophone and a [[pennywhistle]] during Ronson's solo, which are inspired by [[the Hollywood Argyles]]' 1960 song \"Sho Know a Lot About Love\";{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie recalled in 2003 that he thought the combination of sax and piccolo was \"a great thing to put in a rock song\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> Ronson's guitar solo was mostly improvised after Bowie had conveyed the mood he wanted to him.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie later recalled in his 2002 book ''Moonage Daydream'':\n\n{{block quote|[I would] literally draw out on paper with a crayon or felt-tip pen the shape of a solo. The one in 'Moonage Daydream', for instance, started as a flat line that became a fat megaphone type shape, and ended as sprays of disassociated and broken lines. I'd read somewhere that [[Frank Zappa]] used a series of drawn symbols to explain to his musicians how he wanted the shape of a composition to sound. Mick could take something like that and actually bloody play it, bring it to life. Very impressive.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}}}}\n\nThe song's strings, arranged and orchestrated by Ronson,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} appear at the return of the chorus, climaxing in a \"steep pizzicato descent.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} They appear again during the fadeout, this time having a \"swirling phased\" effect that was Scott's idea during the mixing stage.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Doggett writes, \"Only in the final moments did Ronson's guitar provide the climactic release that the daydream demanded, continually returning to the same motifs as if in ecstatic spasm.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nAs the third track on the album, \"Moonage Daydream\" directly introduces the character of Ziggy Stardust,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} following \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\" which describes an impending disaster that will result in Earth only having five years left and \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" in which numerous characters deal with love before the impending disaster.<ref>{{harvnb|Spitz|2009|p=187: \"Five Years\"}}; {{harvnb|Pegg|2016|p=445; \"Soul Love\"}}</ref> Once introduced, Ziggy proclaims himself \"an exotic hybrid of rock's past and mankind's future\": \"an alligator\" (strong and remorseless), \"a mama-papa\" (non-gender specific), \"the space invader\" (alien and phallic), \"a rock'n'rollin' bitch\" and a \"pink-monkey-bird\" (gay slang for a recipient of anal sex).{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Ziggy also praises the virtues of \"the church of man, love\" (or heard as \"the church of man-love\"); Pegg believes that this line is inspired in part by the proposed \"Church of God, Love and Man\" by philosopher [[Thomas Paine]], who Bowie often referenced indirectly (and directly on the 1990 [[Adrian Belew]] collaboration \"Pretty Pink Rose\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Doggett believes that the \"carefree\" imagery Ziggy presents heightens the \"erotic fantasy\" of the chorus, described as \"a wet dream that was 'moonage' for the era of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions\" and for the tradition of \"muse poetry\" by [[Robert Graves]], which is linked to \"ancient cults that worshipped the moon, accessing the imagination without involving the intellect.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Doggett continues that as philosopher [[Colin Wilson]] said in 1971, \"the moon goddess was the goddess of magic, of the subconscious, of poetic inspiration.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Hence, a \"moonage daydream\" might represent \"an ecstatic, instinctive path to creativity\", or nothing more than an homage to \"[[Marc Bolan]]'s brand of lyrical imagery.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Bowie used several Americanisms on the original version of the song, most of which he which retained on the re-recording, using abbreviations such as \"comin'\", \"'lectric\" and \"rock'n'rollin'\", as well as phrases such as \"busting up my brains\", \"lay the real thing on me\", \"freak out\" and \"far out\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} According to Pegg, there are several homages present\u2014including one to [[Iggy Pop]], whose lyric \"she got a TV eye on me\" turns into \"keep your 'lectric eye on me\", and one to [[Legendary Stardust Cowboy]], whose lyric \"I shot my space gun\" turns into \"put your ray gun to my head\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n[[File:Mick Ronson 1979.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=Mick Ronson playing guitar|[[Mick Ronson]]'s guitar work received unanimous praise from music critics, with most calling it the best aspect of the track.]]\nThe original version of \"Moonage Daydream\" by the short-lived band Arnold Corns was released in the UK by [[B&C Records]] as a 7-inch single<ref name=\"Rhino\" /> with \"Hang On to Yourself\" as the B-side in May 1971.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=216}}<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Moonage Daydream\"''|others=[[Arnold Corns|The Arnold Corns]]|year=1971|publisher=[[B&C Records]]|location=UK|type=Single liner notes|id=CB 149}}</ref> The re-recorded version was released as the third track on Bowie's fifth studio album ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'', between \"Soul Love\" and \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\", on 16&nbsp;June 1972 by [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> Discussing the song's placement in the album's track-listing, Pegg describes it as its \"keystone\" if one identifies the opening and closing tracks (\"Five Years\" and \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\", respectively) as the album's framework.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=When I walked into the control room and heard \"Moonage Daydream\" played back through the speakers for the first time I knew then we really had something special.

It was originally recorded in February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London and released as a single by his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in May 1971 on [[B&C Records]]. Bowie subsequently re-recorded the song later that year with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]]\u2014comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]\u2014for release on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. The re-recording was co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London in November 1971. On the album, the song directly introduces the character Ziggy Stardust, who describes himself as a [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] alien rock superstar who will save the Earth from the impending disaster described in the opening track \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\". It features saxophone played by Bowie and a guitar solo and string arrangement by Ronson.\n\nSince its release, \"Moonage Daydream\" has received critical acclaim, with many deeming Ronson's guitar work its clear standout. Bolder, Woodmansey and Scott have called it the best song on the album; retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs. He played it in concert throughout 1972\u201373 and on later tours. The ''Ziggy'' recording has since appeared on multiple [[compilation album]]s and in the 2014 film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', while the Arnold Corns' recording has appeared on reissues of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970) and ''Ziggy Stardust''. The ''Ziggy'' recording has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012, which was subsequently included as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set in 2015, along with the Arnold Corns' recording.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Moonage Daydream\" was written during Bowie's US promotional tour in early February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After the tour Bowie formed a short-lived band, [[Arnold Corns]], named after the [[Pink Floyd]] song \"[[Arnold Layne]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Led by Bowie, the band consisted of guitarist Mark Carr-Pritchard, bassist Peter DeSomogyi and drummer Tim Broadbent, who were known previously as a trio called Rungk.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Arnold Corns recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\" on 25&nbsp;February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Bowie later hired openly gay dress designer Freddie Burretti, for whom he wrote \"Moonage Daydream\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}} Burretti did not appear on either track's recording.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=605}} Biographer [[Peter Doggett]] writes, the original version had a \"playful science-fiction-inspired chorus, two nondescript verses with a single memorable line, and an arrangement that not only racked his voice like a martyr under the Inquisition but virtually defined the word 'shambolic'.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the Corns' version lacks  the \"lightness of touch\" of the second.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Like Doggett, Pegg criticises the recording's arrangement and Bowie's vocal, calling it a \"strained attempt\" at an American [[Rock and roll|rock'n'roll]] vocal, along with an additional \"come on, you mothers!\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} According to [[Marc Spitz]], the Corns' version is melodically the same as the ''Ziggy'' version, but with a slightly different chorus.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Doggett believes that had the track and \"Hang On to Yourself\" not been re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'', they would have been forgotten.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Author Kevin Cann writes that once the lyrics were revised and \"given the Ziggy treatment\", it became a \"glittering glam gem\" in the context of the album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=253}}\n\nBowie re-recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" on 12&nbsp;November 1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London for inclusion on ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}{{sfn|Woodmansey|2017|pp=88, 114}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], the lineup consisted of Bowie's backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]]\u2014comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\" /> The group recorded the track in two takes, as well as \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\", \"[[Lady Stardust]]\" and a re-recording of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Supermen]]\" during the session.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} The re-recording, like its parent album, is a [[glam rock]] song<ref>{{cite web|title=Masterpiece Reviews: \"David Bowie \u2013 The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And

metal]].{{sfn|Perone|2007|p=28}} Doggett writes that after learning from the \"vocal agonies\" of the Corns' recording, the Spiders decided to record the song three semitones lower than before.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Ronson begins it on guitar with a D chord described as an \"avalanche\",{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} a \"pile-driver\", and an \"opening thunderbolt\" that is Ronson's \"declaration of intent\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Pegg writes that the chord \"cuts across the fade-out\" of \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" taking the listener \"into the morass of sleazy sex and surreal science fiction that occupies the album's heart.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After a short pause, Bowie begins his vocal, which Doggett believes sounds far better than the \"metallic rasp\" of his 1970 recordings.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Bowie plays a saxophone and a [[pennywhistle]] during Ronson's solo, which are inspired by [[the Hollywood Argyles]]' 1960 song \"Sho Know a Lot About Love\";{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie recalled in 2003 that he thought the combination of sax and piccolo was \"a great thing to put in a rock song\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> Ronson's guitar solo was mostly improvised after Bowie had conveyed the mood he wanted to him.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie later recalled in his 2002 book ''Moonage Daydream'':\n\n{{block quote|[I would] literally draw out on paper with a crayon or felt-tip pen the shape of a solo. The one in 'Moonage Daydream', for instance, started as a flat line that became a fat megaphone type shape, and ended as sprays of disassociated and broken lines.

It began on October 3, 1988, and is syndicated by [[King Features]].<ref>[[Dean Mullaney]], Bruce Canwell and Brian Walker, ''King of the Comics : One Hundred Years of King Features Syndicate''. San Diego : [[IDW Publishing]], 2015. {{ISBN|9781631403736}} (p. 259)</ref>\n\nThe strip mostly involves the title character, Curtis, getting in trouble at home and school, trying in many attempts to make his father, Greg, quit [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] (a storyline which earned Billingsley the [[American Lung Association]]'s President's Award in 2000), trying to win the heart of aspiring [[diva]] singer Michelle and stuffing his face.\n\nCurtis will often fantasize at school (rather than paying attention to his teacher, Mrs. Nelson) about his favorite [[superhero]], \"Supercaptaincoolman\" (a superhero who is constantly defending the city against the insidious schemes of the evil \"Doctor Horsehead\").\n\nOnce a year, up through the 2012-2013 holiday season and again in the 2015-2016 season, Billingsley has Curtis and the gang take a hiatus one day after Christmas (or first Monday after Christmas, if Christmas falls on a Saturday or Sunday) and focus on a special two-to-three week inspirational story to celebrate the Festival of [[Kwanzaa]]. Also, around the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] holiday, the strip will discuss some aspect of [[Martin Luther King|Dr. King's]] life. The month of February is also dedicated to [[Black History Month]], in which Mrs. Nelson assigns her class to write about various African-American figures in history.\n\n''Curtis'' featured Dagwood of the ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]'' comic as part of the 75th anniversary celebration for ''Blondie''. Unlike ''[[Dennis the Menace (U.S.)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[Hi and Lois]]'', ''[[B.C. (comic)|B.C.]]'', ''[[Family Circus]]'' or ''[[Baby Blues]]'', the other comic strips that participated in the anniversary crossover, ''Curtis'' took an extended storyline lasting from August 29 to September 3, like ''[[H\u00e4gar the Horrible]]''. Curtis was also featured in the 75th Anniversary strip on September 4.\n\n==Characters and story==\n*'''[[Curtis Wilkins|Curtis Wesley Wilkins]]''' - Main character, an 11-year-old boy. A [[rap music|rap]] fan with a huge [[Limerence|crush]] on a girl named Michelle. He has a huge appetite and a talent for getting himself into trouble. Prior to 2020, he always wore an oversized green cap backwards and perched at an angle on the back of his head; according to the storyline, he got it at a young age from his father. In 2020, Michelle gave him a smaller green cap as a gift and he has worn that one ever since.\n*'''Barry Taylor Wilkins''' - Curtis's younger brother. Often likes to annoy and outsmart Curtis. Their parents consider Barry to be the more trustworthy of the two, while Curtis usually sees him as a brat. He whines when he has to eat his vegetables and has no qualms about mashing Curtis to a pulp when called on to do it. Also earns merit awards, which makes Curtis jealous. Barry has an [[imaginary friend]] named Oogie, who is green, has one eye, is about Barry's size, and likes to eat vegetables.\n*'''Greg Wilkins''' - Curtis's father. Works at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] and hates his job. He and Curtis are regularly at odds over their tastes in music (Curtis likes rap and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], and Greg can't stand it, preferring [[Motown]]), among other things (see below).\n*'''Diane Wilkins''' - Curtis's mother. A housewife, she tends to get irritated by Curtis's antics, but is always supportive of him when he has a problem. Originally sporting an [[afro]], Diane has received two different hairstyle makeovers over the years. The last one of these made Derrick and \"Onion\" think that Greg was having an affair.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Diane and Greg met when they were featured dancers on ''[[Soul Train]]''.<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=May 25, 2010 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref>\n*'''Mrs. Nelson''' - A middle-aged, overweight teacher. Since Curtis is the class joker, she doesn't get along very well with him. He does however do well when he makes an effort and when he thanks her for giving him a good grade, she tells him he earned it. She also tells his mother good things about him at the parent-teacher conferences. In 2020, Mrs. Nelson tested positive for [[COVID-19]].<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=April 11, 2020 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref>\n*'''Michelle Grant''' - A girl whom Curtis likes, even though she is two years older. Her father is rich. Considered self-centered (and egotistical) by most of the other characters, she only likes Curtis as a friend (although it may prove otherwise since whenever Curtis greets her, she always gives him an annoyed look) and discourages his attempts to date her (though she did finally agree to do so in a June\u2013July 2007 series). She is an excellent singer and hopes to become a famous star, currently starring in energy drink commercials. In a weeklong series of strips starting November 30, 2009 she tells Curtis she was in a Super Fiber Chux cereal commercial at age three, and that her first role in a TV series would have been on \"[[The Muppet Show]]\" had [[Miss Piggy]] not felt threatened by her. In the October 10, 2007 strip, it is revealed that Michelle has a mother who has been admitted to rehab for treatment due to her problems with drug addiction.\n*'''Chutney Devoe''' - A girl who likes Curtis. Curtis only sees her as a friend, while he chases after Michelle. However that may prove otherwise: in an early 2011 strip, Curtis finds Chutney with another guy, whom Curtis suspects is her boyfriend. That being said, Curtis tries to find out for himself, fearing that her new relationship with him will strongly affect their friendship. He finds that the guy is in fact one of her relatives who came to visit her family for a little while.\n*'''Gunk''' - Curtis's cross-eyed [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] best friend. A native of the fictional Flyspeck Island, Gunk (an [[initialism]] for '''G'''ladimus '''U'''mfred '''N'''ostradamus '''K'''laustauvicke<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Houston, TX |Date=March 1, 2014 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Houston Chronicle}}</ref>) often gives some bizarre item to Curtis, with disastrous results (most often a [[chameleon]]). One of his quirks is his refusal to fight anybody, but he also is cat-like in his moves to avoid his nemesis's punches, because as he says afterwards, \"Just because I won't fight you doesn't mean I'm going to let you hit me.\"\n*'''Gunther''' - Runs the Soul Scissors<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=July 6, 2016|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref> [[Barber]] Shop. Asked if Gunther is his first or last name, he replies, \"Yeah.\"<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=June 4, 2017|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref> Never gets Curtis' name right (but at least every attempt either starts with a \"C\" or a hard \"C\" sound), and who claims to know nearly every famous person (and who has photos &ndash; but always with a thumb covering the famous person).\n*'''Rose Petal''', niece of Gunther, who enjoys singing, but she gets fired from every gig she enters, because she has a foul mouth and a really bad attitude. She refuses to work for money she needs to \"pay for her rent\" (although it is revealed that she really needs the money to party), and ultimately, Gunther throws her out of his shop, demonstrating \"[[tough love]]\". She responds with profanity. According to Curtis, she thinks the world owes her.\n*'''Derrick''' - A [[Bullying|bully]]. He and his friend, \"Onion\", make fun of Curtis by calling him \"Wimpkins\" and using \"[[your mom|yo momma jokes]]\", and on occasion physically harass him (in one series, they attempted to falsely accuse him of criminal activity). Curtis attempts to avoid them as much as possible. Gunk, Chutney and others have helped Curtis against the bullying of Derrick and \"Onion\". In a late 2010 strip, Derrick has a girlfriend named Veranda, who has an attitude like him and \"Onion\".\n*'''\"Onion\"''' - Derrick's friend and fellow [[bullying|bully]] to Curtis. His real name is Norman,<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=November 16, 2014 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref> but is self-nicknamed \"Onion\" for being able to \"bring tears to a sucker's eyes\", although Curtis once exclaimed that it was \"probably because he stunk\".\n*'''\"Ms. Honeystump\"''' - Curtis's summer-school teacher. The gag is that she's attractive, and therefore distracting to the students.\n*'''\"Mr. Kwame\"''' - Michelle's Teacher whom she is madly in love with. The gag is while Curtis fawns over her in his presence she completely ignores his passes while dreaming about him.\n*'''\"Heart-Throb\"''' - An overweight friend of Curtis whose real name is Anthony Caldwell.<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=June 15, 2016|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref> He is polite and tells adults what they want to hear but doesn't mean what he says.<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=June 18, 2016|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref>\n*'''\"Tiny\"''' - Gunther's very large nephew who everyone believes is going to college on a football scholarship but is really receiving an academic scholarship and studying to be a lawyer.<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=April 18, 2017|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref><ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=April 21, 2017|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref><ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=April 27, 2017|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring gags==\n*Barry is almost always listening in on either phone or live conversations between Curtis and Michelle which annoys Curtis. A frequent running gag in the strip, each time this happens it starts with Barry saying something offensive about Michelle, which causes Curtis to chase after him. Barry runs to Diane, saying \"Mama, Curtis is trying to hit me ''for no good reason''!\" Curtis responds by saying \"Don't fall for his 'innocent little boy' routine, Mom,\" and begins to explain what Barry did. More often that not, Diane does not believe Curtis and usually gives Barry [[ice cream]] to calm him while scolding Curtis and sending him off to do chores. On a couple of occasions, Barry even confesses to having listened to the conversations (asking what does a certain phrase mean, or even offering to repeat what Curtis said).  This prompts questions from some over whether Diane properly punishes him for lying and eavesdropping.<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=February 5, 2008 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref>\n*Greg Wilkins is a heavy smoker, a habit he picked up in childhood and has apparently little desire to break as it apparently helps him cope with life. Curtis is not happy with his father's smoking and tries at various points to make him quit, including by trying to shame him for having to stop at the grocery store in the rain with no umbrella just so he could purchase cigarettes (which backfires when Greg tells Curtis the purpose of the trip was to buy [[liver (food)|liver]] for dinner, which Curtis hates) and by purposely breaking his cigarettes in front of Greg, which causes him to chase Curtis around the house.\n*Another recurring theme involves Curtis' favorite [[comic book]] [[superhero]] Supercaptaincoolman. The strip reads like a comic book in most part where Supercaptaincoolman engages in many types of adventures in his daily struggle to rid the world of his arch nemesis, The Evil Dr. Horsehead.  But just as the action is about to heat up, the third to last panel suddenly shows Ms. Nelson shouting, \"Mr. Wilkins!!\" as she catches Curtis reading his comics while he is supposed to be paying attention in class while he gulps and says \"Ms. Nelson!\" He immediately tries to get out of the situation by lying.  The last panel shows Curtis being sent to the principal's [[office]] as punishment for reading comic books in class.\n*Once in a while, Curtis and Barry, just before [[church service]]s begin, will observe ladies coming in wearing elaborate hats on their heads.  Curtis will promptly make jokes about each hat they are wearing as they pass by the [[pew]] that Curtis and Barry are sitting in, while Barry tries not to laugh too loud.  In the last panel, while Curtis is laughing over his ladies' hat jokes, Barry will typically warn Curtis about big trouble coming to him if they ever heard him make insulting jokes about their hats (ironically, in one such strip, there were also two elderly men who mock the women's hats in exactly the same manner as Curtis and Barry do, causing Barry to worry even more as to what they might end up as).\n*In another recurring theme, Diane would have a dish made for either dinner or a bake sale at church place on the table in front of Curtis. She turns away for one second only to turn back and find Curtis eating up everything at an amazingly fast rate. The last panel features Curtis sitting in his room after being punished for eating the whole dish Diane made for either everyone at dinner or the church bake sale.\n*One recurring theme always involves Curtis and someone else (often his brother) entering some establishment with a name like \"The [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] School of Personal [[Etiquette]]\" or \"The [[Mike Tyson]] Institute of Good Mannerism\", then finding out it's really a music store.  Curtis explains that \"it's really my favorite record store in disguise\" and that \"the locals torch the place once they find out its real identity\", apparently due to the type of music it sells (usually rap music featuring an artist with a [[rap sheet]]). This theme has been featured less since the advent of [[iTunes]].\n*The skits often show Curtis (and often Barry for mere association) being disciplined for his various antics by either his mom or dad.  However, they never show the actual punishment as it takes place, but the final frame of a strip where discipline is administered will show stars and such showing where the punishment was administered.\n*Another recurring theme is the first day of school strip where the reader sees the city in the first panel. Then, the next two panels of the view brings the reader to where Curtis lives. The first three strips warn the reader about something that very disturbing is happening at this time of the morning, whether it is a skirmish or some other type of war.

It began on October 3, 1988, and is syndicated by [[King Features]].<ref>[[Dean Mullaney]], Bruce Canwell and Brian Walker, ''King of the Comics : One Hundred Years of King Features Syndicate''. San Diego : [[IDW Publishing]], 2015. {{ISBN|9781631403736}} (p. 259)</ref>\n\nThe strip mostly involves the title character, Curtis, getting in trouble at home and school, trying in many attempts to make his father, Greg, quit [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] (a storyline which earned Billingsley the [[American Lung Association]]'s President's Award in 2000), trying to win the heart of aspiring [[diva]] singer Michelle and stuffing his face.\n\nCurtis will often fantasize at school (rather than paying attention to his teacher, Mrs. Nelson) about his favorite [[superhero]], \"Supercaptaincoolman\" (a superhero who is constantly defending the city against the insidious schemes of the evil \"Doctor Horsehead\").\n\nOnce a year, up through the 2012-2013 holiday season and again in the 2015-2016 season, Billingsley has Curtis and the gang take a hiatus one day after Christmas (or first Monday after Christmas, if Christmas falls on a Saturday or Sunday) and focus on a special two-to-three week inspirational story to celebrate the Festival of [[Kwanzaa]]. Also, around the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] holiday, the strip will discuss some aspect of [[Martin Luther King|Dr. King's]] life. The month of February is also dedicated to [[Black History Month]], in which Mrs. Nelson assigns her class to write about various African-American figures in history.\n\n''Curtis'' featured Dagwood of the ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]'' comic as part of the 75th anniversary celebration for ''Blondie''. Unlike ''[[Dennis the Menace (U.S.)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[Hi and Lois]]'', ''[[B.C. (comic)|B.C.]]'', ''[[Family Circus]]'' or ''[[Baby Blues]]'', the other comic strips that participated in the anniversary crossover, ''Curtis'' took an extended storyline lasting from August 29 to September 3, like ''[[H\u00e4gar the Horrible]]''. Curtis was also featured in the 75th Anniversary strip on September 4.\n\n==Characters and story==\n*'''[[Curtis Wilkins|Curtis Wesley Wilkins]]''' - Main character, an 11-year-old boy. A [[rap music|rap]] fan with a huge [[Limerence|crush]] on a girl named Michelle. He has a huge appetite and a talent for getting himself into trouble. Prior to 2020, he always wore an oversized green cap backwards and perched at an angle on the back of his head; according to the storyline, he got it at a young age from his father. In 2020, Michelle gave him a smaller green cap as a gift and he has worn that one ever since.\n*'''Barry Taylor Wilkins''' - Curtis's younger brother. Often likes to annoy and outsmart Curtis. Their parents consider Barry to be the more trustworthy of the two, while Curtis usually sees him as a brat. He whines when he has to eat his vegetables and has no qualms about mashing Curtis to a pulp when called on to do it. Also earns merit awards, which makes Curtis jealous. Barry has an [[imaginary friend]] named Oogie, who is green, has one eye, is about Barry's size, and likes to eat vegetables.\n*'''Greg Wilkins''' - Curtis's father. Works at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] and hates his job. He and Curtis are regularly at odds over their tastes in music (Curtis likes rap and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], and Greg can't stand it, preferring [[Motown]]), among other things (see below).\n*'''Diane Wilkins''' - Curtis's mother. A housewife, she tends to get irritated by Curtis's antics, but is always supportive of him when he has a problem. Originally sporting an [[afro]], Diane has received two different hairstyle makeovers over the years. The last one of these made Derrick and \"Onion\" think that Greg was having an affair.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Diane and Greg met when they were featured dancers on ''[[Soul Train]]''.<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=May 25, 2010 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref>\n*'''Mrs. Nelson''' - A middle-aged, overweight teacher. Since Curtis is the class joker, she doesn't get along very well with him. He does however do well when he makes an effort and when he thanks her for giving him a good grade, she tells him he earned it. She also tells his mother good things about him at the parent-teacher conferences. In 2020, Mrs. Nelson tested positive for [[COVId-19]].<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=April 11, 2020 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref>\n*'''Michelle Grant''' - A girl whom Curtis likes, even though she is two years older. Her father is rich. Considered self-centered (and egotistical) by most of the other characters, she only likes Curtis as a friend (although it may prove otherwise since whenever Curtis greets her, she always gives him an annoyed look) and discourages his attempts to date her (though she did finally agree to do so in a June\u2013July 2007 series). She is an excellent singer and hopes to become a famous star, currently starring in energy drink commercials. In a weeklong series of strips starting November 30, 2009 she tells Curtis she was in a Super Fiber Chux cereal commercial at age three, and that her first role in a TV series would have been on \"[[The Muppet Show]]\" had [[Miss Piggy]] not felt threatened by her. In the October 10, 2007 strip, it is revealed that Michelle has a mother who has been admitted to rehab for treatment due to her problems with drug addiction.\n*'''Chutney Devoe''' - A girl who likes Curtis. Curtis only sees her as a friend, while he chases after Michelle. However that may prove otherwise: in an early 2011 strip, Curtis finds Chutney with another guy, whom Curtis suspects is her boyfriend. That being said, Curtis tries to find out for himself, fearing that her new relationship with him will strongly affect their friendship. He finds that the guy is in fact one of her relatives who came to visit her family for a little while.\n*'''Gunk''' - Curtis's cross-eyed [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] best friend. A native of the fictional Flyspeck Island, Gunk (an [[initialism]] for '''G'''ladimus '''U'''mfred '''N'''ostradamus '''K'''laustauvicke<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Houston, TX |Date=March 1, 2014 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Houston Chronicle}}</ref>) often gives some bizarre item to Curtis, with disastrous results (most often a [[chameleon]]). One of his quirks is his refusal to fight anybody, but he also is cat-like in his moves to avoid his nemesis's punches, because as he says afterwards, \"Just because I won't fight you doesn't mean I'm going to let you hit me.\"\n*'''Gunther''' - Runs the Soul Scissors<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=July 6, 2016|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref> [[Barber]] Shop. Asked if Gunther is his first or last name, he replies, \"Yeah.\"<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=June 4, 2017|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref> Never gets Curtis' name right (but at least every attempt either starts with a \"C\" or a hard \"C\" sound), and who claims to know nearly every famous person (and who has photos &ndash; but always with a thumb covering the famous person).\n*'''Rose Petal''', niece of Gunther, who enjoys singing, but she gets fired from every gig she enters, because she has a foul mouth and a really bad attitude. She refuses to work for money she needs to \"pay for her rent\" (although it is revealed that she really needs the money to party), and ultimately, Gunther throws her out of his shop, demonstrating \"[[tough love]]\". She responds with profanity. According to Curtis, she thinks the world owes her.\n*'''Derrick''' - A [[Bullying|bully]]. He and his friend, \"Onion\", make fun of Curtis by calling him \"Wimpkins\" and using \"[[your mom|yo momma jokes]]\", and on occasion physically harass him (in one series, they attempted to falsely accuse him of criminal activity). Curtis attempts to avoid them as much as possible. Gunk, Chutney and others have helped Curtis against the bullying of Derrick and \"Onion\". In a late 2010 strip, Derrick has a girlfriend named Veranda, who has an attitude like him and \"Onion\".\n*'''\"Onion\"''' - Derrick's friend and fellow [[bullying|bully]] to Curtis. His real name is Norman,<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=November 16, 2014 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref> but is self-nicknamed \"Onion\" for being able to \"bring tears to a sucker's eyes\", although Curtis once exclaimed that it was \"probably because he stunk\".\n*'''\"Ms. Honeystump\"''' - Curtis's summer-school teacher. The gag is that she's attractive, and therefore distracting to the students.\n*'''\"Mr. Kwame\"''' - Michelle's Teacher whom she is madly in love with. The gag is while Curtis fawns over her in his presence she completely ignores his passes while dreaming about him.\n*'''\"Heart-Throb\"''' - An overweight friend of Curtis whose real name is Anthony Caldwell.<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=June 15, 2016|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref> He is polite and tells adults what they want to hear but doesn't mean what he says.<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=June 18, 2016|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref>\n*'''\"Tiny\"''' - Gunther's very large nephew who everyone believes is going to college on a football scholarship but is really receiving an academic scholarship and studying to be a lawyer.<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=April 18, 2017|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref><ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=April 21, 2017|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref><ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=April 27, 2017|Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring gags==\n*Barry is almost always listening in on either phone or live conversations between Curtis and Michelle which annoys Curtis. A frequent running gag in the strip, each time this happens it starts with Barry saying something offensive about Michelle, which causes Curtis to chase after him. Barry runs to Diane, saying \"Mama, Curtis is trying to hit me ''for no good reason''!\" Curtis responds by saying \"Don't fall for his 'innocent little boy' routine, Mom,\" and begins to explain what Barry did. More often that not, Diane does not believe Curtis and usually gives Barry [[ice cream]] to calm him while scolding Curtis and sending him off to do chores. On a couple of occasions, Barry even confesses to having listened to the conversations (asking what does a certain phrase mean, or even offering to repeat what Curtis said).  This prompts questions from some over whether Diane properly punishes him for lying and eavesdropping.<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=February 5, 2008 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref>\n*Greg Wilkins is a heavy smoker, a habit he picked up in childhood and has apparently little desire to break as it apparently helps him cope with life. Curtis is not happy with his father's smoking and tries at various points to make him quit, including by trying to shame him for having to stop at the grocery store in the rain with no umbrella just so he could purchase cigarettes (which backfires when Greg tells Curtis the purpose of the trip was to buy [[liver (food)|liver]] for dinner, which Curtis hates) and by purposely breaking his cigarettes in front of Greg, which causes him to chase Curtis around the house.\n*Another recurring theme involves Curtis' favorite [[comic book]] [[superhero]] Supercaptaincoolman. The strip reads like a comic book in most part where Supercaptaincoolman engages in many types of adventures in his daily struggle to rid the world of his arch nemesis, The Evil Dr. Horsehead.  But just as the action is about to heat up, the third to last panel suddenly shows Ms. Nelson shouting, \"Mr. Wilkins!!\" as she catches Curtis reading his comics while he is supposed to be paying attention in class while he gulps and says \"Ms. Nelson!\" He immediately tries to get out of the situation by lying.  The last panel shows Curtis being sent to the principal's [[office]] as punishment for reading comic books in class.\n*Once in a while, Curtis and Barry, just before [[church service]]s begin, will observe ladies coming in wearing elaborate hats on their heads.  Curtis will promptly make jokes about each hat they are wearing as they pass by the [[pew]] that Curtis and Barry are sitting in, while Barry tries not to laugh too loud.  In the last panel, while Curtis is laughing over his ladies' hat jokes, Barry will typically warn Curtis about big trouble coming to him if they ever heard him make insulting jokes about their hats (ironically, in one such strip, there were also two elderly men who mock the women's hats in exactly the same manner as Curtis and Barry do, causing Barry to worry even more as to what they might end up as).\n*In another recurring theme, Diane would have a dish made for either dinner or a bake sale at church place on the table in front of Curtis. She turns away for one second only to turn back and find Curtis eating up everything at an amazingly fast rate. The last panel features Curtis sitting in his room after being punished for eating the whole dish Diane made for either everyone at dinner or the church bake sale.\n*One recurring theme always involves Curtis and someone else (often his brother) entering some establishment with a name like \"The [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] School of Personal [[Etiquette]]\" or \"The [[Mike Tyson]] Institute of Good Mannerism\", then finding out it's really a music store.  Curtis explains that \"it's really my favorite record store in disguise\" and that \"the locals torch the place once they find out its real identity\", apparently due to the type of music it sells (usually rap music featuring an artist with a [[rap sheet]]). This theme has been featured less since the advent of [[iTunes]].\n*The skits often show Curtis (and often Barry for mere association) being disciplined for his various antics by either his mom or dad.  However, they never show the actual punishment as it takes place, but the final frame of a strip where discipline is administered will show stars and such showing where the punishment was administered.\n*Another recurring theme is the first day of school strip where the reader sees the city in the first panel. Then, the next two panels of the view brings the reader to where Curtis lives. The first three strips warn the reader about something that very disturbing is happening at this time of the morning, whether it is a skirmish or some other type of war. After being warned about what's to come in the third panel, the reader will then be taken to the last panel where the actual event takes place\u2014Diane forcing Curtis to get out of bed to get ready for school while Curtis would rather stay in bed and sleep away.<ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=September 13, 2004 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref><ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=September 19, 2005 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref><ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=September 11, 2006 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref><ref>{{Comic strip reference |Cartoonist=Ray Billingsley |Strip=Curtis |Location=Seattle, WA |Date=September 3, 2007 |Syndicate=King Features |Paper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://kingfeatures.com/comics/comics-a-z/?id=Curtis Curtis]\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/curtis.htm Toonopedia]\n\n{{King Features Syndicate Comics}}\n\n[[Category:African-Americans in comic strips]]\n[[Category:Child characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Comic strips set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Comic strips started in the 1980s]]\n", "name_user": "Vchimpanzee", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCharacters and story", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_(comic_strip)"}

After finishing touring for its previous album, ''[[Caress of Steel]]'', in early 1976, the band was in financial hardship due to the album's disappointing sales, unfavorable critical reception, and a decline in attendance at its shows. The band's international label, [[Mercury Records]], considered dropping Rush but granted the band one more album following negotiations with manager [[Ray Danniels]]. Though the label demanded more commercial material, the band decided to continue developing its progressive rock sound. ''2112'' was recorded in February 1976 in Toronto with longtime producer [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]]. Its centerpiece is a 20-minute [[2112 (song)|title track]], a futuristic science-fiction song that takes up the entire first side of the album. There are five individual tracks on side two.\n\n''2112'' was released to favourable reviews from music critics and quickly outsold the band's previous albums. It peaked at No. 5 on the [[Canadian Albums Chart]] and No. 61 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tape]] and was the band's commercial breakthrough in the country. Rush supported the album with a tour of the United States, Canada, and for the first time, Europe, from February 1976 to June 1977. ''2112'' remains the band's second-highest-selling album (behind ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'') with more than 3 million copies sold in the United States. It is listed in ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', and ranked second on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s reader's poll, Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-your-favorite-prog-rock-albums-of-all-time-20120725/2-rush-2112-0423628 |title='Reader's Poll: Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time |first=Andy |last=Greene |date=26 July 2012 |magazine=Rolling Stone |accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref> ''2112'' has been reissued several times; a 40th Anniversary Edition was released in 2016 with previously unreleased material, including the album performed by artists including [[Dave Grohl]], [[Taylor Hawkins]], [[Steven Wilson]], and [[Alice in Chains]].\n\n== Background ==\nIn January 1976, Rush ended its 1975\u20131976 tour to support the band's third studio album, ''[[Caress of Steel]]''. The band members had enjoyed writing and recording the album, but Lifeson recalled the group in a state of confusion after the tour, sensing the disappointing reaction from crowds after playing songs from it on stage.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> The [[progressive rock]]-themed album with lengthy, story-based songs, complex song structures, and hard-to-grasp lyrics, made it difficult to receive radio airplay and promote effectively.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Lee said the band could not understand the underwhelming response, and later dubbed the tour the \"Down the Tubes Tour\" as the band members struggled to meet their $125-a-week salary while crowds declined.<ref name=guitarworld2013/> Lee added, \"That really shakes your confidence. We were so confused and disheartened\".<ref name=40theditionnotes/> In 1980, Lifeson picked this moment of the band's history as the only time he felt close to giving up.<ref name=lifeson1980/>\n\nTo make matters worse, ''Caress of Steel'' raised concerns for management at [[Mercury Records]], the band's international label, which considered dropping Rush. Band manager [[Ray Danniels]] then flew to the label's head offices in Chicago to try to regain confidence in the band and spoke highly of the band's new ideas for a new album without hearing any of it. Mercury complied and gave the green light to one more album.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Despite pressure from the label and management to make a more commercial record, the band ignored the advice and proceeded with material as they saw fit.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Lifeson questioned the musical direction the band was taking at such a crucial time in the band's history. \"I remember having these conversations about, 'What are we going to do? Are we going to try to make another mini-Led Zeppelin record or are we going to do what we are going to do and continue forward and whatever happens, happens?' That's what we honestly decided to do. We fully intended to go down in flames but we were prepared to do that.\"<ref name=40theditionnotes/>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Writing and recording ===\nRush began to put down musical ideas for ''2112'' in backstage dressing rooms, hotel rooms and in their touring van during the ''Caress of Steel'' tour.<ref name=guitarworld2013/> As Peart started to write lyrics, Lee and Lifeson would write music that complemented the mood of what Peart was writing about.<ref name=circus1976/> Most of it was performed on acoustic guitars with the exception of some electric guitar passages with a portable [[Pignose]] practice amplifier.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> They focused on writing music with little need for overdubbing, as they wished to recreate it on stage as much as possible.<ref name=RPM1976/> Lifeson recalled developing \"The Temples of Syrinx\" backstage at a gig in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]] in front of their opening act [[Mendelson Joe]].<ref name=40theditionnotes/> The album was written in approximately six months,<ref name=RPM1976/> with \"Overture\" being the final piece developed.<ref name=radar2016>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/geddy-lee-talks-rushs-2112-track-by-track-634713|title=Geddy Lee talks Rush's 2112 track-by-track|first=Amit|last=Sharma|publisher=Music Radar|date=15 February 2016|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref> Rush made a conscious effort to exclude Danniels from the writing and recording sessions, and only played the album to him when it was finished.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Musically speaking, ''2112'' was the first album that Lifeson said \"really sounded like Rush\".<ref name=guitarworld2013>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20130400guitarworld.htm|title=Big Time Rush|first=Richard|last=Bienstock|magazine=Guitar World|date=April 2013|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n''2112'' was recorded in February 1976 across four weeks at Toronto Sound Studios, with longtime associate [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]] assuming his role as producer.<ref name=LPnotes/><ref name=RPM1976/><ref name=40theditionnotes>{{cite AV media notes|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/211240anniversary.html|title=2112 (40th Anniversary Edition) booklet|publisher=Anthem Records|date=2012|id=0602537150168|first=Rob|last=Bowman|others=Rush}}</ref> The studio was fitted with a [[Multitrack recording|24-track machine]] manufactured by [[Studer]].

The seven-part track is based on a story by Peart, the band's primary lyricist, who credits \"the genius of [[Ayn Rand]]\" in the album's liner notes. Rand, a Russian-born, Jewish-American novelist, and inventor of the philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], wrote the 1937 dystopian fictional novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', the plot of which bears several similarities to ''2112'', and all members read the book.<ref name=scene1976>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19760603scene.htm|title=Rush's \"Concept\" Is Rock And Roll|first=Nick|last=Shofar|date=June 1976|magazine=Scene|volume=7|issue=22|location=Northeast Ohio|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref> Peart added the credit to avoid any legal action. The credit caused the band significant negative publicity, with many labelling them [[Far-right politics|right-wing extremists]]. In the British paper ''[[NME]]'', [[Barry Miles]] made allusions to [[Nazism]], which particularly offended Lee, whose parents were [[Holocaust]] survivors.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> The first and last sections, \"Overture\" and \"Grand Finale\", respectively, are instrumental and borrow a short sequence from ''[[1812 Overture]]'' by [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]].<ref name=40theditionnotes/><ref name=guitarworld2013/> The \"Overture\" features an introduction from graphic designer and musician [[Hugh Syme]] performed on an [[ARP Odyssey]] synthesizer with an [[Echoplex]] Delay pedal.

Next, in \"Oracle: The Dream\", the man dreams of a new planet, established at the same time as the Solar Federation, where creative people live.<ref name=circus1976/> He awakens, depressed that music is part of such a civilization and that he can never be part of it, and kills himself, in \"Soliloquy\", originally titled \"Soliloquy of the Soul\".<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Another planetary war begins in \"Grand Finale\",<ref name=scene1976/> originally named \"Denouement\",<ref name=40theditionnotes/> resulting in the ambiguous spoken ending: \"Attention all planets of the Solar Federation: We have assumed control\". Peart described the ending as a \"double surprise ... a real [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] killer\".<ref name=creem1976/>\n\n==== Side two ====\nSide two contains five individual songs that display the band's more traditional hard-rock sound and Lee's higher-pitched vocals featured on their previous albums.<ref name=circus1976/> Lifeson said having a title track more serious, the rest of the album was to be \"just a little lighter and a little more fun\".<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Bowman wrote that the variation of styles on side two offers \"a very different listening experience\" in comparison.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Though the tracks are not specifically about the \"2112\" concept, they do contain ideas that can relate to its overall theme.<ref name=scene1976/> Lee wrote the lyrics for \"Tears\" and Lifeson the lyrics to \"Lessons\", while Peart wrote the rest.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rushs-alex-lifeson-on-40-years-of-2112-it-was-our-protest-album-20160329?page=5 |title=Rush's Alex Lifeson on 40 Years of '2112': 'It Was Our Protest Album' |last=Grow |first=Kory |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2016-03-29 |accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref>\n\n\"[[A Passage to Bangkok]]\" is a song about [[marijuana]]; Lee said it is \"a travelogue for all the places in the world that grow the best weed\". The track mentions a number of cities and countries, including [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Acapulco]], [[Morocco]], [[Bangkok]] and [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]].<ref name=radar2016/> Rush started to write \"[[The Twilight Zone (Rush song)|The Twilight Zone]]\" at a time when they needed one more song to fill both sides of the vinyl record. The band were big fans of the television series ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' and based the track on the stories written for it from its host, [[Rod Serling]].<ref name=radar2016/> \"Lessons\" is one of the few Rush songs written solely by Lifeson. For him, the process of songwriting is more seldom and spontaneous in comparison to dedicating time to write, rehearse and scrap parts that do not work.<ref name=lifeson1980/> \"Tears\" is a romantic ballad and is the first Rush track to incorporate the [[Mellotron]], which Syme performs.<ref name=radar2016/> \"Something for Nothing\" is a song about freewill and decision making.<ref name=radar2016/> Regarding this song, Peart states: \"All those paeans to American restlessness and the American road carried a tinge of wistfulness, an acknowledgement of the hardships of the vagrant life, the notion that wanderlust could be involuntary, exile as much as freedom, and indeed, the understanding that freedom wasn't free.\" In the mid-1970s, the band was driving to a show in downtown Los Angeles, at the [[Shrine Auditorium]], and I noticed some graffiti splattered across a wall: 'Freedom isn't free', and I adapted that for a song on ''2112''.\"\n\n=== Artwork ===\nAlso known as the 'Man in the Star' logo, the Starman emblem was adopted by Rush fans as a logo since its first appearance in the gatefold of ''2112''. Peart described the Starman in an interview with ''Creem'' magazine:\n\n{{quote|All [the naked man] means is the abstract man against the masses. The red star symbolizes any collectivist mentality.}}\n\nOn the album art, the \"collectivist mentality\" is depicted as the Red Star of the Solar Federation, which, according to the plot, is a galaxy-wide federation that controls all aspects of life during the year 2112. The figure in the emblem is depicted as the \"Hero\". [[Hugh Syme]], the creator of many of Rush's album covers, commented on the design: \"The man is the hero of the story. That he is nude is just a classic tradition&nbsp;... the pureness of his person and creativity without the trappings of other elements such as clothing. The red star is the evil red star of the Federation, which was one of Peart's symbols. We basically based that cover around the red star and that hero.\"\n\nThe logo also appears on seven other Rush album covers: on the backdrop behind Peart's drumkit in ''All the World's a Stage'', their first live album released in 1976; in one of the pictures that is being moved in ''Moving Pictures''; on ''[[Retrospective I]]''; on ''[[Archives (Rush album)|Archives]]'', a compilation album released in 1978; on their 1981 live album ''[[Exit...Stage Left]]'', in the background amongst symbols from all their previous work; on their 2003 compilation ''[[The Spirit of Radio: Greatest Hits 1974\u20131987]]''; and on their 2004 EP ''[[Feedback (EP)|Feedback]]''.

[[Rush (band)|Rush]], released on April 1, 1976 (or March 1976, according to some sources)<ref name=date1/><ref name=date2/><ref name=date3/> by [[Anthem Records]]. After finishing touring for its previous album, ''[[Caress of Steel]]'', in early 1976, the band was in financial hardship due to the album's disappointing sales, unfavorable critical reception, and a decline in attendance at its shows. The band's international label, [[Mercury Records]], considered dropping Rush but granted the band one more album following negotiations with manager [[Ray Danniels]]. Though the label demanded more commercial material, the band decided to continue developing its progressive rock sound. ''2112'' was recorded in February 1976 in Toronto with longtime producer [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]]. Its centerpiece is a 20-minute [[2112 (song)|title track]], a futuristic science-fiction song that takes up the entire first side of the album. There are five individual tracks on side two.\n\n''2112'' was released to favourable reviews from music critics and quickly outsold the band's previous albums. It peaked at No. 5 on the [[Canadian Albums Chart]] and No. 61 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tape]] and was the band's commercial breakthrough in the country. Rush supported the album with a tour of the United States, Canada, and for the first time, Europe, from February 1976 to June 1977. ''2112'' remains the band's second-highest-selling album (behind ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'') with more than 3 million copies sold in the United States. It is listed in ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', and ranked second on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s reader's poll, Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-your-favorite-prog-rock-albums-of-all-time-20120725/2-rush-2112-0423628 |title='Reader's Poll: Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time |first=Andy |last=Greene |date=26 July 2012 |magazine=Rolling Stone |accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref> ''2112'' has been reissued several times; a 40th Anniversary Edition was released in 2016 with previously unreleased material, including the album performed by artists including [[Dave Grohl]], [[Taylor Hawkins]], [[Steven Wilson]], and [[Alice in Chains]].\n\n== Background ==\nIn January 1976, Rush ended its 1975\u20131976 tour to support the band's third studio album, ''[[Caress of Steel]]''. The band members had enjoyed writing and recording the album, but Lifeson recalled the group in a state of confusion after the tour, sensing the disappointing reaction from crowds after playing songs from it on stage.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> The [[progressive rock]]-themed album with lengthy, story-based songs, complex song structures, and hard-to-grasp lyrics, made it difficult to receive radio airplay and promote effectively.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Lee said the band could not understand the underwhelming response, and later dubbed the tour the \"Down the Tubes Tour\" as the band members struggled to meet their $125-a-week salary while crowds declined.<ref name=guitarworld2013/> Lee added, \"That really shakes your confidence. We were so confused and disheartened\".<ref name=40theditionnotes/> In 1980, Lifeson picked this moment of the band's history as the only time he felt close to giving up.<ref name=lifeson1980/>\n\nTo make matters worse, ''Caress of Steel'' raised concerns for management at [[Mercury Records]], the band's international label, which considered dropping Rush. Band manager [[Ray Danniels]] then flew to the label's head offices in Chicago to try to regain confidence in the band and spoke highly of the band's new ideas for a new album without hearing any of it. Mercury complied and gave the green light to one more album.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Despite pressure from the label and management to make a more commercial record, the band ignored the advice and proceeded with material as they saw fit.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Lifeson questioned the musical direction the band was taking at such a crucial time in the band's history. \"I remember having these conversations about, 'What are we going to do? Are we going to try to make another mini-Led Zeppelin record or are we going to do what we are going to do and continue forward and whatever happens, happens?' That's what we honestly decided to do. We fully intended to go down in flames but we were prepared to do that.\"<ref name=40theditionnotes/>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Writing and recording ===\nRush began to put down musical ideas for ''2112'' in backstage dressing rooms, hotel rooms and in their touring van during the ''Caress of Steel'' tour.<ref name=guitarworld2013/> As Peart started to write lyrics, Lee and Lifeson would write music that complemented the mood of what Peart was writing about.<ref name=circus1976/> Most of it was performed on acoustic guitars with the exception of some electric guitar passages with a portable [[Pignose]] practice amplifier.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> They focused on writing music with little need for overdubbing, as they wished to recreate it on stage as much as possible.<ref name=RPM1976/> Lifeson recalled developing \"The Temples of Syrinx\" backstage at a gig in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]] in front of their opening act [[Mendelson Joe]].<ref name=40theditionnotes/> The album was written in approximately six months,<ref name=RPM1976/> with \"Overture\" being the final piece developed.<ref name=radar2016>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/geddy-lee-talks-rushs-2112-track-by-track-634713|title=Geddy Lee talks Rush's 2112 track-by-track|first=Amit|last=Sharma|publisher=Music Radar|date=15 February 2016|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref> Rush made a conscious effort to exclude Danniels from the writing and recording sessions, and only played the album to him when it was finished.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Musically speaking, ''2112'' was the first album that Lifeson said \"really sounded like Rush\".<ref name=guitarworld2013>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20130400guitarworld.htm|title=Big Time Rush|first=Richard|last=Bienstock|magazine=Guitar World|date=April 2013|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n''2112'' was recorded in February 1976 across four weeks at Toronto Sound Studios, with longtime associate [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]] assuming his role as producer.<ref name=LPnotes/><ref name=RPM1976/><ref name=40theditionnotes>{{cite AV media notes|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/211240anniversary.html|title=2112 (40th Anniversary Edition) booklet|publisher=Anthem Records|date=2012|id=0602537150168|first=Rob|last=Bowman|others=Rush}}</ref> The studio was fitted with a [[Multitrack recording|24-track machine]] manufactured by [[Studer]]. Lifeson plays a 1968 [[Gibson ES-335]] for the majority of the electric guitar parts on ''2112'', with some lead parts played on a [[Gibson Les Paul]] Standard. For the acoustic sections, he plays a 12-string [[Gibson B series|Gibson B-45]] and a six-string [[Gibson Dove]].

The seven-part track is based on a story by Peart, the band's primary lyricist, who credits \"the genius of [[Ayn Rand]]\" in the album's liner notes. Rand, a Russian-born, Jewish-American novelist, and inventor of the philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], wrote the 1937 dystopian fictional novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', the plot of which bears several similarities to ''2112'', and all members read the book.<ref name=scene1976>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19760603scene.htm|title=Rush's \"Concept\" Is Rock And Roll|first=Nick|last=Shofar|date=June 1976|magazine=Scene|volume=7|issue=22|location=Northeast Ohio|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref> Peart added the credit to avoid any legal action. The credit caused the band significant negative publicity, with many labelling them [[Far-right politics|right-wing extremists]]. In the British paper ''[[NME]]'', [[Barry Miles]] made allusions to [[Nazism]], which particularly offended Lee, whose parents were [[Holocaust]] survivors.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> The first and last sections, \"Overture\" and \"Grand Finale\", respectively, are instrumental and borrow a short sequence from ''[[1812 Overture]]'' by [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]].<ref name=40theditionnotes/><ref name=guitarworld2013/> The \"Overture\" features an introduction from graphic designer and musician [[Hugh Syme]] performed on an [[ARP Odyssey]] synthesizer with an [[Echoplex]] Delay pedal. Music writer and professor [[Rob Bowman (music writer)|Rob Bowman]] calculated that in the entire piece, 2:34 of the song contains improvised guitar solos.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> \"Overture\" contains the lyric \"And the meek shall inherit the earth\", a reference to the Biblical passages [[Book of Psalms]] 37:11 and [[Matthew 5:5]].<ref name=40theditionnotes/>\n\n\"2112\" tells a story set in the city of Megadon in the year [[AD 2112|2112]],<ref name=creem1976>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19760300creem.htm|title=RUSH Pebbles & Bam-Bam In Alphaville|first=Rick|last=Johnson|date=March 1976|magazine=Creem|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref> \"where individualism and creativity are outlawed with the population controlled by a cabal of malevolent Priests who reside in the Temples of Syrinx\".<ref name=40theditionnotes/> A galaxy-wide war resulted in the planets forcefully joining the Solar Federation (symbolized by the \"Red Star\"). By 2112, the world is controlled by the priests who take orders from giant banks of computers inside the temple.<ref name=creem1976/> Music is unknown in this world absent of creativity and individuality, but in \"Discovery\", a nameless man finds a beaten guitar inside a cave and rediscovers the lost art of music.<ref name=circus1976/><ref name=creem1976/><ref name=circus1976>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19760427circus.htm|title=Rush Goes Into Future Shock|first=Dan|last=Nooger|date=27 April 1976|magazine=Circus|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref> In \"Presentation\", the man takes the guitar to the priests at the temple, who say, \"Yes, we know, it's nothing new; it's just a waste of time\", and then proceed angrily to destroy it and banish him. Next, in \"Oracle: The Dream\", the man dreams of a new planet, established at the same time as the Solar Federation, where creative people live.<ref name=circus1976/> He awakens, depressed that music is part of such a civilization and that he can never be part of it, and kills himself, in \"Soliloquy\", originally titled \"Soliloquy of the Soul\".<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Another planetary war begins in \"Grand Finale\",<ref name=scene1976/> originally named \"Denouement\",<ref name=40theditionnotes/> resulting in the ambiguous spoken ending: \"Attention all planets of the Solar Federation: We have assumed control\". Peart described the ending as a \"double surprise ... a real [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] killer\".<ref name=creem1976/>\n\n==== Side two ====\nSide two contains five individual songs that display the band's more traditional hard-rock sound and Lee's higher-pitched vocals featured on their previous albums.<ref name=circus1976/> Lifeson said having a title track more serious, the rest of the album was to be \"just a little lighter and a little more fun\".<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Bowman wrote that the variation of styles on side two offers \"a very different listening experience\" in comparison.<ref name=40theditionnotes/> Though the tracks are not specifically about the \"2112\" concept, they do contain ideas that can relate to its overall theme.<ref name=scene1976/> Lee wrote the lyrics for \"Tears\" and Lifeson the lyrics to \"Lessons\", while Peart wrote the rest.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rushs-alex-lifeson-on-40-years-of-2112-it-was-our-protest-album-20160329?page=5 |title=Rush's Alex Lifeson on 40 Years of '2112': 'It Was Our Protest Album' |last=Grow |first=Kory |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2016-03-29 |accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref>\n\n\"[[A Passage to Bangkok]]\" is a song about [[marijuana]]; Lee said it is \"a travelogue for all the places in the world that grow the best weed\". The track mentions a number of cities and countries, including [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Acapulco]], [[Morocco]], [[Bangkok]] and [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]].<ref name=radar2016/> Rush started to write \"[[The Twilight Zone (Rush song)|The Twilight Zone]]\" at a time when they needed one more song to fill both sides of the vinyl record. The band were big fans of the television series ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' and based the track on the stories written for it from its host, [[Rod Serling]].<ref name=radar2016/> \"Lessons\" is one of the few Rush songs written solely by Lifeson. For him, the process of songwriting is more seldom and spontaneous in comparison to dedicating time to write, rehearse and scrap parts that do not work.<ref name=lifeson1980/> \"Tears\" is a romantic ballad and is the first Rush track to incorporate the [[Mellotron]], which Syme performs.<ref name=radar2016/> \"Something for Nothing\" is a song about freewill and decision making.<ref name=radar2016/> Regarding this song, Peart states: \"All those paeans to American restlessness and the American road carried a tinge of wistfulness, an acknowledgement of the hardships of the vagrant life, the notion that wanderlust could be involuntary, exile as much as freedom, and indeed, the understanding that freedom wasn't free.\" In the mid-1970s, the band was driving to a show in downtown Los Angeles, at the [[Shrine Auditorium]], and I noticed some graffiti splattered across a wall: 'Freedom isn't free', and I adapted that for a song on ''2112''.\"\n\n=== Artwork ===\nAlso known as the 'Man in the Star' logo, the Starman emblem was adopted by Rush fans as a logo since its first appearance in the gatefold of ''2112''. Peart described the Starman in an interview with ''Creem'' magazine:\n\n{{quote|All [the naked man] means is the abstract man against the masses. The red star symbolizes any collectivist mentality.}}\n\nOn the album art, the \"collectivist mentality\" is depicted as the Red Star of the Solar Federation, which, according to the plot, is a galaxy-wide federation that controls all aspects of life during the year 2112. The figure in the emblem is depicted as the \"Hero\". [[Hugh Syme]], the creator of many of Rush's album covers, commented on the design: \"The man is the hero of the story. That he is nude is just a classic tradition&nbsp;... the pureness of his person and creativity without the trappings of other elements such as clothing. The red star is the evil red star of the Federation, which was one of Peart's symbols. We basically based that cover around the red star and that hero.\"\n\nThe logo also appears on seven other Rush album covers: on the backdrop behind Peart's drumkit in ''All the World's a Stage'', their first live album released in 1976; in one of the pictures that is being moved in ''Moving Pictures''; on ''[[Retrospective I]]''; on ''[[Archives (Rush album)|Archives]]'', a compilation album released in 1978; on their 1981 live album ''[[Exit...Stage Left]]'', in the background amongst symbols from all their previous work; on their 2003 compilation ''[[The Spirit of Radio: Greatest Hits 1974\u20131987]]''; and on their 2004 EP ''[[Feedback (EP)|Feedback]]''.
