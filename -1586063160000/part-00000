The leaf-axils can have either sparse silky hairs or none, and the leaves are either stalkless (sessile) or with a winged stalk, obovate, 5\u201311 cm. long, 2\u20137 cm. broad, and smooth-edged. There are 2-4 pairs lateral veins which are not easily seen.\nThe inflorescence is a series cymes in the axils with one to seven stalkless flowers.\nThe corolla is white or greenish with a tube 10\u201312 mm. long, 3 mm. broad, and crowded with hairs inside. \nThe ovary is 2-locular but only one ovule develops.\nThe fleshy fruit is blue or black and from 10 to 15 mm in diameter. The seeds do not disperse from the fruit.<ref name=powo/>\n\n''Scaevola plumieri'' is similar to ''[[Scaevola taccada]]'' \u2013 both were included in the original [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the species. ''S.&nbsp;plumieri'' has short or absent lobes on its [[Sepal|calyx]] and black fruit when ripe.
