It premiered on 14 April 2003 on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV1]] in the United Kingdom, followed by its [[Nick Jr. (UK and Ireland)|Nick Jr. UK]] premiere on 30 September 2003.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20060304094335/http://www.nickjr.co.uk/shows/boohbah/index.aspx</ref> It aired in the United States on [[PBS Kids]] from January 19, 2004 until January 31, 2010. In Canada it aired on [[Treehouse TV|Treehouse]]. The series was produced by [[Ragdoll Productions]].\n\nThe series ran for three seasons, with a total of 104 episodes.\n\n==Characters==\nThe series focuses on the Boohbahs: five plump, fuzzy, furry, gumdrop-shaped creatures played by actors in full-body costumes. Their fur sparkles and shimmers with tiny lights, and they are hairless with big eyes and rows of lights for eyebrows. They do not speak; instead, they make noises such as squeaks, squeals, \"poofs\", and clicks. The Boohbahs can retract their heads into their furry necks. Each Boohbah is a different colour.\n\nA list of the Boohbahs is available below.\n* Humbah, portrayed by Emma Insley, is a yellow Boohbah.\n* Zumbah, portrayed by Alex Poulter, is a purple Boohbah.\n* Zing Zing Zingbah, portrayed by Cal Jaggers, is an orange Boohbah.\n* Jumbah, portrayed by [[Phil Hayes (actor)|Phil Hayes]], is a blue Boohbah.\n* Jingbah, portrayed by Laura Pero, is a pink Boohbah.\n\nThe Boohbahs can fly; part of their routine is to assemble into a circle, holding hands like skydivers. Each then emits a different musical note as a flash of coloured light (matching the Boohbah's colour) is sent out from their heads to a central point.\n\nThe Boohbahs were designed and made by costume and creature designer, Vin Burnham. \n\n===Storypeople===\nThe Storypeople are a diverse group of familial characters who inhabit Storyworld and there participate in various vignettes inspired by the presents (see below).  They are:\n\n* Grandmamma (Linda Kerr-Scott) \u2013 An elderly yet spry Caucasian woman. She has white banana hair and wears a dark pink housedress, pale blue sweater, white socks, and red [[trainers]].\n* Grandpappa ([[Robin Stevens]]) \u2013 An elderly yet spry Caucasian man. He has white hair and a white moustache; he wears a long-sleeved yellow shirt, dark grey slacks, red [[Braces (clothing)|braces]], and white trainers.\n* Mrs. Lady ([[Harvey Virdi]]) \u2013 An Indian woman. She has dark hair and wears a loose light blue blouse, loose bright pink trousers, and pink trainers.\n* Mr. Man (Mark Ramsey) \u2013 An African-American man. He wears a short-sleeved bright pink shirt, white trousers, and black trainers.\n* Brother (Manuel Bravo) and Sister (Vee Vimolmal) \u2013 ''Always'' paired, they both appear to be in their late teens. ''Brother:'' A [[Latin Americans|Latino]] boy with short black hair; he wears a bright blue T-shirt, bright red knee-length shorts, and white trainers with pink laces. ''Sister:'' A [[Thai people|Thai]] girl with hip-length black hair in a long [[ponytail]]; she wears a bright red T-shirt, bright blue [[capri pants]], and white trainers with pink laces.\n* Auntie (Sachi Kimura) \u2013 A Japanese woman. She has short black hair and wears a long-sleeved lavender blouse, black trousers, purple tights, and black shoes.\n* Little Dog Fido (Dash) \u2013 A [[Jack Russell Terrier]]. He wears a red collar.\n\nThe Storypeople do not speak. (When Little Dog Fido appears, he gives an \"arf!\")  Though they sometimes exhibit frustration or confusion, the Storypeople rarely, if ever, appear upset or sad.  The Storyworld segments are narrated by actor [[Chris Langham]]. In each episode the Storypeople magically receive an object sent to them by a child or group of children.\n\n==The Boohzone==\n \nThe main setting of ''Boohbah'' is the Boohzone, which is the Boohbahs' habitat. The Boohzone somewhat examples a multi-coloured dome with bubbles on its walls, and a rainbow streak leading up to the Boohball. In the middle of the Boohzone is a coloured walkway leading to a spot that resembles either a rainbow spiral or a blank circle when the Boohbahs come down to that area to dance. In the introductions to the \"Storyworld\" segments, some children will come into the Boohzone to give a present to the Storypeople, and the Boohball will pick it up and send it to Storyworld.\n\n==Episodes==\nThree series consisting of 104 episodes were produced.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Series 1 (2003)===\n# \"Skipping Rope\" (14 April 2003)\n# \"Pearly Shells\" (15 April

It was established for the 1905 election and has existed since. It is currently held by [[David Clark (New Zealand politician)|David Clark]] of the [[New Zealand Labour Party]], who replaced the long-standing representative [[Pete Hodgson]]. It is considered a safe Labour seat, with Labour holding the seat for all but one term (1975\u20131978) since {{NZ election link year|1928}}.\n\n==Population centres==\nThrough the City Single Electorates Act, 1903, the three-member electorates of the four main centres were split again, and this became effective at the end of the [[15th New Zealand Parliament|15th Parliament]] and was thus used for the {{NZ election link|1905}}. The {{NZ electorate link|City of Dunedin}} electorate was split into the {{NZ electorate link|Dunedin Central}}, Dunedin North, and {{NZ electorate link|Dunedin South}} electorates.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=66ff}}\n\nThe Dunedin electorate covers the northern half of the city of [[Dunedin]]. It is bordered by [[Waitaki (New Zealand electorate)|Waitaki]] in the north, [[Dunedin South]] in west, south, and south-east, and the Pacific Ocean in the north-east.\n\nThe electorate covers what is the equivalent of the Waikouaiti Coast-Chalmers ward of the Dunedin City Council outside the actual urban area of Dunedin. This includes the population centre of [[Waikouaiti]], [[Karitane]], [[Waitati]], [[Seacliff, New Zealand|Seacliff]], [[Warrington, New Zealand|Warrington]], [[Port Chalmers]], [[Sawyers Bay]], [[Roseneath, Otago|Roseneath]], and [[Aramoana]]. The 2013 redistribution saw the electorate expand to include [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]], [[Macraes Flat]], [[Moeraki]], [[Hampden, New Zealand|Hampden]] and [[Herbert, New Zealand|Herbert]]-[[Waianakarua]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2014 |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/report_of_the_representation_commission_2014.pdf |isbn=978-0-477-10414-2 |publisher=Representation Commission |accessdate=26 September 2014 |page=10 |format=PDF |date=4 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006075102/http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/report_of_the_representation_commission_2014.pdf |archive-date=6 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn urban Dunedin it covers most of northern, central and western Dunedin.

The electorate has the highest proportion of persons aged 15 to 19 in the country, with 14.1%. It also has the highest proportion of people on a student allowance (8.8%), employed in the education and training industry (11.7%), and employed in the health care and social assistance industry (12.3%).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/3946C4A7-1EDE-4C96-A038-24DCC910A6CC/111817/DunedinNorth_profile_3.pdf |title= Dunedin North \u2013 Electorate Profile |publisher=Parliamentary Library |date=24 July 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Dunedin electorate has a low rate of enrolment compared to New Zealand as a whole.

This includes the population centre of [[Waikouaiti]], [[Karitane]], [[Waitati]], [[Seacliff, New Zealand|Seacliff]], [[Warrington, New Zealand|Warrington]], [[Port Chalmers]], [[Sawyers Bay]], [[Roseneath, Otago|Roseneath]], and [[Aramoana]].

He was an instructor and acting-director at the National Gallery of Victoria\n\n==Early life==\nMcInnes was born in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], a suburb of [[Melbourne]], to Malcolm McInnes and his wife Alice Agnes, n\u00e9e Beckwith. Despite lack of family artistic tradition, he was keen to draw from the time he could hold a pencil. In 1903, at 14 years of age, he enrolled in the drawing school of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] under [[Frederick McCubbin]]. Later he moved up to the painting school under [[Lindsay Bernard Hall]].\n\n==Artistic career==\nHe won his first prizes for drawing the figure from life, and for painting a head from life, and shared the prize for a landscape in 1908.\n\nSoon afterwards McInnes held a successful show of his paintings at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Melbourne Athenaeum Gallery]] in conjunction with [[Frank R. Crozier|F. R. Crozier]], which was followed in 1911 by a journey to Europe where he did much landscape painting and made acquaintance with the masterpieces of Rembrandt, Velasquez and Raeburn.\n\nMcInnes was represented in [[London]] at the exhibition of the Royal Institute of Painters in oils in 1913.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 October 1913|title=Royal Institute Of Oil Painters|url=|journal=The Times|volume=|pages=10|via=The Times Digital Archive}}</ref>\n\nHe returned to Melbourne in the same year, where a one-man show was held at the Athenaeum gallery and nearly everything was sold. In 1916 he acted as locum tenens for Frederick McCubbin, master of the school of drawing at the National Gallery of Victoria, during McCubbin's six months' leave of absence.  McInnes was temporarily appointed to the position in 1918 after McCubbin's death, and in 1920 he was permanently appointed.\n\nIn 1921, he won the first [[Archibald Prize]]s for portraiture. He went on to win the award a total of seven times.<ref>{{Citation|last=Haese|first=Richard|title=McInnes, William Beckwith (Billy) (1889\u20131939)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mcinnes-william-beckwith-billy-7371|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref>\n\nMcInnes revisited Europe in 1925 and found he was in great demand as a portrait painter. For many years he was unable to spare time to do landscape work.  In 1927 he was commissioned by the Federal government to depict the opening of the first parliament in Canberra by the Duke of York.<ref>{{Citation|last=Haese|first=Richard|title=McInnes, William Beckwith (Billy) (1889\u20131939)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mcinnes-william-beckwith-billy-7371|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-160841844|title=William Beckwith McInnes painting the opening of the first Commonwealth Parliament, Canberra, ca. 1927 [picture].|website=nla.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref> In 1928 he exhibited with the [[Royal Academy]], and in 1933 he visited England again to paint the Duke of York (later [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]).\n\nIn the following year when [[Lindsay Bernard Hall|Bernard Hall]] left for England as adviser for the [[Alfred Felton|Felton]] bequest, McInnes was appointed acting-director of the National Gallery of Victoria, and on Hall's death, was appointed head of the painting school.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Findlay|first=Elisabeth|date=1992-01-01|title=The Liberal Teaching Philosophies of William Dargie: The National Gallery School from 1946 to 1953|journal=Australian Journal of Art|volume=10|issue=1|pages=66\u201379|doi=10.1080/03146464.1992.11432810|issn=0314-6464}}</ref>\n\nAmongst the many portraits by McInnes were those of the surgeons [[Archibald Watson]] and [[Wood Jones]].\n\nMcInnes' artwork is featured at the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] and the [[Art Gallery of NSW]].

He was an instructor and acting-director at the National Gallery of Victoria\n\n==Early life==\nMcInnes was born in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], a suburb of [[Melbourne]], to Malcolm McInnes and his wife Alice Agnes, n\u00e9e Beckwith. Despite lack of family artistic tradition, he was keen to draw from the time he could hold a pencil. In 1903, at 14 years of age, he enrolled in the drawing school of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] under [[Frederick McCubbin]]. Later he moved up to the painting school under [[Lindsay Bernard Hall]].\n\n==Artistic career==\nHe won his first prizes for drawing the figure from life, and for painting a head from life, and shared the prize for a landscape in 1908.\n\nSoon afterwards McInnes held a successful show of his paintings at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Melbourne Athenaeum Gallery]] in conjunction with [[Frank R. Crozier|F. R. Crozier]], which was followed in 1911 by a journey to Europe where he did much landscape painting and made acquaintance with the masterpieces of Rembrandt, Velasquez and Raeburn.\n\nMcInnes was represented in [[London]] at the exhibition of the Royal Institute of Painters in oils in 1913.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 October 1913|title=Royal Institute Of Oil Painters|url=|journal=The Times|volume=|pages=10|via=The Times Digital Archive}}</ref>\n\nHe returned to Melbourne in the same year, where a one-man show was held at the Athenaeum gallery and nearly everything was sold. In 1916 he acted as locum tenens for Frederick McCubbin, master of the school of drawing at the National Gallery of Victoria, during McCubbin's six months' leave of absence.  McInnes was temporarily appointed to the position in 1918 after McCubbin's death, and in 1920 he was permanently appointed.\n\nIn 1921, he won the first [[Archibald Prize]]s for portraiture. He went on to win the award a total of seven times.<ref>{{Citation|last=Haese|first=Richard|title=McInnes, William Beckwith (Billy) (1889\u20131939)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mcinnes-william-beckwith-billy-7371|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref>\n\nMcInnes revisited Europe in 1925 and found he was in great demand as a portrait painter.
