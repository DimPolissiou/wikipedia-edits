Cruella therefore mends her working relationship with her valet Alonzo and has him lock away all her fur coats. Cruella's probation officer, Chloe Simon, nevertheless suspects her, partly because Chloe is the owner of the grown-up Dipstick (one of the original 101 Dalmatians from the previous film) who moved from Roger and Anita Dearly's plantation to her house.\n\nDipstick's mate, Dottie, has recently given birth to three puppies: Domino, Little Dipper and Oddball (who has no spots). To mend her reputation, Cruella buys the Second Chance Dog shelter, owned by Kevin Shepherd, to resolve its financial insolvency that is on the verge of eviction. Meanwhile, Dr. Pavlov discovers that when his therapy's subjects are subjected to loud noises, they revert to their original states but conceals this discovery. Inevitably, when [[Big Ben]] rings in her presence, Cruella reverts to her former personality and enlists the help of French furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt to steal 102 Dalmatian puppies for a new fur coat with a hood, specifically modifying the original design to use Dipstick's children.\n\nKevin tells Chloe that if Cruella violates her parole, her entire fortune will go to him, since his dog shelter is the only one in the borough of Westminster. Knowing this, Cruella has Kevin framed for the theft of the puppies (exploiting the fact that he has a prior record of dog-napping himself) and invites Chloe and Dipstick to her house for a dinner party as a decoy to distract them while LePelt steals Dottie and the three puppies. Dipstick hurries back to the apartment and hides in LePelt's truck but is later captured at the train station. Chloe rushes home to save her pets but arrives too late. She is joined by Kevin, who has escaped from prison with help from his dogs and talking parrot, Waddlesworth, Kevin explaining that his past theft was just breaking animals out of a lab where they were being used for experiments.\n\nUpon finding a ticket for the [[Venice-Simplon Orient Express]] to [[Paris]] dropped by LePelt, Kevin and Chloe attempt and fail to stop Cruella and LePelt, but Oddball and Waddlesworth pursue their enemies secretly, Oddball having been ostracized due to her spotless status and Waddlesworth helping her get on the train while overcoming his belief that he was a dog himself. In Paris, Kevin and Chloe save some of the captive puppies, but they are seen and locked in the cellar just as the puppies flee. Cruella goes after the puppies alone. Alonzo, having been scolded beyond his patience and had enough of being abused, defeats LePelt and frees Kevin and Chloe. They later give chase to a bakery, where, led by Oddball; the puppies, Kevin's dogs, and Waddlesworth imprison Cruella in an immense cake. She and LePelt are thereupon arrested.\n\nKevin and Chloe, with the former exonerated from the theft accusation, are personally awarded the remnants of Cruella's fortune by Alonzo himself and Oddball's coat finally develops spots.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Glenn Close]] as [[Cruella de Vil]]\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Jean-Pierre LePelt\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as Kevin Shepherd\n* [[Alice Evans]] as Chloe Simon\n* [[Tim McInnerny]] as Alonzo\n* [[Eric Idle]] as Waddlesworth the [[Parrot]]\n* [[Ben Crompton]] as Ewan\n* [[Carol MacReady]] as Agnes\n* [[Ian Richardson]] as Mr. Torte QC\n* [[David Horovitch]] as Dr. Pavlov\n* [[Kerry Shale]] as Le Pelt's Assistant\n* [[Ron Cook]] as Mr. Button\n\n==Release==\n*On November 24, 1999, a teaser trailer was released with [[Disney/Pixar]]'s ''[[Toy Story 2]].''\n*On May 19, 2000, a second trailer was released with ''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]''.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Cruella de Vil Panther.jpg|thumb|A customized [[Panther De Ville]] driven by Cruella de Vil in the film]]\nThe early working title was ''101 Dalmatians Returns.''

As British [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], from 1812 he was central to the management of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|coalition]] that defeated [[Napoleon]]. He was the principal British diplomat at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Castlereagh was also [[leader of the House of Commons|leader of the British House of Commons]] in the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Liverpool]] government from 1812 until his suicide. Early in his career, as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], he was involved in putting down the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and was instrumental in securing the passage of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union of 1800]].\n\nCastlereagh's challenge at the foreign office was to organise and finance an alliance to destroy Napoleon. He successfully brought Napoleon's enemies together at the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] in 1814. Thereafter he worked with Europe's leaders at the Congress of Vienna to provide a peace consistent with the conservative mood of the day. At Vienna he was largely successful in his primary goal of creating a peace settlement that would endure for years. He saw that a harsh treaty based on vengeance and retaliation against France would fail, and anyway the conservative Bourbons were back in power. He employed his diplomatic skills to block harsh terms.  He held the Chaumont allies together, most notably in their determination to finally end Napoleon's 100 Days in 1815. He had a vision of long-term peace in Europe that united efforts of the great powers. At the same time he was watchful of Britain's mercantile and imperial interests. He purchased the Cape Colony and Ceylon from the Netherlands. France's colonies were returned, but France had to give up all its gains in Europe after 1791. In 1820 he enunciated a policy that Britain would not intervene in European affairs \u2013 a policy that was largely adopted down to 1900.\n\nAs the Irish Secretary during the Rebellion of 1798, he took the lead in suppressing the rebellion and restoring order. Castlereagh encouraged lenient treatment of the rebels after they surrendered, but many Irish denounced him as a traitor. Criticism increased when he supported Pitt's Act of Union which abolished the Irish Parliament. Castlereagh was a consistent supporter of Catholic emancipation. In 1805 he became the Secretary of State for war{{sfn|Wills|1817|p=[https://archive.org/details/livesofillustrio06willuoft/page/128/ 128]|ps=: \"In 1806, he was appointed secretary at war and for the colonies.\"}} and proved to be highly effective in reforming recruitment, and securing the appointment of Arthur Wellesley as commander in Spain. He resigned in 1809 after government splits and an unsuccessful war. He then fought a duel with George Canning, a fellow Tory; they both survived. With intense devotion to multiple duties from both the foreign office and as leader of Commons, he was badly overworked. He came under deep psychological distress in 1822, fearing exposure of homosexuality. Castlereagh committed suicide just before he was to represent Britain at an international Congress\n\nAfter 1815 Castlereagh was the leader in imposing repressive measures at home. He was hated for his harsh attacks on liberty and reform. [[John Bew (historian)|John Bew]] stresses the paradox:\n:No British statesman of the 19th century reached the same level of international influence....But very few have been so maligned by their own countrymen and so abused in history.

Between Stewart's attendance to his militia duties, his pursuit of cultural, family and political interests in London, two trips to the Continent (in 1791, when he visited revolutionary Paris, and 1792), and the courtship of his wife whom he married in 1794, his life during this period was not centred on the activities of the Irish House of Commons, where he was listened to with respect but where he was not yet an important player. He was also beginning to disappoint some of his more radical original supporters in his constituency. As the [[French Revolution#National Convention (1792\u20131795)|French Revolution]] grew more bloody and Ireland more rebellious, Stewart increasingly worried about Ireland's future if the threats from France succeeded in breaking Ireland's links to Britain. He became further inclined to support not only Pitt personally but the British Government, even when he did not approve of a specific line taken in Irish policy.<ref name=\"Leigh\"/>\n\nIn 1794, partly as a result of the promotion of Stewart's interests by his Camden connections, he was offered the Government-controlled seat of [[Tregony (UK Parliament constituency)|Tregony]] in Cornwall, where he was elected to the [[Unreformed House of Commons|British House of Commons]] on a similar platform of reform principles and support for Pitt, on whose side he sat in Westminster.

Camden's arrival in Dublin was greeted with riots, and that year Stewart crossed the floor to join the supporters of the British Government.{{efn|name=War}} Stewart became an essential adviser to the inexperienced and unpopular Lord Lieutenant, who was Stewart's senior by only ten years.\n\nIn 1796, when the [[Wolfe Tone#Hoche's expedition and the 1798 rebellion|French invasion of Ireland failed]] at [[Bantry Bay]] due to bad weather and not to Ireland's military preparations or the British Navy, Castlereagh as a leader of the Militia saw at first hand how ripe Ireland was for breaking from Britain and becoming another French satellite. Despairing of obtaining timely military support from Britain if Ireland were again threatened with invasion, for the next several years he was increasingly involved in measures against those promoting a Rising, but his initial principles of reform and emancipation continued to hold a place in his political thought.<ref name=\"Leigh\"/>\n\nIn 1797, Castlereagh was at last appointed to office, as Keeper of the King's Signet for Ireland.{{efn|name=Limavedy}}}} As martial law was declared in the face of growing turmoil, he was made both a [[Lord High Treasurer of Ireland#Commissioners of the Treasury for Ireland (1793-1817)|Lord of the Treasury]] and a Member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] (1797\u20131800).{{efn|name=Abercromby}} At the urging of Camden, Castlereagh assumed many of the onerous duties of the often-absent [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] who was responsible for day-to-day administration and asserting the influence of Dublin Castle in the House of Commons.{{efn|name=Ireland}} In this capacity, and after March 1798 as Acting Chief Secretary, Castlereagh played a key role in crushing the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], offering clemency to commoners who had supported the rebellion, and focusing instead on pursuing rebel leaders.\n\nIn 1799, in furtherance of both his own political vision and Pitt's policies, Castlereagh began lobbying in the Irish and British Parliaments for an official union between the two, convinced that it was the best way to soothe the long-standing divides in Ireland, insulate Ireland from further radical disaffection, and protect Britain from French military threats via Ireland. His first attempt, at the opening of the Irish session of 1799, met with failure during long, heated debates. A year of further intense preparation followed, with an impressive display of Machiavellian tactics that included the common practice of bribery through peerages, honours and money, but bribery on a truly uncommon scale. In the summer of 1800, Castlereagh together with the Lord Lieutenant, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Marquess Cornwallis]], finally succeeded in steering the [[Act of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union]] through both Parliaments.<ref name=\"Leigh\"/><ref name=\"Multitext\"/>\n\nDuring the campaign for the Act of Union, both Castlereagh and Cornwallis had, in good faith, forwarded informal assurances they had received from Pitt's Cabinet to the [[Irish Catholics]] that they would be allowed to sit in Parliament. Both Castlereagh and Cornwallis knew Catholic emancipation would be critical if their objectives for Union were to be realised. Emancipation was, however, opposed by much of the British establishment, including [[George III]], who was convinced that it would violate his royal oath as protector of the Protestant faith. Pitt tried to follow through on his commitment, but when it came to light that the King had approached [[Henry Addington]], an opponent of Catholic emancipation, about becoming Prime Minister to replace the pro-emancipation Pitt, both Castlereagh and Pitt resigned in protest.

At a shift in the composition of [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth#Henry Addington's Government, March 1801 \u2013 May 1804|Addington's Government]], Castlereagh accepted the offer to enter the Cabinet as [[President of the Board of Control]], where he mediated bitter disputes between the [[Governor-General of India]], [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wellesley]], and the [[East India Company directors|Directors]] of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], smoothing quarrels while generally supporting Lord Wellesley's policies.{{sfn|Bartlett|1966|p=[https://archive.org/details/castlereagh00bart/page/40 41]|ps=: \"Castlereagh found much of his time devoted to the thankless task of acting as a mediator between the influential Court in London and its formidable Governor-General in India, the irascible and autocratic Richard Wellesley.\"}}\n\nAfter the renewal of the [[Napoleonic Wars|war]] against [[Napoleon]], at the urging of Castlereagh and other long-time supporters, in 1804 Pitt returned as Prime Minister, and Castlereagh was promoted to [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]].

Canning saw it as a diversion of troops from the [[Peninsular War]] based on a hopeless plan. However, Castlereagh had the support of Lord Wellesley's younger brother [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|General Arthur Wellesley]] (future Duke of Wellington), and evidence later surfaced that Canning himself had interfered with the plan, selecting the [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham|Earl of Chatham]] to command the expedition.<ref name=\"nndb\"/> The Portland government became increasingly paralysed by disputes between the two men.

He also became leader of the House of Commons in the wake of [[Assassination of Spencer Perceval|Spencer Perceval's assassination]] in 1812.\n\n===Treaty of Chaumont===\nIn his role of Foreign Secretary he was instrumental in negotiating what has become known as the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|quadruple alliance]] between Britain, Austria, Russia, and [[Prussia]] at [[Treaty of Chaumont|Chaumont]] in March 1814, in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]]<ref name=\"nndb\"/> that brought peace with France, and at the Congress of Vienna.  The [[Treaty of Chaumont]] was part of the final deal offered to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1814. Napoleon rejected it and it never took effect. However, the key terms reaffirmed decisions that had been made already. These decisions were again ratified and put into effect by the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814\u20131815. The terms were largely written by Lord Castlereagh, who offered cash subsidies to keep the other armies in the field against Napoleon.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gregory Fremont-Barnes|author2=Todd Fisher|title=The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j45Rg2VBbRAC&pg=PA302|year=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=302\u20135|isbn=9781841768311}}</ref> Key terms included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium.

Trevelyan]] argues:\n:In 1813 and 1814 Castlereagh played the part that William III and Marlborough had played more than a hundred years before, in holding together an alliance of jealous, selfish, weak-kneed states and princes, by a vigour or character and singleness of purpose that held Metternich, the Czar, and the King of Prussia on the common track until the goal was reached. It is quite possible that, but for the lead taken by Castlereagh in the allied counsels, France would never have been reduced to her ancient limits, nor Napoleon dethroned.{{sfn|Trevelyan|1922|p=[https://archive.org/details/britishhistoryin00trevuoft/page/132 133]|ps=:as quoted.}}\n\n===Congress of Vienna===\nAt the [[Congress of Vienna]], Castlereagh designed and proposed a form of collective and collaborative security for Europe, then called a [[Congress system]]. In the Congress system, the main signatory powers met periodically (every two years or so) and collectively managed European affairs. This system was used in an attempt to address the [[Congress of Vienna#Polish-Saxon crisis|Polish-Saxon crisis]] at Vienna and the [[Congress of Laibach#Eastern Question|question of Greek independence]] at Laibach. The following ten years saw five European Congresses where disputes were resolved with a diminishing degree of effectiveness. Finally, by 1822, the whole system had collapsed because of the irreconcilable differences of opinion among Britain, Austria, and Russia, and because of the lack of support for the Congress system in British public opinion.  The [[Holy Alliance]], which Castlereagh opposed, lingered a little longer.  The [[Conservative Order|order]] created by the Congress of Vienna was a mood that lasted much longer and worked to prevent major European wars until the [[First World War]] in 1914. Some scholars and historians have seen the Congress system as a forerunner of the modern [[collective security]], international unity, and cooperative agreements of [[NATO]], the EU, the [[League of Nations]], and the United Nations.<ref name=\"Kissinger\">{{cite book |last=Kissinger  |first=Henry  |authorlink=Henry Kissinger  |title=A World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh and the Problems of Peace, 1812\u201322 }}</ref>\n\nIn the years 1812 to 1822, Castlereagh continued to manage Britain's foreign policy, generally pursuing a policy of continental engagement uncharacteristic of British foreign policy in the nineteenth century. Castlereagh was not an effective public speaker and his diplomatic presentation style was at times abstruse.<ref name=\"nndb\"/> Henry Kissinger says he developed a reputation for integrity, consistency, and goodwill, which was perhaps unmatched by any diplomat of that era.<ref name=\"Kissinger\"/>\n\n===Abolition of the slave trade===\n{{Further|Atlantic slave trade#End of the Atlantic slave trade}}\nAbolitionist opinion in Britain was strong enough in 1807 to abolish the slave trade in all British possessions\u2014although slavery itself persisted in the colonies until 1833.<ref>Seymour Drescher, \"Whose abolition? Popular pressure and the ending of the British slave trade.\" ''Past & Present'' 143 (1994): 136-166. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/651164 Online]</ref> Abolitionists after 1807 focused on international agreements to abolish the Atlantic slave trade. Castlereagh switched his position and became  a strong supporter of the movement.  Britain arranged treaties with Portugal, Sweden and Denmark, 1810\u20131814, whereby they agreed to restrict their trading. These were preliminary to the Congress of Vienna negotiations that Castlereagh dominated and which resulted in a general declaration condemning the slave trade.<ref>Jerome Reich,  \"The Slave Trade at the Congress of Vienna--A Study in English Public Opinion--.\" ''Journal of Negro History'' 53.2 (1968): 129-143. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716488 Online]</ref> The problem was that the treaties and declarations were hard to enforce, given the very high profits available to private interests. As Foreign Minister, Castlereagh cooperated with senior officials to use the Royal Navy to detect and capture slave ships; the freed slaves were sent to freedom in a new British colony of [[History of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]].  He used diplomacy to make search and seize agreements with all the government whose ships were trading.  There was serious friction with the United States, where the southern slave interest was politically powerful. Washington recoiled at British policing of the high seas.  Spain, France and Portugal also relied on the international slave trade to supply their colonial plantations. As more and more diplomatic arrangements were made by Castlereagh, the owners of slave ships started flying false flags of nations that had not agreed, especially the United States. It was illegal under American law for American ships to engage in the slave trade, but the idea of Britain enforcing American laws was unacceptable to Washington. Lord Palmerston continued the Castlereagh  policies. Eventually, in 1842 in 1845, an arrangement was reached between London and Washington. With the arrival of a staunchly anti-slavery government in Washington in 1861, the Atlantic slave trade was doomed. In the long run, Castlereagh's strategy on how to stifle the trade proved successful.<ref>James C. Duram, \"A Study of Frustration: Britain, the USA, and the African Slave Trade, 1815-1870.\" Social Science (1965): 220-225. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41885111 Online]</ref>\n\n===Nonintervention in European affairs===\nIn May 1820 Castlereagh circulated to high officials a major state paper that set the main British policy for the rest of the century. Temperley and Penson call it, \"the most famous State Paper in British history and the one of the widest ultimate consequences.\" <ref>H.W.V. Temperley, and Lillian M. Penson, eds. ''Foundations of British Foreign Policy: 1792\u20131902'' (1938) Quote page 47, the paper itself pp 48-63.</ref> Castlereagh called for no British intervention in continental affairs.  He argued that the purpose of the Quadruple Alliance was to contain France and put down revolutions. But the Spanish revolt did not threaten European peace nor any of the great powers. Castlereagh said that an actual practice the powers would seldom be able to agree on concerted action, and he pointed out that British public opinion would not support interventions. He admitted that individual states could indeed intervene in affairs in their recognized sphere of interest, such as Austria's intervention in Italy.\n\n==Decline and death==\n[[File:Castlereagh's House.jpg|thumb|right|Castlereagh's house, [[Loring Hall|Woollet Hall]] (now called Loring Hall), in [[North Cray]] in [[Bexley]], south London]]\n[[File:Blue Plaque for the Viscount Castlereagh.jpg|thumb|right|Blue plaque along the North Cray Road]]\n\nDespite his contributions to the defeat of Napoleon and restoration of peace, Castlereagh became extremely unpopular at home. He was attacked for his construction of a peace that gave a free hand to reactionary governments on the Continent to suppress dissent. He was also condemned for his association with repressive measures of the [[Home Secretary]], [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Lord Sidmouth]] (the former Prime Minister Addington).<ref name=\"nndb\"/> As [[Leader of the House of Commons]] for the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool#Lord Liverpool's Administration (1812\u20131827)|Liverpool Government]], he was often called upon to [[Cabinet collective responsibility|defend government policy]] in the House. He had to support the widely reviled measures taken by Sidmouth and the others, including the infamous [[Six Acts]], to remain in cabinet and continue his diplomatic work. For these reasons, Castlereagh appears with other members of Lord Liverpool's Cabinet in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s poem ''[[The Masque of Anarchy]]'', which was inspired by, and heavily critical of, the [[Peterloo Massacre]]:\n\n: I met Murder on the way \u2013\n: He had a mask like Castlereagh \u2013\n: Very smooth he looked, yet grim;\n: Seven bloodhounds followed him\n\n: All were fat; and well they might\n: Be in admirable plight,\n: For one by one, and two by two,\n: He tossed them human hearts to chew\n: Which from his wide cloak he drew.<ref>{{cite book|author=David C.

The defect of the settlement, destined to imperil Britain once more when the wheel had come full circle, was its entire neglect of the craving of the European people for nationality and for freedom.\"}} His diplomacy was applauded by historians. For example, in 1919 diplomatic historians recommended his wise policies of 1814\u20131815 to the British delegation to the Paris peace conferences that ended the First World War.  Historian [[Charles Webster (historian)|Charles Webster]] underscores the paradox:\n{{quote|There probably never was a statesman whose ideas were so right and whose attitude to public opinion was so wrong.

Much of the Stewart family wealth was based on the estates which came into the family through the Cowan inheritance, which put the family squarely in the [[landed gentry]] class of [[Ulster#History and politics|Ulster Presbyterians]] whose ancestors first arrived in Ireland during the [[Plantation of Ulster]].

The estates included the demesne land of Mount Pleasant, later [[Mount Stewart]], which became the family seat of the Londonderrys (see Leigh, ''Castlereagh'', p. 15).}}\n: {{efn|name=Election|The Down election of 1790 was fought against the elder Stewart's rival for influence in Ulster, [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire]], who controlled both Down seats. The elder Stewart, who had been raised to the Irish peerage the previous year and was thereby ineligible, persuaded his son to stand for the seat. His son was backed, as he had been, by Whigs and [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]. The election expenses to the Stewarts reached the extraordinary sum of \u00a360,000, financed by a mortgage of Mount Stewart, which Castlereagh's father spent much of the next decades paying off. (See Leigh, ''Castlereagh''.)}}\n: {{efn|name=Child|In a profile of Castlereagh published within months of his death, he was reported to have had, prior to his marriage, a son by a maidservant who lived near the Mount Stewart estate, and whom it was rumored he supported. (Dr. Felton Reede, ''Private Life of the Marquess of Londonderry'', (1822), cited in Leigh, ''Castlereagh'', pp 34 and 144.)}}\n: {{efn|name=Limavedy|Castlereagh had been re-elected without opposition from Down in 1797 and continued to hold this seat while in office in Ireland. He could not continue to hold both Irish office and the seat in Westminster for Orford, which he therefore resigned. (See Leigh, ''Castlereagh'', Ch 4.) In the Irish election of 1798, he stood for [[Newtown Limavady (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Newtown Limavady]] as well as for Down. He was successful for both constituencies and chose to sit for the latter. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}}}\n: {{efn|name=War|The war with France absorbed much of the attention of Government and Parliament, and what attention was paid to an increasingly radicalised Ireland was confused and inconsistent. Pitt's dismissal of the popular [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]] in 1795, over Fitzwilliam's aggressive support of Whig patronage and Catholic emancipation, produced outrage and rioting in Dublin. Castlereagh had watched the unravelling of Irish policy with deep concern and knew what sort of reaction to expect to Fitzwilliam's dismissal. But he was in no position to steer Irish policy nor could he object to the inevitable departure of Fitzwilliam, especially as the person appointed to replace Fitzwilliam was the brother of Stewart's step-mother, [[John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden|John Jeffreys Pratt]], who had recently succeed as 2nd Earl Camden. (See Leigh, ''Castlereagh'', Ch. 3.)}}\n: {{efn|name=Abercromby|In Council, though he was active in pursuing plots against the Government, he countered the influence of the more extreme members of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] who, against especially the policies of the new Commander-in-Chief for Ireland, [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]], called for indiscriminate violence to suppress all threat of rebellion. (See Leigh, ''Castlereagh'', Ch 4).}}\n: {{efn|name=Ireland|The Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1795\u201398 was [[Thomas Pelham, 2nd Earl of Chichester|Thomas Pelham]], but he was continually absent from his duties due to illness. Camden pressed London to replace Pelham, recommending in his stead Castlereagh, whose performance in office was admired by those in London concerned with Irish policy. But as an example of the perverse prejudices of the era, Castlereagh, who might have been especially competent in this delicate and demanding office because he was an Irishman, was also ineligible to represent the Crown in Ireland because he was an Irishman, even though this Irishman was grandson of an English Marquess, great-grandson of an English Duke and son-in-law of an English Earl. After pressure by Pitt on [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] who shared the prejudice against appointments of Irish as representatives of the Crown in Ireland, Castlereagh was appointed Acting Chief Secretary in March 1798. But it was only in November 1798, after the Rebellion had been put down that, in response to imperious demands from the next influential Lord Lieutenant, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Marquess Cornwallis]], Castlereagh was given the permanent office, and for the first time the Chief Secretary for Ireland was an Irishman. The next month, Castlereagh was admitted to the King's Privy Council.

Prior to the Right to Burial Act of 1823, a suicide was denied a Christian burial and, until the Abolition of Forfeiture Act of 1870, his property was forfeited to the Crown. These cruel penalties were less and less frequently applied over the course of the 18th century, especially in the case of wealthier perpetrators. Inquests were likely to view suicide as itself evidence of the disturbed state of the perpetrator's mind. (See e.g., [[Clifton D.

derived from the [[courtesy title]] '''Viscount Castlereagh'''{{efn|name=Castlereagh}} ({{IPAc-en|UK|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|s|\u0259l|r|e\u026a}} {{respell|KAH|s\u0259l|ray}}) by which he was styled from 1796 to 1821, was an [[Anglo-Irish]] statesman. As British [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], from 1812 he was central to the management of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|coalition]] that defeated [[Napoleon]]. He was the principal British diplomat at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Castlereagh was also [[leader of the House of Commons|leader of the British House of Commons]] in the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Liverpool]] government from 1812 until his suicide. Early in his career, as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], he was involved in putting down the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and was instrumental in securing the passage of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union of 1800]].\n\nCastlereagh's challenge at the foreign office was to organise and finance an alliance to destroy Napoleon. He successfully brought Napoleon's enemies together at the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] in 1814. Thereafter he worked with Europe's leaders at the Congress of Vienna to provide a peace consistent with the conservative mood of the day. At Vienna he was largely successful in his primary goal of creating a peace settlement that would endure for years. He saw that a harsh treaty based on vengeance and retaliation against France would fail, and anyway the conservative Bourbons were back in power. He employed his diplomatic skills to block harsh terms.  He held the Chaumont allies together, most notably in their determination to finally end Napoleon's 100 Days in 1815. He had a vision of long-term peace in Europe that united efforts of the great powers. At the same time he was watchful of Britain's mercantile and imperial interests. He purchased the Cape Colony and Ceylon from the Netherlands. France's colonies were returned, but France had to give up all its gains in Europe after 1791. In 1820 he enunciated a policy that Britain would not intervene in European affairs \u2013 a policy that was largely adopted down to 1900.\n\nAs the Irish Secretary during the Rebellion of 1798, he took the lead in suppressing the rebellion and restoring order. Castlereagh encouraged lenient treatment of the rebels after they surrendered, but many Irish denounced him as a traitor. Criticism increased when he supported Pitt's Act of Union which abolished the Irish Parliament. Castlereagh was a consistent supporter of Catholic emancipation. In 1805 he became the Secretary of State for war{{sfn|Wills|1817|p=[https://archive.org/details/livesofillustrio06willuoft/page/128/ 128]|ps=: \"In 1806, he was appointed secretary at war and for the colonies.\"}} and proved to be highly effective in reforming recruitment, and securing the appointment of Arthur Wellesley as commander in Spain. He resigned in 1809 after government splits and an unsuccessful war. He then fought a duel with George Canning, a fellow Tory; they both survived. With intense devotion to multiple duties from both the foreign office and as leader of Commons, he was badly overworked. He came under deep psychological distress in 1822, fearing exposure of homosexuality. Castlereagh committed suicide just before he was to represent Britain at an international Congress\n\nAfter 1815 Castlereagh was the leader in imposing repressive measures at home. He was hated for his harsh attacks on liberty and reform. [[John Bew (historian)|John Bew]] stresses the paradox:\n:No British statesman of the 19th century reached the same level of international influence....But very few have been so maligned by their own countrymen and so abused in history.

As the [[French Revolution#National Convention (1792\u20131795)|French Revolution]] grew more bloody and Ireland more rebellious, Stewart increasingly worried about Ireland's future if the threats from France succeeded in breaking Ireland's links to Britain. He became further inclined to support not only Pitt personally but the British Government, even when he did not approve of a specific line taken in Irish policy.<ref name=\"Leigh\"/>\n\nIn 1794, partly as a result of the promotion of Stewart's interests by his Camden connections, he was offered the Government-controlled seat of [[Tregony (UK Parliament constituency)|Tregony]] in Cornwall, where he was elected to the [[Unreformed House of Commons|British House of Commons]] on a similar platform of reform principles and support for Pitt, on whose side he sat in Westminster. In 1796, he transferred to a seat for the [[Suffolk]] constituency of [[Orford (UK Parliament constituency)|Orford]], which was in the interest of his mother's family, the Seymour-Conways ([[Marquess of Hertford]]).<ref name=\"Leigh\"/>\n\n<div style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em\">\n{{chart top|width=auto|collapsed=no|Family tree}}\n{{chart/start|style=clear: both; font-size: 80%; width: 40em;}}\n{{chart|Txt|Txt=Robert Stewart (Castlereagh) with wife, parents, and other selected relatives.

Camden's arrival in Dublin was greeted with riots, and that year Stewart crossed the floor to join the supporters of the British Government.{{efn|name=War}} Stewart became an essential adviser to the inexperienced and unpopular Lord Lieutenant, who was Stewart's senior by only ten years.\n\nIn 1796, when the [[Wolfe Tone#Hoche's expedition and the 1798 rebellion|French invasion of Ireland failed]] at [[Bantry Bay]] due to bad weather and not to Ireland's military preparations or the British Navy, Castlereagh as a leader of the Militia saw at first hand how ripe Ireland was for breaking from Britain and becoming another French satellite. Despairing of obtaining timely military support from Britain if Ireland were again threatened with invasion, for the next several years he was increasingly involved in measures against those promoting a Rising, but his initial principles of reform and emancipation continued to hold a place in his political thought.<ref name=\"Leigh\"/>\n\nIn 1797, Castlereagh was at last appointed to office, as Keeper of the King's Signet for Ireland.{{efn|name=Limavedy}}}} As martial law was declared in the face of growing turmoil, he was made both a [[Lord High Treasurer of Ireland#Commissioners of the Treasury for Ireland (1793-1817)|Lord of the Treasury]] and a Member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] (1797\u20131800).{{efn|name=Abercromby}} At the urging of Camden, Castlereagh assumed many of the onerous duties of the often-absent [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] who was responsible for day-to-day administration and asserting the influence of Dublin Castle in the House of Commons.{{efn|name=Ireland}} In this capacity, and after March 1798 as Acting Chief Secretary, Castlereagh played a key role in crushing the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], offering clemency to commoners who had supported the rebellion, and focusing instead on pursuing rebel leaders.\n\nIn 1799, in furtherance of both his own political vision and Pitt's policies, Castlereagh began lobbying in the Irish and British Parliaments for an official union between the two, convinced that it was the best way to soothe the long-standing divides in Ireland, insulate Ireland from further radical disaffection, and protect Britain from French military threats via Ireland. His first attempt, at the opening of the Irish session of 1799, met with failure during long, heated debates. A year of further intense preparation followed, with an impressive display of Machiavellian tactics that included the common practice of bribery through peerages, honours and money, but bribery on a truly uncommon scale. In the summer of 1800, Castlereagh together with the Lord Lieutenant, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Marquess Cornwallis]], finally succeeded in steering the [[Act of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union]] through both Parliaments.<ref name=\"Leigh\"/><ref name=\"Multitext\"/>\n\nDuring the campaign for the Act of Union, both Castlereagh and Cornwallis had, in good faith, forwarded informal assurances they had received from Pitt's Cabinet to the [[Irish Catholics]] that they would be allowed to sit in Parliament. Both Castlereagh and Cornwallis knew Catholic emancipation would be critical if their objectives for Union were to be realised. Emancipation was, however, opposed by much of the British establishment, including [[George III]], who was convinced that it would violate his royal oath as protector of the Protestant faith. Pitt tried to follow through on his commitment, but when it came to light that the King had approached [[Henry Addington]], an opponent of Catholic emancipation, about becoming Prime Minister to replace the pro-emancipation Pitt, both Castlereagh and Pitt resigned in protest.

By 1802, tensions between Tories supporting emancipation and those opposing had relaxed, and Addington had obtained his desired cessation of hostilities with France (the [[Treaty of Amiens|Peace of Amiens]]). At a shift in the composition of [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth#Henry Addington's Government, March 1801 \u2013 May 1804|Addington's Government]], Castlereagh accepted the offer to enter the Cabinet as [[President of the Board of Control]], where he mediated bitter disputes between the [[Governor-General of India]], [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wellesley]], and the [[East India Company directors|Directors]] of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], smoothing quarrels while generally supporting Lord Wellesley's policies.{{sfn|Bartlett|1966|p=[https://archive.org/details/castlereagh00bart/page/40 41]|ps=: \"Castlereagh found much of his time devoted to the thankless task of acting as a mediator between the influential Court in London and its formidable Governor-General in India, the irascible and autocratic Richard Wellesley.\"}}\n\nAfter the renewal of the [[Napoleonic Wars|war]] against [[Napoleon]], at the urging of Castlereagh and other long-time supporters, in 1804 Pitt returned as Prime Minister, and Castlereagh was promoted to [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]].

Canning saw it as a diversion of troops from the [[Peninsular War]] based on a hopeless plan. However, Castlereagh had the support of Lord Wellesley's younger brother [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|General Arthur Wellesley]] (future Duke of Wellington), and evidence later surfaced that Canning himself had interfered with the plan, selecting the [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham|Earl of Chatham]] to command the expedition.<ref name=\"nndb\"/> The Portland government became increasingly paralysed by disputes between the two men. Portland was in deteriorating health and gave no lead, until Canning threatened resignation unless Castlereagh was removed and replaced by Lord Wellesley. Wellesley himself was neither complicit with nor even aware of the arrangement, but Portland secretly agreed to make this change when it became possible.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nCastlereagh discovered the deal in September 1809 and demanded redress. He challenged Canning to a duel, which Canning accepted. Canning had never before fired a pistol. The duel was fought on 21 September 1809 on [[Putney#Putney Heath|Putney Heath]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pistols at dawn|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/575291/pistols-at-dawn.thtml|author=The Spectator|accessdate=3 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205005753/http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/575291/pistols-at-dawn.thtml|archivedate=5 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Canning missed but Castlereagh wounded his opponent in the thigh. There was much outrage that two cabinet ministers had resorted to such a method, and they both felt compelled to resign from the government. Six months later, Canning published a full account of his actions in the affair, and many who had initially rallied to him  became convinced Castlereagh had been betrayed by his cabinet colleague.<ref name=\"Hunt\">Hunt, Giles, (2008), ''The Duel: Castlereagh, Canning and Deadly Cabinet Rivalry'', London: B Tauris {{ISBN|978-1-84511-593-7}}</ref>\n\n==Diplomatic career==\n[[File:Viscount Castlereagh by Francis Leggatt Chantrey 1821.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marble]] [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Castlereagh by [[Joseph Nollekens]], 1821.

He also became leader of the House of Commons in the wake of [[Assassination of Spencer Perceval|Spencer Perceval's assassination]] in 1812.\n\n===Treaty of Chaumont===\nIn his role of Foreign Secretary he was instrumental in negotiating what has become known as the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|quadruple alliance]] between Britain, Austria, Russia, and [[Prussia]] at [[Treaty of Chaumont|Chaumont]] in March 1814, in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]]<ref name=\"nndb\"/> that brought peace with France, and at the Congress of Vienna.  The [[Treaty of Chaumont]] was part of the final deal offered to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1814. Napoleon rejected it and it never took effect. However, the key terms reaffirmed decisions that had been made already. These decisions were again ratified and put into effect by the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814\u20131815. The terms were largely written by Lord Castlereagh, who offered cash subsidies to keep the other armies in the field against Napoleon.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gregory Fremont-Barnes|author2=Todd Fisher|title=The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j45Rg2VBbRAC&pg=PA302|year=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=302\u20135|isbn=9781841768311}}</ref> Key terms included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium.

Artz, ''Reaction & Revolution: 1814\u20131832'' (1934), p. 110</ref>\n\nHistorian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] argues:\n:In 1813 and 1814 Castlereagh played the part that William III and Marlborough had played more than a hundred years before, in holding together an alliance of jealous, selfish, weak-kneed states and princes, by a vigour or character and singleness of purpose that held Metternich, the Czar, and the King of Prussia on the common track until the goal was reached. It is quite possible that, but for the lead taken by Castlereagh in the allied counsels, France would never have been reduced to her ancient limits, nor Napoleon dethroned.{{sfn|Trevelyan|1922|p=[https://archive.org/details/britishhistoryin00trevuoft/page/132 133]|ps=:as quoted.}}\n\n===Congress of Vienna===\nAt the [[Congress of Vienna]], Castlereagh designed and proposed a form of collective and collaborative security for Europe, then called a [[Congress system]]. In the Congress system, the main signatory powers met periodically (every two years or so) and collectively managed European affairs. This system was used in an attempt to address the [[Congress of Vienna#Polish-Saxon crisis|Polish-Saxon crisis]] at Vienna and the [[Congress of Laibach#Eastern Question|question of Greek independence]] at Laibach. The following ten years saw five European Congresses where disputes were resolved with a diminishing degree of effectiveness. Finally, by 1822, the whole system had collapsed because of the irreconcilable differences of opinion among Britain, Austria, and Russia, and because of the lack of support for the Congress system in British public opinion.  The [[Holy Alliance]], which Castlereagh opposed, lingered a little longer.  The [[Conservative Order|order]] created by the Congress of Vienna was a mood that lasted much longer and worked to prevent major European wars until the [[First World War]] in 1914. Some scholars and historians have seen the Congress system as a forerunner of the modern [[collective security]], international unity, and cooperative agreements of [[NATO]], the EU, the [[League of Nations]], and the United Nations.<ref name=\"Kissinger\">{{cite book |last=Kissinger  |first=Henry  |authorlink=Henry Kissinger  |title=A World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh and the Problems of Peace, 1812\u201322 }}</ref>\n\nIn the years 1812 to 1822, Castlereagh continued to manage Britain's foreign policy, generally pursuing a policy of continental engagement uncharacteristic of British foreign policy in the nineteenth century. Castlereagh was not an effective public speaker and his diplomatic presentation style was at times abstruse.<ref name=\"nndb\"/> Henry Kissinger says he developed a reputation for integrity, consistency, and goodwill, which was perhaps unmatched by any diplomat of that era.<ref name=\"Kissinger\"/>\n\n===Abolition of the slave trade===\n{{Further|Atlantic slave trade#End of the Atlantic slave trade}}\nAbolitionist opinion in Britain was strong enough in 1807 to abolish the slave trade in all British possessions\u2014although slavery itself persisted in the colonies until 1833.<ref>Seymour Drescher, \"Whose abolition? Popular pressure and the ending of the British slave trade.\" ''Past & Present'' 143 (1994): 136-166. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/651164 Online]</ref> Abolitionists after 1807 focused on international agreements to abolish the Atlantic slave trade. Castlereagh switched his position and became  a strong supporter of the movement.  Britain arranged treaties with Portugal, Sweden and Denmark, 1810-1814, whereby they agreed to restrict their trading. These were preliminary to the Congress of Vienna negotiations that Castlereagh dominated and which resulted in a general declaration condemning the slave trade.<ref>Jerome Reich,  \"The Slave Trade at the Congress of Vienna--A Study in English Public Opinion--.\" ''Journal of Negro History'' 53.2 (1968): 129-143. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716488 Online]</ref> The problem was that the treaties and declarations were hard to enforce, given the very high profits available to private interests. As Foreign Minister, Castlereagh cooperated with senior officials to use the Royal Navy to detect and capture slave ships; the freed slaves were sent to freedom in a new British colony of [[History of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]].  He used diplomacy to make search and seize agreements with all the government whose ships were trading.  There was serious friction with the United States, where the southern slave interest was politically powerful. Washington recoiled at British policing of the high seas.  Spain, France and Portugal also relied on the international slave trade to supply their colonial plantations. As more and more diplomatic arrangements were made by Castlereagh, the owners of slave ships started flying false flags of nations that had not agreed, especially the United States. It was illegal under American law for American ships to engage in the slave trade, but the idea of Britain enforcing American laws was unacceptable to Washington. Lord Palmerston continued the Castlereagh  policies. Eventually, in 1842 in 1845, an arrangement was reached between London and Washington. With the arrival of a staunchly anti-slavery government in Washington in 1861, the Atlantic slave trade was doomed. In the long run, Castlereagh's strategy on how to stifle the trade proved successful.<ref>James C. Duram, \"A Study of Frustration: Britain, the USA, and the African Slave Trade, 1815-1870.\" Social Science (1965): 220-225. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41885111 Online]</ref>\n\n===Nonintervention in European affairs===\nIn May 1820 Castlereagh circulated to high officials a major state paper that set the main British policy for the rest of the century. Temperley and Penson call it, \"the most famous State Paper in British history and the one of the widest ultimate consequences.\" <ref>H.W.V. Temperley, and Lillian M. Penson, eds. ''Foundations of British Foreign Policy: 1792\u20131902'' (1938) Quote page 47, the paper itself pp 48-63.</ref> Castlereagh called for no British intervention in continental affairs.  He argued that the purpose of the Quadruple Alliance was to contain France and put down revolutions. But the Spanish revolt did not threaten European peace nor any of the great powers. Castlereagh said that an actual practice the powers would seldom be able to agree on concerted action, and he pointed out that British public opinion would not support interventions.

He was attacked for his construction of a peace that gave a free hand to reactionary governments on the Continent to suppress dissent.

He had to support the widely reviled measures taken by Sidmouth and the others, including the infamous [[Six Acts]], to remain in cabinet and continue his diplomatic work.

Castlereagh had watched the unravelling of Irish policy with deep concern and knew what sort of reaction to expect to Fitzwilliam's dismissal.

But as an example of the perverse prejudices of the era, Castlereagh, who might have been especially competent in this delicate and demanding office because he was an Irishman, was also ineligible to represent the Crown in Ireland because he was an Irishman, even though this Irishman was grandson of an English Marquess, great-grandson of an English Duke and son-in-law of an English Earl. After pressure by Pitt on [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] who shared the prejudice against appointments of Irish as representatives of the Crown in Ireland, Castlereagh was appointed Acting Chief Secretary in March 1798.

Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained\u2014there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: \"I am the Lord, thy God,\" corresponds to the sixth: \"Thou shalt not kill,\" for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: \"Thou shalt have no strange gods before me,\" corresponds to the seventh: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain,\" corresponds to the eighth: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" corresponds to the ninth: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,\" for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath). The fifth commandment: \"Honor thy father and thy mother,\" corresponds to the tenth: \"Covet not thy neighbor's wife,\" for one who indulges this lust produces children who will not honor their true father, but will consider a stranger their father.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The Unity of Ten Commandments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807032722/https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS |date=7 August 2018 }}, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide laws]], several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments.

However, the Gospel of Barnabas does not form part of the Christian bible.  It is known only from 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts, and frequently reflects Islamic rather than Christian understandings<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne}}</ref>, so it cannot be taken as authoritative on Christian views.\n\nIn Christianity's earliest centuries, some Christians had informally adorned their homes and places of worship with images of Christ and the saints, which others thought inappropriate. No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons,{{fact|date=February 2020}} and again in the Middle Ages, becoming a critical point of contention in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.{{fact|date=February 2020}} This mostly settled the matter until the Reformation, when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council \"emanated from Satan\".{{fact|date=February 2020}} Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible. To emphasize the theological importance of the incarnation, the Orthodox Church encourages the use of icons in church and private devotions, but prefers a two-dimensional depiction<ref name=Hore>Alexander Hugh Hore, [https://archive.org/details/eighteencenturi00horegoog/page/n265 <!-- pg=353 quote=\"flat pictures\". --> ''Eighteen Centuries of the Orthodox Church''], J.

Levinson]] argued that this reconstruction assumes a Christian perspective, and dates back to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s polemic against Judaism, which asserted that religions evolve from the more [[ritual]]istic to the more [[ethic]]al. Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mt. Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the \"ethical\" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the [[messiah]]. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.<ref>Levinson, Bernard M.

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],<ref>PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Congress]]<ref>American Jewish Congress, \"AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments,\" (May 16, 2003) http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904031027/http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 |date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.\n\nThose who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].<ref name=\"moses.creighton.edu\" />\n\n[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]] (detail)]]\nU.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.\n\nOne result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.\n\n==Cultural references==\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by [[Cecil B.

Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained\u2014there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: \"I am the Lord, thy God,\" corresponds to the sixth: \"Thou shalt not kill,\" for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: \"Thou shalt have no strange gods before me,\" corresponds to the seventh: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain,\" corresponds to the eighth: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" corresponds to the ninth: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,\" for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath).

Islam has a stronger prohibition, banning representations of God, and in some cases of Muhammad, humans and, in some interpretations, any living creature.\n\nIn the non-canonical [[Gospel of Barnabas]], it is claimed that Jesus stated that idolatry is the greatest sin as it divests a man fully of faith, and hence of God.<ref>[http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/424-chapter-32-statues-of-flesh Chapter 32: Statues of Flesh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115071747/http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/424-chapter-32-statues-of-flesh |date=15 January 2018 }} ''Barnabas.net''</ref> The words attributed to Jesus prohibit not only worshipping statues of wood or stone; but also statues of flesh. ''\"...all which a man loves, for which he leaves everything else but that, is his god, thus the glutton and drunkard has for his idol his own flesh, the fornicator has for his idol the harlot and the greedy has for his idol silver and gold, and so the same for every other sinner.\"''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110826202022/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/arts/barnabas/Barncoloured.html Gospel of Barnabas chapter XXXIII] ''Latrobe Edu''</ref>  Idolatory was thus the basic sin, which manifested in various acts or thoughts, which displace the primacy of God.  However, the Gospel of Barnabas does not form part of the Christian bible.  It is known only from 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts, and frequently reflects Islamic rather than Christian understandings<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne}}</ref>, so it cannot be taken as authoritative on Christian views.\n\nIn Christianity's earliest centuries, some Christians had informally adorned their homes and places of worship with images of Christ and the saints, which others thought inappropriate. No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons,{{fact|date=February 2020}} and again in the Middle Ages, becoming a critical point of contention in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.{{fact|date=February 2020}} This mostly settled the matter until the Reformation, when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council \"emanated from Satan\".{{fact|date=February 2020}} Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible. To emphasize the theological importance of the incarnation, the Orthodox Church encourages the use of icons in church and private devotions, but prefers a two-dimensional depiction<ref name=Hore>Alexander Hugh Hore, [https://archive.org/details/eighteencenturi00horegoog/page/n265 <!-- pg=353 quote=\"flat pictures\". --> ''Eighteen Centuries of the Orthodox Church''], J.

Levinson]] argued that this reconstruction assumes a Christian perspective, and dates back to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s polemic against Judaism, which asserted that religions evolve from the more [[ritual]]istic to the more [[ethic]]al. Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mt. Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the \"ethical\" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the [[messiah]]. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.<ref>Levinson, Bernard M. (July 2002). \"Goethe's Analysis of Exodus 34 and Its Influence on Julius Wellhausen: the Pfropfung of the Documentary Hypothesis\". ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft'' 114 (2): 212\u2013223</ref>\n\nBy the 1930s, historians who accepted the basic premises of multiple authorship had come to reject the idea of an orderly evolution of Israelite religion. Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times. This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20:2\u201317 and Exodus 34:10\u201328 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that \"had already been normalized in the period of the Judges\" (i.e., of the tribal alliance).<ref>John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition.

It is likely to be an independent document, which was inserted here by the Redactor.\"<ref>Friedman, p. 153</ref> In his view, the [[Covenant Code]] follows that version of the Ten Commandments in the northern Israel E narrative. In the J narrative in Exodus 34 the editor of the combined story known as the Redactor (or RJE), adds in an explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets which were shattered. \"In the combined JE text, it would be awkward to picture God just commanding Moses to make some tablets, as if there were no history to this matter, so RJE adds the explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets that were shattered.\"<ref>Friedman, p. 177</ref>\n\nHe writes that Exodus 34:14\u201326 is the J text of the Ten Commandments: \"The first two commandments and the sabbath commandment have parallels in the other versions of the Ten Commandments.

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],<ref>PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Congress]]<ref>American Jewish Congress, \"AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments,\" (May 16, 2003) http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904031027/http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 |date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.\n\nThose who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].<ref name=\"moses.creighton.edu\" />\n\n[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]] (detail)]]\nU.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.\n\nOne result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.\n\n==Cultural references==\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]]: a [[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|silent movie which was released in 1923]] and starred [[Theodore Roberts]] as Moses and a colour [[VistaVision]] [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|version which was released in 1956]], and starred [[Charlton Heston]] as Moses.\n\nBoth ''[[Dekalog]]'', a 1989 Polish film series directed by [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]], and ''[[The Ten]]'', a 2007 American film, use the ten commandments as a structure for 10 smaller stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|title=The Ten|accessdate=8 April 2020|via=www.imdb.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307211234/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|archive-date=7 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe receipt of the Ten Commandments by Moses was satirized in [[Mel Brooks]]'s movie ''[[History of the World Part I]]'' (1981), which shows Moses (played by Brooks, in a similar costume to [[Charlton Heston]]'s Moses in the [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|1956 film]]), receiving three tablets containing fifteen commandments, but before he can present them to his people, he stumbles and drops one of the tablets, shattering it.
