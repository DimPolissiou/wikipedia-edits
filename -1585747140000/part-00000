They used their lands for hunting, fishing, and trapping. The Anishinabe knew no borders at the time and their land ranged both north and south of the US\u2013Canada border, and both east and west of the [[Red River (Canada)|Red River]]. On 3 August 1871 the Anishinabe people signed [[Treaty 1]] and moved onto reserves such as the [[Brokenhead Ojibway Nation|Brokenhead Indian Reserve]] and [[Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation]] Reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|title=History and Heritage of Roseau River First Nation|accessdate=1 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205813/http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|archivedate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the government began surveying and staking out the land for the [[East Reserve]] (now the [[Hanover, Manitoba|R.M. of Hanover]]).\n\n===Early history===\nSteinbach (meaning \"Stone Brook\" in [[German language|German]]) was founded in 1874 by [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]]-speaking [[Russian Mennonites]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title=City of Steinbach |access-date=25 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date=9 May 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Many of Steinbach's 18 original settler families came directly from the Borosenko colony in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], now [[Ukraine]].<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\">{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Between Earth and Sky: Steinbach, The First 50 Years |publisher = Derksen Printers |date =September 2009}}</ref>\nThey took the name \"Steinbach\" from the village they lived in there. At the time they left for Canada, Borosenko was just ten years old, an off-shoot of the larger [[Molotschna]] (or Milk River) colony. However, Russia was not their ancestral homeland. Originating in [[Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking [[Flanders]] region of [[Belgium]] during the 16th century, the ancestors of Steinbach's Mennonite settlers also lived in [[Prussia]] for two centuries before their time in Ukraine.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\">{{cite web |url= http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title= Steinbach History 1874 - 1990 |date= 1 May 1990 |accessdate= 14 May 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date= 9 May 2008 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Within the settlement of Molotschna were a group of people following the [[Kleine Gemeinde]], known for practise of the New Testament teachings of non-resistance, community of sharing and the publication of the first inspirational books. This group was a small minority in Molotschna but its farmers were known as the best in the community.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1873, Mennonites from Russia became dissatisfied with increasing [[Russification]] and the removal of their military exemption, and sent delegates to Canada to investigate and negotiate terms of immigration. Many of the delegates decided to move their people to [[Kansas]], however, the more conservative groups, such as the Kleine Gemeinde, were persuaded to settle in Canada because the Canadian government was more generous in their guarantees of religious freedom. In 1873 a [[Privilegium of 1873 (Canada)|Privilegium]] was signed, and a year later Mennonites started to arrive in the region. The document guaranteed, among other things, military exemption, freedom of religion, private schools, and land, known as the [[East Reserve]].<ref name=\"Francis, E.K. 1955\">{{cite book |author = Francis, E.K. |title = In Search of Utopia |publisher = D.W. Friesens and Sons |date =1955}}</ref>\n\nTwo Mennonite groups settled in the East Reserve, the [[Bergthal Colony|Bergthalers]] and [[Kleine Gemeinde]]. Most of Steinbach's settlers were from Kleine Gemeinde families, who arrived late in the summer of 1874. When they arrived, they found that much of the better land in the reserve had already been settled a few months earlier by the Bergthaler and earlier Kleine Gemeinde families. The earlier settlers had come to realize the area suffered from excessive moisture and settled upon much of the higher lands and gravel ridges. So Steinbach's earliest Mennonite settlers settled in the northeast corner of the East Reserve. The 20 homesteads were laid out on the northeast side of present-day Main Street along the Steinbach Creek.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n[[File:Wind mill in Mennonite Heritage Village Steinbach Manitoba Canada 1 (5).JPG|thumb|upright|Windmill at [[Mennonite Heritage Village]] in Steinbach]]\n\nContrary to the preferences of the Canadian government, the early settlers of Steinbach, like other Mennonite villages, organized the village into a Strassendorf, or street village, with each family occupying a long narrow strip known as a ''Wirtschaft''.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Most of the settlers were farmers, but in a somewhat urban setting, who lived, to some degree, communally, and shared a common pasture at the end of the village. They started a school in the first year, and in the following year of 1875 built a school and teacherage.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Steinbach's Main Street was hacked out of thick [[Populus \u00d7 canadensis|poplar]] bush along the creek, where a [[bison]] trail ran, a trail that was still used by Indigenous people during Steinbach's early years.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|title=Dad, God, and Me|author=Ralph Friesen|publisher=FriesenPress|date=2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1875, Steinbach's spiritual leader Jakob Barkman, who had led the Kleine Gemeinde to Canada, drowned in the Red River, along with Jakob K. Friesen on a trip to Winnipeg for supplies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jakob M. Barkman|publisher=GAMEO|url=https://www.gameo.org/index.php?title=Barkman,_Jakob_M._(1824-1875)|accessdate=February 17, 2002}}</ref> The absence of religious leadership in Steinbach created a vacuum that made the villagers receptive to [[John Holdeman]] when he visited in 1881. After Holdeman's visit many locals from the Kleine Gemeinde joined his new church, [[Church of God in Christ, Mennonite]]. This was the first of many [[schisms]] and revivals in Steinbach and eventually the town would be known for having dozens of churches, many of them different variations of Mennonite, a dynamic that has shaped the city's character.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/>\n\nIn 1877, [[Lord Dufferin]] toured Manitoba's new Mennonite settlements and stopped just west of Steinbach where he could see \"half a dozen villages\" in the distance. A crowd of 1000 people greeted his arrival.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> That same year, the first and original windmill in the town was built by Abraham S. Friesen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siamandas.com/time_machine/PAGES/more%20stories/STEINBACH.htm|title= History of Steinbach |publisher= |year= |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> After a period of eight years, in 1882, Mayor Gerhard Giesbrecht said that the village had grown to 28 families with a population of 128.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nVarious epidemics swept the area in the late 1800s, including [[scarlet fever]], [[whooping cough]], and [[diphtheria]]. In the spring of 1884 alone, more than seventy people died, mostly children. Another whopping cough epidemic took place in 1900.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBy 1900 the settlers had drained the swamps and cleared the land making it more suitable for the farming of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. In the 1901 census, Steinbach had a population of 366, and almost the entire population still spoke Plautdietsch, with only a few reporting a knowledge of English.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===End of the Strassendorf===\nIn 1910, the [[linear settlement]] village design, or Strassendorf, for the community ended.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Prior to this time, the settlers of Steinbach lived in long narrow strips, called wirtschafts, along the Steinbach Creek. Following the lead of the neighbouring Mennonite village of [[Blumenort, Manitoba|Blumenort]], who had abandoned their Strassendorf system a year earlier, the village of Steinbach was surveyed and land was redistributed with individual titles to open-field properties. Those who were given inferior land were financially compensated by the others. Although a communal pasture for cattle was maintained for some decades after this, the end of the linear settlement meant the end of the traditional communal lifestyle of the Mennonites in this area, but also opened the area up to greater capitalist enterprise.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1911, the Kleine Gemeinde church, who had met in the village school up until this point, built a building on the south end of the village.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1912, J.R. Friesen opened a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] auto dealership in town, which was the first Ford dealership in Western Canada. At the time, Friesen was excommunicated from the [[Kleine Gemeinde]] for adopting the modern technology, but within a few years, many Steinbachers accepted the automobile as an acceptable mode of transportation.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nBy this time, Steinbach had a third Mennonite church, the [[Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches|Bruderthaler]], who, unlike the Kleine Gemeinde and Holdeman Mennonites, taught that being successful in business was not a sin and, in fact, was to be encouraged. The new theology radically changed Steinbach from a more traditional and agriculturally-based economy to one that emphasized capitalist endeavour.<ref>{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Revive Us Again: A Brief History of Revivalism in Steinbach |publisher = Preservings |date =December 2018}}</ref> Entrepreneurs took advantage of the business opportunities at the time and several small businesses sprang up. Many other important and large businesses developed as well, helping to establish Steinbach as a regional service centre for the area.\n\nBy 1915, Steinbach had grown to a population of 463 and continued to attract immigrants from Europe.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Many of the new immigrants were Bergthaler Mennonites, but Steinbach also was the destination for new German and Lutheran settlers, as well as some British families who had previously settled in the Clearspring Settlement slightly to the north.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Steinbach's first bank, the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Royal Bank]], opened in 1915.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nDuring [[World War I]], most Steinbach Mennonites were given an exemption from military service, as promised in the Privilegium they had agreed to upon immigration in the 1870s.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\" /> Mistakenly considered \"ethnic Germans\", the Mennonites were caught up in the anti-German sentiment of the time and [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867-1942)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] banned Mennonites from Steinbach and other areas from voting in 1917. A year later in 1918, as soldiers returned to North America, [[Spanish flu]] struck the village, killing many.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\" />\n\nAfter the war, Borden banned Mennonites and other pacifists from immigrating to Canada for three years from 1919 to 1922.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> At the same time, there was the out-migration of the more conservative Mennonites, who left the area for [[Mexico]] and [[Paraguay]], after the Canadian government required them to learn English and attend public schools, issues which seemed to be in violation of the Privilegium signed in 1873.<ref name=\"Francis, E.K. 1955\"/>\n\nAfter the Mennonite immigration ban was lifted in 1922 by [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], a second wave of Mennonite immigration occurred due to the Russian Revolution, and many of the \"Russlander\" Mennonites took over farms and land left unoccupied by the Mennonites leaving for Latin America. During the 1920s, thousands of Mennonite refugees fled the [[Soviet Union]], many of them arriving in the Steinbach area.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book |author = Epp, Frank H. |title = Mennonite Exodus |publisher = D.W.

The same year, the last traditional Mennonite [[housebarn]] in Steinbach was torn down by car dealer (and later mayor) A.D. Penner.<ref name=reflections /> Partially in response to the destruction of heritage buildings in the area, such as the historic housebarn destroyed by A.D. Penner, residents in the 1960s saw the need to preserve and remember the Mennonite history of the region. In 1967 the [[Mennonite Heritage Village]] museum in Steinbach was opened.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/>\n\nIn 1970, the year of Manitoba's centennial, Steinbach was visited by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Charles]].<ref name=reflections/> A crowd of 10,000 waited along the streets of Steinbach as the royals visited, coming from the east along Highway 52 after their visit to [[La Broquerie, Manitoba|La Brouqerie]]. The Carillon described the visit saying, \"it was the most memorable and exciting moment in the history of the Southeast. For the first time since the earliest European settlers arrived in the 1860s and 1870s, a member of the British royal family paid a personal visit to the communities of La Broquerie, Steinbach, Sarto, [[Grunthal, Manitoba|Grunthal]] and [[St-Pierre-Jolys|St. Pierre]].

They used their lands for hunting, fishing, and trapping. The Anishinabe knew no borders at the time and their land ranged both north and south of the US\u2013Canada border, and both east and west of the [[Red River (Canada)|Red River]]. On 3 August 1871 the Anishinabe people signed [[Treaty 1]] and moved onto reserves such as the [[Brokenhead Ojibway Nation|Brokenhead Indian Reserve]] and [[Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation]] Reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|title=History and Heritage of Roseau River First Nation|accessdate=1 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205813/http://www.rrafn.com/history.html|archivedate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the government began surveying and staking out the land for the [[East Reserve]] (now the [[Hanover, Manitoba|R.M. of Hanover]]).\n\n===Early history===\nSteinbach (meaning \"Stone Brook\" in [[German language|German]]) was founded in 1874 by [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]]-speaking [[Russian Mennonites]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title=City of Steinbach |access-date=25 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date=9 May 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Many of Steinbach's 18 original settler families came directly from the Borosenko colony in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], now [[Ukraine]].<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\">{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Between Earth and Sky: Steinbach, The First 50 Years |publisher = Derksen Printers |date =September 2009}}</ref>\nThey took the name \"Steinbach\" from the village they lived in there. At the time they left for Canada, Borosenko was just ten years old, an off-shoot of the larger [[Molotschna]] (or Milk River) colony. However, Russia was not their ancestral homeland. Originating in [[Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking [[Flanders]] region of [[Belgium]] during the 16th century, the ancestors of Steinbach's Mennonite settlers also lived in [[Prussia]] for two centuries before their time in Ukraine.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\">{{cite web |url= http://city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |title= Steinbach History 1874 - 1990 |date= 1 May 1990 |accessdate= 14 May 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093834/http://www.city-of-steinbach.com/heritage.shtml |archive-date= 9 May 2008 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Within the settlement of Molotschna were a group of people following the [[Kleine Gemeinde]], known for practise of the New Testament teachings of non-resistance, community of sharing and the publication of the first inspirational books. This group was a small minority in Molotschna but its farmers were known as the best in the community.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1873, Mennonites from Russia became dissatisfied with increasing [[Russification]] and the removal of their military exemption, and sent delegates to Canada to investigate and negotiate terms of immigration. Many of the delegates decided to move their people to [[Kansas]], however, the more conservative groups, such as the Kleine Gemeinde, were persuaded to settle in Canada because the Canadian government was more generous in their guarantees of religious freedom. In 1873 a [[Privilegium of 1873 (Canada)|Privilegium]] was signed, and a year later Mennonites started to arrive in the region. The document guaranteed, among other things, military exemption, freedom of religion, private schools, and land, known as the [[East Reserve]].<ref name=\"Francis, E.K. 1955\">{{cite book |author = Francis, E.K. |title = In Search of Utopia |publisher = D.W. Friesens and Sons |date =1955}}</ref>\n\nTwo Mennonite groups settled in the East Reserve, the [[Bergthal Colony|Bergthalers]] and [[Kleine Gemeinde]]. Most of Steinbach's settlers were from Kleine Gemeinde families, who arrived late in the summer of 1874. When they arrived, they found that much of the better land in the reserve had already been settled a few months earlier by the Bergthaler and earlier Kleine Gemeinde families. The earlier settlers had come to realize the area suffered from excessive moisture and settled upon much of the higher lands and gravel ridges. So Steinbach's earliest Mennonite settlers settled in the northeast corner of the East Reserve. The 20 homesteads were laid out on the northeast side of present-day Main Street along the Steinbach Creek.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n[[File:Wind mill in Mennonite Heritage Village Steinbach Manitoba Canada 1 (5).JPG|thumb|upright|Windmill at [[Mennonite Heritage Village]] in Steinbach]]\n\nContrary to the preferences of the Canadian government, the early settlers of Steinbach, like other Mennonite villages, organized the village into a Strassendorf, or street village, with each family occupying a long narrow strip known as a ''Wirtschaft''.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Most of the settlers were farmers, but in a somewhat urban setting, who lived, to some degree, communally, and shared a common pasture at the end of the village. They started a school in the first year, and in the following year of 1875 built a school and teacherage.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Steinbach's Main Street was hacked out of thick [[Populus_\u00d7_canadensis|poplar]] bush along the creek, where a [[bison]] trail ran, a trail that was still used by Indigenous people during Steinbach's early years.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|title=Dad, God, and Me|author=Ralph Friesen|publisher=FriesenPress|date=2019}}</ref> \n\nIn June 1875, Steinbach's spiritual leader Jakob Barkman, who had led the Kleine Gemeinde to Canada, drowned in the Red River, along with Jakob K. Friesen on a trip to Winnipeg for supplies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jakob M. Barkman|publisher=GAMEO|url=https://www.gameo.org/index.php?title=Barkman,_Jakob_M._(1824-1875)|accessdate=February 17, 2002}}</ref> The absence of religious leadership in Steinbach created a vacuum that made the villagers receptive to [[John Holdeman]] when he visited in 1881. After Holdeman's visit many locals from the Kleine Gemeinde joined his new church, [[Church of God in Christ, Mennonite]]. This was the first of many [[schisms]] and revivals in Steinbach and eventually the town would be known for having dozens of churches, many of them different variations of Mennonite, a dynamic that has shaped the city's character.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> \n\nIn 1877, [[Lord Dufferin]] toured Manitoba's new Mennonite settlements and stopped just west of Steinbach where he could see \"half a dozen villages\" in the distance. A crowd of 1000 people greeted his arrival.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> That same year, the first and original windmill in the town was built by Abraham S. Friesen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siamandas.com/time_machine/PAGES/more%20stories/STEINBACH.htm|title= History of Steinbach |publisher= |year= |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> After a period of eight years, in 1882, Mayor Gerhard Giesbrecht said that the village had grown to 28 families with a population of 128.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nVarious epidemics swept the area in the late 1800s, including [[scarlet fever]], [[whooping cough]], and [[diphtheria]]. In the spring of 1884 alone, more than seventy people died, mostly children. Another whopping cough epidemic took place in 1900.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBy 1900 the settlers had drained the swamps and cleared the land making it more suitable for the farming of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. In the 1901 census, Steinbach had a population of 366, and almost the entire population still spoke Plautdietsch, with only a few reporting a knowledge of English.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===End of the Strassendorf===\nIn 1910, the [[linear settlement]] village design, or Strassendorf, for the community ended.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\"/> Prior to this time, the settlers of Steinbach lived in long narrow strips, called wirtschafts, along the Steinbach Creek. Following the lead of the neighbouring Mennonite village of [[Blumenort, Manitoba|Blumenort]], who had abandoned their Strassendorf system a year earlier, the village of Steinbach was surveyed and land was redistributed with individual titles to open-field properties. Those who were given inferior land were financially compensated by the others. Although a communal pasture for cattle was maintained for some decades after this, the end of the linear settlement meant the end of the traditional communal lifestyle of the Mennonites in this area, but also opened the area up to greater capitalist enterprise.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> In 1911, the Kleine Gemeinde church, who had met in the village school up until this point, built a building on the south end of the village.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1912, J.R. Friesen opened a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] auto dealership in town, which was the first Ford dealership in Western Canada. At the time, Friesen was excommunicated from the [[Kleine Gemeinde]] for adopting the modern technology, but within a few years, many Steinbachers accepted the automobile as an acceptable mode of transportation.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/>\n\nBy this time, Steinbach had a third Mennonite church, the [[Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches|Bruderthaler]], who, unlike the Kleine Gemeinde and Holdeman Mennonites, taught that being successful in business was not a sin and, in fact, was to be encouraged. The new theology radically changed Steinbach from a more traditional and agriculturally-based economy to one that emphasized capitalist endeavour.<ref>{{cite book |author = Friesen, Ralph |title = Revive Us Again: A Brief History of Revivalism in Steinbach |publisher = Preservings |date =December 2018}}</ref> Entrepreneurs took advantage of the business opportunities at the time and several small businesses sprang up. Many other important and large businesses developed as well, helping to establish Steinbach as a regional service centre for the area.\n\nBy 1915, Steinbach had grown to a population of 463 and continued to attract immigrants from Europe.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Many of the new immigrants were Bergthaler Mennonites, but Steinbach also was the destination for new German and Lutheran settlers, as well as some British families who had previously settled in the Clearspring Settlement slightly to the north.<ref name=\"Steinbach History\"/> Steinbach's first bank, the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Royal Bank]], opened in 1915.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> \n\nDuring [[World War I]], most Steinbach Mennonites were given an exemption from military service, as promised in the Privilegium they had agreed to upon immigration in the 1870s.<ref name=\"Friesen, Ralph\" /> Mistakenly considered \"ethnic Germans\", the Mennonites were caught up in the anti-German sentiment of the time and [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867-1942)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] banned Mennonites from Steinbach and other areas from voting in 1917.

The band's main community and offices are located on the {{convert|312|acre|km2|1}} [[Semiahmoo Indian Reserve]] which is sandwiched between the boundary of [[White Rock, British Columbia]] and the Canada\u2013United States boundary and [[Peace Arch Provincial Park]].\n\n== History ==\n{{main|Semiahmoo people}}\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 1790, Europeans estimated the Semiahmoo population at 300. By 1854, the band's numbers were reduced to 250 due to smallpox and warfare. In 1909 there were 38 band members in British Columbia.  In 1963, the number had reached 28 and then just 25 by 1971.  Between 1996 and 2001, the reserve population dropped 34.5 per cent, from 200 people to 131, and currently they have 98 registered members and 53 members who live on site\n\nThe Semiahmoo remain one of the smallest First Nations in the region with about 74 band members, of whom 40 live on Reserve. In fact, Semiahmoo has more non-Aboriginals living on its reserve than band members. As of 2003, the median age of the Semiahmoo population was 42.5 years: higher than the average for all people living on Indian Reserves in Greater Vancouver (which was 39.2 years).\n\n== Reserve and governance ==\nThe Semiahmoo Reserve was established by the Canadian government in 1887. Renowned [[Haida people|Haida]] artist [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]] currently works from a studio on the reserve.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1996, {{convert|172|acre|km2|1}} or more than half the reserve's area was leased by the band to the Municipality of Surrey for recreational \"parkland\" purposes. The City of White Rock and the City of Surrey both used the land, known as \"Semiahmoo Park\" for [[landfill]] and municipal infrastructure purposes. In 2014, the First Nation announced that it was endeavouring to remediate the soil which was contaminated by the municipalities' usage.<ref name=landfill>{{cite news|title=Semiahmoo First Nation begins restoration of former landfill|url=http://www.thenownewspaper.com/news/semiahmoo-first-nation-begins-restoration-of-former-landfill-1.847448|accessdate=15 August 2015|work=The Now Newspaper|date=Feb 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Relations with federal government ==\nIn 2003/04, the Semiahmoo received $243,500 in federal funding.<ref>[http://sdiprod2.inac.gc.ca/FNProfiles/FNProfiles_DETAILS.asp?BAND_NUMBER=569 First Nation Detail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030904140603/http://sdiprod2.inac.gc.ca/fnprofiles/FNProfiles_Details.asp?Band_Number=569 |date=2003-09-04 }}, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Retrieved on June 18, 2007</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the Semihamoo reserve was listed by [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]] as a high-priority community for drinking-water improvements.

The band's main community and offices are located on the {{convert|312|acre|km2|1}} [[Semiahmoo Indian Reserve]] which is sandwiched between the boundary of [[White Rock, British Columbia]] and the Canada\u2013United States boundary and [[Peace Arch Provincial Park]].\n\n== History ==\n{{main|Semiahmoo people}}\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 1790, Europeans estimated the Semiahmoo population at 300. By 1854, the band's numbers were reduced to 250 due to smallpox and warfare. In 1909 there were 38 band members in British Columbia.  In 1963, the number had reached 28 and then just 25 by 1971.  Between 1996 and 2001, the reserve population dropped 34.5 per cent, from 200 people to 131.\n\nThe Semiahmoo remain one of the smallest First Nations in the region with about 74 band members, of whom 40 live on Reserve. In fact, Semiahmoo has more non-Aboriginals living on its reserve than band members. As of 2003, the median age of the Semiahmoo population was 42.5 years: higher than the average for all people living on Indian Reserves in Greater Vancouver (which was 39.2 years).\n\n== Reserve and governance ==\nThe Semiahmoo Reserve was established by the Canadian government in 1887. Renowned [[Haida people|Haida]] artist [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]] currently works from a studio on the reserve.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1996, {{convert|172|acre|km2|1}} or more than half the reserve's area was leased by the band to the Municipality of Surrey for recreational \"parkland\" purposes. The City of White Rock and the City of Surrey both used the land, known as \"Semiahmoo Park\" for [[landfill]] and municipal infrastructure purposes. In 2014, the First Nation announced that it was endeavouring to remediate the soil which was contaminated by the municipalities' usage.<ref name=landfill>{{cite news|title=Semiahmoo First Nation begins restoration of former landfill|url=http://www.thenownewspaper.com/news/semiahmoo-first-nation-begins-restoration-of-former-landfill-1.847448|accessdate=15 August 2015|work=The Now Newspaper|date=Feb 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Relations with federal government ==\nIn 2003/04, the Semiahmoo received $243,500 in federal funding.<ref>[http://sdiprod2.inac.gc.ca/FNProfiles/FNProfiles_DETAILS.asp?BAND_NUMBER=569 First Nation Detail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030904140603/http://sdiprod2.inac.gc.ca/fnprofiles/FNProfiles_Details.asp?Band_Number=569 |date=2003-09-04 }}, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Retrieved on June 18, 2007</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the Semihamoo reserve was listed by [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]] as a high-priority community for drinking-water improvements.

This was closer to that used for stationary [[gas engine]]s than the expensive high-voltage [[ignition magneto]]s that were used on some other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The system did not need a starting battery, since proper hand-cranking would generate enough current for starting. Electric lighting powered by the magneto was adopted in 1915, replacing acetylene and oil lamps, but electric starting was not offered until 1919.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.modelt.ca/history |title=History of the Ford Motor Company \u2013 Fast Facts |website=The Frontenac Motor Company & The Ford Model T |access-date=2017-09-27}}</ref>\n\nThe Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. \n\nThe [[Fordson]] Model F tractor engine, that was designed about a decade later, was very similar to, but larger than, the Model T engine.<ref name=\"Manly1919p268\">{{Harvnb|Manly|1919|p=268}}</ref>\n\n===Transmission and drive train===\n[[File:Model T pedals.jpg|thumb|The three pedal controls of the Model{{nbsp}}T]]\n[[File:1920 Ford Model T Controls (1495288990).jpg|thumb|View of the driver's controls, 1920 Model{{nbsp}}T]]\nThe Model T was a [[rear-wheel drive]] vehicle. Its [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was a [[planetary gear]] type billed as \"three speed\". In today's terms it would be considered a two-speed, because one of the three speeds was reverse.\n\nThe Model T's transmission was controlled with three floor-mounted pedals and a lever mounted to the road side of the driver's seat. The [[throttle]] was controlled with a lever on the [[steering wheel]]. The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the mid position or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered low gear. When held in an intermediate position, the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward \u2013 in any other position, the pedal would only move up as far as the central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.\n\nThe first 800 units were sent in reverse with a lever; all units after that were sent in reverse with a pedal between the [[car controls#Pedals|clutch and brake pedals]].<ref name=\"Kimes1989p551\"/> The middle pedal was used to engage reverse gear when the car was in neutral. The right pedal operated the [[transmission brake]] \u2013 there were no brakes on the wheels. The floor lever also controlled the [[parking brake]], which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back. This doubled as an emergency brake.\n\nAlthough it was uncommon, the drive bands could fall out of adjustment, allowing the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a [[wet clutch]], this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] through a single [[universal joint]] attached to a [[torque tube]] which drove the rear [[axle]]; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing. The heavy-duty ''[[Ford Model TT|Model TT]]'' truck chassis came with a special [[worm gear]] rear differential with lower gearing than the normal car and truck, giving more pulling power but a lower top speed (the frame was also stronger; the cab and engine were the same). A Model TT is easily identifiable by the cylindrical housing for the worm-drive over the axle differential. All gears were [[vanadium steel]] running in an oil bath.\n\n====Transmission bands and linings====\nTwo main types of band lining material were used:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordmodelt.net/transmission.htm |title=Ford Model T Transmission |website=FordModelT.net |access-date=2017-07-06}}</ref>\n* '''Cotton''' \u2013 Cotton woven linings were the original type fitted and specified by Ford.  Generally, the cotton lining is \"kinder\" to the drum surface, with damage to the drum caused only by the retaining rivets scoring the drum surface. Although this in itself did not pose a problem, a dragging band resulting from improper adjustment caused overheating of the transmission and engine, diminished power, and&nbsp;\u2013 in the case of cotton linings&nbsp;\u2013 rapid destruction of the band lining.\n* '''Wood''' \u2013 Wooden linings were originally offered as a \"longer life\" accessory part during the life of the Model T. They were a single piece of steam bent wood and metal wire, fitted to the normal Model T transmission band.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pag\u00e9|first=Victor Wilfred |date=1917 |title=The Model T Ford Car, Its Construction, Operation and Repair: A Complete Practical Treatise Explaining the Operating Principles of All Parts of the Ford Automobile, with Complete Instructions for Driving and Maintenance|page=241 |publisher=Norman W. Henley Publishing Co.}}</ref> These bands give a very different feel to the pedals, with much more of a \"bite\" feel. The sensation is of a definite \"grip\" of the drum and seemed to noticeably increase the feel, in particular of the brake drum.\n\n===Suspension and wheels===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Ford model t suspension.triddle.jpg|thumb|The suspension components of a Ford Model T. The coil-spring device is an aftermarket accessory, the \"Hassler shock absorber\".]]\n\nModel T suspension employed a transversely mounted semi-elliptical spring for each of the front and rear beam axles which allowed a great deal of wheel movement to cope with the dirt roads of the time.\n\nThe front axle was [[drop forged]] as a single piece of vanadium steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated [[band brake]]s acting on the inside of the rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.\n\nWheels were wooden [[artillery wheel]]s, with steel welded-spoke wheels available in 1926 and 1927.\n\nTires were [[Tire|pneumatic]] [[Clincher tire|clincher]] type, {{convert|30|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, {{convert|3.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide in the rear,  {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} in the front. Clinchers needed much higher pressure than today's tires, typically {{convert|60|psi|abbr=on}}, to prevent them from leaving the rim at speed. Horseshoe nails on the roads, together with the high pressure, made flat tires a common problem.\n\nBalloon tires became available in 1925. They were {{convert|21|x|4.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} all around. Balloon tires were closer in design to today's tires, with steel wires reinforcing the tire bead, making lower pressure possible \u2013 typically {{convert|35|psi|abbr=on}} \u2013 giving a softer ride. The steering gear ratio was changed from 4:1 to 5:1 with the introduction of balloon tires.<ref>{{cite book |title=Model T Ford Service |publisher=Ford}}</ref> The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so {{convert|21|in|abbr=on}} (rim diameter) \u00d7 {{convert|4.5|in|abbr=on}} (tire width) wheels has about the same outer diameter as 30 in (76&nbsp;cm) clincher tires. All tires in this time period used an [[inner tube]] to hold the pressurized air; [[tubeless tire]]s were not generally in use until much later.\n\n[[Wheelbase]] was 100&nbsp;inches (254&nbsp;cm) and standard track width was 56 inch (142&nbsp;cm); 60 inch (152&nbsp;cm) track could be obtained on special order, \"for Southern roads\", identical to [[Track gauge in the United States#5ft|the pre-Civil War track gauge]] for many railroads in the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The standard 56 inch track being very near the standard {{frac|4 foot 8|1|2}} inch railroad track gauge meant that Model Ts could be and frequently were, fitted with flanged wheels and used as railway vehicles; the availability of a 60in (5ft) version meant the same could be done on the few remaining Southern 5ft railways (these being the only nonstandard lines remaining, except for a few narrow-gauge lines of various sizes).  Although a Model T could be adapted to run on track as narrow as 2ft gauge (Wiscasset, Waterville and Farmington RR, Maine has one), this was a more complex alteration.\n\n===Colors===\nBy 1918, half of all the cars in the U.S. were Model Ts. In his autobiography, Ford reports that in 1909 he told his management team, \"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.\"<!-- DO NOT TRY TO COPY EDIT THIS QUOTE; IT IS ALREADY *VERBATIM* AND ALREADY ACCEPTABLY WRITTEN. --><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|p=72}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, in the first years of production from 1908 to 1913, the Model T was not available in black<ref name=\"McCalley 1994\">{{Harvnb|McCalley|1994}}.</ref> but rather only gray, green, blue, and red.  Green was available for the touring cars, town cars, coupes, and Landaulets. Gray was only available for the town cars, and red only for the touring cars. By 1912, all cars were being painted midnight blue with black fenders. Only in 1914 was the \"any color so long as it is black\" policy finally implemented. It is often stated Ford suggested the use of black from 1914 to 1926 due to the low cost, durability, and faster drying time of black paint in that era. Paint choices in the American automotive industry, as well as in others (including locomotives, furniture, bicycles, and the rapidly expanding field of electrical appliances), were shaped by the development of the [[chemical industry]]. These included the disruption of dye sources during [[World War I]] and the advent, in the mid-1920s, of new [[Lacquer#Nitrocellulose lacquers|nitrocellulose lacquer]]s that were faster-drying and more scratch-resistant, and obviated the need for multiple coats;<ref name=\"Dutton_1942\">{{Harvnb|Dutton|1942}}.</ref>{{rp|261\u2013301}} understanding the choice of paints for the Model T era and the years immediately following requires an understanding of the contemporary chemical industry.<ref name=\"Dutton_1942\"/>\n\nDuring the lifetime production of the Model T, over 30 types of black paint were used on various parts of the car.<ref name=\"McCalley 1994\"/> These were formulated to satisfy the different means of applying the paint to the various parts, and had distinct drying times, depending on the part, paint, and method of drying.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:1910Ford-T.jpg|thumb|1910 Model T, photographed in [[Salt Lake City]]]]\n[[File:Ford_T_1917.jpg|thumb|1917 Model T]]\n[[File:Ford Speedster T.JPG|thumb|T Speedster]]\n[[File:1925.ford.model.t.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|1925 Ford \"New Model\" T Tudor Sedan]]\nAlthough Ford classified the Model T with a single letter designation throughout its entire life and made no distinction by model years, enough significant changes to the body were made over the production life that the car may be classified into several style generations.  Among the most immediately visible and identifiable changes were in the hood and cowl areas, although many other modifications were made to the vehicle.\n* 1909\u20131914 \u2013 Characterized by a nearly straight, five-sided hood, with a flat top containing a center hinge and two side sloping sections containing the folding hinges. The firewall was flat from the windshield down with no distinct cowl.\n* 1915\u20131916 \u2013 The hood design was nearly the same five-sided design with the only obvious change being the addition of louvers to the vertical sides.  A significant change to the cowl area occurred with the windshield relocated significantly behind the firewall and joined with a compound-contoured cowl panel.\n* 1917\u20131923 \u2013 The hood design was changed to a tapered design with a curved top. The folding hinges were now located at the joint between the flat sides and the curved top. This is sometime referred to as the \"low hood\" to distinguish it from the later hoods. The back edge of the hood now met the front edge of the cowl panel so that no part of the flat firewall was visible outside of the hood.  This design was used the longest and during the highest production years, accounting for about half of the total number of Model Ts built.\n* 1923\u20131925 \u2013 This change was made during the 1923 calendar year, so models built earlier in the year have the older design, while later vehicles have the newer design.  The taper of the hood was increased and the rear section at the firewall is about an inch taller and several inches wider than the previous design.  While this is a relatively minor change, the parts between the third and fourth generations are not interchangeable.\n* 1926\u20131927 \u2013 This design change made the greatest difference in the appearance of the car.  The hood was again enlarged, with the cowl panel no longer a compound curve and blended much more with the line of the hood.  The distance between the firewall and the windshield was also increased significantly.  This style is sometimes referred to as the \"high hood\".\n\nThe styling on the last \"generation\" was a preview for the following Model A, but the two models are visually quite different, as the body on the A was much wider and had curved doors as opposed to the flat doors on the T.\n\n===Diverse applications===\n[[File:Model T tractor.png|thumb|A Model T [[Doodlebug tractor|homemade tractor]] pulling a plow]]\n[[File:Pullford auto-to-tractor conversion advert 1918.png|thumb|Pullford auto-to-tractor conversion advertisement, 1918]]\n[[File:Ford-American LaFrance 1919 Model-T firefighting vehicle.jpg|thumb|The American LaFrance company modified more than 900 Ford Model T's to serve firefighters.]]\nWhen the Model T was designed and introduced, the infrastructure of the world was quite different from today's. Pavement was a rarity except for sidewalks and a few big-city streets. (The sense of the term \"pavement\" as equivalent with \"sidewalk\" comes from that era, when streets and roads were generally dirt and sidewalks were a paved way to walk along them.) Agriculture was the occupation of many people. [[Power tool]]s were scarce outside factories, as were power sources for them; electrification, like pavement, was found usually only in larger towns. [[Rural electrification]] and motorized [[mechanization]] were embryonic in some regions and nonexistent in most. Henry Ford oversaw the requirements and design of the Model T based on contemporary realities. Consequently, the Model T was (intentionally) almost as much a tractor and [[portable engine]] as it was an automobile. It has always been well regarded for its all-terrain abilities and ruggedness. It could travel a rocky, muddy farm lane, cross a shallow stream, climb a steep hill, and be parked on the other side to have one of its wheels removed and a pulley fastened to the hub for a [[flat belt]] to drive a [[bucksaw]], [[threshing machine|thresher]], silo blower, conveyor for filling [[corn crib]]s or haylofts, [[baler]], water pump, electrical generator, and many other applications. One unique application of the Model T was shown in the October 1922 issue of ''Fordson Farmer'' magazine. It showed a minister who had transformed his Model T into a mobile church, complete with small organ.<ref>{{cite book|last=Casey|first=Robert|title=The Model T A Centennial History|url=https://archive.org/details/modeltcentennial0000case|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-8850-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/modeltcentennial0000case/page/148 148]}}</ref>\n\nDuring this era, entire automobiles (including thousands of Model Ts) were even hacked apart by their owners and reconfigured into custom machinery permanently dedicated to a purpose, such as [[Doodlebug tractor|homemade tractors]] and ice saws.<ref>{{cite web |title=1926 Ford Model T Ice Saw |url=http://owlshead.org/collections/detail/1926-ford-t-ice-saw |accessdate=2012-12-24 |publisher=Owl's Head Transportation Museum}} Used for harvesting winter ice from ponds in [[Maine]].</ref> Dozens of [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] companies sold [[prefabrication|prefab]] kits to facilitate the T's conversion from car to tractor.<ref name=\"PrippsMorland1993p28\">{{Harvnb|Pripps|Morland|1993|p=28}}.</ref> The Model T had been around for a decade before the [[Fordson tractor]] became available (1917\u201318), and many Ts had been converted for field use. (For example, [[Harry Ferguson]], later famous for his hitches and tractors, worked on Eros Model T tractor conversions before he worked with Fordsons and others.) During the next decade, Model T tractor conversion kits were harder to sell, as the Fordson and then the [[Farmall]] (1924), as well as other light and affordable tractors, served the farm market. But during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] (1930s), Model T tractor conversion kits had a resurgence, because by then used Model Ts and junkyard parts for them were plentiful and cheap.<ref name=\"Leffingwell2002pp43-51\">{{Harvnb|Leffingwell|2002|pp=43\u201351}}.</ref>\n\nLike many popular car engines of the era, the Model T engine was also used on home-built aircraft (such as the [[Pietenpol Sky Scout]]) and [[motorboat]]s.\n\nAn [[armored car (military)|armored-car]] variant (called the [[Ford FT-B|FT-B]]) was developed in Poland in 1920 due to the high demand during the [[Polish-Soviet war]] in 1920.\n\nMany Model Ts were converted into vehicles which could travel across heavy snows with kits on the rear wheels (sometimes with an extra pair of rear-mounted wheels and two sets of [[continuous track]] to mount on the now-tandemed rear wheels, essentially making it a [[half-track]]) and skis replacing the front wheels. They were popular for rural mail delivery for a time.  The common name for these conversions of cars and small trucks was \"snowflyers\".

When introduced, the T used the building methods typical at the time, assembly by hand, and production was small. The [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]] could not keep up with demand for the Model T, and only 11 cars were built there during the first full month of production. More and more machines were used to reduce the complexity within the 84 defined areas. In 1910, after assembling nearly 12,000 Model Ts, Henry Ford moved the company to the new [[Highland Park Ford Plant|Highland Park complex]]. During this time the Model T production system ([[Vertical integration|including the]] [[supply chain]]) transitioned into an iconic example of assembly line production.<ref name=\"hounshell-1984\"/><ref name=Abernathy/> In subsequent decades it would also come to be viewed as the classic example of the rigid, first-generation version of assembly line production, as opposed to flexible mass production<ref name=\"hounshell-1984\"/> of higher quality products.<ref name=Abernathy>{{cite web |last1=Abernathy |first1=William J. |last2=Wayne |first2=Kenneth |title=Limits of the Learning Curve |url=https://hbr.org/1974/09/limits-of-the-learning-curve |website=[[Harvard Business Review]] |date=1 September 1974 |quote=Ford\u2019s objective was to reduce the price of the automobile and thereby increase volume and market share. <br> \"Ford\u2019s long devotion to the experience-curve strategy made the transition to another strategy difficult and very costly\" (going from reducing Model T cost to increasing Model A price) \"From the time it introduced the Model A, Ford was compelled to compete on the basis of product quality and performance \u2014 a strategy in which it was not skilled\" <br> The rate of capital investment showed substantial increases after 1913, rising from 11 cents per sales dollar that year to 22 cents by 1921.

These facilities even included coal mines, rubber plantations, and forestry operations (to provide wooden car parts). By 1926, nearly 33 cents in such assets backed each dollar of sales, up from 20 cents just four years earlier, thereby increasing fixed costs and raising the break-even point. |url-access=limited}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, Ford's cars came off the line in three-minute intervals, much [[Experience curve effects|faster than previous methods]], reducing production time from 12.5 hours before to 93 minutes by 1914, while using less manpower.<ref name=\"Georgano1985\">{{Harvnb|Georgano|1985}}.</ref> In 1914, Ford produced more cars than all other automakers combined. The Model T was a great commercial success, and by the time Ford made its 10 millionth car, half of all cars in the world were Fords. It was so successful Ford did not purchase any advertising between 1917 and 1923; instead, the Model T became so famous, people considered it a norm. More than 15&nbsp;million Model Ts were manufactured in all, reaching a rate of 9,000 to 10,000 cars a day in 1925, or 2&nbsp;million annually,<ref>{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Sandler |title=Driving Around the USA: Automobiles in American Life |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Brinkley |title=Wheels for the world: Henry Ford, his company, and a century of progress, 1903\u20132003 |url=https://archive.org/details/wheelsforworldhe00brin |url-access=registration |publisher=Viking |year=2003 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wheelsforworldhe00brin/page/475 475]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=My forty years with Ford |first1=Charles E. |last1=Sorensen |first2=David Lanier |last2=Lewis |first3=Samuel T. |last3=Williamson |publisher=Wayne State University Press |page=4}}</ref> more than any other model of its day, at a price of just $260.

As other companies offered comfort and styling advantages, at competitive prices, the Model T lost market share and became barely profitable.<ref name=Abernathy/> Design changes were not as few as the public perceived, but the idea of an unchanging model was kept intact.

Almost 170,000 were built after car production stopped, as replacement engines were required to service already produced vehicles. Racers and enthusiasts, forerunners of modern hot rodders, used the Model T's block to build popular and cheap racing engines, including [[Cragar]], [[Navarro (hot rodder)|Navarro]], and famously the [[Frontenac (racing car)|Frontenacs]] (\"Fronty Fords\")<ref name=nac/> of the [[Chevrolet]] brothers, among many others.\n\nThe Model T employed some advanced technology, for example, its use of [[vanadium steel]] alloy. Its durability was phenomenal, and some Model Ts and their parts are in running order over a century later. Although Henry Ford resisted some kinds of change, he always championed the advancement of [[materials engineering]], and often mechanical engineering and industrial engineering.\n\nIn 2002, Ford built a final batch of six Model Ts as part of their 2003 centenary celebrations. These cars were assembled from remaining new components and other parts produced from the original drawings. The last of the six was used for publicity purposes in the UK.\n\nAlthough Ford no longer manufactures parts for the Model T, many parts are still manufactured through [[Privately held company|private companies]] as replicas to service the thousands of Model Ts still in operation today.\n\nOn May 26, 1927, Henry Ford and his son Edsel drove the 15-millionth Model T out of the factory.<ref name=15million/> This marked the famous automobile's official last day of production at the main factory.\n\n===Price and production===\n[[File: Phoenix-Phoenix Police Museum-1919 Ford Model TPolice Cruiser.jpg |300px|thumb|1919 Ford Model T Phoenix Police Cruiser]]\n{{external media\n| image1=[https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/hbr/7409/74501_A.gif Ford Model T price/volume curve, 1909-1923]\n}}\n\nThe moving assembly line system, which started on October 7, 1913, allowed Ford to reduce the price of his cars.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/ford-assembly-line-turns-100-changed-society-article-1.1478331 |title=Ford's Assembly Line Turns 100: How It Changed Manufacturing and Society |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=2013-10-07 |access-date=2017-08-27 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131130021237/http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/ford-assembly-line-turns-100-changed-society-article-1.1478331 |archive-date=2013-11-30}}</ref> As he continued to fine-tune the system, Ford was able to keep reducing costs significantly.<ref name=imf>{{cite web|url= https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2017/05/22/Riding-the-Energy-Transition-Oil-Beyond-2040-44932 |title=Riding the Energy Transition : Oil Beyond 2040 |first1=Reda |last1=Cherif |first2=Fuad |last2=Hasanov |first3=Aditya |last3=Pande |publisher= [[International Monetary Fund]] |date=2017-05-22 |accessdate=2017-10-07 |page=13 |quote=Vehicle adoption is strongly associated with the ability to offer an affordable price.

This was closer to that used for stationary [[gas engine]]s than the expensive high-voltage [[ignition magneto]]s that were used on some other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The system did not need a starting battery, since proper hand-cranking would generate enough current for starting. Electric lighting powered by the magneto was adopted in 1915, replacing acetylene and oil lamps, but electric starting was not offered until 1919.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.modelt.ca/history |title=History of the Ford Motor Company \u2013 Fast Facts |website=The Frontenac Motor Company & The Ford Model T |access-date=2017-09-27}}</ref>\n\nThe Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. \n\nThe [[Fordson]] Model F tractor engine, that was designed about a decade later, was very similar to, but larger than, the Model T engine.<ref name=\"Manly1919p268\">{{Harvnb|Manly|1919|p=268}}</ref>\n\n===Transmission and drive train===\n[[File:Model T pedals.jpg|thumb|The three pedal controls of the Model{{nbsp}}T]]\n[[File:1920 Ford Model T Controls (1495288990).jpg|thumb|View of the driver's controls, 1920 Model{{nbsp}}T]]\nThe Model T was a [[rear-wheel drive]] vehicle. Its [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was a [[planetary gear]] type billed as \"three speed\". In today's terms it would be considered a two-speed, because one of the three speeds was reverse.\n\nThe Model T's transmission was controlled with three floor-mounted pedals and a lever mounted to the road side of the driver's seat. The [[throttle]] was controlled with a lever on the [[steering wheel]]. The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the mid position or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered low gear. When held in an intermediate position, the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward \u2013 in any other position, the pedal would only move up as far as the central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.\n\nThe first 800 units were sent in reverse with a lever; all units after that were sent in reverse with a pedal between the [[car controls#Pedals|clutch and brake pedals]].<ref name=\"Kimes1989p551\"/> The middle pedal was used to engage reverse gear when the car was in neutral. The right pedal operated the [[transmission brake]] \u2013 there were no brakes on the wheels. The floor lever also controlled the [[parking brake]], which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back. This doubled as an emergency brake.\n\nAlthough it was uncommon, the drive bands could fall out of adjustment, allowing the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a [[wet clutch]], this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] through a single [[universal joint]] attached to a [[torque tube]] which drove the rear [[axle]]; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing. The heavy-duty ''[[Ford Model TT|Model TT]]'' truck chassis came with a special [[worm gear]] rear differential with lower gearing than the normal car and truck, giving more pulling power but a lower top speed (the frame was also stronger; the cab and engine were the same). A Model TT is easily identifiable by the cylindrical housing for the worm-drive over the axle differential. All gears were [[vanadium steel]] running in an oil bath.\n\n====Transmission bands and linings====\nTwo main types of band lining material were used:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordmodelt.net/transmission.htm |title=Ford Model T Transmission |website=FordModelT.net |access-date=2017-07-06}}</ref>\n* '''Cotton''' \u2013 Cotton woven linings were the original type fitted and specified by Ford.  Generally, the cotton lining is \"kinder\" to the drum surface, with damage to the drum caused only by the retaining rivets scoring the drum surface. Although this in itself did not pose a problem, a dragging band resulting from improper adjustment caused overheating of the transmission and engine, diminished power, and&nbsp;\u2013 in the case of cotton linings&nbsp;\u2013 rapid destruction of the band lining.\n* '''Wood''' \u2013 Wooden linings were originally offered as a \"longer life\" accessory part during the life of the Model T. They were a single piece of steam bent wood and metal wire, fitted to the normal Model T transmission band.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pag\u00e9|first=Victor Wilfred |date=1917 |title=The Model T Ford Car, Its Construction, Operation and Repair: A Complete Practical Treatise Explaining the Operating Principles of All Parts of the Ford Automobile, with Complete Instructions for Driving and Maintenance|page=241 |publisher=Norman W. Henley Publishing Co.}}</ref> These bands give a very different feel to the pedals, with much more of a \"bite\" feel. The sensation is of a definite \"grip\" of the drum and seemed to noticeably increase the feel, in particular of the brake drum.\n\n===Suspension and wheels===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Ford model t suspension.triddle.jpg|thumb|The suspension components of a Ford Model T. The coil-spring device is an aftermarket accessory, the \"Hassler shock absorber\".]]\n\nModel T suspension employed a transversely mounted semi-elliptical spring for each of the front and rear beam axles which allowed a great deal of wheel movement to cope with the dirt roads of the time.\n\nThe front axle was [[drop forged]] as a single piece of vanadium steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated [[band brake]]s acting on the inside of the rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.\n\nWheels were wooden [[artillery wheel]]s, with steel welded-spoke wheels available in 1926 and 1927.\n\nTires were [[Tire|pneumatic]] [[Clincher tire|clincher]] type, {{convert|30|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, {{convert|3.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide in the rear,  {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} in the front. Clinchers needed much higher pressure than today's tires, typically {{convert|60|psi|abbr=on}}, to prevent them from leaving the rim at speed. Horseshoe nails on the roads, together with the high pressure, made flat tires a common problem.\n\nBalloon tires became available in 1925. They were {{convert|21|x|4.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} all around. Balloon tires were closer in design to today's tires, with steel wires reinforcing the tire bead, making lower pressure possible \u2013 typically {{convert|35|psi|abbr=on}} \u2013 giving a softer ride. The steering gear ratio was changed from 4:1 to 5:1 with the introduction of balloon tires.<ref>{{cite book |title=Model T Ford Service |publisher=Ford}}</ref> The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so {{convert|21|in|abbr=on}} (rim diameter) \u00d7 {{convert|4.5|in|abbr=on}} (tire width) wheels has about the same outer diameter as 30 in (76&nbsp;cm) clincher tires. All tires in this time period used an [[inner tube]] to hold the pressurized air; [[tubeless tire]]s were not generally in use until much later.\n\n[[Wheelbase]] was 100&nbsp;inches (254&nbsp;cm) and standard track width was 56 inch (142&nbsp;cm); 60 inch (152&nbsp;cm) track could be obtained on special order, \"for Southern roads\", identical to [[Track gauge in the United States#5ft|the pre-Civil War track gauge]] for many railroads in the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The standard 56 inch track being very near the standard {{frac|4 foot 8|1|2}} inch railroad track gauge meant that Model Ts could be and frequently were, fitted with flanged wheels and used as railway vehicles; the availability of a 60in (5ft) version meant the same could be done on the few remaining Southern 5ft railways (these being the only nonstandard lines remaining, except for a few narrow-gauge lines of various sizes).  Although a Model T could be adapted to run on track as narrow as 2ft gauge (Wiscasset, Waterville and Farmington RR, Maine has one), this was a more complex alteration.\n\n===Colors===\nBy 1918, half of all the cars in the U.S. were Model Ts. In his autobiography, Ford reports that in 1909 he told his management team, \"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.\"<!-- DO NOT TRY TO COPY EDIT THIS QUOTE; IT IS ALREADY *VERBATIM* AND ALREADY ACCEPTABLY WRITTEN. --><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|p=72}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, in the first years of production from 1908 to 1913, the Model T was not available in black<ref name=\"McCalley 1994\">{{Harvnb|McCalley|1994}}.</ref> but rather only gray, green, blue, and red.  Green was available for the touring cars, town cars, coupes, and Landaulets. Gray was only available for the town cars, and red only for the touring cars. By 1912, all cars were being painted midnight blue with black fenders. Only in 1914 was the \"any color so long as it is black\" policy finally implemented. It is often stated Ford suggested the use of black from 1914 to 1926 due to the low cost, durability, and faster drying time of black paint in that era. Paint choices in the American automotive industry, as well as in others (including locomotives, furniture, bicycles, and the rapidly expanding field of electrical appliances), were shaped by the development of the [[chemical industry]]. These included the disruption of dye sources during [[World War I]] and the advent, in the mid-1920s, of new [[Lacquer#Nitrocellulose lacquers|nitrocellulose lacquer]]s that were faster-drying and more scratch-resistant, and obviated the need for multiple coats;<ref name=\"Dutton_1942\">{{Harvnb|Dutton|1942}}.</ref>{{rp|261\u2013301}} understanding the choice of paints for the Model T era and the years immediately following requires an understanding of the contemporary chemical industry.<ref name=\"Dutton_1942\"/>\n\nDuring the lifetime production of the Model T, over 30 types of black paint were used on various parts of the car.<ref name=\"McCalley 1994\"/> These were formulated to satisfy the different means of applying the paint to the various parts, and had distinct drying times, depending on the part, paint, and method of drying.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:1910Ford-T.jpg|thumb|1910 Model T, photographed in [[Salt Lake City]]]]\n[[File:Ford_T_1917.jpg|thumb|1917 Model T]]\n[[File:Ford Speedster T.JPG|thumb|T Speedster]]\n[[File:1925.ford.model.t.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|1925 Ford \"New Model\" T Tudor Sedan]]\nAlthough Ford classified the Model T with a single letter designation throughout its entire life and made no distinction by model years, enough significant changes to the body were made over the production life that the car may be classified into several style generations.  Among the most immediately visible and identifiable changes were in the hood and cowl areas, although many other modifications were made to the vehicle.\n* 1909\u20131914 \u2013 Characterized by a nearly straight, five-sided hood, with a flat top containing a center hinge and two side sloping sections containing the folding hinges. The firewall was flat from the windshield down with no distinct cowl.\n* 1915\u20131916 \u2013 The hood design was nearly the same five-sided design with the only obvious change being the addition of louvers to the vertical sides.  A significant change to the cowl area occurred with the windshield relocated significantly behind the firewall and joined with a compound-contoured cowl panel.\n* 1917\u20131923 \u2013 The hood design was changed to a tapered design with a curved top. The folding hinges were now located at the joint between the flat sides and the curved top. This is sometime referred to as the \"low hood\" to distinguish it from the later hoods. The back edge of the hood now met the front edge of the cowl panel so that no part of the flat firewall was visible outside of the hood.  This design was used the longest and during the highest production years, accounting for about half of the total number of Model Ts built.\n* 1923\u20131925 \u2013 This change was made during the 1923 calendar year, so models built earlier in the year have the older design, while later vehicles have the newer design.  The taper of the hood was increased and the rear section at the firewall is about an inch taller and several inches wider than the previous design.  While this is a relatively minor change, the parts between the third and fourth generations are not interchangeable.\n* 1926\u20131927 \u2013 This design change made the greatest difference in the appearance of the car.  The hood was again enlarged, with the cowl panel no longer a compound curve and blended much more with the line of the hood.  The distance between the firewall and the windshield was also increased significantly.  This style is sometimes referred to as the \"high hood\".\n\nThe styling on the last \"generation\" was a preview for the following Model A, but the two models are visually quite different, as the body on the A was much wider and had curved doors as opposed to the flat doors on the T.\n\n===Diverse applications===\n[[File:Model T tractor.png|thumb|A Model T [[Doodlebug tractor|homemade tractor]] pulling a plow]]\n[[File:Pullford auto-to-tractor conversion advert 1918.png|thumb|Pullford auto-to-tractor conversion advertisement, 1918]]\n[[File:Ford-American LaFrance 1919 Model-T firefighting vehicle.jpg|thumb|The American LaFrance company modified more than 900 Ford Model T's to serve firefighters.]]\nWhen the Model T was designed and introduced, the infrastructure of the world was quite different from today's. Pavement was a rarity except for sidewalks and a few big-city streets. (The sense of the term \"pavement\" as equivalent with \"sidewalk\" comes from that era, when streets and roads were generally dirt and sidewalks were a paved way to walk along them.) Agriculture was the occupation of many people. [[Power tool]]s were scarce outside factories, as were power sources for them; electrification, like pavement, was found usually only in larger towns. [[Rural electrification]] and motorized [[mechanization]] were embryonic in some regions and nonexistent in most. Henry Ford oversaw the requirements and design of the Model T based on contemporary realities. Consequently, the Model T was (intentionally) almost as much a tractor and [[portable engine]] as it was an automobile. It has always been well regarded for its all-terrain abilities and ruggedness. It could travel a rocky, muddy farm lane, cross a shallow stream, climb a steep hill, and be parked on the other side to have one of its wheels removed and a pulley fastened to the hub for a [[flat belt]] to drive a [[bucksaw]], [[threshing machine|thresher]], silo blower, conveyor for filling [[corn crib]]s or haylofts, [[baler]], water pump, electrical generator, and many other applications. One unique application of the Model T was shown in the October 1922 issue of ''Fordson Farmer'' magazine. It showed a minister who had transformed his Model T into a mobile church, complete with small organ.<ref>{{cite book|last=Casey|first=Robert|title=The Model T A Centennial History|url=https://archive.org/details/modeltcentennial0000case|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-8850-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/modeltcentennial0000case/page/148 148]}}</ref>\n\nDuring this era, entire automobiles (including thousands of Model Ts) were even hacked apart by their owners and reconfigured into custom machinery permanently dedicated to a purpose, such as [[Doodlebug tractor|homemade tractors]] and ice saws.<ref>{{cite web |title=1926 Ford Model T Ice Saw |url=http://owlshead.org/collections/detail/1926-ford-t-ice-saw |accessdate=2012-12-24 |publisher=Owl's Head Transportation Museum}} Used for harvesting winter ice from ponds in [[Maine]].</ref> Dozens of [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] companies sold [[prefabrication|prefab]] kits to facilitate the T's conversion from car to tractor.<ref name=\"PrippsMorland1993p28\">{{Harvnb|Pripps|Morland|1993|p=28}}.</ref> The Model T had been around for a decade before the [[Fordson tractor]] became available (1917\u201318), and many Ts had been converted for field use. (For example, [[Harry Ferguson]], later famous for his hitches and tractors, worked on Eros Model T tractor conversions before he worked with Fordsons and others.) During the next decade, Model T tractor conversion kits were harder to sell, as the Fordson and then the [[Farmall]] (1924), as well as other light and affordable tractors, served the farm market. But during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] (1930s), Model T tractor conversion kits had a resurgence, because by then used Model Ts and junkyard parts for them were plentiful and cheap.<ref name=\"Leffingwell2002pp43-51\">{{Harvnb|Leffingwell|2002|pp=43\u201351}}.</ref>\n\nLike many popular car engines of the era, the Model T engine was also used on home-built aircraft (such as the [[Pietenpol Sky Scout]]) and [[motorboat]]s.\n\nAn [[armored car (military)|armored-car]] variant (called the [[Ford FT-B|FT-B]]) was developed in Poland in 1920 due to the high demand during the [[Polish-Soviet war]] in 1920.\n\nMany Model Ts were converted into vehicles which could travel across heavy snows with kits on the rear wheels (sometimes with an extra pair of rear-mounted wheels and two sets of [[continuous track]] to mount on the now-tandemed rear wheels, essentially making it a [[half-track]]) and skis replacing the front wheels. They were popular for rural mail delivery for a time.  The common name for these conversions of cars and small trucks was \"snowflyers\". These vehicles were extremely popular in the northern reaches of Canada, where factories were set up to produce them.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA878 |title=Snowflyers Replace Dogs in Frozen North |work=Popular Mechanics |issue=December |year=1934 |page=878 |accessdate=2012-12-24}}</ref>\n\nA number of companies built Model T\u2013based [[railcar]]s.<ref name=mtfca_Model_T_railcar>{{cite web |publisher=Model T Ford Club of America |year=2011 |title=Model T Ford Forum: Forum 2011: Old Photo \u2013 Model T Rail Car |url=http://www.mtfca.com/discus/messages/179374/185052.html?1296125299 |postscript=.}}</ref> In ''[[The Great Railway Bazaar]]'', Paul Theroux mentions a rail journey in India on such a railcar.

When introduced, the T used the building methods typical at the time, assembly by hand, and production was small. The [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]] could not keep up with demand for the Model T, and only 11 cars were built there during the first full month of production. More and more machines were used to reduce the complexity within the 84 defined areas. In 1910, after assembling nearly 12,000 Model Ts, Henry Ford moved the company to the new [[Highland Park Ford Plant|Highland Park complex]]. During this time the Model T production system ([[Vertical integration|including the]] [[supply chain]]) transitioned into an iconic example of assembly line production.<ref name=\"hounshell-1984\"/><ref name=Abernathy/> In subsequent decades it would also come to be viewed as the classic example of the rigid, first-generation version of assembly line production, as opposed to flexible mass production<ref name=\"hounshell-1984\"/> of higher quality products.<ref name=Abernathy>{{cite web |last1=Abernathy |first1=William J. |last2=Wayne |first2=Kenneth |title=Limits of the Learning Curve |url=https://hbr.org/1974/09/limits-of-the-learning-curve |website=[[Harvard Business Review]] |date=1 September 1974 |quote=Ford\u2019s objective was to reduce the price of the automobile and thereby increase volume and market share. <br> \"Ford\u2019s long devotion to the experience-curve strategy made the transition to another strategy difficult and very costly\" (going from reducing Model T cost to increasing Model A price) \"From the time it introduced the Model A, Ford was compelled to compete on the basis of product quality and performance \u2014 a strategy in which it was not skilled\" <br> The rate of capital investment showed substantial increases after 1913, rising from 11 cents per sales dollar that year to 22 cents by 1921.

These facilities even included coal mines, rubber plantations, and forestry operations (to provide wooden car parts).

Almost 170,000 were built after car production stopped, as replacement engines were required to service already produced vehicles. Racers and enthusiasts, forerunners of modern hot rodders, used the Model T's block to build popular and cheap racing engines, including [[Cragar]], [[Navarro (hot rodder)|Navarro]], and famously the [[Frontenac (racing car)|Frontenacs]] (\"Fronty Fords\")<ref name=nac/> of the [[Chevrolet]] brothers, among many others.\n\nThe Model T employed some advanced technology, for example, its use of [[vanadium steel]] alloy. Its durability was phenomenal, and some Model Ts and their parts are in running order over a century later. Although Henry Ford resisted some kinds of change, he always championed the advancement of [[materials engineering]], and often mechanical engineering and industrial engineering.\n\nIn 2002, Ford built a final batch of six Model Ts as part of their 2003 centenary celebrations. These cars were assembled from remaining new components and other parts produced from the original drawings. The last of the six was used for publicity purposes in the UK.\n\nAlthough Ford no longer manufactures parts for the Model T, many parts are still manufactured through [[Privately held company|private companies]] as replicas to service the thousands of Model Ts still in operation today.\n\nOn May 26, 1927, Henry Ford and his son Edsel drove the 15-millionth Model T out of the factory.<ref name=15million/> This marked the famous automobile's official last day of production at the main factory.\n\n===Price and production===\n[[File: Phoenix-Phoenix Police Museum-1919 Ford Model TPolice Cruiser.jpg |300px|thumb|1919 Ford Model T Phoenix Police Cruiser]]\n{{external media\n| image1=[https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/hbr/7409/74501_A.gif Ford Model T price/volume curve, 1909-1923]\n}}\n\nThe moving assembly line system, which started on October 7, 1913, allowed Ford to reduce the price of his cars.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/ford-assembly-line-turns-100-changed-society-article-1.1478331 |title=Ford's Assembly Line Turns 100: How It Changed Manufacturing and Society |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=2013-10-07 |access-date=2017-08-27 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131130021237/http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/ford-assembly-line-turns-100-changed-society-article-1.1478331 |archive-date=2013-11-30}}</ref> As he continued to fine-tune the system, Ford was able to keep reducing costs significantly.<ref name=imf>{{cite web|url= https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2017/05/22/Riding-the-Energy-Transition-Oil-Beyond-2040-44932 |title=Riding the Energy Transition : Oil Beyond 2040 |first1=Reda |last1=Cherif |first2=Fuad |last2=Hasanov |first3=Aditya |last3=Pande |publisher= [[International Monetary Fund]] |date=2017-05-22 |accessdate=2017-10-07 |page=13 |quote=Vehicle adoption is strongly associated with the ability to offer an affordable price.

Originally named Ford Charcoal, the name was changed to [[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford Charcoal]] after the Iron Mountain Ford Plant closed in 1951 and the Kingsford Chemical Company was formed and continued the wood distillation process. E. G.

Scrap wood was distilled at the Iron Mountain plant for its wood chemicals, with the end by product being lump charcoal. This lump charcoal was modified and pressed into briquettes and mass marketed by Ford.<ref name=\"Chronicle\">{{cite journal|last1=Forstrom|first1=Guy|title=The Burning History of the Charcoal Briquette|journal=Historical Society of Michigan|date=Summer 2017|volume=40|issue=2|pages=13\u201315}}</ref>\n\n===First global car===\n[[File:Ford factory LaBoca.jpg|thumb|right|The first Ford assembly plant in [[La Boca, Buenos Aires]], c. 1921]]\n[[File:Feature.

This Convention was a result of three years of meeting and negotiating, after which the text of the Convention was approved by delegates representing close to 140 countries on 19 January 2013 in Geneva and adopted and signed later that year on 10 October 2013 at a Diplomatic Conference held in Kumamoto, Japan. The Convention is named after the Japanese city [[Minamata]]. This naming is of symbolic importance as the city went through a [[Minamata disease|devastating incident]] of mercury poisoning. It is expected that over the next few decades, this international agreement will enhance the reduction of mercury pollution from the targeted activities responsible for the major release of mercury to the immediate environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Marianne|title=Minamata Convention on Mercury|url=http://www2.epa.gov/international-cooperation/minamata-convention-mercury|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe objective of the Minamata Convention is to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. It contains, in support of this objective, provisions that relate to the entire life cycle of mercury, including controls and reductions across a range of products, processes and industries where mercury is used, released or emitted. The treaty also addresses the direct mining of mercury, its export and import, its safe storage and its disposal once as waste. Pinpointing populations at risk, boosting medical care and better training of health-care professionals in identifying and treating mercury-related effects will also result from implementing the Convention.\n\nThe Minamata Convention provides controls over a myriad of products containing mercury, the manufacture, import and export of which will be altogether prohibited by 2020,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/minamata-convention-agreed-nations|title=Minamata Convention Agreed by Nations|date=19 January 2013|access-date=5 January 2020|publisher=UNEP}}</ref> except where countries have requested an exemption for an initial 5-year period. These products include certain types of batteries, compact fluorescent lamps, relays, soaps and cosmetics, thermometers, and blood pressure devices. Dental fillings which use mercury [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] are also regulated under the Convention, and their use must be phased down through a number of measures.\n\n== Background on mercury ==\n[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a naturally occurring element. It can be released to the environment from natural sources \u2013 such as weathering of mercury-containing rocks, forest fires, volcanic eruptions or geothermal activities \u2013 but also from human activities. An estimated 5500-8900 tons of mercury is currently emitted and re-emitted each year to the atmosphere, with much of the re-emitted mercury considered to be related to human activity, as are the direct releases.\n\nDue to its unique properties, mercury has been used in various products and processes for hundreds of years. Currently, it is mostly utilised in industrial processes that produce chlorine (mercury chlor-alkali plants) or vinyl chloride monomer for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production, and polyurethane elastomers. It is extensively used to extract gold from ore in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. It is contained in products such as electrical switches (including thermostats), relays, measuring and control equipment, energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs, batteries and dental amalgam. It is also used in laboratories, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, including in vaccines as a preservative, paints, and jewellery. Mercury is also released unintentionally from some industrial processes, such as coal-fired power and heat generation, cement production, mining and other metallurgic activities such as non-ferrous metals production, as well as from incineration of many types of waste.<ref>UNEP, 2013.

UNEP Chemicals Branch, Geneva, Switzerland</ref>\n\n== History of the negotiations ==\n[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] and mercury compounds have long been known to be toxic to human health and the environment. Large-scale public health crises due to mercury poisoning, such as [[Minamata disease]] and [[Niigata Minamata disease]], drew attention to the issue. In 1972, delegates to the [[Stockholm Conference]] on the Human Environment witnessed Japanese junior high school student Shinobu Sakamoto, disabled as the result of methylmercury poisoning ''in utero''. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UN Environment, previously UNEP) was established shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite news\n |last        = Tanaka\n |first       = Hisatoshi\n |title       = Minamata disease sufferer pins hope on mercury ban treaty\n |newspaper   = The Asahi Shimbun\n |location    = Tokyo, Japan\n |publisher   = The Asahi Shimbun Company\n |date        = 9 October 2013\n |url         = http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201310090066\n |accessdate  = 10 October 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610220054/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201310090066\n |archivedate = 10 June 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> UN Environment has been actively engaged in bringing the science of mercury poisoning to policy implementation. In 2001, the Executive Director of UN Environment was invited by its Governing Council to undertake a global assessment of mercury and its compounds, including the chemistry and health effects, sources, long-range transport, as well as prevention and control technologies relating to mercury.\n\nIn 2003, the Governing Council considered this assessment and found that there was sufficient evidence of significant global adverse impacts from mercury and its compounds to warrant further international action to reduce the risks to human health and the environment from their release to the environment. Governments were urged to adopt goals for the reduction of mercury emissions and releases and UN Environment initiated technical assistance and capacity-building activities to meet these goals.\n\nA mercury programme to address the concerns posed by mercury was established and further strengthened by governments in 2005 and 2007 with the UNEP Global Mercury Partnership. In 2007, the Governing Council concluded that the options of enhanced voluntary measures and new or existing international legal instruments should be reviewed and assessed in order to make progress in addressing the mercury issue. In February 2009, the Governing Council of UNEP decided to develop a global legally binding instrument on mercury.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Mandate\n | publisher = United Nations Environment Programme\n | url = http://www.unep.org/hazardoussubstances/Mercury/Negotiations/Mandates/tabid/3321/Default.aspx\n | accessdate = 10 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\nAn intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) was promptly established, through which countries negotiated and developed the text of the convention.

and 5 Annexes, preceded by a Preamble.\n\nThe preamble of the Convention states that the Parties have recognized that mercury is, \"a chemical of global concern owing to its long-range atmospheric transport, its persistence in the environment once anthropogenically introduced, its ability to bioaccumulate in ecosystems and its significant negative effects on human health and the environment.\"<ref name=\"Minamata Convention on mercury\">{{cite web|title=Minamata Convention on mercury|url=http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Portals/11/documents/conventionText/Minamata%20Convention%20on%20Mercury_e.pdf|website=Mercury Convention|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> It further refers to previous relevant decisions including of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme as well as to the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \"the future we want\". The preamble recalls the lessons of the Minamata disease, in particular the serious safety and environmental effects resulting from mercury pollution and the need to ensure proper management of mercury and the prevention of such events in the future.\n\nThe importance of financial, technical, and technological and capacity building support, particularly for developing countries and countries with economies in transition to strengthen national capabilities for the management of mercury and order to promote the proper implementation of the Convention is stressed. The preamble also recognizes the activities of the World Health Organization in the protection of human health related to mercury as well as the roles of relevant multilateral environmental agreements, recognizing that the Convention and other international agreements in the field of environment and trade are mutually supportive.<ref name=\"Minamata Convention on mercury\" />\n\n=== Article 1 ===\n\n*States the objective of the Convention, which is \"to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds\".\n\n=== Article 2 ===\n* Sets out definitions used in more than one Article of the Convention, including:\n* \"Artisanal and small-scale gold mining\" which refers to gold mining conducted by individual miners or small enterprises with limited capital investment and production;\n* \"Best available techniques\";\n* \"Best environmental practices\" means using the most appropriate combination of environmental control measures and strategies;\n* \"Mercury\" specifically refers to elemental mercury (Hg), CAS No. 7439-97-6;\n* \"Mercury compound\";\n* \"Mercury-added product\" refers to a product or product component that contains mercury or a mercury compound that was intentionally added;\n* \"Party\" and \"Parties present and voting\";\n* \"Primary mercury mining\";\n* \"Regional economic integration organization\";\n* \"Use allowed\".\n\n===Article 3===\n* Addresses the question of mercury supply sources and trade.\n* The provisions of this Article do not apply to mercury compounds used for laboratory research, naturally occurring trace quantities of mercury or mercury compounds present, mercury-added products.\n* It prohibits parties to allow mercury mining that was not being conducted prior to the date of entry into force of the Convention for them, and it only allows mercury mining that was conducted at the date of entry into force for up to fifteen years after that date.\n* It encourages countries to identify individual stocks of mercury or mercury compounds exceeding 50 metric tons as well as     sources of mercury supply generating stocks exceeding 10 metric tons per year. If excess mercury from the decommissioning of chlor alkali facilities is available, such mercury is disposed of in accordance with the guidelines for environmentally sound management using operations that do not lead to recovery, recycling, reclamation, direct re-use or     alternative uses.\n* Parties are not allowed to export mercury without the written consent of the importing Party and only for either environmentally sound interim storage or a use allowed. These controls only apply to mercury, not to either mercury compounds or mercury-added products.\n\n===Article 4===\n\n*Addresses the question of Mercury-added products. \n*The Convention employs two approaches to controlling mercury in products, namely setting a phase-out date for some, and specifying measures to be taken in allowing continued use for others.\n\n===Article 5===\n* Deals with manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are used.\n* Sets out measures either to phase out or to restrict such existing processes.\n* It also does not allow the development of new facilities that would use manufacturing processes listed in Annex B and discourages the development of new manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are intentionally used.\n\n===Article 6===\n* Relates to exemptions available to a Party upon request.\n* A State or regional economic integration organization can register for one or more exemptions from the phase out dates listed in Parts I of Annexes A and B.\n* They do so on becoming a Party, or in the case of a product or process that is added by amendment to the list, no later than the date upon which that amendment enters into force for it.\n* Exemptions can be registered for a listed category or an identified sub-category.\n* The registration is made by notifying the Secretariat in writing, and must be accompanied by a statement explaining the Party's need for the exemption.\n\n===Article 7===\n* Deals with the question of artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in which mercury amalgamation is used to extract gold from ore.\n* Each Party that has small-scale gold mining and processing within its territory has the general obligation to take steps to reduce the use of mercury and mercury compounds in such mining and processing needs to reduce, and where feasible eliminate, the use of mercury and mercury compounds in mining and processing, as well as the emissions and releases to the environment of mercury from such activities.\n* Additional obligations, including the development and implementation of a national action plan, are laid out for a Party that determines that artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in its territory is more than insignificant.\n\n===Article 8===\n* Concerns emissions of mercury and mercury compounds.\n* It aims at controlling and, where feasible, reducing emissions of mercury and mercury compounds to the atmosphere, through measures to control emissions from the point sources listed in Annex D.\n* The Article differentiates between measures required for new sources and those required for existing sources. Releases to land and water are not addressed in Article 8 \u2013 they are addressed in Article 9 of the Convention.\n\n===Article 9===\n* Addresses the releases of mercury and mercury compounds to land and water\n* Aims at controlling and where feasible reducing releases of mercury and mercury compounds from significant anthropogenic point sources that are not addressed in other provisions of the Convention.\n* Each state should within three years after of date of entry into force of the Convention identify the relevant point source categories of releases of mercury into land and water.\n\n===Article 10===\n* Applies to the environmentally sound interim storage of mercury other than waste mercury.\n* Parties are requested to take measures to ensure that mercury and mercury compounds that are intended for a use allowed under the Convention are stored in an environmentally sound manner, taking into account any guidelines and in accordance with any requirements that the Conference of Parties adopts.\n\n===Article 11===\n* Deals with mercury wastes, including their definition, their management in an environmentally sound manner and transportation across international boundaries''.''\n\n===Article 12===\n* Deals with contaminated sites.\n* Each state needs to endeavour to develop appropriate strategies for identifying and assessing sites contaminated by mercury or mercury compounds.\n* When taking action to reduce the risks posed by sites contaminated by mercury or mercury compounds, each Party is required to ensure that actions are performed in an environmentally sound manner, and actions incorporate, where appropriate, an assessment of the risks to human health and the environment from mercury or mercury compounds contained in these sites.\n\n===Article 13===\n* Relates to the question of financial resources and mechanism.\n* Establishes a mechanism for the provision of adequate, predictable and timely financial resources, comprising the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund and a specific international programme to support capacity building and technical assistance.\n\n===Article 14===\n* Addresses the issues of capacity-building, technical assistance and technology transfer.\n* Calls for cooperation between Parties to provide timely and appropriate capacity-building and technical assistance to developing country Parties, including through regional, sub regional and national arrangements.\n\n===Article 15===\n* Establishes an Implementation and Compliance Committee to promote implementation of, and compliance with, all provisions of this Convention.\n* The Committee comprises 15 members nominated by Parties and elected by the Conference of the Parties.\n* Issues can be taken up by the Committee on self-referral by a Party, on the basis of information submitted under the reporting provisions, or upon request from the Conference of the Parties.\n\n===Article 16===\n* Relates to health aspects.\n* It encourages Parties to promote the development and implementation of strategies and programmes to identify and protect populations at risk It encourages Parties to adopt and implement science based educational and preventive programmes on occupational exposure to mercury and mercury compounds.\n* It encourages Parties to promote appropriate health-care services for prevention,

This Convention was a result of three years of meeting and negotiating, after which the text of the Convention was approved by delegates representing close to 140 countries on 19 January 2013 in Geneva and adopted and signed later that year on 10 October 2013 at a Diplomatic Conference held in Kumamoto, Japan. The Convention is named after the Japanese city [[Minamata]]. This naming is of symbolic importance as the city went through a [[Minamata disease|devastating incident]] of mercury poisoning. It is expected that over the next few decades, this international agreement will enhance the reduction of mercury pollution from the targeted activities responsible for the major release of mercury to the immediate environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Marianne|title=Minamata Convention on Mercury|url=http://www2.epa.gov/international-cooperation/minamata-convention-mercury|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe objective of the Minamata Convention is to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. It contains, in support of this objective, provisions that relate to the entire life cycle of mercury, including controls and reductions across a range of products, processes and industries where mercury is used, released or emitted. The treaty also addresses the direct mining of mercury, its export and import, its safe storage and its disposal once as waste. Pinpointing populations at risk, boosting medical care and better training of health-care professionals in identifying and treating mercury-related effects will also result from implementing the Convention.\n\nThe Minamata Convention provides controls over a myriad of products containing mercury, the manufacture, import and export of which will be altogether prohibited by 2020,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/minamata-convention-agreed-nations|title=Minamata Convention Agreed by Nations|date=19 January 2013|access-date=5 January 2020|publisher=UNEP}}</ref> except where countries have requested an exemption for an initial 5-year period. These products include certain types of batteries, compact fluorescent lamps, relays, soaps and cosmetics, thermometers, and blood pressure devices. Dental fillings which use mercury [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] are also regulated under the Convention, and their use must be phased down through a number of measures.\n\n== Background on mercury ==\n[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a naturally occurring element. It can be released to the environment from natural sources \u2013 such as weathering of mercury-containing rocks, forest fires, volcanic eruptions or geothermal activities \u2013 but also from human activities. An estimated 5500-8900 tons of mercury is currently emitted and re-emitted each year to the atmosphere, with much of the re-emitted mercury considered to be related to human activity, as are the direct releases.\n\nDue to its unique properties, mercury has been used in various products and processes for hundreds of years. Currently, it is mostly utilised in industrial processes that produce chlorine (mercury chlor-alkali plants) or vinyl chloride monomer for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production, and polyurethane elastomers. It is extensively used to extract gold from ore in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. It is contained in products such as electrical switches (including thermostats), relays, measuring and control equipment, energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs, batteries and dental amalgam. It is also used in laboratories, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, including in vaccines as a preservative, paints, and jewellery. Mercury is also released unintentionally from some industrial processes, such as coal-fired power and heat generation, cement production, mining and other metallurgic activities such as non-ferrous metals production, as well as from incineration of many types of waste.<ref>UNEP, 2013.

UNEP Chemicals Branch, Geneva, Switzerland</ref>\n\n== History of the negotiations ==\n[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] and mercury compounds have long been known to be toxic to human health and the environment. Large-scale public health crises due to mercury poisoning, such as [[Minamata disease]] and [[Niigata Minamata disease]], drew attention to the issue. In 1972, delegates to the [[Stockholm Conference]] on the Human Environment witnessed Japanese junior high school student Shinobu Sakamoto, disabled as the result of methylmercury poisoning ''in utero''. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UN Environment, previously UNEP) was established shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite news\n |last        = Tanaka\n |first       = Hisatoshi\n |title       = Minamata disease sufferer pins hope on mercury ban treaty\n |newspaper   = The Asahi Shimbun\n |location    = Tokyo, Japan\n |publisher   = The Asahi Shimbun Company\n |date        = 9 October 2013\n |url         = http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201310090066\n |accessdate  = 10 October 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610220054/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201310090066\n |archivedate = 10 June 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> UN Environment has been actively engaged in bringing the science of mercury poisoning to policy implementation. In 2001, the Executive Director of UN Environment was invited by its Governing Council to undertake a global assessment of mercury and its compounds, including the chemistry and health effects, sources, long-range transport, as well as prevention and control technologies relating to mercury.\n\nIn 2003, the Governing Council considered this assessment and found that there was sufficient evidence of significant global adverse impacts from mercury and its compounds to warrant further international action to reduce the risks to human health and the environment from their release to the environment. Governments were urged to adopt goals for the reduction of mercury emissions and releases and UN Environment initiated technical assistance and capacity-building activities to meet these goals.\n\nA mercury programme to address the concerns posed by mercury was established and further strengthened by governments in 2005 and 2007 with the UNEP Global Mercury Partnership. In 2007, the Governing Council concluded that the options of enhanced voluntary measures and new or existing international legal instruments should be reviewed and assessed in order to make progress in addressing the mercury issue. In February 2009, the Governing Council of UNEP decided to develop a global legally binding instrument on mercury.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Mandate\n | publisher = United Nations Environment Programme\n | url = http://www.unep.org/hazardoussubstances/Mercury/Negotiations/Mandates/tabid/3321/Default.aspx\n | accessdate = 10 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\nAn intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) was promptly established, through which countries negotiated and developed the text of the convention.

and 5 Annexes, preceded by a Preamble.\n\nThe preamble of the Convention states that the Parties have recognized that mercury is, \"a chemical of global concern owing to its long-range atmospheric transport, its persistence in the environment once anthropogenically introduced, its ability to bioaccumulate in ecosystems and its significant negative effects on human health and the environment.\"<ref name=\"Minamata Convention on mercury\">{{cite web|title=Minamata Convention on mercury|url=http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Portals/11/documents/conventionText/Minamata%20Convention%20on%20Mercury_e.pdf|website=Mercury Convention|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> It further refers to previous relevant decisions including of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme as well as to the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \"the future we want\". The preamble recalls the lessons of the Minamata disease, in particular the serious safety and environmental effects resulting from mercury pollution and the need to ensure proper management of mercury and the prevention of such events in the future.\n\nThe importance of financial, technical, and technological and capacity building support, particularly for developing countries and countries with economies in transition to strengthen national capabilities for the management of mercury and order to promote the proper implementation of the Convention is stressed. The preamble also recognizes the activities of the World Health Organization in the protection of human health related to mercury as well as the roles of relevant multilateral environmental agreements, recognizing that the Convention and other international agreements in the field of environment and trade are mutually supportive.<ref name=\"Minamata Convention on mercury\" />\n\n=== Article 1 ===\n\n*States the objective of the Convention, which is \"to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds\".\n\n=== Article 2 ===\n* Sets out definitions used in more than one Article of the Convention, including:\n* \"Artisanal and small-scale gold mining\" which refers to gold mining conducted by individual miners or small enterprises with limited capital investment and production;\n* \"Best available techniques\";\n* \"Best environmental practices\" means using the most appropriate combination of environmental control measures and strategies;\n* \"Mercury\" specifically refers to elemental mercury (Hg), CAS No. 7439-97-6;\n* \"Mercury compound\";\n* \"Mercury-added product\" refers to a product or product component that contains mercury or a mercury compound that was intentionally added;\n* \"Party\" and \"Parties present and voting\";\n* \"Primary mercury mining\";\n* \"Regional economic integration organization\";\n* \"Use allowed\".\n\n===Article 3===\n* Addresses the question of mercury supply sources and trade.\n* The provisions of this Article do not apply to mercury compounds used for laboratory research, naturally occurring trace quantities of mercury or mercury compounds present, mercury-added products.\n* It prohibits parties to allow mercury mining that was not being conducted prior to the date of entry into force of the Convention for them, and it only allows mercury mining that was conducted at the date of entry into force for up to fifteen years after that date.\n* It encourages countries to identify individual stocks of mercury or mercury compounds exceeding 50 metric tons as well as     sources of mercury supply generating stocks exceeding 10 metric tons per year. If excess mercury from the decommissioning of chlor alkali facilities is available, such mercury is disposed of in accordance with the guidelines for environmentally sound management using operations that do not lead to recovery, recycling, reclamation, direct re-use or     alternative uses.\n* Parties are not allowed to export mercury without the written consent of the importing Party and only for either environmentally sound interim storage or a use allowed. These controls only apply to mercury, not to either mercury compounds or mercury-added products.\n\n===Article 4===\n\n*Addresses the question of Mercury-added products. \n*The Convention employs two approaches to controlling mercury in products, namely setting a phase-out date for some, and specifying measures to be taken in allowing continued use for others.\n\n===Article 5===\n* Deals with manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are used.\n* Sets out measures either to phase out or to restrict such existing processes.\n* It also does not allow the development of new facilities that would use manufacturing processes listed in Annex B and discourages the development of new manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are intentionally used.\n\n===Article 6===\n* Relates to exemptions available to a Party upon request.\n* A State or regional economic integration organization can register for one or more exemptions from the phase out dates listed in Parts I of Annexes A and B.\n* They do so on becoming a Party, or in the case of a product or process that is added by amendment to the list, no later than the date upon which that amendment enters into force for it.\n* Exemptions can be registered for a listed category or an identified sub-category.\n* The registration is made by notifying the Secretariat in writing, and must be accompanied by a statement explaining the Party's need for the exemption.\n\n===Article 7===\n* Deals with the question of artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in which mercury amalgamation is used to extract gold from ore.\n* Each Party that has small-scale gold mining and processing within its territory has the general obligation to take steps to reduce the use of mercury and mercury compounds in such mining and processing needs to reduce, and where feasible eliminate, the use of mercury and mercury compounds in mining and processing, as well as the emissions and releases to the environment of mercury from such activities.\n* Additional obligations, including the development and implementation of a national action plan, are laid out for a Party that determines that artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in its territory is more than insignificant.\n\n===Article 8===\n* Concerns emissions of mercury and mercury compounds.\n* It aims at controlling and, where feasible, reducing emissions of mercury and mercury compounds to the atmosphere, through measures to control emissions from the point sources listed in Annex D.\n* The Article differentiates between measures required for new sources and those required for existing sources. Releases to land and water are not addressed in Article 8 \u2013 they are addressed in Article 9 of the Convention.\n\n===Article 9===\n* Addresses the releases of mercury and mercury compounds to land and water\n* Aims at controlling and where feasible reducing releases of mercury and mercury compounds from significant anthropogenic point sources that are not addressed in other provisions of the Convention.\n* Each state should within three years after of date of entry into force of the Convention identify the relevant point source categories of releases of mercury into land and water.\n\n===Article 10===\n* Applies to the environmentally sound interim storage of mercury other than waste mercury.\n* Parties are requested to take measures to ensure that mercury and mercury compounds that are intended for a use allowed under the Convention are stored in an environmentally sound manner, taking into account any guidelines and in accordance with any requirements that the Conference of Parties adopts.\n\n===Article 11===\n* Deals with mercury wastes, including their definition, their management in an environmentally sound manner and transportation across international boundaries''.''\n\n===Article 12===\n* Deals with contaminated sites.\n* Each state needs to endeavour to develop appropriate strategies for identifying and assessing sites contaminated by mercury or mercury compounds.\n* When taking action to reduce the risks posed by sites contaminated by mercury or mercury compounds, each Party is required to ensure that actions are performed in an environmentally sound manner, and actions incorporate, where appropriate, an assessment of the risks to human health and the environment from mercury or mercury compounds contained in these sites.\n\n===Article 13===\n* Relates to the question of financial resources and mechanism.\n* Establishes a mechanism for the provision of adequate, predictable and timely financial resources, comprising the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund and a specific international programme to support capacity building and technical assistance.\n\n===Article 14===\n* Addresses the issues of capacity-building, technical assistance and technology transfer.\n* Calls for cooperation between Parties to provide timely and appropriate capacity-building and technical assistance to developing country Parties, including through regional, sub regional and national arrangements.\n\n===Article 15===\n* Establishes an Implementation and Compliance Committee to promote implementation of, and compliance with, all provisions of this Convention.\n* The Committee comprises 15 members nominated by Parties and elected by the Conference of the Parties.\n* Issues can be taken up by the Committee on self-referral by a Party, on the basis of information submitted under the reporting provisions, or upon request from the Conference of the Parties.\n\n===Article 16===\n* Relates to health aspects.\n* It encourages Parties to promote the development and implementation of strategies and programmes to identify and protect populations at risk It encourages Parties to adopt and implement science based educational and preventive programmes on occupational exposure to mercury and mercury compounds.\n* It encourages Parties to promote appropriate health-care services for prevention,
