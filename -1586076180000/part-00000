It enters the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]] via the [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge]] between [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and [[Clarksville, Indiana]]. The {{convert| 266.02 |mi|km|2}} of US&nbsp;31 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit. Some of the highway is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]]. Various sections are rural two-lane highway and urbanized four- or six-lane divided expressway. The northernmost community along the highway is [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] near the [[Michigan]] state line.\n\nUS&nbsp;31 was first designated as a US Highway in October 1926. A northern section (from Rochester to South Bend) and a far southern section (on old US&nbsp;31 W into Louisville on the K&I Bridge) of the highway originally served as part of the [[Dixie Highway]]. US&nbsp;31 was the Jackson Highway from Indianapolis to Seymour. US&nbsp;31 replaced the original State Road 1 (SR&nbsp;1) designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana State Road system. SR&nbsp;1 ran from Clarksville through [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] to South Bend and ended at the Michigan state line.\n\n==Route description==\nOnly the segment of US&nbsp;31 that is north of Indianapolis is included as a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] (NHS).<ref name=\"NHS Map of Indiana\">{{cite map |title = National Highway System: Indiana |date = December 2003 |author = [[Federal Highway Administration]] |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/maps/in/in_Indiana.pdf |format = PDF |scale = Scale not given |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref>  The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.<ref name=NHS>{{FHWA NHS |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref>  The highway is maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]] (INDOT) like all other U.S. Routes in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 3,690&nbsp;personal vehicles and 160&nbsp;commercial vehicles that used the highway daily near [[Memphis, Indiana|Memphis]]. The peak traffic volume was 168,770&nbsp;personal vehicles and 18,090&nbsp;commercial vehicles along the section of US&nbsp;31 concurrent with [[Interstate 465 in Indiana|Interstate 465]] (I\u2013465).<ref name=\"AADT\">{{cite web |url = http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/ |title = INDOT Traffic Zones |publisher = Indiana Department of Transportation |date = 2010 |accessdate = July 9, 2012 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110505203005/http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/ |archivedate = May 5, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Jeffersonville to Columbus===\nUS&nbsp;31 overlaps I-65 in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]], after crossing the [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge]] from Kentucky.  It then diverges as the access frontage lanes before splitting off north of Jeffersonville at [[Clarksville, Indiana|Clarksville]] and proceeding to [[Indianapolis]].  US&nbsp;31 was widened to two lanes in both directions for its length through Columbus in the early 2000s.\n\n===Columbus to Indianapolis===\nAt I-465 on the south side of Indianapolis, US&nbsp;31 is routed onto I-465 on the east side of the city. This is the closest approach the highway makes to downtown Indianapolis. Previously the northbound route of the highway through Indianapolis was on East Street, Madison Avenue, Delaware Street, North Street, and onto Meridian Street; southbound was on Meridian Street, North Street, Pennsylvania Street, Madison Avenue, and onto East Street.\n\n===Indianapolis to Michigan===\nUS&nbsp;31 exits I-465 (coincidentally at exit 31) in [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]], and continues northward as a [[freeway]] through [[Westfield, Indiana|Westfield]]. North of [[Indiana State Road 38|SR&nbsp;38]], it reverts to a [[divided highway]] until reaching the [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]] area, where it again becomes a full freeway to bypass that city to the east. North of the Kokomo area US&nbsp;31 again becomes a rural divided highway, which skirts [[Peru, Indiana|Peru]], [[Rochester, Indiana|Rochester]], and [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]]. At [[U.S. Route 30 in Indiana|US&nbsp;30]] east of Plymouth, US&nbsp;31 becomes a freeway again and remains so for the rest of its journey in the state. After bypassing [[Lakeville, Indiana|Lakeville]] to the east, US&nbsp;31 approaches [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]]. There the route converges with [[U.S. Route 20 in Indiana|US&nbsp;20]] ([[St. Joseph Valley Parkway]]) and proceeds west and then north to bypass South Bend. After US&nbsp;20 splits off to the west near [[South Bend International Airport|the South Bend Airport]], US&nbsp;31 has an interchange with the [[Indiana Toll Road]] ([[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]]/[[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]]) before proceeding north into [[Michigan]].\n\n==History==\nUS&nbsp;31 was signed into law by the Governor on March 7, 1917, as Main Market Highway&nbsp;1, and signs were installed on June 1 of that year.<ref name=\"Main Market Highways\">{{cite map |author = Indiana State Highway Commission |title = 1917 Indiana State Highway Map and State Highway Commission |year = 1917 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission }}</ref><ref name=\"INDOT 1917\">{{cite map |url = http://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/gm-web/imdb/inhwy1917.jpg |author = Indiana State Highway Commission  |title = Indiana Transportation Map |year = 1917 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref> The name was changed to State Road&nbsp;1 within a year when Indiana began the state road system.<ref name=\"INDOT 1917\" /><ref name=\"INDOT 1918\">{{cite map |author = Indiana State Highway Commission |title = Indiana Transportation Map |year = 1918 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission }}</ref> By 1924, most of the route was paved, leaving only from Columbus to Franklin and from Peru to Plymouth that was unpaved.<ref name=\"INDOT 1924\">{{cite map |url = http://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/gm-web/imdb/inhwy1924.pdf  |author = Indiana State Highway Commission |title = Indiana Transportation Map |year = 1924 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref> On October 1, 1926, US&nbsp;31 was designated along what was SR&nbsp;1 at the time.<ref name=\"increated\" />\n\nIn the late 2000s, INDOT began a process of converting US&nbsp;31 to [[Interstate Highway standards]] from [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] to [[Indianapolis]].

It enters the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]] via the [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge]] between [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and [[Clarksville, Indiana]]. The {{convert| 266.02 |mi|km|2}} of US&nbsp;31 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit. Some of the highway is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]]. Various sections are rural two-lane highway and urbanized four- or six-lane divided expressway. The northernmost community along the highway is [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] near the [[Michigan]] state line.\n\nUS&nbsp;31 was first designated as a US Highway in October 1926. A northern section (from Rochester to South Bend) and a far southern section (on old US&nbsp;31 W into Louisville on the K&I Bridge) of the highway originally served as part of the [[Dixie Highway]]. US&nbsp;31 was the Jackson Highway from Indianapolis to Seymour. US&nbsp;31 replaced the original State Road 1 (SR&nbsp;1) designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana State Road system. SR&nbsp;1 ran from Clarksville through [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] to South Bend and ended at the Michigan state line.\n\n==Route description==\nOnly the segment of US&nbsp;31 that is north of Indianapolis is included as a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] (NHS).<ref name=\"NHS Map of Indiana\">{{cite map |title = National Highway System: Indiana |date = December 2003 |author = [[Federal Highway Administration]] |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/maps/in/in_Indiana.pdf |format = PDF |scale = Scale not given |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref>  The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.<ref name=NHS>{{FHWA NHS |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref>  The highway is maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]] (INDOT) like all other U.S. Routes in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 3,690&nbsp;personal vehicles and 160&nbsp;commercial vehicles that used the highway daily near [[Memphis, Indiana|Memphis]]. The peak traffic volume was 168,770&nbsp;personal vehicles and 18,090&nbsp;commercial vehicles along the section of US&nbsp;31 concurrent with [[Interstate 465 in Indiana|Interstate 465]] (I\u2013465).<ref name=\"AADT\">{{cite web |url = http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/ |title = INDOT Traffic Zones |publisher = Indiana Department of Transportation |date = 2010 |accessdate = July 9, 2012 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110505203005/http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/ |archivedate = May 5, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Jeffersonville to Columbus===\nUS&nbsp;31 overlaps I-65 in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]], after crossing the [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge]] from Kentucky.  It then diverges as the access frontage lanes before splitting off north of Jeffersonville at [[Clarksville, Indiana|Clarksville]] and proceeding to [[Indianapolis]].  US&nbsp;31 was widened to two lanes in both directions for its length through Columbus in the early 2000s.\n\n===Columbus to Indianapolis===\nAt I-465 on the south side of Indianapolis, US&nbsp;31 is routed onto I-465 on the east side of the city. This is the closest approach the highway makes to downtown Indianapolis. Previously the northbound route of the highway through Indianapolis was on East Street, Madison Avenue, Delaware Street, North Street, and onto Meridian Street; southbound was on Meridian Street, North Street, Pennsylvania Street, Madison Avenue, and onto East Street.\n\n===Indianapolis to Michigan===\nUS&nbsp;31 exits I-465 (coincidentally at exit 31) in [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]], and continues northward as a [[freeway]] through [[Westfield, Indiana|Westfield]]. North of [[Indiana State Road 38|SR&nbsp;38]], it reverts to a [[divided highway]] until reaching the [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]] area, where it again becomes a full freeway to bypass that city to the east. North of the Kokomo area US&nbsp;31 again becomes a rural divided highway, which skirts [[Peru, Indiana|Peru]], [[Rochester, Indiana|Rochester]], and [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]]. At [[U.S. Route 30 in Indiana|US&nbsp;30]] east of Plymouth, US&nbsp;31 becomes a freeway again and remains so for the rest of its journey in the state. After bypassing [[Lakeville, Indiana|Lakeville]] to the east, US&nbsp;31 approaches [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]]. There the route converges with [[U.S. Route 20 in Indiana|US&nbsp;20]] ([[St. Joseph Valley Parkway]]) and proceeds west and then north to bypass South Bend. After US&nbsp;20 splits off to the west near [[South Bend International Airport|the South Bend Airport]], US&nbsp;31 has an interchange with the [[Indiana Toll Road]] ([[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]]/[[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]]) before proceeding north into [[Michigan]].\n\n==History==\nUS&nbsp;31 was signed into law by the Governor on March 7, 1917, as Main Market Highway&nbsp;1, and signs were installed on June 1 of that year.<ref name=\"Main Market Highways\">{{cite map |author = Indiana State Highway Commission |title = 1917 Indiana State Highway Map and State Highway Commission |year = 1917 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission }}</ref><ref name=\"INDOT 1917\">{{cite map |url = http://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/gm-web/imdb/inhwy1917.jpg |author = Indiana State Highway Commission  |title = Indiana Transportation Map |year = 1917 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref> The name was changed to State Road&nbsp;1 within a year when Indiana began the state road system.<ref name=\"INDOT 1917\" /><ref name=\"INDOT 1918\">{{cite map |author = Indiana State Highway Commission |title = Indiana Transportation Map |year = 1918 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission }}</ref> By 1924, most of the route was paved, leaving only from Columbus to Franklin and from Peru to Plymouth that was unpaved.<ref name=\"INDOT 1924\">{{cite map |url = http://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/gm-web/imdb/inhwy1924.pdf  |author = Indiana State Highway Commission |title = Indiana Transportation Map |year = 1924 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref> On October 1, 1926, US&nbsp;31 was designated along what was SR&nbsp;1 at the time.<ref name=\"increated\" />\n\nIn the late 2000s, INDOT began a process of converting US&nbsp;31 to [[Interstate Highway standards]] from [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] to [[Indianapolis]].

Since its meaning is \"crown\", it is interpreted as both the \"topmost\" of the Sephirot and the \"regal crown\" of the Sephirot. It is between [[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokhmah]] and [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] (with Chokhmah on the right and Binah in the left) and it sits above [[Tiferet (Kabbalah)|Tiferet]]. It is usually given three paths, to Chokhmah, Tiferet and Binah.\n\nKeter is so sublime, it is called in the [[Zohar]] \"the most hidden of all hidden things\", and is completely incomprehensible to man. It is also described as absolute compassion, and [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero]] describes it as the source of the [[Keter#13 Supernal Attributes of Mercy|13 Supernal Attributes of Mercy]].\n\nKeter is invisible and colorless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Theology/God/The_Middle_Ages/The_Kabbalists_on_God/The_Sefirot.shtml|work=Sefirot|publisher=My Jewish Learning|accessdate=5 December 2011 |title=Sefirot}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nAccording to the [[Bahir]]:\n\"What are the ten utterances? The first is supreme crown, blessed be His name and His people.\" <ref name=\"Arthur Green. Guide to the Zohar\">Arthur Green. Guide to the Zohar</ref>\n\nThe first Sephirah is called the Crown, since a crown is worn above the head. The Crown therefore refers to things that are above the mind's abilities of comprehension. All of the other Sephirot are likened to the body which starts with the head and winds its way down into action. But the crown of a king lies above the head and connects the concept of \"monarchy\", which is abstract and intangible, with the tangible and concrete head of the king.\n\nThis first Sefirah represents the primal stirrings of intent in the [[Ein Soph]], or the arousal of desire to come forth into the varied life of being.<ref name=\"Arthur Green. Guide to the Zohar\"/> But in this sense, although it contains all the potential for content, it contains no content itself, and is therefore called 'Nothing', 'The Hidden Light', 'The air that cannot be grasped'. Being desire to bring the world into being, Keter is absolute compassion.<ref>Rabbi Moshe Cordovero. The Palm Tree of Devorah</ref>\n\nThe [[Names of God in Judaism|name of God]] associated with Keter is [[Ehyeh asher ehyeh|Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh]] (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4), the name through which he revealed himself to Moses from the burning bush.<ref>Aryeh Kaplan. Meditation and Kabbalah</ref> \"It is from the name Ehyeh that all kinds of sustenance emanate, coming from the source, which is the infinite\".\n\nKeter, although being the highest Sephirah of its world, receives from the Sephirah of [[Malkuth]] of the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|domain]] above it (see [[Sephirot]]). The uppermost Keter sits below no other Sephirah, although it is below [[Ein Soph|Or Ein Soph]] which is the source of all Sephirot.\n\n==Qualities==\n\n===Ethical behaviour===\nMoses ben Jacob Cordovero, in ''The Palm Tree of Devorah'', discusses ethical behaviour that man should follow, related to the qualities of the Sephirot, in order that man might emulate his Creator. Humility is the first, because although Keter is the highest, it is ashamed to look at its cause, and instead gazes at those below it.<ref>Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, The Palm Tree of Devorah.</ref> One's thoughts should be pure, one's forehead should display no harshness, one's ears should always turn to hear good, one's eyes should distance themselves from noticing evil, always looking at the good, one's nose should be free from the breath of anger, one's face should always shine, and his mouth should express nothing except good.\n\n=== 13 Supernal Attributes of Mercy ===\n{{main article|Thirteen Attributes of Mercy}}\n\nThrough discussion of a line in the [[Michah]], 13 attributes are associated with the Sephirah Kether:\n\n<blockquote>Who is God like you, who pardons iniquity and forgives the transgressions of the remnant of his heritage? He does not maintain His anger forever, for He delights in kindness. He will again show us compassion, He will vanquish our iniquities, and You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. Show faithfulness to Ya'akov, kindness to Avraham, which You have sworn to our fathers from days of old. (''Michah'', 7:18-20)</blockquote>\n\nAccordingly, the 13 attributes are derived from this and are described in great detail.\n\nAdditionally, the \"Thirteen Attributes of Mercy\" were described by Rabbi Chizkiyah in an allegorical depiction of a lily among thorns. The metaphor in whole is known and taught as \"The lily amongst the thorns,\" a phrase found in [[Shir Hashirim]] 2:2. A summary:\n\n<blockquote>The secret of spiritual protection is revealed through a richly metaphorical discourse given by Rabbi Chizkiyah. The Rabbi explains that the spiritual forces that protect and watch over us are called the 13 Attributes of Mercy. They are transmitted into our physical world through the first 13 words of the Torah. When judgments are decreed against us, these 13 forces can safeguard us from their influence. We begin drawing this Light of protection to ourselves at the very moment we begin to browse and behold the mystical shapes and sequences of the Aramaic text, and to learn the spiritual insights presented there. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.kabbalah.com/k/index.php/p=zohar/zohar |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008211150/http://www2.kabbalah.com/k/index.php/p=zohar/zohar |archivedate=2011-10-08 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Non-Jewish practices ==\nIn ''The Mystical Qabalah'' [[Dion Fortune]] describes Keter as pure consciousness, beyond all categories, timeless, a point that crystallises out of the Ein Soph, and commences the process of emanation that ends in [[Malchut|Malkuth]].\n\nThe name of God given to it is [[I Am that I Am|Eheieh]], the [[archangel]] that presides over it is [[Metatron]], the order of [[angel]]s that resides in it are the Holy Living Creatures (the [[Chayot|Chaioth ha Qadesh]], Hebrew: \u05d7\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9), and its mundane [[chakra]] is said to be the First Swirlings of the cosmos ([[Primum Mobile]], Rashith ha Gilgalin).\n\n[[A.E. Waite]] made mention that Rabbi Azariel ben Menachem, a student of [[Isaac the Blind]], in his ''Commentary on the Sephiroth'' granted a particular colour to each Sephira, yet these do not agree with the colours given in the Zohar, where Kether (which, according to him, is also correlated to ''Yechidah'') is called colourless, Tiphareth purple, and Malkuth sapphire-blue.<ref>A.E.

Since its meaning is \"crown\", it is interpreted as both the \"topmost\" of the Sephirot and the \"regal crown\" of the Sephirot. It is between [[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokhmah]] and [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] (with Chokhmah on the right and Binah in the left) and it sits above [[Tiferet (Kabbalah)|Tiferet]]. It is usually given three paths, to Chokhmah, Tiferet and Binah.\n\nKeter is so sublime, it is called in the [[Zohar]] \"the most hidden of all hidden things\", and is completely incomprehensible to man. It is also described as absolute compassion, and [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero]] describes it as the source of the [[Keter#13 Supernal Attributes of Mercy|13 Supernal Attributes of Mercy]].\n\nKeter is invisible and colorless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Theology/God/The_Middle_Ages/The_Kabbalists_on_God/The_Sefirot.shtml|work=Sefirot|publisher=My Jewish Learning|accessdate=5 December 2011 |title=Sefirot}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nAccording to the [[Bahir]]:\n\"What are the ten utterances? The first is supreme crown, blessed be His name and His people.\" <ref name=\"Arthur Green. Guide to the Zohar\">Arthur Green. Guide to the Zohar</ref>\n\nThe first Sephirah is called the Crown, since a crown is worn above the head. The Crown therefore refers to things that are above the mind's abilities of comprehension. All of the other Sephirot are likened to the body which starts with the head and winds its way down into action. But the crown of a king lies above the head and connects the concept of \"monarchy\", which is abstract and intangible, with the tangible and concrete head of the king.\n\nThis first Sefirah represents the primal stirrings of intent in the [[Ein Soph]], or the arousal of desire to come forth into the varied life of being.<ref name=\"Arthur Green. Guide to the Zohar\"/> But in this sense, although it contains all the potential for content, it contains no content itself, and is therefore called 'Nothing', 'The Hidden Light', 'The air that cannot be grasped'. Being desire to bring the world into being, Keter is absolute compassion.<ref>Rabbi Moshe Cordovero. The Palm Tree of Devorah</ref>\n\nThe [[Names of God in Judaism|name of God]] associated with Keter is [[Ehyeh asher ehyeh|Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh]] (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4), the name through which he revealed himself to Moses from the burning bush.<ref>Aryeh Kaplan. Meditation and Kabbalah</ref> \"It is from the name Ehyeh that all kinds of sustenance emanate, coming from the source, which is the infinite\".\n\nKeter, although being the highest Sephirah of its world, receives from the Sephirah of [[Malkuth]] of the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|domain]] above it (see [[Sephirot]]). The uppermost Keter sits below no other Sephirah, although it is below [[Ein Soph|Or Ein Soph]] which is the source of all Sephirot.\n\n==Qualities==\n\n===Ethical behaviour===\nMoses ben Jacob Cordovero, in ''The Palm Tree of Devorah'', discusses ethical behaviour that man should follow, related to the qualities of the Sephirot, in order that man might emulate his Creator. Humility is the first, because although Keter is the highest, it is ashamed to look at its cause, and instead gazes at those below it.<ref>Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, The Palm Tree of Devorah.</ref> One's thoughts should be pure, one's forehead should display no harshness, one's ears should always turn to hear good, one's eyes should distance themselves from noticing evil, always looking at the good, one's nose should be free from the breath of anger, one's face should always shine, and his mouth should express nothing except good.\n\n=== 13 Supernal Attributes of Mercy ===\n{{main article|Thirteen Attributes of Mercy}}\n\nThrough discussion of a line in the [[Michah]], 13 attributes are associated with the Sephirah Kether:\n\n<blockquote>Who is God like you, who pardons iniquity and forgives the transgressions of the remnant of his heritage? He does not maintain His anger forever, for He delights in kindness. He will again show us compassion, He will vanquish our iniquities, and You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. Show faithfulness to Ya'akov, kindness to Avraham, which You have sworn to our fathers from days of old. (''Michah'', 7:18-20)</blockquote>\n\nAccordingly, the 13 attributes are derived from this and are described in great detail.\n\nAdditionally, the \"Thirteen Attributes of Mercy\" were described by Rabbi Chizkiyah in an allegorical depiction of a lily among thorns. The metaphor in whole is known and taught as \"The lily amongst the thorns,\" a phrase found in [[Shir Hashirim]] 2:2. A summary:\n\n<blockquote>The secret of spiritual protection is revealed through a richly metaphorical discourse given by Rabbi Chizkiyah. The Rabbi explains that the spiritual forces that protect and watch over us are called the 13 Attributes of Mercy. They are transmitted into our physical world through the first 13 words of the Torah. When judgments are decreed against us, these 13 forces can safeguard us from their influence. We begin drawing this Light of protection to ourselves at the very moment we begin to browse and behold the mystical shapes and sequences of the Aramaic text, and to learn the spiritual insights presented there. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.kabbalah.com/k/index.php/p=zohar/zohar |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008211150/http://www2.kabbalah.com/k/index.php/p=zohar/zohar |archivedate=2011-10-08 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Non-Jewish practices ==\nIn ''The Mystical Qabalah'' [[Dion Fortune]] describes Keter as pure consciousness, beyond all categories, timeless, a point that crystallises out of the Ein Soph, and commences the process of emanation that ends in [[Malchut|Malkuth]].\n\nThe name of God given to it is [[I Am that I Am|Eheieh]], the [[archangel]] that presides over it is [[Metatron]], the order of [[angel]]s that resides in it are the Holy Living Creatures (the [[Chayot|Chaioth ha Qadesh]], Hebrew: \u05d7\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9), and its mundane [[chakra]] is said to be the First Swirlings of the cosmos ([[Primum Mobile]], Rashith ha Gilgalin).\n\n[[A.E. Waite]] made mention that Rabbi Azariel ben Menachem, a student of [[Isaac the Blind]], in his ''Commentary on the Sephiroth'' granted a particular colour to each Sephira, yet these do not agree with the colours given in the Zohar, where Kether (which, according to him, is also correlated to ''Yechidah'') is called colourless, Tiphareth purple, and Malkuth sapphire-blue.<ref>A.E. Waite, ''The Holy Kabbalah''</ref>\n\nAs pure formless consciousness, it is often compared with the [[Sahasrara]] chakra, which resides above the crown of the head, in Indian [[Shaktism#Association with Tantra|Shakta Tantra]].\n\nIn [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''[[777 and other Qabalistic writings|Liber 777]]'', Keter is associated with the Four [[Ace]]s of the [[Tarot]] deck, White Brilliance, [[Poseidon]], [[Brahma]], [[Wodan]], [[Zeus]], The [[Trinity]], [[Almond]] in flower, [[Diamond]], [[Elixir of life|Elixir Vitae]], [[Tao|Dao]], and [[Death]] (not a complete list of the 777 associations).\n\nIt is said to have a negative aspect, the [[Qliphoth]]ic order of [[demon]]s called [[Thaumiel]] ruled by the [[Archdemon]]s [[Satan]] and [[Moloch]].\n\nKeter is also identified with the planets [[Neptune]] or [[Pluto]], the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atma]] in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Raja Yoga]], and the ''Khabs am Pekht'' in Egyptian mysticism.<ref>David Rankine, ''Climbing the Tree of Life: A Manual of Practical Magickal Qabalah''</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the [[SCP Foundation]] mythos and related games, \"Keter\" is one of four major classifications for anomalous objects or entities (Safe, Euclid, Keter, Thaumiel).
