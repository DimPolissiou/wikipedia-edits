He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a [[Phaeton (hypothetical planet)|destroyed planet]]. He sent a letter with his proposal to the English astronomer [[William Herschel]], suggesting that a search near the locations where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected might reveal more fragments. These orbital intersections were located in the [[constellation]]s of [[Cetus]] and [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].<ref name=\"Littmann2004\"/> Olbers commenced his search in 1802, and on 29 March 1807 he discovered Vesta in the constellation Virgo\u2014a coincidence, because Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are not fragments of a larger body. Because the asteroid [[3 Juno|Juno]] had been discovered in 1804, this made Vesta the fourth object to be identified in the region that is now known as the [[asteroid belt]]. The discovery was announced in a letter addressed to German astronomer [[Johann Hieronymus Schr\u00f6ter|Johann H. Schr\u00f6ter]] dated 31 March.<ref name=\"Lynn1907\"/> Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet (Pallas; at the time, the asteroids were considered to be planets), he gave the honor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirm the existence of Ceres, the first asteroid, and who had computed the orbit of the new planet in the remarkably short time of 10 hours.<ref name=\"Dunnington2004\"/><ref name=\"Rao2003\"/> Gauss decided on the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] virgin goddess of home and hearth, [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]].<ref name=\"MPDictionary\"/>\n\n===Name===\nVesta was the fourth asteroid to be discovered, hence the number 4 in its formal designation. The name ''Vesta'', or national variants thereof, is in international use with two exceptions: [[Greece]] and China. In [[Modern Greek|Greek]], the name adopted was the Hellenic equivalent of Vesta, [[Hestia]] ({{lang|el|4 \u0395\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}); in English, that name is used for [[46 Hestia]] (Greeks use the name \"Hestia\" for both, with the minor-planet numbers used for disambiguation). In [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], Vesta is called the 'hearth-god(dess) star', {{lang|zh|\u7076\u795e\u661f}} ''{{transl|zh|z\u00e0osh\u00e9nx\u012bng}}'', naming the asteroid for Vesta's role rather than literally transliterating her name into Chinese, as is done with other bodies discovered in modern times, including [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and [[Pluto]].{{efn|1=\u7dad\u65af\u5854 ''w\u00e9is\u012bt\u01ce'', with an obscure ''\u012b'', is the closest Chinese approximation of the Latin pronunciation ''westa''.}}\n\nUpon its discovery, Vesta was, like Ceres, Pallas, and Juno before it, classified as a planet and given a [[Astronomical symbols|planetary symbol]]. The symbol represented the altar of Vesta with its [[Sacred fire of Vesta|sacred fire]] and was designed by Gauss.<ref name=\"mcbeh-v15\"/><ref name=\"effemeridi-1809\"/> In Gauss's conception, this was drawn {{nowrap|[[File:Simbolo di Vesta.svg|x15px|Gauss's version of the astronomical symbol for Vesta]];}} in its modern form, it is {{nowrap|[[File:Vesta symbol.svg|x20px|modern version of the astronomical symbol for Vesta]].{{efn|1=Other sources contemporaneous to Gauss used a more elaborate form of the symbol, [[File:4 Vesta (2).svg|x20px|Elaborate form of the astronomical symbol for Vesta]].<ref name=\"annuaire-1808\"/><ref name=\"Canovai1810\"/>}}}}\n\nAfter the discovery of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets.<ref name=\"18planets\"/> However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, each with its own symbol, in addition to the eight major planets ([[Neptune]] had been discovered in 1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould]], who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the generic symbol \u2463. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number\u2013name designation, ''\u2463 Vesta'', as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, ''(4) Vesta'', which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as ''4) Vesta'' and ''4, Vesta'', was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949.<ref name=\"WhenbecameMPs\"/> Today, either ''Vesta'', or, more commonly, ''4 Vesta'', is used.\n\n===Early measurements===\n[[File:New SPHERE view of Vesta.jpg|thumb|[[Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research|SPHERE]] image is shown on the left, with a synthetic view derived from space-based data shown on the right for comparison.<ref>{{cite web |title=New SPHERE view of Vesta |url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1826a/ |website=www.eso.org |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref>]]\n\nPhotometric observations of Vesta were made at the [[Harvard College Observatory]] in 1880\u20131882 and at the [[Observatoire de Toulouse]] in 1909. These and other observations allowed the rotation rate of Vesta to be determined by the 1950s. However, the early estimates of the rotation rate came into question because the [[light curve]] included variations in both shape and [[albedo]].<ref name=\"McFadden2008\"/>\n\nEarly estimates of the diameter of Vesta ranged from 383 (in 1825) to {{val|444|u=km}}. [[Edward Charles Pickering|E.C. Pickering]] produced an estimated diameter of {{val|513|17|u=km}} in 1879, which is close to the modern value for the mean diameter, but the subsequent estimates ranged from a low of {{val|390|u=km}} up to a high of {{val|602|u=km}} during the next century. The measured estimates were based on [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. In 1989, [[speckle interferometry]] was used to measure a dimension that varied between 498 and {{val|548|u=km}} during the rotational period.<ref name=\"Hughes1994\"/> In 1991, an [[occultation]] of the star [[SAO 93228]] by Vesta was observed from multiple locations in the eastern United States and Canada. Based on observations from 14 different sites, the best fit to the data was an elliptical profile with dimensions of about {{val|550|u=km}} \u00d7 {{val|462|u=km}}.<ref name=\"Povenmire2001\"/> ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' confirmed this measurement.\n\nVesta became the first asteroid to have its mass determined. Every 18 years, the asteroid [[197 Arete]] approaches within {{val|0.04|ul=AU}} of Vesta. In 1966, based upon observations of Vesta's [[gravitational perturbation]]s of Arete, Hans G. Hertz estimated the mass of Vesta as {{val|1.20|0.08|e=-10}} [[solar mass]]es.<ref name=\"science160_3825\"/> More refined estimates followed, and in 2001 the perturbations of [[17 Thetis]] were used to estimate the mass of Vesta as {{val|1.31|0.02|e=-10}} solar masses.<ref name=\"aaa430\"/>\n\n==Orbit==\nVesta orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, within the [[asteroid belt]], with a period of 3.6 Earth years,<ref name=\"jpldata\"/> specifically in the inner asteroid belt, interior to the [[Kirkwood gap]] at 2.50&nbsp;AU. Its orbit is moderately inclined (''i'' = 7.1\u00b0, compared to 7\u00b0 for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and 17\u00b0 for [[Pluto]]) and moderately [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (''e'' = 0.09, about the same as for Mars).<ref name=\"jpldata\"/>\n\nTrue [[orbital resonance]]s between asteroids are considered unlikely; due to their small masses relative to their large separations, such relationships should be very rare.<ref name=\"Christou\"/> Nevertheless, Vesta is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 1:1 resonant orbital relationships (for periods up to 2 million years or more); about forty such objects have been identified.<ref name=\"Christou2012\"/> Decameter-sized objects detected in the vicinity of Vesta by ''Dawn'' may be such [[quasi-satellite]]s rather than proper satellites.<ref name=\"Christou2012\"/>\n\n==Rotation==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 580\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image2    = Claudia crater, Vesta IOTD-298.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Claudia (crater)|Claudia crater]] (indicated by the arrow at the bottom of the closeup image at right) defines the prime meridian in the ''Dawn''/NASA coordinate system.\n| image1    = Olbers Regio (square).gif\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Olbers Regio (dark area) defines the prime meridian in the IAU coordinate system.

This gives an [[axial tilt]] of 29\u00b0.<ref name=\"Thomas1997b\"/>\n\n==Coordinate systems==\nThere are two longitudinal coordinate systems in use for Vesta, with [[prime meridian]]s separated by 150\u00b0. The [[IAU]] established a coordinate system in 1997 based on ''Hubble'' photos, with the prime meridian running through the center of [[Olbers Regio]], a dark feature 200&nbsp;km across. When ''Dawn'' arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10\u00b0, so that the IAU coordinate system drifted across the surface of Vesta at 0.06\u00b0 per year, and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close, and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed. They corrected the pole, but also established a new prime meridian 4\u00b0 from the center of [[Claudia (crater)|Claudia]], a sharply defined crater 700 meters across, which they say results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles.<ref name=\"Claudian\"/> All NASA publications, including images and maps of Vesta, use the Claudian meridian, which is unacceptable to the IAU. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a coordinate system, correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150\u00b0 to coincide with Olbers Regio.<ref name=\"IAUcoordinates\"/> It was accepted by the IAU, though it disrupts the maps prepared by the ''Dawn'' team, which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features.<ref name=Claudian/><ref name=\"Dawncoordinates\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Vesta full mosaic.jpg|thumb|Composite greyscale image of Vesta taken by [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'']]]]\n[[File:Iau dozen.jpg|thumb|The [[IAU definition of planet#First draft proposal|IAU 2006 draft proposal]] on the definition of a planet listed Vesta as a candidate.<ref name=\"IAU-draft2006\"/> Vesta is shown fourth from the left along the bottom row.]]\n\nVesta is the second-most-massive body in the [[asteroid belt]],<ref name=\"Baer2007\"/> though only 28% as massive as Ceres.<ref name=\"Pitjeva05\"/> Vesta's density is lower than those of the four [[terrestrial planet]]s, but higher than that of most asteroids and all of the moons in the Solar System except [[Io (moon)|Io]].

The Rheasilvia crater is younger and overlies the Veneneia crater.<ref name=\"Schenk2012\"/> The ''Dawn'' science team named the younger, more prominent crater [[Rheasilvia]], after the mother of Romulus and Remus and a mythical [[vestal virgin]].<ref name=\"Rheasilvianamed\"/> Its width is 95% of the mean diameter of Vesta. The crater is about {{convert|19|km|mi|0}} deep. A central peak rises 23&nbsp;km above the lowest measured part of the crater floor and the highest measured part of the crater rim is 31&nbsp;km above the crater floor low point. It is estimated that the impact responsible excavated about 1% of the volume of Vesta, and it is likely that the [[Vesta family]] and [[V-type asteroid]]s are the products of this collision. If this is the case, then the fact that 10-km fragments have survived bombardment until the present indicates that the crater is at most only about 1&nbsp;billion years old.<ref name=\"Binzel1997\"/> It would also be the site of origin of the [[HED meteorite]]s. All the known V-type asteroids taken together account for only about 6% of the ejected volume, with the rest presumably either in small fragments, ejected by approaching the 3:1&nbsp;[[Kirkwood gap]], or perturbed away by the [[Yarkovsky effect]] or [[radiation pressure]].

The largest is named [[Divalia Fossa]] (10\u201320&nbsp;km wide, 465&nbsp;km long). Despite the fact that Vesta is a one-seventh the size of the Moon, Divalia Fossa dwarfs the [[Grand Canyon]]. A second series, inclined to the equator, is found further north. The largest of the northern troughs is named [[Saturnalia Fossa]] (\u2248 40&nbsp;km wide, > 370&nbsp;km long). These troughs are thought to be large-scale [[graben]] resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters, respectively. They are some of the [[List of largest rifts and valleys in the Solar System|longest chasms in the Solar System]], nearly as long as [[Ithaca Chasma]] on [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]]. The troughs may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta, a process that can happen only in a body that, like Vesta, is differentiated.<ref name=\"Buczkowski2012\"/> Vesta's differentiation is one of the reasons why scientists consider it a protoplanet.<ref name=\"Stunted Planet\"/>\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=660\n| align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Divalia Fossa IOTD-260.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = A section of Divalia Fossa, with parallel troughs to the north and south\n| image2    = Divalia Fossa PIA15673.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = A computer-generated view of a portion of Divalia Fossa\n}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Surface composition===\nCompositional information from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate that the majority of the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites.<ref name=\"DeSanctis2012a\"/><ref name=\"Prettyman2012\"/><ref name=\"Reddy2012\"/> The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia.<ref name=\"Ammannito2013\"/> The origin of this olivine is currently unknown.\n\n===Features associated with volatiles===\nPitted terrain has been observed in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia.<ref name=\"Denevi2012\"/> The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by the heat of the impacts.<ref name=\"Scully2014\"/> Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material.<ref name=\"DeSanctis2012b\"/> Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.<ref name=\"Reddy2012\"/>\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Vestan interior PIA15510.jpg|thumb|Cut-away schematic of Vestan core, mantle, and crust]]\n[[File:MillbillillieMeteorite.jpg|thumb|right|Eucrite meteorite]]\n\nThere is a large collection of potential samples from Vesta accessible to scientists, in the form of over 1200&nbsp;[[HED meteorite]]s (Vestan [[achondrite]]s), giving insight into Vesta's geologic history and structure. [[NASA Infrared Telescope Facility]] (NASA IRTF) studies of asteroid {{mpl|(237442) 1999 TA|10}} suggest that it originated from deeper within Vesta than the HED meteorites<ref name=\"Vestainterior\"/>\n\nVesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron\u2013nickel [[planetary core|core]] 214\u2013226&nbsp;km in diameter,<ref name=\"Russell2012\"/> an overlying rocky [[olivine]] [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], with a surface [[crust (geology)|crust]]. From the first appearance of [[calcium\u2013aluminium-rich inclusion]]s (the first solid matter in the [[Solar System]], forming about 4.567&nbsp;billion years ago), a likely time line is as follows:<ref name=\"Ghosh1998\"/><ref name=\"Righter1997\"/><ref name=\"Drake2001\"/><ref name=\"Sahijpal2007\"/><ref name=\"Gupta2010\"/>\n\n:{|class=wikitable\n|+Timeline of the evolution of Vesta\n|-\n!2\u20133&nbsp;million years\n|Accretion completed\n|-\n!4\u20135&nbsp;million years\n|Complete or almost complete melting due to [[radioactive decay]] of [[Aluminium-26|<sup>26</sup>Al]], leading to separation of the metal core\n|-\n!6\u20137&nbsp;million years\n|Progressive crystallization of a [[convection|convecting]] molten [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].

Because of this, some scientists refer to Vesta as a protoplanet.<ref name=\"nasa-dawn20110329\"/> However, the presence of [[iron meteorite]]s and achondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated [[planetesimal]]s with [[igneous]] histories, which have since been shattered by impacts.\n\n:{|class=wikitable\n|+Composition of the Vestan crust (by depth)<ref name=\"Takeda1997\"/>\n|-\n|A [[lithification|lithified]] [[regolith]], the source of [[howardite]]s and [[breccia]]ted [[eucrite]]s.\n|-\n|[[Basalt]]ic [[lava flow]]s, a source of non-cumulate [[eucrite]]s.\n|-\n|Plutonic rocks consisting of [[pyroxene]], [[pigeonite]] and [[plagioclase]], the source of cumulate [[eucrite]]s.\n|-\n|Plutonic rocks rich in [[orthopyroxene]] with large grain sizes, the source of [[diogenite]]s.\n|}\nOn the basis of the sizes of [[V-type asteroid]]s (thought to be pieces of Vesta's crust ejected during large impacts), and the depth of Rheasilvia crater (see below), the crust is thought to be roughly {{convert|10|km|mi|0}} thick.<ref name=\"Yamaguchi1995\"/>\nFindings from the ''Dawn'' spacecraft have found evidence that the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta's differentiated interior implies that it was in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus a dwarf planet in the past, but it is not today.<ref name=\"Schenk2012\"/> The impacts that created the Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters occurred when Vesta was no longer warm and plastic enough to return to an equilibrium shape, distorting its once rounded shape and prohibiting it from being classified as a dwarf planet today.\n\n===Regolith===\nVesta's surface is covered by [[regolith]] distinct from that found on the [[Moon]] or asteroids such as [[25143 Itokawa|Itokawa]]. This is because [[space weathering]] acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of [[nanophase iron]] because the [[Asteroid impact|impact]] speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by [[brecciation]] and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components.<ref name=\"Pieters2012\"/> The dark component is probably due to the infall of [[carbon]]aceous material, whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil.<ref name=\"McCord2012\"/>\n\n==Fragments==\nSome [[small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] are suspected to be fragments of Vesta caused by impacts. The [[Vesta family|Vestian]] asteroids and [[HED meteorite]]s are examples. The [[V-type asteroid]] [[1929 Kollaa]] has been determined to have a composition akin to cumulate [[eucrite]] meteorites, indicating its origin deep within Vesta's crust.<ref name=\"Kelley2003\"/>\n\nVesta is currently one of only six identified [[Solar System]] bodies of which we have physical samples, coming from a number of meteorites suspected to be Vestan fragments. It is estimated that 1 out of 16 meteorites originated from Vesta.<ref name=\"siliconvalleyastrolecture\"/> The other identified Solar System samples are from Earth itself, [[Martian meteorite|meteorites from Mars]], [[Lunar meteorite|meteorites from the Moon]], and [[Sample return mission|samples returned]] from the [[Moon]], the comet [[Wild 2]], and the asteroid [[25143 Itokawa]].<ref name=\"nasa2011-vesta\"/>{{efn|1=Note that there is very strong evidence that [[6 Hebe]] is the parent body for H-[[chondrites]], one of the most common meteorite types.}}\n\n==Exploration==\n[[File:Animation of Dawn trajectory.gif|thumb|right|Animation of '' Dawn''{{'s}} trajectory from 27 September 2007 to 5 October 2018<br />{{legend2|magenta| ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' }}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Royalblue|[[Earth]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Gold|[[Mars]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Cyan|4 Vesta }}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|lime|[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|1 Ceres]]}}]]\n[[File:PIA17937-MarsCuriosityRover-FirstAsteroidImage-20140420.jpg|thumb|left|First image of [[asteroid]]s ([[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] and Vesta) taken from [[Mars]].

Named the '''Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis''' ('''AGORA'''), this [[spacecraft]] was to launch some time in 1990\u20131994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a [[gravitational slingshot]] trajectory past Mars or by means of a small [[ion engine]]. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint [[NASA]]\u2013ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a '''Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion''' ('''MAOSEP'''), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved.<ref name=\"ulivi_harland08\"/> Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|impacting penetrator]] was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet [[Vesta mission]], developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991\u20131994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.\n[[File:Dawn Flight Configuration 2.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's conception of ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' orbiting Vesta]]\nIn the early 1990s, NASA initiated the [[Discovery Program]], which was intended to be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' vehicle had passed its critical design review<ref name=\"Russell2007\"/> and construction proceeded.\n\nIt launched on 27 September 2007 as the first space mission to Vesta. On 3 May 2011, ''Dawn'' acquired its first targeting image 1.2 million kilometers from Vesta.<ref name=\"pr2011-138\"/> On 16 July 2011, NASA confirmed that it received telemetry from ''Dawn'' indicating that the spacecraft successfully entered Vesta's orbit.<ref name=\"Vega2011\"/> It was scheduled to orbit Vesta for one year, until July 2012.<ref name=\"Dawntimeline\"/> ''Dawn''{{'s}} arrival coincided with late summer in the southern hemisphere of Vesta, with the large crater at Vesta's south pole ([[Rheasilvia]]) in sunlight. Because a season on Vesta lasts eleven months, the northern hemisphere, including anticipated compression fractures opposite the crater, would become visible to ''Dawn''{{'s}} cameras before it left orbit.<ref name=\"DawnMission\"/> ''Dawn'' left orbit around Vesta on 4 September 2012 {{nobreak|11:26 p.m. PDT}} to travel to [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]].<ref name=\"Dawndeparture\"/>\n\nNASA/DLR released imagery and summary information from a survey orbit, two high-altitude orbits (60\u201370&nbsp;m/pixel) and a low-altitude mapping orbit (20&nbsp;m/pixel), including digital terrain models, videos and atlases.<ref name=\"Russell2013\"/><ref name=\"Roatsch2012\"/><ref name=\"Roatsch2013\"/><ref name=\"journeyaboveVesta\"/><ref name=\"dawn_gis\"/><ref name=\"NASADawn\"/> Scientists also used ''Dawn'' to calculate Vesta's precise mass and gravity field.

He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a [[Phaeton (hypothetical planet)|destroyed planet]]. He sent a letter with his proposal to the English astronomer [[William Herschel]], suggesting that a search near the locations where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected might reveal more fragments. These orbital intersections were located in the [[constellation]]s of [[Cetus]] and [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].<ref name=\"Littmann2004\"/> Olbers commenced his search in 1802, and on 29 March 1807 he discovered Vesta in the constellation Virgo\u2014a coincidence, because Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are not fragments of a larger body. Because the asteroid [[3 Juno|Juno]] had been discovered in 1804, this made Vesta the fourth object to be identified in the region that is now known as the [[asteroid belt]]. The discovery was announced in a letter addressed to German astronomer [[Johann Hieronymus Schr\u00f6ter|Johann H. Schr\u00f6ter]] dated 31 March.<ref name=\"Lynn1907\"/> Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet (Pallas; at the time, the asteroids were considered to be planets), he gave the honor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirm the existence of Ceres, the first asteroid, and who had computed the orbit of the new planet in the remarkably short time of 10 hours.<ref name=\"Dunnington2004\"/><ref name=\"Rao2003\"/> Gauss decided on the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] virgin goddess of home and hearth, [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]].<ref name=\"MPDictionary\"/>\n\n===Name===\nVesta was the fourth asteroid to be discovered, hence the number 4 in its formal designation. The name ''Vesta'', or national variants thereof, is in international use with two exceptions: [[Greece]] and China. In [[Modern Greek|Greek]], the name adopted was the Hellenic equivalent of Vesta, [[Hestia]] ({{lang|el|4 \u0395\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}); in English, that name is used for [[46 Hestia]] (Greeks use the name \"Hestia\" for both, with the minor-planet numbers used for disambiguation). In [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], Vesta is called the 'hearth-god(dess) star', {{lang|zh|\u7076\u795e\u661f}} ''{{transl|zh|z\u00e0osh\u00e9nx\u012bng}}'', naming the asteroid for Vesta's role rather than literally transliterating her name into Chinese, as is done with other bodies discovered in modern times, including [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and [[Pluto]].{{efn|1=\u7dad\u65af\u5854 ''w\u00e9is\u012bt\u01ce'', with an obscure ''\u012b'', is the closest Chinese approximation of the Latin pronunciation ''westa''.}}\n\nUpon its discovery, Vesta was, like Ceres, Pallas, and Juno before it, classified as a planet and given a [[Astronomical symbols|planetary symbol]]. The symbol represented the altar of Vesta with its [[Sacred fire of Vesta|sacred fire]] and was designed by Gauss.<ref name=\"mcbeh-v15\"/><ref name=\"effemeridi-1809\"/> In Gauss's conception, this was drawn {{nowrap|[[File:Simbolo di Vesta.svg|x15px|Gauss's version of the astronomical symbol for Vesta]];}} in its modern form, it is {{nowrap|[[File:Vesta symbol.svg|x20px|modern version of the astronomical symbol for Vesta]].{{efn|1=Other sources contemporaneous to Gauss used a more elaborate form of the symbol, [[File:4 Vesta (2).svg|x20px|Elaborate form of the astronomical symbol for Vesta]].<ref name=\"annuaire-1808\"/><ref name=\"Canovai1810\"/>}}}}\n\nAfter the discovery of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets.<ref name=\"18planets\"/> However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, each with its own symbol, in addition to the eight major planets ([[Neptune]] had been discovered in 1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould]], who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the generic symbol \u2463. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number\u2013name designation, ''\u2463 Vesta'', as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, ''(4) Vesta'', which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as ''4) Vesta'' and ''4, Vesta'', was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949.<ref name=\"WhenbecameMPs\"/> Today, either ''Vesta'', or, more commonly, ''4 Vesta'', is used.\n\n===Early measurements===\n[[File:New SPHERE view of Vesta.jpg|thumb|[[Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research|SPHERE]] image is shown on the left, with a synthetic view derived from space-based data shown on the right for comparison.<ref>{{cite web |title=New SPHERE view of Vesta |url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1826a/ |website=www.eso.org |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref>]]\n\nPhotometric observations of Vesta were made at the [[Harvard College Observatory]] in 1880\u20131882 and at the [[Observatoire de Toulouse]] in 1909. These and other observations allowed the rotation rate of Vesta to be determined by the 1950s. However, the early estimates of the rotation rate came into question because the [[light curve]] included variations in both shape and [[albedo]].<ref name=\"McFadden2008\"/>\n\nEarly estimates of the diameter of Vesta ranged from 383 (in 1825) to {{val|444|u=km}}. [[Edward Charles Pickering|E.C. Pickering]] produced an estimated diameter of {{val|513|17|u=km}} in 1879, which is close to the modern value for the mean diameter, but the subsequent estimates ranged from a low of {{val|390|u=km}} up to a high of {{val|602|u=km}} during the next century. The measured estimates were based on [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. In 1989, [[speckle interferometry]] was used to measure a dimension that varied between 498 and {{val|548|u=km}} during the rotational period.<ref name=\"Hughes1994\"/> In 1991, an [[occultation]] of the star [[SAO 93228]] by Vesta was observed from multiple locations in the eastern United States and Canada. Based on observations from 14 different sites, the best fit to the data was an elliptical profile with dimensions of about {{val|550|u=km}} \u00d7 {{val|462|u=km}}.<ref name=\"Povenmire2001\"/> ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' confirmed this measurement.\n\nVesta became the first asteroid to have its mass determined. Every 18 years, the asteroid [[197 Arete]] approaches within {{val|0.04|ul=AU}} of Vesta. In 1966, based upon observations of Vesta's [[gravitational perturbation]]s of Arete, Hans G. Hertz estimated the mass of Vesta as {{val|1.20|0.08|e=-10}} [[solar mass]]es.<ref name=\"science160_3825\"/> More refined estimates followed, and in 2001 the perturbations of [[17 Thetis]] were used to estimate the mass of Vesta as {{val|1.31|0.02|e=-10}} solar masses.<ref name=\"aaa430\"/>\n\n==Orbit==\nVesta orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, within the [[asteroid belt]], with a period of 3.6 Earth years,<ref name=\"jpldata\"/> specifically in the inner asteroid belt, interior to the [[Kirkwood gap]] at 2.50&nbsp;AU. Its orbit is moderately inclined (''i'' = 7.1\u00b0, compared to 7\u00b0 for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and 17\u00b0 for [[Pluto]]) and moderately [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (''e'' = 0.09, about the same as for Mars).<ref name=\"jpldata\"/>\n\nTrue [[orbital resonance]]s between asteroids are considered unlikely; due to their small masses relative to their large separations, such relationships should be very rare.<ref name=\"Christou\"/> Nevertheless, Vesta is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 1:1 resonant orbital relationships (for periods up to 2 million years or more); about forty such objects have been identified.<ref name=\"Christou2012\"/> Decameter-sized objects detected in the vicinity of Vesta by ''Dawn'' may be such [[quasi-satellite]]s rather than proper satellites.<ref name=\"Christou2012\"/>\n\n==Rotation==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 580\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image2    = Claudia crater, Vesta IOTD-298.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Claudia (crater)|Claudia crater]] (indicated by the arrow at the bottom of the closeup image at right) defines the prime meridian in the ''Dawn''/NASA coordinate system.\n| image1    = Olbers Regio (square).gif\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Olbers Regio (dark area) defines the prime meridian in the IAU coordinate system.

This gives an [[axial tilt]] of 29\u00b0.<ref name=\"Thomas1997b\"/>\n\n==Coordinate systems==\nThere are two longitudinal coordinate systems in use for Vesta, with [[prime meridian]]s separated by 150\u00b0. The [[IAU]] established a coordinate system in 1997 based on ''Hubble'' photos, with the prime meridian running through the center of [[Olbers Regio]], a dark feature 200&nbsp;km across. When ''Dawn'' arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10\u00b0, so that the IAU coordinate system drifted across the surface of Vesta at 0.06\u00b0 per year, and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close, and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed. They corrected the pole, but also established a new prime meridian 4\u00b0 from the center of [[Claudia (crater)|Claudia]], a sharply defined crater 700 meters across, which they say results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles.<ref name=\"Claudian\"/> All NASA publications, including images and maps of Vesta, use the Claudian meridian, which is unacceptable to the IAU. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a coordinate system, correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150\u00b0 to coincide with Olbers Regio.<ref name=\"IAUcoordinates\"/> It was accepted by the IAU, though it disrupts the maps prepared by the ''Dawn'' team, which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features.<ref name=Claudian/><ref name=\"Dawncoordinates\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Vesta full mosaic.jpg|thumb|Composite greyscale image of Vesta taken by [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'']]]]\n[[File:Iau dozen.jpg|thumb|The [[IAU definition of planet#First draft proposal|IAU 2006 draft proposal]] on the definition of a planet listed Vesta as a candidate.<ref name=\"IAU-draft2006\"/> Vesta is shown fourth from the left along the bottom row.]]\n\nVesta is the second-most-massive body in the [[asteroid belt]],<ref name=\"Baer2007\"/> though only 28% as massive as Ceres.<ref name=\"Pitjeva05\"/> Vesta's density is lower than those of the four [[terrestrial planet]]s, but higher than that of most asteroids and all of the moons in the Solar System except [[Io (moon)|Io]].

The Rheasilvia crater is younger and overlies the Veneneia crater.<ref name=\"Schenk2012\"/> The ''Dawn'' science team named the younger, more prominent crater [[Rheasilvia]], after the mother of Romulus and Remus and a mythical [[vestal virgin]].<ref name=\"Rheasilvianamed\"/> Its width is 95% of the mean diameter of Vesta. The crater is about {{convert|19|km|mi|0}} deep. A central peak rises 23&nbsp;km above the lowest measured part of the crater floor and the highest measured part of the crater rim is 31&nbsp;km above the crater floor low point. It is estimated that the impact responsible excavated about 1% of the volume of Vesta, and it is likely that the [[Vesta family]] and [[V-type asteroid]]s are the products of this collision. If this is the case, then the fact that 10-km fragments have survived bombardment until the present indicates that the crater is at most only about 1&nbsp;billion years old.<ref name=\"Binzel1997\"/> It would also be the site of origin of the [[HED meteorite]]s. All the known V-type asteroids taken together account for only about 6% of the ejected volume, with the rest presumably either in small fragments, ejected by approaching the 3:1&nbsp;[[Kirkwood gap]], or perturbed away by the [[Yarkovsky effect]] or [[radiation pressure]].

The largest is named [[Divalia Fossa]] (10\u201320&nbsp;km wide, 465&nbsp;km long). Despite the fact that Vesta is a one-seventh the size of the Moon, Divalia Fossa dwarfs the [[Grand Canyon]]. A second series, inclined to the equator, is found further north. The largest of the northern troughs is named [[Saturnalia Fossa]] (\u2248 40&nbsp;km wide, > 370&nbsp;km long). These troughs are thought to be large-scale [[graben]] resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters, respectively. They are some of the [[List of largest rifts and valleys in the Solar System|longest chasms in the Solar System]], nearly as long as [[Ithaca Chasma]] on [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]]. The troughs may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta, a process that can happen only in a body that, like Vesta, is differentiated.<ref name=\"Buczkowski2012\"/> Vesta's differentiation is one of the reasons why scientists consider it a protoplanet.<ref name=\"Stunted Planet\"/>\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=660\n| align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Divalia Fossa IOTD-260.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = A section of Divalia Fossa, with parallel troughs to the north and south\n| image2    = Divalia Fossa PIA15673.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = A computer-generated view of a portion of Divalia Fossa\n}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Surface composition===\nCompositional information from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate that the majority of the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites.<ref name=\"DeSanctis2012a\"/><ref name=\"Prettyman2012\"/><ref name=\"Reddy2012\"/> The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia.<ref name=\"Ammannito2013\"/> The origin of this olivine is currently unknown.\n\n===Features associated with volatiles===\nPitted terrain has been observed in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia.<ref name=\"Denevi2012\"/> The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by the heat of the impacts.<ref name=\"Scully2014\"/> Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material.<ref name=\"DeSanctis2012b\"/> Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.<ref name=\"Reddy2012\"/>\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Vestan interior PIA15510.jpg|thumb|Cut-away schematic of Vestan core, mantle, and crust]]\n[[File:MillbillillieMeteorite.jpg|thumb|right|Eucrite meteorite]]\n\nThere is a large collection of potential samples from Vesta accessible to scientists, in the form of over 1200&nbsp;[[HED meteorite]]s (Vestan [[achondrite]]s), giving insight into Vesta's geologic history and structure.

Vesta's differentiated interior implies that it was in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus a dwarf planet in the past, but it is not today. <ref name=\"Schenk2012\"/> The impacts that created the Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters occurred when Vesta was no longer warm and plastic enough to return to an equilibrium shape, distorting its once rounded shape and prohibiting it from being classified as a dwarf planet today.\n===Regolith===\nVesta's surface is covered by [[regolith]] distinct from that found on the [[Moon]] or asteroids such as [[25143 Itokawa|Itokawa]]. This is because [[space weathering]] acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of [[nanophase iron]] because the [[Asteroid impact|impact]] speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by [[brecciation]] and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components.<ref name=\"Pieters2012\"/> The dark component is probably due to the infall of [[carbon]]aceous material, whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil.<ref name=\"McCord2012\"/>\n\n==Fragments==\nSome [[small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] are suspected to be fragments of Vesta caused by impacts. The [[Vesta family|Vestian]] asteroids and [[HED meteorite]]s are examples.

Named the '''Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis''' ('''AGORA'''), this [[spacecraft]] was to launch some time in 1990\u20131994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a [[gravitational slingshot]] trajectory past Mars or by means of a small [[ion engine]]. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint [[NASA]]\u2013ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a '''Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion''' ('''MAOSEP'''), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved.<ref name=\"ulivi_harland08\"/> Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|impacting penetrator]] was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet [[Vesta mission]], developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991\u20131994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.\n[[File:Dawn Flight Configuration 2.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's conception of ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' orbiting Vesta]]\nIn the early 1990s, NASA initiated the [[Discovery Program]], which was intended to be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' vehicle had passed its critical design review<ref name=\"Russell2007\"/> and construction proceeded.\n\nIt launched on 27 September 2007 as the first space mission to Vesta.

Wings are dark grey with varying levels of yellow highlighting. The ventral feathering is light grey to white with light grey scalloping on the chest. The feathering surrounding the eye is black. The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies. Fledgling birds have undefined, fluffy light grey chests without scalloping. Immature birds can be identified in the hand by retained juvenile remiges and rectrices, which are more brownish.<ref name=\"BirdInTheHand\" /> Yellow-throated miners are distinctive from the other miners by their clean white rump, instead of the continuous grey from the back that the noisy and black-eared miners have. The white-rump is clearly visible as yellow-throated miners are flying away, so this feature is often used in the field where two miner species overlap.  Yellow-throated miners have a varying amount of yellow highlighting above and below the beak on the forehead and chin, as well as on the sides of the throat. This differs from noisy miners which have white above the beak and no yellow highlighting on the  forehead or neck, but can have a small amount of yellow on the chin. Yellow-throated miners have paler feathering on the lower jaw compared to the throat, while pure black-eared miners have darker feathering on the lower jaw compared to that of the throat.

For example, [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] wrote educational texts. The modern textbook has its roots in the mass production made possible by the printing press. [[Johannes Gutenberg]] himself may have printed editions of ''Ars Minor'', a schoolbook on Latin grammar by [[Aelius Donatus]]. Early textbooks were used by tutors and teachers (e.g. alphabet books), as well as by individuals who taught themselves.\n\nThe Greek philosopher [[Socrates]] lamented the loss of knowledge because the media of transmission were changing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130020156/http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |archivedate=2013-01-30 }} True Stuff: Socrates vs. the Written Word, January 27th, 2011. By David Malki</ref> Before the invention of the [[Greek alphabet]] 2,500 years ago, knowledge and stories were recited aloud, much like [[Homer]]'s epic poems. The new technology of writing meant stories no longer needed to be memorized, a development Socrates feared would weaken the Greeks' mental capacities for memorizing and retelling. (Ironically, we know about Socrates' concerns only because they were written down by his student [[Plato]] in his famous Dialogues.) <ref>Marcia Clemmitt, \"Learning Online Literacy,\" in \"Reading Crisis?\" CQ Researcher, Feb. 22, 2008, pp. 169-192.</ref>\n\nThe next revolution in the field of books came with the 15th-century invention of printing with changeable type. The invention is attributed to German metalsmith Johannes Gutenberg, who cast type in molds using a melted metal alloy and constructed a wooden-screw [[printing press]] to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nGutenberg's first and only large-scale printing effort was the now-iconic [[Gutenberg Bible]] in the 1450s \u2014 a Latin translation from the Hebrew Old Testament and the [[Greek New Testament]]. Gutenberg's invention made mass production of texts possible for the first time. Although the Gutenberg Bible itself was expensive, printed books began to spread widely over European trade routes during the next 50 years, and by the 16th century, printed books had become more widely accessible and less costly.<ref>British Library, \"Treasures in Full: Gutenberg Bible,\" http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/background.html.</ref>\n\nWhile many textbooks were already in use, [[compulsory education]] and the resulting growth of schooling in Europe led to the printing of many more textbooks for children. Textbooks have been the primary teaching instrument for most children since the 19th century. Two textbooks of historical significance in United States schooling were the 18th century [[New England Primer]] and the 19th century [[McGuffey Readers]].\n\nRecent technological advances have changed the way people interact with textbooks. Online and digital materials are making it increasingly easy for students to access materials other than the traditional print textbook. Students now have access to electronic books (\"e-books\"), online tutoring systems and video lectures. An example of an e-book is ''[[Principles of Biology]]'' from [[Nature Publishing Group|Nature Publishing]].\n\nMost notably, an increasing number of authors are avoiding commercial publishers and instead offering their textbooks under a [[creative commons]] or other open license.\n\n==Market==\n\n===The market for textbooks===\nAs in many industries, the number of providers has declined in recent years (there are just a handful of major textbook companies in the USA).<ref>Rose, Marla Matzer.

Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus wholesaler for 0-30% of the new cost, for distribution to other bookstores.  Some textbook companies have countered this by encouraging teachers to assign homework that must be done on the publisher's website. Students with a new textbook can use the passcode in the book to register on the site; otherwise, they must pay the publisher to access the website and complete assigned homework.\n\nStudents who look beyond the campus bookstore can typically find lower prices. With the ISBN or title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online used booksellers or retailers.\n\nMost leading textbook companies publish a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently in math and science. Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions are often not about significant improvements to the content. \"New editions are to a considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and textbook authors to maintain their revenue stream, that is, to keep up prices.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/3/4/professors-find-differents-uses-for-textbook |title=Professors Find Different Uses for Textbook Profits |first1=Alissa |last1=D\u2019gama |first2=Benjamin |last2=Jaffe |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |date=March 4, 2008 |access-date=July 14, 2019 }}</ref>  A study conducted by The Student [[Public Interest Research Group|PIRGs]] found that a new edition costs 12% more than a new copy of the previous edition (not surprising if the old version is obsolete), and 58% more than a used copy of the previous edition.

Each combination of a textbook and supplemental items receives a separate ISBN. A single textbook could, therefore, have dozens of ISBNs that denote different combinations of supplements packaged with that particular book. When a bookstore attempts to track down used copies of textbooks, they will search for the ISBN the course instructor orders, which will locate only a subset of the copies of the textbook.\n\nLegislation at state and federal levels seeks to limit the practice of bundling, by requiring publishers to offer all components separately.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 Analysis of Textbook Affordability Provisions in H.R. 4137] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124161237/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 |date=2009-11-24 }}, The Student PIRGs</ref>  Publishers have testified in favor of bills including this provision,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|title=House Committee on Education (03/06/2008)|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413042944/http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|archivedate=13 April 2008}}</ref>  but only in the case that the provision exempts the loosely defined category of \"integrated textbooks.\"  The Federal bill<ref>\"[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.04137: Higher Education Opportunity Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921103240/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.04137: |date=2008-09-21 }}.\" H.R.4137, U.S. House of Representatives, 110th Congress (2007-2008.)

Students can sell to 1) the college/university bookstore; 2) fellow students; 3) a number of online websites; or 4) a student swap service.\n\n====Campus buyback====\nAs for buyback on a specific campus, faculty decisions largely determine how much a student receives. If a professor chooses to use the same book the following semester, even if it is a custom text, designed specifically for an individual instructor, bookstores often buy the book back. The GAO report found that, generally, if a book is in good condition and will be used on the campus again the next term, bookstores will pay students 50 per cent of the original price paid. If the bookstore has not received a faculty order for the book at the end of the term and the edition is still current, they may offer students the wholesale price of the book, which could range from 5 to 35 per cent of the new retail price, according to the GAO report.<ref name=GAO/>\n\nWhen students resell their textbooks during campus \u201cbuyback\u201d periods, these textbooks are often sold into the national used textbook distribution chain.  If a textbook is not going to be used on campus for the next semester of courses then many times the college bookstore will sell that book to a national used book company.  The used book company then resells the book to another college bookstore.  Finally, that book is sold as used to a student at another college at a price that is typically 75% of the new book price. At each step, a markup is applied to the book to enable the respective companies to continue to operate.\n\n====Student to student sales====\nStudents can also sell or trade textbooks among themselves. After completing a course, sellers will often seek out members of the next enrolling class, people who are likely to be interested in purchasing the required books. This may be done by posting flyers to advertise the sale of the books or simply soliciting individuals who are shopping in the college bookstore for the same titles. Many larger schools have independent websites set up for the purpose of facilitating such trade. These often operate much like digital classified ads, enabling students to list their items for sale and browse for those they wish to acquire. Also, at the [[US Air Force Academy]], it is possible to [[e-mail]] entire specific classes, allowing for an extensive network of textbook sales to exist.\n\n====Student online marketplaces====\nOnline marketplaces are one of the two major types of online websites students can use to sell used textbooks. Online marketplaces may have an [[Online auction business model|online auction]] format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price. In either case, the student must create the listing for each book themselves and wait for a buyer to order, making the use of marketplaces a more passive way of selling used textbooks. Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using online marketplaces, and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.\n\n====Online book buyers====\nOnline book buyers buy textbooks, and sometimes other types of books, with the aim of reselling them for a profit. Like online marketplaces, online book buyers operate year-round, giving students the opportunity to sell their books even when campus \"buyback\" periods are not in effect. Students enter the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] numbers of the books they wish to sell and receive a price quote or offer. These online book buyers often offer \"free shipping\" (which in actuality is built into the offer for the book), and allow students to sell multiple books to the same source. Because online book buyers are buying books for resale, the prices they offer may be lower than students can get on online marketplaces. However, their prices are competitive, and they tend to focus on the convenience of their service. Some even claim that buying used textbooks online and selling them to online book buyers has a lower total cost than even textbook rental services.\n\n====Textbook exchanges====\nIn response to escalating textbook prices, limited competition, and to provide a more efficient system to connect buyers and sellers together, online textbook exchanges were developed. Most of today's sites handle buyer and seller payments and usually deduct a small commission only after the sale is completed.\n\nAccording to the textbook author [[Henry L. Roediger III|Henry L. Roediger]] (and Wadsworth Publishing Company senior editor Vicki Knight), the used textbook market is illegitimate, and entirely to blame for the rising costs of textbooks.  As methods of \"dealing with this problem\", he recommends making previous editions of textbooks obsolete, binding the textbook with other materials, and passing laws to prevent the sale of used books.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-are-textbooks-so-expensive|magazine=Observer|publisher=Association for Psychological Science|title=Why Are Textbooks So Expensive?|author=Henry L.

The intent is to make users understand that the content of any textbook is the intellectual property of the author and/or the publisher, and that as such, subject to copyright. Obviously, this idea is completely opposed to the millennia-old tradition of the sale of [[used book]]s, and would make that entire industry illegal.\n\n==== E-textbooks ====\nAnother alternative to save money and obtaining the materials you are required are e-textbooks. The article \"Ebooks rewrite the rules of education\" states that alternately to spending a lot of money on textbooks, you can purchase an e-textbook at a small amount of the cost. With the growth of digital applications for iPhone, and gadgets like the Amazon kindle, e-textbooks are not an innovation, but have been \"gaining momentum\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ebooks Rewrite the Rules of Education|url = http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|website = EContent Magazine|last = Mullan|first = Eileen|date = 4 May 2009|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180317231848/http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|archivedate = 17 March 2018}}</ref> According to the article \" Are textbooks obsolete?\", publishers and editorials are concerned about the issue of expensive textbooks. \"The expense of textbooks is a concern for students, and e-textbooks, address the face of the issue, Williams says \" As publishers, we understand the high cost of these materials, and the electronic format  permit us diminish the general expense of our content to the market\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Are textbooks obsolete?

Some stores use a hybrid of both methods, opting for in-store selections of the most popular books and the online option for more obscure titles or books they consider too risky to put in the rental system.\n\n=== Textbook sharing ===\nAnother method to help students save money that is coming up is called Textbooks Sharing. Using textbook sharing the students share the physical textbook with other students, and also the cost of the book is divided among the users of the textbook. So over the life of the textbook, if 4 students use the textbook, the cost of the textbook for each student will be 25% of the total cost of the book.\n\n=== Open textbooks ===\n{{main|Open textbook}}\nThe latest trend in textbooks is \"open textbooks.\" An [[open textbook]] is a free, openly licensed textbook offered online by the copyright holders.

Currently, some open textbooks have been funded with non-profit investment.\n\nThe other challenge involves the reality of publishing, which is that textbooks with good sales and profitability subsidize the creation and publication of low demand but believed to be necessary textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Subsidies skew markets and the elimination of subsidies is disruptive; in the case of low demand textbooks the possibilities following subsidy removal include any or all of the following: higher retail prices, a switch to open textbooks, a reduction of the number of titles published.\n\nOn the other hand, independent open textbook authoring and publishing models are developing.  Most notably, the startup publisher [[Flat World Knowledge]] already has dozens of college-level open textbooks that are used by  more than 900 institutions in 44 countries.<ref>[http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ Flat World Knowledge President Eric Frank Addresses Oregon Legislators on Solving Textbook Affordability.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223233038/http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ |date=2011-02-23 }} Pressitt.

Retailers and publishers have expressed concern about the re-importation of lower-priced textbooks from international locations. Specifically, they cited the ability students have to purchase books from online distribution channels outside the United States at lower prices, which may result in a loss of sales for U.S. retailers. Additionally, the availability of lower-priced textbooks through these channels has heightened distrust and frustration among students regarding textbook prices, and college stores find it difficult to explain why their textbook prices are higher, according to the National Association of College Stores. Retailers and publishers have also been concerned that some U.S. retailers may have engaged in reimportation on a large scale by ordering textbooks for entire courses at lower prices from international distribution channels.  While the 1998 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision [[Quality King v. L'anza]] protects the reimportation of copyrighted materials under the [[first-sale doctrine]], textbook publishers have still attempted to prevent the U.S. sale of international editions by enforcing contracts which forbid foreign wholesalers from selling to American distributors.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tamar |last=Lewin |title=Students Find $100 Textbooks Cost $50, Purchased Overseas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 October 2003 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916004116/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |archivedate=16 September 2009 }}</ref> Concerned about the effects of differential pricing on college stores, the National Association of College Stores has called on publishers to stop the practice of selling textbooks at lower prices outside the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Testimony of Marc L.

The authors often getting half-royalties instead of full-royalties, minus the charges for returned books from bookstores.\n\n===Production===\n\n====Cost distribution====\nAccording to the National Association of College Stores, the entire cost of the book is justified by expenses, with typically 11.7% of the price of a new book going to the author's royalties (or a committee of editors at the publishing house), 22.7% going to the store, and 64.6% going to the publisher.  The store and publisher amounts are slightly higher for Canada. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\nBookstores and used-book vendors profit from the resale of textbooks on the used market, with publishers only earning profits on sales of new textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n====Research====\nAccording to the GAO study published July 2005:\n\n<blockquote>\nFollowing closely behind annual increases in tuition and fees at postsecondary institutions, college textbook and supply prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades.\n\nRising at an average of 6 per cent each year since the academic year 1987-1988, compared with overall average price increases of 3 per cent per year, college textbook and supply prices trailed tuition and fee increases, which averaged 7 per cent per year. Since December 1986, textbook and supply prices have nearly tripled, increasing by 186 per cent, while tuition and fees increased by 240 per cent and overall prices grew by 72 per cent. While increases in textbook and supply prices have followed increases in tuition and fees, the cost of textbooks and supplies for degree-seeking students as a percentage of tuition and fees varies by the type of institution attended. For example, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student for the academic year 2003-2004 was $898 at 4-year public institutions, or about 26 per cent of the cost of tuition and fees. At 2-year public institutions, where low-income students are more likely to pursue a degree program and tuition and fees are lower, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student was $886 in the academic year 2003-2004, representing almost three-quarters of the cost of tuition and fees.<ref name=GAO/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to the 2nd edition of a study by the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) published in February 2005{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''\"Textbook prices are increasing at more than four times the inflation rate for all finished goods, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index. The wholesale prices charged by textbook publishers have jumped 62 per cent since 1994, while prices charged for all finished goods increased only 14 per cent. Similarly, the prices charged by publishers for general books increased just 19 per cent during the same time period.\"''\n\nAccording to the 2007 edition of the College Board's Trend in College Pricing Report published October 2007{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''\"College costs continue to rise and federal student aid has shown slower growth when adjusted for inflation, while textbooks, as a percentage of total college costs, have remained steady at about 5 per cent.\"''\n\n==K-12 textbooks==\nIn most U.S. [[K-12]] public schools, a local school board votes on which textbooks to purchase from a selection of books that have been approved by the state Department of Education. Teachers receive the books to give to the students for each subject. Teachers are usually not required to use textbooks, however, and many prefer to use other materials instead.\n\nTextbook publishing in the U.S. is a business primarily aimed at large states. This is due to state purchasing controls over the books, most notably in Texas, where the [[Texas Education Agency]] sets curricula for all courses taught by the state's 1,000+ school districts, and therefore also approves which textbooks can be purchased.\n\n===High school===\nIn recent years, high school textbooks of United States history have come under increasing criticism. Authors such as [[Howard Zinn]] (''[[A People's History of the United States]]''), [[Gilbert T. Sewall]] (''[[Textbooks: Where the Curriculum Meets the Child]]'') and [[James W. Loewen]] (''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong]]''), make the claim that [[History of the United States|U.S. history]] textbooks contain mythical untruths and omissions, which paint a whitewashed picture that bears little resemblance to what most students learn in universities. Inaccurately retelling history, through textbooks or other literature, has been practised in many societies, from ancient [[Rome]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[People's Republic of China]]. The content of history textbooks is often determined by the political forces of state adoption boards and ideological pressure groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nScience textbooks have been the source of ongoing debates and have come under scrutiny from several organizations. The presentation or inclusion of controversial scientific material has been debated in several court cases. Poorly designed textbooks have been cited as contributing to declining grades in mathematics and science in the United States and organizations such as the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (AAAS) have criticized the layout, presentation, and amount of material given in textbooks.\n\nDiscussions of textbooks have been included on [[Creationism|creation]] and [[evolution]] in the public education debate. The ''[[Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County]]'' case brought forward a debate about scientific fact being presented in textbooks.\n\nIn his book, ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]'', the late physics [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Richard P. Feynman]] described his experiences as a member of a committee that evaluated science textbooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|title=Book Review: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!|work=Textbooks.org - Compare Textbook Prices|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508135103/http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|archivedate=8 May 2016}}</ref> At some instances, there were nonsensical examples to illustrate physical phenomena; then a company sent \u2014 for reasons of timing \u2014 a textbook that contained blank pages, which even got good critiques. Feynman himself experienced attempts at bribery.\n\n== Mathematics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\nLargely in the US, but increasingly in other nations, K-12 Mathematics textbooks have reflected the controversies of [[new math]] and [[reform mathematics]] which have sought to replace [[traditional mathematics]] in what have been called the [[math wars]]. Traditional texts, still favored in Asia and other areas, merely taught the same time-tested mathematics that most adults have learned. By contrast \"progressive\" approaches seek to address problems in social inequity{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with approaches that often incorporate principles of [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivism]] and discovery. Texts such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space|TERC]] and [[Connected Mathematics|CMP]] discourage or omit standard mathematics methods and concepts such as long division and lowest common denominators. For example, an index entry to multiply fractions would lead to \"devise your own method to multiply fractions which work on these examples\", and the formula for the area of a circle would be an exercise for a student to derive rather than including it in the student text. By the 2000s, while some districts were still adopting the more novel methods, others had abandoned them as unworkable.\n\n==Higher education==\nIn the U.S., college and university textbooks are chosen by the professor teaching the course, or by the department as a whole. Students are typically responsible for obtaining their own copies of the books used in their courses, although alternatives to owning textbooks, such as textbook rental services and library reserve copies of texts, are available in some instances.\n\nIn some European countries, such as Sweden or Spain, students attending institutions of higher education pay for textbooks themselves, although higher education is free of charge otherwise.\n\nWith higher education costs on the rise, many students are becoming sensitive to every aspect of college pricing, including textbooks, which in many cases amount to one tenth of tuition costs. The 2005 Government Accountability Office report on college textbooks said that since the 1980s, textbook and supply prices have risen twice the rate of inflation in the past two decades{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.  A 2005 PIRG study found that textbooks cost students $900 per year, and that prices <ref name=GAO /> increased four times the rate of inflation over the past decade.<ref>[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition Rip-off 101: Second Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064841/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition |date=2010-03-14 }}, The Student PIRGs (2005)</ref>  A June 2007 Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) report, \u201cTurn the Page,\u201d reported that the average U.S. student spends $700\u2013$1000 per year on textbooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|title=Archived: Advisory Committee for Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) - U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509204934/http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|archivedate=9 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile many groups have assigned blame to publishers, bookstores or faculty, the ACSFA also found that assigning blame to any one party\u2014faculty, colleges, bookstores or publishers\u2014for current textbook costs is unproductive and without merit. The report called on all parties within the industry to work together to find productive solutions, which included a movement toward [[open textbook]]s and other lower-cost digital solutions.\n\nTextbook prices are considerably higher in law school. Students ordinarily pay close to $200 for case books consisting of cases available free online.\n\n==Textbook bias on controversial topics==\nIn cases of history, science, current events, and political textbooks, \"the writer might be biased towards one way or another. Topics such as actions of a country, presidential actions, and scientific theories are common potential biases\".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[John Amos Comenius]] - \"the innovator who first introduced pictorial textbooks, written in native language instead of Latin, applied effective teaching based on the natural gradual growth from simple to more comprehensive concepts, supported lifelong learning and development of logical thinking by moving from dull memorization\"\n*[[Orbis Pictus]] - 1658 textbook by [[Comenius]], one of the first books with pictures for children\n*[[Casebook]] - A special type of textbook used in [[Law school in the United States|law schools in the United States]].\n*[[Kirtsaeng v.

For example, [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] wrote educational texts. The modern textbook has its roots in the mass production made possible by the printing press. [[Johannes Gutenberg]] himself may have printed editions of ''Ars Minor'', a schoolbook on Latin grammar by [[Aelius Donatus]]. Early textbooks were used by tutors and teachers (e.g. alphabet books), as well as by individuals who taught themselves.\n\nThe Greek philosopher [[Socrates]] lamented the loss of knowledge because the media of transmission were changing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130020156/http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |archivedate=2013-01-30 }} True Stuff: Socrates vs. the Written Word, January 27th, 2011. By David Malki</ref> Before the invention of the [[Greek alphabet]] 2,500 years ago, knowledge and stories were recited aloud, much like [[Homer]]'s epic poems. The new technology of writing meant stories no longer needed to be memorized, a development Socrates feared would weaken the Greeks' mental capacities for memorizing and retelling. (Ironically, we know about Socrates' concerns only because they were written down by his student [[Plato]] in his famous Dialogues.) <ref>Marcia Clemmitt, \"Learning Online Literacy,\" in \"Reading Crisis?\" CQ Researcher, Feb. 22, 2008, pp. 169-192.</ref>\n\nThe next revolution in the field of books came with the 15th-century invention of printing with changeable type. The invention is attributed to German metalsmith Johannes Gutenberg, who cast type in molds using a melted metal alloy and constructed a wooden-screw [[printing press]] to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nGutenberg's first and only large-scale printing effort was the now iconic [[Gutenberg Bible]] in the 1450s \u2014 a Latin translation from the Hebrew Old Testament and the [[Greek New Testament]]. Gutenberg's invention made mass production of texts possible for the first time. Although the Gutenberg Bible itself was expensive, printed books began to spread widely over European trade routes during the next 50 years, and by the 16th century, printed books had become more widely accessible and less costly.<ref>British Library, \"Treasures in Full: Gutenberg Bible,\" http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/background.html.</ref>\n\nWhile many textbooks were already in use, [[compulsory education]] and the resulting growth of schooling in Europe led to the printing of many more textbooks for children. Textbooks have been the primary teaching instrument for most children since the 19th century. Two textbooks of historical significance in United States schooling were the 18th century [[New England Primer]] and the 19th century [[McGuffey Readers]].\n\nRecent technological advances have changed the way people interact with textbooks. Online and digital materials are making it increasingly easy for students to access materials other than the traditional print textbook. Students now have access to electronic books (\"e-books\"), online tutoring systems and video lectures. An example of an e-book is ''[[Principles of Biology]]'' from [[Nature Publishing Group|Nature Publishing]].\n\nMost notably, an increasing number of authors are avoiding commercial publishers and instead offering their textbooks under a [[creative commons]] or other open license.\n\n==Market==\n\n===The market for textbooks===\nAs in many industries, the number of providers has declined in recent years (there are just a handful of major textbook companies in the USA).<ref>Rose, Marla Matzer.

Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus wholesaler for 0-30% of the new cost, for distribution to other bookstores.  Some textbook companies have countered this by encouraging teachers to assign homework that must be done on the publisher's website. Students with a new textbook can use the pass code in the book to register on the site; otherwise they must pay the publisher to access the website and complete assigned homework.\n\nStudents who look beyond the campus bookstore can typically find lower prices. With the ISBN or title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online used book sellers or retailers.\n\nMost leading textbook companies publish a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently in math and science. Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions are often not about significant improvements to the content. \"New editions are to a considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and textbook authors to maintain their revenue stream, that is, to keep up prices.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/3/4/professors-find-differents-uses-for-textbook |title=Professors Find Different Uses for Textbook Profits |first1=Alissa |last1=D\u2019gama |first2=Benjamin |last2=Jaffe |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |date=March 4, 2008 |access-date=July 14, 2019 }}</ref>  A study conducted by The Student [[Public Interest Research Group|PIRGs]] found that a new edition costs 12% more than a new copy of the previous edition (not surprising if the old version is obsolete), and 58% more than a used copy of the previous edition.

Students often cannot buy these things separately, and often the one-time-use supplements destroy the resale value of the textbook.<ref name=\"required-reading\">[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/required-reading Required Reading: A Look at the Words Publishing Tactics at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064817/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/required-reading |date=2010-03-14 }}, The Student PIRGs (2006)</ref>\n\nAccording to the Student PIRGs, the typical bundled textbook is 10%-50% more{{clarify|date=January 2019}} than an unbundled textbook, and 65% of professors said they \u201crarely\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d use the bundled items in their courses.<ref name=\"ripoff-101\"/>\n\nA 2005 [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) Report in the USA found that the production of these supplemental items was the primary cause of rapidly increasing prices:\n<blockquote>\nWhile publishers, retailers, and wholesalers all play a role in textbook pricing, the primary factor contributing to increases in the price of textbooks has been the increased investment publishers have made in new products to enhance instruction and learning...While wholesalers, retailers, and others do not question the quality of these materials, they have expressed concern that the publishers\u2019 practice \nof packaging supplements with a textbook to sell as one unit limits the opportunity students have to purchase less expensive used books....If publishers continue to increase these investments, particularly in technology, the cost to produce a textbook is likely to continue to increase in the future.<ref name=GAO>\"[http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-05-806 College Textbooks: Enhanced Offerings Appear to Drive Recent Price Increases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619071824/http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-05-806 |date=2008-06-19 }}.\" U.S. Government Accountability Office, Washington, DC, 2005.

Each combination of a textbook and supplemental items receives a separate ISBN. A single textbook could therefore have dozens of ISBNs that denote different combinations of supplements packaged with that particular book. When a bookstore attempts to track down used copies of textbooks, they will search for the ISBN the course instructor orders, which will locate only a subset of the copies of the textbook.\n\nLegislation at state and federal levels seeks to limit the practice of bundling, by requiring publishers to offer all components separately.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 Analysis of Textbook Affordability Provisions in H.R. 4137] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124161237/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 |date=2009-11-24 }}, The Student PIRGs</ref>  Publishers have testified in favor of bills including this provision,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|title=House Committee on Education (03/06/2008)|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413042944/http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|archivedate=13 April 2008}}</ref>  but only in the case that the provision exempts the loosely defined category of \"integrated textbooks.\"  The Federal bill<ref>\"[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.04137: Higher Education Opportunity Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921103240/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.04137: |date=2008-09-21 }}.\" H.R.4137, U.S. House of Representatives, 110th Congress (2007-2008.)

Students can sell to 1) the college/university bookstore; 2) fellow students; 3) a number of online websites; or 4) a student swap service.\n\n====Campus buyback====\nAs for buyback on a specific campus, faculty decisions largely determine how much a student receives. If a professor chooses to use the same book the following semester, even if it is a custom text, designed specifically for an individual instructor, bookstores often buy the book back. The GAO report found that, generally, if a book is in good condition and will be used on the campus again the next term, bookstores will pay students 50 percent of the original price paid. If the bookstore has not received a faculty order for the book at the end of the term and the edition is still current, they may offer students the wholesale price of the book, which could range from 5 to 35 percent of the new retail price, according to the GAO report.<ref name=GAO/>\n\nWhen students resell their textbooks during campus \u201cbuyback\u201d periods, these textbooks are often sold into the national used textbook distribution chain.  If a textbook is not going to be used on campus for the next semester of courses then many times the college bookstore will sell that book to a national used book company.  The used book company then resells the book to another college bookstore.  Finally, that book is sold as used to a student at another college at a price that is typically 75% of the new book price. At each step, a markup is applied to the book to enable the respective companies to continue to operate.\n\n====Student to student sales====\nStudents can also sell or trade textbooks among themselves. After completing a course, sellers will often seek out members of the next enrolling class, people who are likely to be interested in purchasing the required books. This may be done by posting flyers to advertise the sale of the books or simply soliciting individuals who are shopping in the college bookstore for the same titles. Many larger schools have independent websites set up for the purpose of facilitating such trade. These often operate much like digital classified ads, enabling students to list their items for sale and browse for those they wish to acquire. Also, at the [[US Air Force Academy]], it is possible to [[e-mail]] entire specific classes, allowing for an extensive network of textbook sales to exist.\n\n====Student online marketplaces====\nOnline marketplaces are one of the two major types of online websites students can use to sell used textbooks. Online marketplaces may have an [[Online auction business model|online auction]] format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price. In either case, the student must create the listing for each book themselves and wait for a buyer to order, making the use of marketplaces a more passive way of selling used textbooks. Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using online marketplaces, and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.\n\n====Online book buyers====\nOnline book buyers buy textbooks, and sometimes other types of books, with the aim of reselling them for a profit. Like online marketplaces, online book buyers operate year-round, giving students the opportunity to sell their books even when campus \"buyback\" periods are not in effect. Students enter the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] numbers of the books they wish to sell and receive a price quote or offer. These online book buyers often offer \"free shipping\" (which in actuality is built into the offer for the book), and allow students to sell multiple books to the same source. Because online book buyers are buying books for resale, the prices they offer may be lower than students can get on online marketplaces. However, their prices are competitive, and they tend to focus on the convenience of their service. Some even claim that buying used textbooks online and selling them to online book buyers has a lower total cost than even textbook rental services.\n\n====Textbook exchanges====\nIn response to escalating textbook prices, limited competition, and to provide a more efficient system to connect buyers and sellers together, online textbook exchanges were developed. Most of today's sites handle buyer and seller payments, and usually deduct a small commission only after the sale is completed.\n\nAccording to textbook author [[Henry L. Roediger III|Henry L. Roediger]] (and Wadsworth Publishing Company senior editor Vicki Knight), the used textbook market is illegitimate, and entirely to blame for the rising costs of textbooks.  As methods of \"dealing with this problem\", he recommends making previous editions of textbooks obsolete, binding the textbook with other materials, and passing laws to prevent the sale of used books.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-are-textbooks-so-expensive|magazine=Observer|publisher=Association for Psychological Science|title=Why Are Textbooks So Expensive?|author=Henry L.

The intent is to make users understand that the content of any textbook is the intellectual property of the author and/or the publisher, and that as such, subject to copyright. Obviously, this idea is completely opposed to the millennia-old tradition of the sale of [[used book]]s, and would make that entire industry illegal.\n\n==== E-textbooks ====\nAnother alternative to save money and obtaining the materials you are required are e-textbooks. The article \"E books rewrite the rules of education\" states that, alternately to spending a lot of money on textbooks, you can purchase an e-textbook at a small amount of the cost. With the growth of digital applications for iPhone, and gadgets like the Amazon kindle, e-textbooks are not an innovation, but have been \"gaining momentum\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ebooks Rewrite the Rules of Education|url = http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|website = EContent Magazine|last = Mullan|first = Eileen|date = 4 May 2009|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180317231848/http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|archivedate = 17 March 2018}}</ref> According to the article \" Are textbooks obsolete?\", publishers and editorials are concerned about the issue of expensive textbooks. \"The expense of textbooks is a concern for students, and e-textbooks, address the face of the issue, Williams says \" As publishers we understand the high cost of these materials, and the electronic format  permit us diminish the general expense of our content to the market\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Are textbooks obsolete?

Some stores use a hybrid of both methods, opting for in-store selections of the most popular books and the online option for more obscure titles or books they consider too risky to put in the rental system.\n\n=== Textbook sharing ===\nAnother method to help students save money that is coming up is called Textbooks Sharing. Using textbook sharing the students share the physical textbook with other students, and also the cost of the book is divided among the users of the textbook. So over the life of the textbook, if 4 students use the textbook, the cost of the textbook for each student will be 25% of the total cost of the book.\n\n=== Open textbooks ===\n{{main|Open textbook}}\nThe latest trend in textbooks is \"open textbooks.\" An [[open textbook]] is a free, openly licensed textbook offered online by the copyright holders.  According to PIRG, a number of textbooks already exist, and are being used at schools such as MIT and Harvard.<ref>See PIRG's [http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog Catalog of Open Textbooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324125700/http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog |date=2010-03-24 }} for examples of open textbooks</ref> A 2010 study published found that open textbooks offer a viable and attractive means to meet faculty and student needs while offering savings of approximately 80% compared to traditional textbook options.<ref>[http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf A Cover to Cover Solution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226015800/http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf |date=2010-12-26 }} by Nicole Allen of the Student PIRGs. 2010.</ref>\n\nAlthough the largest question seems to be who is going to pay to write them, several state policies suggest that public investment in open textbooks might make sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|title=AB 2261 Assembly Bill - INTRODUCED|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304135209/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} To offer another perspective{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, any jurisdiction might find itself challenged to find sufficient numbers of credible academics who would be willing to undertake the effort of creating an open textbook without realistic compensation, in order to make such a proposal work. Currently, some open textbooks have been funded with non-profit investment.\n\nThe other challenge involves the reality of publishing, which is that textbooks with good sales and profitability subsidize the creation and publication of low demand but believed to be necessary textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Subsidies skew markets and the elimination of subsidies is disruptive; in the case of low demand textbooks the possibilities following subsidy removal include any or all of the following: higher retail prices, a switch to open textbooks, a reduction of the number of titles published.\n\nOn the other hand, independent open textbook authoring and publishing models are developing.

Retailers and publishers have expressed concern about the re-importation of lower-priced textbooks from international locations. Specifically, they cited the ability students have to purchase books from online distribution channels outside the United States at lower prices, which may result in a loss of sales for U.S. retailers. Additionally, the availability of lower-priced textbooks through these channels has heightened distrust and frustration among students regarding textbook prices, and college stores find it difficult to explain why their textbook prices are higher, according to the National Association of College Stores. Retailers and publishers have also been concerned that some U.S. retailers may have engaged in reimportation on a large scale by ordering textbooks for entire courses at lower prices from international distribution channels.  While the 1998 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision [[Quality King v. L'anza]] protects the reimportation of copyrighted materials under the [[first-sale doctrine]], textbook publishers have still attempted to prevent the U.S. sale of international editions by enforcing contracts which forbid foreign wholesalers from selling to American distributors.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tamar |last=Lewin |title=Students Find $100 Textbooks Cost $50, Purchased Overseas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 October 2003 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916004116/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |archivedate=16 September 2009 }}</ref> Concerned about the effects of differential pricing on college stores, the National Association of College Stores has called on publishers to stop the practice of selling textbooks at lower prices outside the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Testimony of Marc L.

The authors often getting half-royalties instead of full-royalties, minus the charges for returned books from bookstores.\n\n===Production===\n\n====Cost distribution====\nAccording to the National Association of College Stores, the entire cost of the book is justified by expenses, with typically 11.7% of the price of a new book going to the author's royalties (or a committee of editors at the publishing house), 22.7% going to the store, and 64.6% going to the publisher.  The store and publisher amounts are slightly higher for Canada. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\nBookstores and used-book vendors profit from the resale of textbooks on the used market, with publishers only earning profits on sales of new textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n====Research====\nAccording to the GAO study published July 2005:\n\n<blockquote>\nFollowing closely behind annual increases in tuition and fees at postsecondary institutions, college textbook and supply prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades.\n\nRising at an average of 6 percent each year since academic year 1987-1988, compared with overall average price increases of 3 percent per year, college textbook and supply prices trailed tuition and fee increases, which averaged 7 percent per year. Since December 1986, textbook and supply prices have nearly tripled, increasing by 186 percent, while tuition and fees increased by 240 percent and overall prices grew by 72 percent. While increases in textbook and supply prices have followed increases in tuition and fees, the cost of textbooks and supplies for degree-seeking students as a percentage of tuition and fees varies by the type of institution attended. For example, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student for academic year 2003-2004 was $898 at 4-year public institutions, or about 26 percent of the cost of tuition and fees. At 2-year public institutions, where low-income students are more likely to pursue a degree program and tuition and fees are lower, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student was $886 in academic year 2003-2004, representing almost three-quarters of the cost of tuition and fees.<ref name=GAO/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to the 2nd edition of a study by the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) published in February 2005{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''\"Textbook prices are increasing at more than four times the inflation rate for all finished goods, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index. The wholesale prices charged by textbook publishers have jumped 62 percent since 1994, while prices charged for all finished goods increased only 14 percent. Similarly, the prices charged by publishers for general books increased just 19 percent during the same time period.\"''\n\nAccording to the 2007 edition of the College Board's Trend in College Pricing Report published October 2007{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''\"College costs continue to rise and federal student aid has shown slower growth when adjusted for inflation, while textbooks, as a percentage of total college costs, have remained steady at about 5 percent.\"''\n\n==K-12 textbooks==\nIn most U.S. [[K-12]] public schools, a local school board votes on which textbooks to purchase from a selection of books that have been approved by the state Department of Education. Teachers receive the books to give to the students for each subject. Teachers are usually not required to use textbooks, however, and many prefer to use other materials instead.\n\nTextbook publishing in the U.S. is a business primarily aimed at large states. This is due to state purchasing controls over the books, most notably in Texas, where the [[Texas Education Agency]] sets curricula for all courses taught by the state's 1,000+ school districts, and therefore also approves which textbooks can be purchased.\n\n===High school===\nIn recent years, high school textbooks of United States history have come under increasing criticism. Authors such as [[Howard Zinn]] (''[[A People's History of the United States]]''), [[Gilbert T. Sewall]] (''[[Textbooks: Where the Curriculum Meets the Child]]'') and [[James W. Loewen]] (''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong]]''), make the claim that [[History of the United States|U.S. history]] textbooks contain mythical untruths and omissions, which paint a whitewashed picture that bears little resemblance to what most students learn in universities. Inaccurately retelling history, through textbooks or other literature, has been practiced in many societies, from ancient [[Rome]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[People's Republic of China]]. The content of history textbooks is often determined by the political forces of state adoption boards and ideological pressure groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nScience textbooks have been the source of ongoing debates and have come under scrutiny from several organizations. The presentation or inclusion of controversial scientific material has been debated in several court cases. Poorly designed textbooks have been cited as contributing to declining grades in mathematics and science in the United States and organizations such as the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (AAAS) have criticized the layout, presentation, and amount of material given in textbooks.\n\nDiscussions of textbooks have been included on [[Creationism|creation]] and [[evolution]] in the public education debate. The ''[[Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County]]'' case brought forward a debate about scientific fact being presented in textbooks.\n\nIn his book, ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]'', the late physics [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Richard P. Feynman]] described his experiences as a member of a committee that evaluated science textbooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|title=Book Review: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!|work=Textbooks.org - Compare Textbook Prices|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508135103/http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|archivedate=8 May 2016}}</ref> At some instances, there were nonsensical examples to illustrate physical phenomena; then a company sent \u2014 for reasons of timing \u2014 a textbook that contained blank pages, which even got good critiques. Feynman himself experienced attempts at bribery.\n\n== Mathematics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\nLargely in the US, but increasingly in other nations, K-12 Mathematics textbooks have reflected the controversies of [[new math]] and [[reform mathematics]] which have sought to replace [[traditional mathematics]] in what have been called the [[math wars]]. Traditional texts, still favored in Asia and other areas, merely taught the same time-tested mathematics that most adults have learned. By contrast \"progressive\" approaches seek to address problems in social inequity{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with approaches that often incorporate principles of [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivism]] and discovery. Texts such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space|TERC]] and [[Connected Mathematics|CMP]] discourage or omit standard mathematics methods and concepts such as long division and lowest common denominators. For example, an index entry to multiply fractions would lead to \"devise your own method to multiply fractions which work on these examples\", and the formula for the area of a circle would be an exercise for a student to derive rather than including it in the student text. By the 2000s, while some districts were still adopting the more novel methods, others had abandoned them as unworkable.\n\n==Higher education==\nIn the U.S., college and university textbooks are chosen by the professor teaching the course, or by the department as a whole. Students are typically responsible for obtaining their own copies of the books used in their courses, although alternatives to owning textbooks, such as textbook rental services and library reserve copies of texts, are available in some instances.\n\nIn some European countries, such as Sweden or Spain, students attending institutions of higher education pay for textbooks themselves, although higher education is free of charge otherwise.\n\nWith higher education costs on the rise, many students are becoming sensitive to every aspect of college pricing, including textbooks, which in many cases amount to one tenth of tuition costs. The 2005 Government Accountability Office report on college textbooks said that since the 1980s, textbook and supply prices have risen twice the rate of inflation in the past two decades{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.  A 2005 PIRG study found that textbooks cost students $900 per year, and that prices <ref name=GAO /> increased four times the rate of inflation over the past decade.<ref>[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition Rip-off 101: Second Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064841/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition |date=2010-03-14 }}, The Student PIRGs (2005)</ref>  A June 2007 Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) report, \u201cTurn the Page,\u201d reported that the average U.S. student spends $700\u2013$1000 per year on textbooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|title=Archived: Advisory Committee for Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) - U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509204934/http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|archivedate=9 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile many groups have assigned blame to publishers, bookstores or faculty, the ACSFA also found that assigning blame to any one party\u2014faculty, colleges, bookstores or publishers\u2014for current textbook costs is unproductive and without merit. The report called on all parties within the industry to work together to find productive solutions, which included a movement toward [[open textbook]]s and other lower-cost digital solutions.\n\nTextbook prices are considerably higher in law school. Students ordinarily pay close to $200 for case books consisting of cases available free online.\n\n==Textbook bias on controversial topics==\nIn cases of history, science, current events, and political textbooks, \"the writer might be biased towards one way or another. Topics such as actions of a country, presidential actions, and scientific theories are common potential biases\".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[John Amos Comenius]] - \"the innovator who first introduced pictorial textbooks, written in native language instead of Latin, applied effective teaching based on the natural gradual growth from simple to more comprehensive concepts, supported lifelong learning and development of logical thinking by moving from dull memorization\"\n*[[Orbis Pictus]] - 1658 textbook by [[Comenius]], one of the first books with pictures for children\n*[[Casebook]] - A special type of textbook used in [[Law school in the United States|law schools in the United States]].\n*[[Kirtsaeng v.

He said it was also probably the \"green crescent moon\" seen in New Zealand and later in North America in 1886, for periods of less than a half-hour each time. He said this was the \"second moon\" seen by  Waltemath in 1898. Wiggins hypothesized that the second moon had a high carbon atmosphere but could be seen occasionally by its reflected light.<ref>Edmonton Bulletin, June 12, 1907</ref>\n\nThe existence of these objects put forward by Waltemath (and Wiggins) was discredited after the absence of corroborating observation by other members of the [[scientific community]].

The franchise centers on a series of fantasy and science fantasy [[role-playing video game]]s. The [[Final Fantasy (video game)|first game in the series]] was released in 1987, with 14 other main-numbered entries being released since then. The franchise has since branched into other [[video game genres]] such as [[tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]], [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]], [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing]], [[racing video game|racing]], [[third-person shooter]], [[Fighting game|fighting]], and [[Rhythm game|rhythm]], as well as branching into other media, including [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] films, [[anime]], [[manga]], and [[novel]]s.\n\n''Final Fantasy'' installments are generally stand-alone stories, each with different settings, plots and main characters, but the franchise is linked by several recurring elements, including game mechanics and recurring character names. Each plot centers on a particular group of heroes who are battling a great evil, but also explores the characters' internal struggles and relationships. Character names are frequently derived from the history, languages, [[pop culture]], and [[mythologies]] of cultures worldwide. The mechanics of each game involve similar battle systems and maps.\n\nThe ''Final Fantasy'' video game series has been both critically and commercially successful, selling more than {{Nowrap|149 million}} games worldwide, making it one of the [[best-selling video game franchises]] of all time. The series is well known for its innovation, visuals, and music, such as the inclusion of [[full motion video|full-motion video]]s (FMVs), [[Photorealism|photorealistic]] character models, and music by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. It has been a driving force in the [[video game industry]], and the series has affected Square Enix's business practices and its relationships with other [[video game developer]]s. It has popularized many features now common in role-playing games, also popularizing the genre as a whole in markets outside [[Japan]].\n\n== Media ==\n{{Further|List of Final Fantasy media}}\n\n=== Games ===\n{{Main|List of Final Fantasy video games}}\n\nThe [[Final Fantasy (video game)|first installment]] of the series was released in Japan on December 18, 1987. Subsequent games are numbered and given a story unrelated to previous games, so the numbers refer to volumes rather than to sequels. Many ''Final Fantasy'' games have been [[Internationalization and localization|localized]] for markets in North America, Europe, and Australia on numerous [[video game console]]s, [[personal computer]]s (PC), and [[mobile phone]]s. Future installments will appear on [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh]] and [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation consoles]]. As of November 2016, the series includes the main installments from ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' to ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', as well as direct sequels and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s, both released and confirmed as being in development.

In 1987, Square designer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] chose to create a new fantasy role-playing game for the cartridge-based NES, and drew inspiration from popular fantasy games: [[Enix]]'s ''[[Dragon Warrior|Dragon Quest]]'', Nintendo's ''[[The Legend of Zelda (1986 video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', and [[Origin Systems]]'s [[Ultima (series)|''Ultima'' series]]. Though often attributed to the company allegedly facing bankruptcy, Sakaguchi explained that the game was his personal last-ditch effort in the game industry and that its title, ''Final Fantasy'', stemmed from his feelings at the time; had the game not sold well, he would have quit the business and gone back to university.<ref name=\"developmentFF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/28960/Sakaguchi-discusses-the-development-of-Final-Fantasy |title=Sakaguchi discusses the development of Final Fantasy |author=Fear, Ed |date=December 13, 2007 |work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] |publisher=Intent Media |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809114048/http://www.develop-online.net/news/28960/Sakaguchi-discusses-the-development-of-Final-Fantasy |archivedate=August 9, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"IntroSE\">{{cite web|title=An Introduction to Square-Enix |url=http://features.teamxbox.com/xbox/1554/An-Introduction-to-SquareEnix/p2/ |publisher=IGN |work=[[TeamXbox]] |last=Berardini |first=C\u00e9sar A. |date=April 26, 2006 |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716200245/http://features.teamxbox.com/xbox/1554/An-Introduction-to-SquareEnix/p2/ |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"FF-Retro-1\">{{cite web| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-i-final-fantasy/22250| title = Final Fantasy Retrospective Part&nbsp;I| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = July 15, 2007| accessdate = August 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLzVucK9LcQ |archivedate=June 8, 2009 }}</ref> Despite his explanation, publications have also attributed the name to the company's hopes that the project would solve its financial troubles.<ref name=\"IntroSE\"/><ref name=\"GS-FFHistory\">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/| title = The History of Final Fantasy: Introduction| work = The History of Final Fantasy| last = Vestal| first = Andrew| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate = August 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210055911/http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/ |archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> In 2015, Sakaguchi explained the name's origin: the team wanted a title that would abbreviate to \"''FF''\", which would sound good in Japanese. The name was originally going to be ''Fighting Fantasy'', but due to concerns over trademark conflicts with the [[Fighting Fantasy|roleplaying gamebook series of the same name]], they needed to settle for something else.

Because Sakaguchi assumed ''Final Fantasy'' would be a stand-alone game, its story was not designed to be expanded by a sequel. The developers instead chose to carry over only thematic similarities from its predecessor, while some of the [[gameplay]] elements, such as the character advancement system, were overhauled. This approach has continued throughout the series; each major ''Final Fantasy'' game features a new setting, a new cast of characters, and an upgraded battle system.<ref name=\"GT-FFRetrospectiveII\"/> Video game writer John Harris attributed the concept of reworking the game system of each installment to [[Nihon Falcom]]'s ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=13 |author=John Harris |title=Game Design Essentials: 20 RPGs - Dragon Slayer |website=[[Gamasutra]] |page=13 |date=July 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012154920/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=13 |archivedate=October 12, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with which Square was previously involved as a publisher.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kurt Kalata |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dragonslayer/dragonslayer.htm |title=Dragon Slayer |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142515/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dragonslayer/dragonslayer.htm |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The company regularly released new games in the main series.

Which is unfortunate, since I'm sure people would have enjoyed the game that much more if we could have left all our original ideas in. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206221711/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYIzjBbO2FQ |archivedate=December 6, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"FamitsuWatanabe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201407/11056946.html|title=\u300e\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fcXIII REMINISCENCE -tracer of memories-\u300f\u8457\u8005\u3001\u6e21\u8fba\u5927\u7950\u6c0f\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc|trans-title=Final Fantasy XIII: Reminiscence -tracer of memories-: Interview with author Daisuke Watanabe|work=[[Famitsu]]|date=July 11, 2014|accessdate=July 11, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711075338/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201407/11056946.html|archivedate=July 11, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ff6 magitek.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Final Fantasy&nbsp;VI]]'' artwork by [[Yoshitaka Amano]], who provided designs for much of the series]]\n\nArtistic design, including character and monster creations, was handled by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from ''Final Fantasy'' through ''Final Fantasy&nbsp;VI''.

Battle screens use more detailed, full versions of characters in a side-view perspective. This practice was used until ''Final Fantasy&nbsp;VI'', which uses detailed versions for both screens. The NES sprites are 26&nbsp;[[pixel]]s high and use a [[Palette (computing)|color palette]] of 4&nbsp;colors. 6&nbsp;[[Film frame|frames of animation]] are used to depict different character statuses like \"healthy\" and \"fatigued\". The SNES installments use updated graphics and effects, as well as higher quality audio than in previous games, but are otherwise similar to their predecessors in basic design. The SNES sprites are 2&nbsp;pixels shorter, but have larger palettes and feature more animation frames: 11&nbsp;colors and 40&nbsp;frames respectively. The upgrade allowed designers to have characters be more detailed in appearance and express more emotions. The first game includes [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) the player could interact with, but they are mostly static in-game objects. Beginning with the second game, Square used predetermined pathways for NPCs to create more dynamic scenes that include comedy and drama.<ref name=\"GT-FFRetrospectiveIV\">{{cite web| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-iv-final-fantasy/23185| title = Final Fantasy Retrospective Part&nbsp;IV| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = August 5, 2007| accessdate = August 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611203037/http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-iv-final-fantasy/23185 |archivedate=June 11, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Square showed an [[Final Fantasy VI#Legacy|interactive SGI technical demonstration]] of ''Final Fantasy VI'' for the then [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|next generation of consoles]].

The franchise centers on a series of fantasy and science fantasy [[role-playing video game]]s. The [[Final Fantasy (video game)|first game in the series]] was released in 1987, with 14 other main-numbered entries being released since then. The franchise has since branched into other [[video game genres]] such as [[tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]], [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]], [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing]], [[racing video game|racing]], [[third-person shooter]], [[Fighting game|fighting]], and [[Rhythm game|rhythm]], as well as branching into other media, including [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] films, [[anime]], [[manga]], and [[novel]]s.\n\n''Final Fantasy'' installments are generally stand-alone stories, each with different settings, plots and main characters, but the franchise is linked by several recurring elements, including game mechanics and recurring character names. Each plot centers on a particular group of heroes who are battling a great evil, but also explores the characters' internal struggles and relationships. Character names are frequently derived from the history, languages, [[pop culture]], and [[mythologies]] of cultures worldwide. The mechanics of each game involve similar battle systems and maps.\n\nThe ''Final Fantasy'' video game series has been both critically and commercially successful, selling more than {{Nowrap|149 million}} games worldwide, making it one of the [[best-selling video game franchises]] of all time. The series is well known for its innovation, visuals, and music, such as the inclusion of [[full motion video|full-motion video]]s (FMVs), [[Photorealism|photorealistic]] character models, and music by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. It has been a driving force in the [[video game industry]], and the series has affected Square Enix's business practices and its relationships with other [[video game developer]]s. It has popularized many features now common in role-playing games, also popularizing the genre as a whole in markets outside [[Japan]].\n\n== Media ==\n{{Further|List of Final Fantasy media}}\n\n=== Games ===\n{{Main|List of Final Fantasy video games}}\n\nThe [[Final Fantasy (video game)|first installment]] of the series was released in Japan on December 18, 1987. Subsequent games are numbered and given a story unrelated to previous games, so the numbers refer to volumes rather than to sequels. Many ''Final Fantasy'' games have been [[Internationalization and localization|localized]] for markets in North America, Europe, and Australia on numerous [[video game console]]s, [[personal computer]]s (PC), and [[mobile phone]]s. Future installments will appear on [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh]] and [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation consoles]]. As of November 2016, the series includes the main installments from ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' to ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', as well as direct sequels and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s, both released and confirmed as being in development.

In 1987, Square designer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] chose to create a new fantasy role-playing game for the cartridge-based NES, and drew inspiration from popular fantasy games: [[Enix]]'s ''[[Dragon Warrior|Dragon Quest]]'', Nintendo's ''[[The Legend of Zelda (1986 video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', and [[Origin Systems]]'s [[Ultima (series)|''Ultima'' series]]. Though often attributed to the company allegedly facing bankruptcy, Sakaguchi explained that the game was his personal last-ditch effort in the game industry and that its title, ''Final Fantasy'', stemmed from his feelings at the time; had the game not sold well, he would have quit the business and gone back to university.<ref name=\"developmentFF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/28960/Sakaguchi-discusses-the-development-of-Final-Fantasy |title=Sakaguchi discusses the development of Final Fantasy |author=Fear, Ed |date=December 13, 2007 |work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] |publisher=Intent Media |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809114048/http://www.develop-online.net/news/28960/Sakaguchi-discusses-the-development-of-Final-Fantasy |archivedate=August 9, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"IntroSE\">{{cite web|title=An Introduction to Square-Enix |url=http://features.teamxbox.com/xbox/1554/An-Introduction-to-SquareEnix/p2/ |publisher=IGN |work=[[TeamXbox]] |last=Berardini |first=C\u00e9sar A. |date=April 26, 2006 |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716200245/http://features.teamxbox.com/xbox/1554/An-Introduction-to-SquareEnix/p2/ |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"FF-Retro-1\">{{cite web| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-i-final-fantasy/22250| title = Final Fantasy Retrospective Part&nbsp;I| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = July 15, 2007| accessdate = August 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLzVucK9LcQ |archivedate=June 8, 2009 }}</ref> Despite his explanation, publications have also attributed the name to the company's hopes that the project would solve its financial troubles.<ref name=\"IntroSE\"/><ref name=\"GS-FFHistory\">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/| title = The History of Final Fantasy: Introduction| work = The History of Final Fantasy| last = Vestal| first = Andrew| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate = August 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210055911/http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/ |archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> In 2015, Sakaguchi explained the name's origin: the team wanted a title that would abbreviate to \"''FF''\", which would sound good in Japanese. The name was originally going to be ''Fighting Fantasy'', but due to concerns over trademark conflicts with the [[Fighting Fantasy|roleplaying gamebook series of the same name]], they needed to settle for something else.

Because Sakaguchi assumed ''Final Fantasy'' would be a stand-alone game, its story was not designed to be expanded by a sequel. The developers instead chose to carry over only thematic similarities from its predecessor, while some of the [[gameplay]] elements, such as the character advancement system, were overhauled. This approach has continued throughout the series; each major ''Final Fantasy'' game features a new setting, a new cast of characters, and an upgraded battle system.<ref name=\"GT-FFRetrospectiveII\"/> Video game writer John Harris attributed the concept of reworking the game system of each installment to [[Nihon Falcom]]'s ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=13 |author=John Harris |title=Game Design Essentials: 20 RPGs - Dragon Slayer |website=[[Gamasutra]] |page=13 |date=July 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012154920/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=13 |archivedate=October 12, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with which Square was previously involved as a publisher.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kurt Kalata |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dragonslayer/dragonslayer.htm |title=Dragon Slayer |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142515/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dragonslayer/dragonslayer.htm |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The company regularly released new games in the main series.

Which is unfortunate, since I'm sure people would have enjoyed the game that much more if we could have left all our original ideas in. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206221711/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYIzjBbO2FQ |archivedate=December 6, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"FamitsuWatanabe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201407/11056946.html|title=\u300e\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fcXIII REMINISCENCE -tracer of memories-\u300f\u8457\u8005\u3001\u6e21\u8fba\u5927\u7950\u6c0f\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc|trans-title=Final Fantasy XIII: Reminiscence -tracer of memories-: Interview with author Daisuke Watanabe|work=[[Famitsu]]|date=July 11, 2014|accessdate=July 11, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711075338/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201407/11056946.html|archivedate=July 11, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ff6 magitek.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Final Fantasy&nbsp;VI]]'' artwork by [[Yoshitaka Amano]], who provided designs for much of the series]]\n\nArtistic design, including character and monster creations, was handled by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from ''Final Fantasy'' through ''Final Fantasy&nbsp;VI''.

Battle screens use more detailed, full versions of characters in a side-view perspective. This practice was used until ''Final Fantasy&nbsp;VI'', which uses detailed versions for both screens. The NES sprites are 26&nbsp;[[pixel]]s high and use a [[Palette (computing)|color palette]] of 4&nbsp;colors. 6&nbsp;[[Film frame|frames of animation]] are used to depict different character statuses like \"healthy\" and \"fatigued\". The SNES installments use updated graphics and effects, as well as higher quality audio than in previous games, but are otherwise similar to their predecessors in basic design. The SNES sprites are 2&nbsp;pixels shorter, but have larger palettes and feature more animation frames: 11&nbsp;colors and 40&nbsp;frames respectively. The upgrade allowed designers to have characters be more detailed in appearance and express more emotions. The first game includes [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) the player could interact with, but they are mostly static in-game objects. Beginning with the second game, Square used predetermined pathways for NPCs to create more dynamic scenes that include comedy and drama.<ref name=\"GT-FFRetrospectiveIV\">{{cite web| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-iv-final-fantasy/23185| title = Final Fantasy Retrospective Part&nbsp;IV| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = August 5, 2007| accessdate = August 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611203037/http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-iv-final-fantasy/23185 |archivedate=June 11, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Square showed an [[Final Fantasy VI#Legacy|interactive SGI technical demonstration]] of ''Final Fantasy VI'' for the then [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|next generation of consoles]].
