The band admits that with [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] working alongside them, they were more focused during recording because he didn't let them just fool around and party, so there was a lot less drinking this time around.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| title1 = Dead\n| length1 = 1:12\n| title2 = [[Falling Away from Me]]\n| length2 = 4:29\n| title3 = Trash\n| length3 = 3:27\n| title4 = 4 U\n| length4 = 1:42\n| title5 = Beg for Me\n| length5 = 3:53\n| title6 = [[Make Me Bad]]\n| length6 = 3:55\n| title7 = It's Gonna Go Away\n| length7 = 1:29\n| title8 = Wake Up\n| length8 = 4:07\n| title9 = Am I Going Crazy\n| length9 = 1:00\n| title10 = Hey Daddy\n| length10 = 3:44\n| title11 = [[Somebody Someone]]\n| length11 = 3:47\n| title12 = No Way\n| length12 = 4:07\n| title13 = Let's Get This Party Started\n| length13 = 3:41\n| title14 = Wish You Could Be Me\n| length14 = 1:07\n| title15 = Counting\n| length15 = 3:37\n| title16 = Dirty\n| length16 = 7:50\n|total_length = 53:16\n}}\n*The song \"Dirty\" ends at 3:43 and is followed up by 4 minutes and 7 seconds of static.\n**In the advance version, this song ends at 3:46 without the static, followed by an alternative version of \"Am I Going Crazy\".

A statement on the band's site relates: \"We're so psyched about [the new album] that we wanted to give all you guys, the true Korn fans \u2014 a gift from us.\" Also at this time, the band attempted to start an online [[Chain letter|chain email]], by posting the letter online and asking fans to email the letter to 10 other people and to then sign the \"I Downloaded the Korn Single For Free\" guestbook on the band's site. For each person who signed, Korn donated 25 cents to the charities Childhelp USA and Children Of The Night.

The British aircraft industry had slipped into general decline and morale in the aerial services of the British armed forces was low. [[Flight Lieutenant]] Alan Pollock, a flight commander in [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|No. 1 (Fighter) Squadron RAF]], was further displeased that no aerial displays had been planned to mark the RAF's 50th anniversary.\n\nOn 1 April 1968, Pollock and other members of No. 1 Squadron took part in anniversary leaflet raids on other RAF stations and on 4 April visited [[RAF Tangmere]], where they performed a display.<ref name=Empire/>\n\n==Incident==\n[[File:LondonTowerBridge2004-08-03.jpg|thumb|right|Tower Bridge]]\nOn 5 April 1968, Pollock decided on his own initiative<ref> Daily Mail, 15 May 2018, \"Peterborough\" column / Readers' Letters, page 60</ref> to mark the occasion of the RAF anniversary with an unauthorised display.

The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n\n===Cloud formation===\nSnow clouds usually occur in the context of larger weather systems, the most important of which is the low-pressure area, which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation.

In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed [[thundersnow]].\n\nA [[warm front]] can produce snow for a period, as warm, moist air overrides below-freezing air and creates precipitation at the boundary.

The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the [[orographic lift|orographic]] influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores.

The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of [[micrometer]]s or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by the [[Wegener\u2013Bergeron\u2013Findeisen process]]. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.<ref name=\"natgeojan07\">{{cite journal|author=M.

Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they [[Entrainment (physical geography)|entrain]] more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of [[gravity current]]. They occur in three major mechanisms:<ref name=\"McClung 2006\">McClung, David and Shaerer, Peter: The Avalanche Handbook, The Mountaineers: 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-89886-809-8}}</ref>\n* ''Slab avalanches'' occur in snow that has been deposited, or redeposited by wind. They have the characteristic appearance of a block (slab) of snow cut out from its surroundings by fractures. These account for most back-country fatalities.\n* ''[[Powder snow avalanche]]s'' result from a deposition of fresh dry powder and generate a powder cloud, which overlies a dense avalanche. They can exceed speeds of {{convert|300|kph}}, and masses of {{convert|10000000|tonnes}}; their flows can travel long distances along flat valley bottoms and even uphill for short distances.\n* ''Wet snow avalanches'' are a low-velocity suspension of snow and water, with the flow confined to the surface of the pathway.<ref name=\"McClung 2006\"/> The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~{{convert|10|to|40|km/h|0}}), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.\n\n===Snowmelt===\n[[File:1997 Red River Flood Grand Forks.jpg|thumb|right|Snowmelt-induced flooding of the [[Red River of the North]] in [[1997 Red River flood|1997]]]]\nMany rivers originating in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive a significant portion of their flow from snowmelt.

The area in which an alpine glacier forms is called a cirque (corrie or cwm), a typically armchair-shaped geological feature, which collects snow and where the snowpack compacts under the weight of successive layers of accumulating snow, forming n\u00e9v\u00e9. Further crushing of the individual snow crystals and reduction of entrapped air in the snow turns it into glacial ice. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it overflows through a geological weakness or an escape route, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure.  On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) of snow-ice.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n==Science==\n{{Main|Snow science}}\nScientists study snow at a wide variety of scales that include the [[physics]] of [[chemical bonds]] and [[Cloud physics|clouds]]; the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks; and the contribution of snowmelt to river [[hydraulics]] and ground [[hydrology]]. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by [[engineer]]s, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by [[agronomist]]s, who address the availability of snowmelt to [[agriculture]], and those, who design equipment for sporting activities on snow. Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub-specialty is [[avalanche]]s, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike.\n\nSnow science addresses how snow forms, its distribution, and processes affecting how snowpacks change over time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover and its effect on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish [[ground truth]] and [[remote sensing]] techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science\n |title       = All About Snow\u2014Snow Science\n |date        = 2016\n |website     = National Snow and Ice Data Center\n |publisher   = University of Colorado, Boulder\n |access-date = November 30, 2016\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161201020029/https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science\n |archivedate = December 1, 2016\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Measurement and classification===\n{{See also|Classifications of snow}}\nIn the field snow scientists often excavate a snow pit within which to make basic measurements and observations. Observations can describe features caused by wind, water percolation, or snow unloading from trees. Water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers, which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack. Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks that the ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' includes are: snow height, snow water equivalent, snow strength, and extent of snow cover. Each has a designation with code and detailed description. The classification extends the prior classifications of Nakaya and his successors to related types of precipitation and are quoted in the following table:<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n[[File:Taku glacier firn ice sampling.png|thumb|right|Snow pit on the surface of a glacier, profiling snow properties where the snow becomes increasingly dense with depth as it metamorphoses towards ice]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Frozen precipitation particles, related to snow crystals\n|-\n!

The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack and the formation of ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.<ref name=Classificationonground>\n{{Citation\n |last        = Fierz\n |first       = C.\n |last2       = Armstrong\n |first2      = R.L.\n |last3       = Durand\n |first3      = Y.\n |last4       = Etchevers\n |first4      = P.\n |last5       = Greene\n |first5      = E.\n |display-authors=5\n |author6=McClung, D.M.\n |author7=Nishimura, K.\n |author8=Satyawali, P.K.\n |author9=Sokratov, S.A.\n |title       = The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground\n |place       = Paris\n |publisher   = UNESCO\n |series      = IHP-VII Technical Documents in Hydrology\n |volume      = 83\n |year        = 2009\n |pages       = 80\n |url         = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001864/186462e.pdf\n |access-date = November 25, 2016\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160929205922/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001864/186462e.pdf\n |archivedate = September 29, 2016\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Satellite data===\n[[Remote sensing]] of snowpacks with satellites and other platforms typically includes multi-spectral collection of imagery.

The science behind these remote observations has been verified with ground-truth studies of the actual conditions.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\nSatellite observations record a decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellite observations began. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover was observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less coverage area. However, in some areas there may be an increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40\u00b0. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.<ref name = Review>{{cite journal | author=Dietz, A. |author2=Kuenzer, C. |author3=Gessner, U. |author4= Dech, S.  | year=2012 |title=Remote Sensing of Snow \u2013 a Review of available methods |journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing |doi=10.1080/01431161.2011.640964|bibcode = 2012IJRS...33.4094D |volume=33 |issue=13 |pages=4094\u20134134}}</ref>\n\nThe most frequently used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible\u2013infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, which has led to other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it is important to have continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.<ref name = Review/>\n\n===Models===\n[[File:Watercyclesummary.jpg|thumb|Snowfall and snowmelt are parts of the Earth's water cycle.]]\nSnow science often leads to predictive models that include snow deposition, snow melt, and snow hydrology\u2014elements of the Earth's [[water cycle]]\u2014which help describe [[global climate change]].<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n[[Climate model|Global climate change models]] (GCMs) incorporate snow as a factor in their calculations. Some important aspects of snow cover include its [[albedo]] (reflectivity of incident radiation, including light) and insulating qualities, which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice. As of 2011, the melt phase of GCM snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snow melt, such as vegetation cover and terrain. These models typically derive snow water equivalent (SWE) in some manner from satellite observations of snow cover.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/> The ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' defines SWE as \"the depth of water that would result if the mass of snow melted completely\".<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n\nGiven the importance of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the air and the snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute ''Q<sub>m</sub>'', the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to ''Q<sub>m</sub>''.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n==Effects on human activity==\nSnow affects human activity in four major areas, transportation, agriculture, structures, and sports. Most transportation modes are impeded by snow on the travel surface. Agriculture often relies on snow as a source of seasonal moisture. Structures may fail under snow loads. Humans find a wide variety of recreational activities in snowy landscapes.\n\n===Transportation===\n{{See also|Snowplow}}\nSnow affects the rights of way of highways, airfields and railroads. They share a common tool for clearing snow, the [[snowplow]]. However, the application is different in each case\u2014whereas roadways employ anti-icing chemicals to prevent bonding of ice, airfields may not; railroads rely on abrasives to enhance traction on tracks.\n\n====Highway====\n[[File:Cars covered in Snow on Lake Shore Drive Chicago Feb 2 2011 storm.JPG|thumb|Traffic stranded in a 2011 [[Chicago]] snowstorm.]]\n[[File:Snowy Higddhway 4012.jpg|thumb|Winter conditions on [[Ontario Highway 401]] in Toronto due to a [[snowsquall]].]]\nIn the late 20th century, an estimated $2 billion was spent annually in North America on roadway winter maintenance, owing to snow and other winter weather events, according to a 1994 report by Kuemmel.

Snow loads are related to the climate in which a structure is sited. Icings are usually a result of the building or structure generating heat that melts the snow that is on it.\n\n''Snow loads'' \u2013 The ''Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures'' gives guidance on how to translate the following factors into roof snow loads:<ref name = ASCE7/>\n* Ground snow loads\n* Exposure of the roof\n* Thermal properties of the roof\n* Shape of the roof\n* Drifting\n* Importance of the building\nIt gives tables for ground snow loads by region and a methodology for computing ground snow loads that may vary with elevation from nearby, measured values. The ''Eurocode 1'' uses similar methodologies, starting with ground snow loads that are tabulated for portions of Europe.<ref name=Eurocode1/>\n\n''Icings'' \u2013 Roofs must also be designed to avoid [[Ice dam (roof)|ice dams]], which result from meltwater running under the snow on the roof and freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the [[eaves]]. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam.<ref name=\"Paul\" >Paul Fisette, \"Preventing Ice Dams\", ''Roofing, flashing & waterproofing''. Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 2005. 54.</ref> Ice dams may result in [[Water damage|damaged]] building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams.

Among the adaptive mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.<ref name = SnowEcology/>\n\n===Plant life===\nSnow interacts with vegetation in two principal ways, vegetation can influence the deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of [[conifer]]s intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth is dependent on the departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n===Animal life===\n[[File:Fjellrev - Arctic fox (24490250823).jpg|thumb|right|[[Arctic fox]], a predator of smaller animals that live beneath the snow]]\nSnow supports a wide variety of animals both on the surface and beneath. Many [[invertebrate]]s thrive in snow, including [[spider]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[snow scorpionfly]]s and [[springtail]]s. Such [[arthropod]]s are typically active at temperatures down to {{convert|-5|C}}. Invertebrates fall into two groups, regarding surviving subfreezing temperatures: freezing resistant and those that avoid freezing because they are freeze-sensitive. The first group may be cold hardy owing to the ability to produce [[antifreeze]] agents in their body fluids that allows survival of long exposure to sub-freezing conditions. Some organisms [[Fasting|fast]] during the winter, which expels freezing-sensitive contents from their digestive tracts. The ability to survive the absence of oxygen in ice is an additional survival mechanism.<ref name = SnowEcology/>\n\nSmall [[vertebrates]] are active beneath the snow. Among vertebrates, [[alpine salamander]]s are active in snow at temperatures as low as {{convert|-8|C}}; they burrow to the surface in springtime and lay their eggs in melt ponds. Among mammals, those that remain active are typically smaller than {{convert|250|g}}. [[Omnivore]]s are more likely to enter a torpor or be [[Hibernate|hibernators]], whereas [[herbivore]]s are more likely to maintain food caches beneath the snow. [[Vole]]s store up to {{convert|3|kg}} of food and [[pika]]s up to {{convert|20|kg}}. Voles also huddle in communal nests to benefit from one another's warmth.

Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n\n===Cloud formation===\nSnow clouds usually occur in the context of larger weather systems, the most important of which is the low-pressure area, which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation.

The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of [[micrometer]]s or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by the [[Wegener\u2013Bergeron\u2013Findeisen process]]. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.<ref name=\"natgeojan07\">{{cite journal|author=M.

Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they [[Entrainment (physical geography)|entrain]] more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of [[gravity current]]. They occur in three major mechanisms:<ref name=\"McClung 2006\">McClung, David and Shaerer, Peter: The Avalanche Handbook, The Mountaineers: 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-89886-809-8}}</ref>\n* ''Slab avalanches'' occur in snow that has been deposited, or redeposited by wind. They have the characteristic appearance of a block (slab) of snow cut out from its surroundings by fractures. These account for most back-country fatalities.\n* ''[[Powder snow avalanche]]s'' result from a deposition of fresh dry powder and generate a powder cloud, which overlies a dense avalanche. They can exceed speeds of {{convert|300|kph}}, and masses of {{convert|10000000|tonnes}}; their flows can travel long distances along flat valley bottoms and even uphill for short distances.\n* ''Wet snow avalanches'' are a low-velocity suspension of snow and water, with the flow confined to the surface of the pathway.<ref name=\"McClung 2006\"/> The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~{{convert|10|to|40|km/h|0}}), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.\n\n===Snowmelt===\n[[File:1997 Red River Flood Grand Forks.jpg|thumb|right|Snowmelt-induced flooding of the [[Red River of the North]] in [[1997 Red River flood|1997]]]]\nMany rivers originating in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive a significant portion of their flow from snowmelt.

The area in which an alpine glacier forms is called a cirque (corrie or cwm), a typically armchair-shaped geological feature, which collects snow and where the snowpack compacts under the weight of successive layers of accumulating snow, forming n\u00e9v\u00e9. Further crushing of the individual snow crystals and reduction of entrapped air in the snow turns it into glacial ice. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it overflows through a geological weakness or an escape route, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure.  On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) of snow-ice.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n==Science==\n{{Main|Snow science}}\nScientists study snow at a wide variety of scales that include the [[physics]] of [[chemical bonds]] and [[Cloud physics|clouds]]; the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks; and the contribution of snowmelt to river [[hydraulics]] and ground [[hydrology]]. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by [[engineer]]s, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by [[agronomist]]s, who address the availability of snowmelt to [[agriculture]], and those, who design equipment for sporting activities on snow. Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub-specialty is [[avalanche]]s, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike.\n\nSnow science addresses how snow forms, its distribution, and processes affecting how snowpacks change over time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover and its effect on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish [[ground truth]] and [[remote sensing]] techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science\n |title       = All About Snow\u2014Snow Science\n |date        = 2016\n |website     = National Snow and Ice Data Center\n |publisher   = University of Colorado, Boulder\n |access-date = November 30, 2016\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161201020029/https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science\n |archivedate = December 1, 2016\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Measurement and classification===\n{{See also|Classifications of snow}}\nIn the field snow scientists often excavate a snow pit within which to make basic measurements and observations. Observations can describe features caused by wind, water percolation, or snow unloading from trees. Water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers, which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack. Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks that the ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' includes are: snow height, snow water equivalent, snow strength, and extent of snow cover. Each has a designation with code and detailed description. The classification extends the prior classifications of Nakaya and his successors to related types of precipitation and are quoted in the following table:<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n[[File:Taku glacier firn ice sampling.png|thumb|right|Snow pit on the surface of a glacier, profiling snow properties where the snow becomes increasingly dense with depth as it metamorphoses towards ice]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Frozen precipitation particles, related to snow crystals\n|-\n!

The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack and the formation of ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.<ref name=Classificationonground>\n{{Citation\n |last        = Fierz\n |first       = C.\n |last2       = Armstrong\n |first2      = R.L.\n |last3       = Durand\n |first3      = Y.\n |last4       = Etchevers\n |first4      = P.\n |last5       = Greene\n |first5      = E.\n |display-authors=5\n |author6=McClung, D.M.\n |author7=Nishimura, K.\n |author8=Satyawali, P.K.\n |author9=Sokratov, S.A.\n |title       = The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground\n |place       = Paris\n |publisher   = UNESCO\n |series      = IHP-VII Technical Documents in Hydrology\n |volume      = 83\n |year        = 2009\n |pages       = 80\n |url         = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001864/186462e.pdf\n |access-date = November 25, 2016\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160929205922/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001864/186462e.pdf\n |archivedate = September 29, 2016\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Satellite data===\n[[Remote sensing]] of snowpacks with satellites and other platforms typically includes multi-spectral collection of imagery. Multi-faceted interpretation of the data obtained allows inferences about what is observed. The science behind these remote observations has been verified with ground-truth studies of the actual conditions.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\nSatellite observations record a decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellite observations began. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover was observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less coverage area. However, in some areas there may be an increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40\u00b0. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.<ref name = Review>{{cite journal | author=Dietz, A. |author2=Kuenzer, C. |author3=Gessner, U. |author4= Dech, S.  | year=2012 |title=Remote Sensing of Snow \u2013 a Review of available methods |journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing |doi=10.1080/01431161.2011.640964|bibcode = 2012IJRS...33.4094D |volume=33 |issue=13 |pages=4094\u20134134}}</ref>\n\nThe most frequently used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible\u2013infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, which has led to other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it is important to have continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.<ref name = Review/>\n\n===Models===\n[[File:Watercyclesummary.jpg|thumb|Snowfall and snowmelt are parts of the Earth's water cycle.]]\nSnow science often leads to predictive models that include snow deposition, snow melt, and snow hydrology\u2014elements of the Earth's [[water cycle]]\u2014which help describe [[global climate change]].<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n[[Climate model|Global climate change models]] (GCMs) incorporate snow as a factor in their calculations. Some important aspects of snow cover include its [[albedo]] (reflectivity of incident radiation, including light) and insulating qualities, which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice. As of 2011, the melt phase of GCM snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snow melt, such as vegetation cover and terrain. These models typically derive snow water equivalent (SWE) in some manner from satellite observations of snow cover.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/> The ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' defines SWE as \"the depth of water that would result if the mass of snow melted completely\".<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n\nGiven the importance of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the air and the snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute ''Q<sub>m</sub>'', the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to ''Q<sub>m</sub>''.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n==Effects on human activity==\nSnow affects human activity in four major areas, transportation, agriculture, structures, and sports. Most transportation modes are impeded by snow on the travel surface. Agriculture often relies on snow as a source of seasonal moisture. Structures may fail under snow loads. Humans find a wide variety of recreational activities in snowy landscapes.\n\n===Transportation===\n{{See also|Snowplow}}\nSnow affects the rights of way of highways, airfields and railroads.

However, the application is different in each case\u2014whereas roadways employ anti-icing chemicals to prevent bonding of ice, airfields may not; railroads rely on abrasives to enhance traction on tracks.\n\n====Highway====\n[[File:Cars covered in Snow on Lake Shore Drive Chicago Feb 2 2011 storm.JPG|thumb|Traffic stranded in a 2011 [[Chicago]] snowstorm.]]\n[[File:Snowy Higddhway 4012.jpg|thumb|Winter conditions on [[Ontario Highway 401]] in Toronto due to a [[snowsquall]].]]\nIn the late 20th century, an estimated $2 billion was spent annually in North America on roadway winter maintenance, owing to snow and other winter weather events, according to a 1994 report by Kuemmel. The study surveyed the practices of jurisdictions within 44 US states and nine Canadian provinces. It assessed the policies, practices, and equipment used for winter maintenance. It found similar practices and progress to be prevalent in Europe.<ref name = Kuemmel/>\n\nThe dominant effect of snow on vehicle contact with the road is diminished friction. This can be improved with the use of [[snow tire]]s, which have a tread designed to compact snow in a manner that enhances traction.

Snow loads are related to the climate in which a structure is sited. Icings are usually a result of the building or structure generating heat that melts the snow that is on it.\n\n''Snow loads'' \u2013 The ''Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures'' gives guidance on how to translate the following factors into roof snow loads:<ref name = ASCE7/>\n* Ground snow loads\n* Exposure of the roof\n* Thermal properties of the roof\n* Shape of the roof\n* Drifting\n* Importance of the building\nIt gives tables for ground snow loads by region and a methodology for computing ground snow loads that may vary with elevation from nearby, measured values. The ''Eurocode 1'' uses similar methodologies, starting with ground snow loads that are tabulated for portions of Europe.<ref name=Eurocode1/>\n\n''Icings'' \u2013 Roofs must also be designed to avoid [[Ice dam (roof)|ice dams]], which result from meltwater running under the snow on the roof and freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the [[eaves]]. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam.<ref name=\"Paul\" >Paul Fisette, \"Preventing Ice Dams\", ''Roofing, flashing & waterproofing''. Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 2005. 54.</ref> Ice dams may result in [[Water damage|damaged]] building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams.

Among the adaptive mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.<ref name = SnowEcology/>\n\n===Plant life===\nSnow interacts with vegetation in two principal ways, vegetation can influence the deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of [[conifer]]s intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth is dependent on the departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n===Animal life===\n[[File:Fjellrev - Arctic fox (24490250823).jpg|thumb|right|[[Arctic fox]], a predator of smaller animals that live beneath the snow]]\nSnow supports a wide variety of animals both on the surface and beneath. Many [[invertebrate]]s thrive in snow, including [[spider]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[snow scorpionfly]]s and [[springtail]]s. Such [[arthropod]]s are typically active at temperatures down to {{convert|-5|C}}. Invertebrates fall into two groups, regarding surviving subfreezing temperatures: freezing resistant and those that avoid freezing because they are freeze-sensitive. The first group may be cold hardy owing to the ability to produce [[antifreeze]] agents in their body fluids that allows survival of long exposure to sub-freezing conditions. Some organisms [[Fasting|fast]] during the winter, which expels freezing-sensitive contents from their digestive tracts. The ability to survive the absence of oxygen in ice is an additional survival mechanism.<ref name = SnowEcology/>\n\nSmall [[vertebrates]] are active beneath the snow. Among vertebrates, [[alpine salamander]]s are active in snow at temperatures as low as {{convert|-8|C}}; they burrow to the surface in springtime and lay their eggs in melt ponds. Among mammals, those that remain active are typically smaller than {{convert|250|g}}. [[Omnivore]]s are more likely to enter a torpor or be [[Hibernate|hibernators]], whereas [[herbivore]]s are more likely to maintain food caches beneath the snow. [[Vole]]s store up to {{convert|3|kg}} of food and [[pika]]s up to {{convert|20|kg}}. Voles also huddle in communal nests to benefit from one another's warmth.

During portions of its cycle, a tidewater glacier is relatively insensitive to [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]].\n\n==Calving rate of tidewater glaciers==\n[[File:Icebergs cape york 4.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Iceberg [[Ice calving|calving]] from several tidewater glaciers, [[Cape York (Greenland)|Cape York]], [[Greenland]]]]\nWhile climate is the main factor affecting the behavior of all glaciers, additional factors affect calving ([[iceberg]]-producing) tidewater glaciers. These glaciers terminate abruptly at the ocean interface,  with large pieces of the glacier fracturing and separating, or [[Ice calving|calving]], from the ice front as icebergs.\n\nClimate change causes a shift in the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of a glacier. This is the imaginary line on a glacier, above which snow accumulates faster than it ablates, and below which, the reverse is the case. This altitude shift, in turn, prompts a retreat or advance of the terminus toward a new steady-state position. However, this change in terminus behavior for calving glaciers is also a function of resulting changes in [[fjord]] geometry, and calving rate at the glacier terminus as it changes position.<ref name=\"Mercer\">{{Cite journal| last = Mercer| first = J.H.| author-link = | title = The response of fjord glaciers to changes in the firn limit| journal = Journal of Glaciology| volume = 3/29| pages = 850\u2013858| year = 1961}}</ref><ref name=\"Post1\">{{Cite journal| first =Post| last =Austen| title =Preliminary hydrography and historical terminal changes of Columbia Glacier| year =1975| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey Hydrologic Investigations Atlas HA-559}}</ref>\n\nCalving glaciers are different from land terminating glaciers in the variation in velocity along their length.  Land terminating glacier velocities decline as the terminus is approached.  Calving glaciers accelerate at the terminus.   A declining velocity near the terminus slows the glacier response to climate.  An accelerating velocity at the front enhances the speed of the glaciers response to climate or glacier dynamic changes.

Using data collected from 13 Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Brown et al. (1982) derived the following relationship between calving speed and water depth: <math>V_C = CH_w + D</math>, where <math>V_C</math> is the mean calving speed ([[metre|m]]\u22c5[[Annum|a]]<sup>\u22121</sup>), <math>C</math> is a calving coefficient (27.1\u00b12&nbsp;a<sup>\u22121</sup>), <math>H_w</math> is the mean water depth at glacier front (m) and <math>D</math> is a constant (0&nbsp;m\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup>).  Pelto and Warren (1991) found a similar calving relationship with tidewater glaciers observed over longer time periods, with slightly reduced calving rate to the mainly summer rates noted by Brown et al. (1982).<ref name=\"Brown1982\"/><ref name=\"PeltoWarren1991\"/>\n\nCalving is an important form of ablation for glaciers that terminate in [[Fresh water|freshwater]], also.  Funk and R\u00f6thlisberger determined a relationship between calving speed and water depth based on analysis of six glaciers that calve into lakes.<ref name=\"Funk1989\">{{cite journal | last =Funk | first =M. |author2=R\u00f6thlisberger, F. | title =Forecasting the effects of a planned reservoir which will partially flood the tongue of Unteraargletscher in Switzerland | journal =Annals of Glaciology | volume =13 | pages =76\u201381 | publisher =[[International Glaciological Society]] | year =1989 }}</ref>  They found that the same basic calving relationship developed for tidewater calving glaciers was true for freshwater calving glaciers, only the calving coefficients lead to calving rates 10% of that for tidewater glaciers.\n\n==Tidewater glacier phases==\nObservations of Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers prompted Austin Post<ref name=\"Post1\"/> to describe the tidewater calving glacier advance/retreat cycle:  (1) advancing, (2) stable-extended, (3) drastically retreating, or (4) stable-retracted.  The following is a detailed review of the tidewater glacier cycle derived by Post, with numerous cited examples, the cycle is based on observations of temperate tidewater glaciers in Alaska, not outlet glaciers from large ice sheets or polar glaciers.\n\nThe ''accumulation area ratio'' of a glacier, AAR, is the percentage of a glacier that is a snow-covered accumulation zone at the end of the summer melt season.  This percentage for large Alaskan glaciers is between 60 and 70 for non-calving glaciers, 70-80 for moderately calving glaciers and up to 90 for very high calving rate glaciers.<ref name=\"Pelto2\">{{cite journal| last =Pelto| first =M.S.| title =Mass balance of southeast Alaska and northwest British Columbia glaciers from 1976 to 1984: Methods and Results| journal =Annals of Glaciology| volume =9| issue =| pages =189\u2013193| year =1987| url=http://crevassezone.org/reports/JIRP/37-Balance76-84.pdf }}</ref> By using accumulation area ratio (AAR) data for Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Pelto (1987)<ref name=\"Pelto2\"/> and Viens (1995)<ref name=\"Viens1\">{{Cite journal| first =R.J.| last =Viens| title =Dynamics and mass balance of tidewater calving glaciers of southern Alaska (Unpublished Masters thesis)| year =1995| pages =| place =University of Washington}}</ref> produced models showing that climate acts as a first-order control on the advance/retreat cycle of calving glaciers during most of the advance retreat cycle, but there are climate insensitive periods as well.

The glacier will build a terminus [[shoal]] of [[sediment]] further reducing the calving rate.  This will improve the [[glacier mass balance]] and the glacier can begin to advance due to this change or an increase in ice flux to the terminus due to increasing snowfall or reduced snow melt.  As the advance proceeds the terminus shoal will be pushed in front of the glacier and continue to build, keeping the calving rate low.  In the case of the most glaciers such as the [[Taku Glacier]] the glacier will eventually build a terminus shoal that is above water and calving will essentially cease. This will eliminate this loss of ice from the glacier and the glacier can continue to advance. Taku Glacier and [[Hubbard Glacier]] have been in this phase of the cycle.

They noted that the average calving rate from Columbia Glacier increased from 3&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> in the second half of 1983 to 4&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> during the first nine months of 1984. This rate was four times greater than that measured at the end of 1977 and increased again in 1985. The glacier flow, i.e., the movement of the ice toward the sea, also increased, it was inadequate to keep pace with the break-up and expulsion of icebergs.  The increase in speed instead seemed to just feed the ever faster conveyor to the terminus for iceberg production. This prompted the USGS to predict that the glacier would retreat 32&nbsp;km before stabilizing.<ref name=\"Meier\"/>  By 2006, it has retreated 16&nbsp;km. The water remains deep and the calving rate and glacier velocity very high, indicating retreat will continue. At this point, just like having a balloon payment in an adjustable rate mortgage, the glacier has to pay a whole new portion of its balance via icebergs.  The glacier accelerates as flow is enhanced by the calving process; this increases the export of icebergs from the glacier.  Large calving retreats are initiated by warming conditions causing ice thinning.  The resulting retreat to a new equilibrium conditions can be far more extensive than will be regained during the next advance stage. A good example of this is Muir Glacier.\n\nNext to Glacier Bay, Icy Bay has had the most extensive retreat. At the beginning of the 20th century, the coastline was nearly straight and the bay non-existent.  The entrance of the bay was filled by a tidewater glacier face that calved icebergs directly into the Gulf of Alaska.  A century later glacier retreat has opened a multi-armed bay more than 30 miles long.  The tidewater glacier has divided into three independent glaciers, Yahtse, Tsaa and Guyot Glacier. Other examples of glaciers currently in the retreat phase are South Sawyer and Sawyer Glaciers in Alaska, retreating 2.1 and 2.3&nbsp;km respectively from 1961 to 2005.\n\nIn Patagonia an example of a rapidly retreating glacier is the Jorge Montt Glacier which drains into Baja Jorge Montt in the Pacific Ocean. The glacier\u2019s ice thinning, at low elevations, from 1975 to 2000 reached 18&nbsp;m\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> at the lowest elevations. The glacier calving front experienced a major retreat of 8.5&nbsp;km in those 25 years as a result of rapid thinning [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16337].\n\n===Stable-retracted===\nAt some point the glacier reaches a pinning point where calving is reduced due to a fjord narrowing or shoaling and the glacier\u2019s AAR is near 100.  This is occurring with [[LeConte Glacier]] and [[Yathse Glacier]].

Pelto and Miller concluded that the current reduction in rate of advance is since 1970 is attributable to the laterally expanding terminal lobe as opposed to declining mass balance and that the primary force behind the Taku Glacier\u2019s advance since about 1900 is due to positive mass balance.<ref name=\"Pelto4\"/>  The recent lack of positive mass balance will eventually slow the retreat if it persists.\n\n==Effects of climate change==\nThe size of tidewater glaciers is such that the tidewater glacier cycle is several hundred years in length. A tidewater glacier is not sensitive to climate during the advancing and drastically retreating phases of its cycle.  In the same region, disparate terminus responses are observed amongst tidewater calving glaciers, but not land terminating glaciers.  This is exemplified by the 17 major glaciers of the [[Juneau Icefield]], 5 have retreated more than 500 m since 1948, 11 more than 1000 m, and one glacier the Taku has advanced.  This difference highlights the unique impacts on terminus behavior of the tidewater glacier cycle, which has caused the Taku Glacier to be insensitive to climate change in the last 60 years.\nConcurrently, in both Patagonia<ref name=\"Warren\"/> and Alaska,<ref name=\"Brown1982\"/> there are tidewater glaciers that have advanced for a considerable period, tidewater glaciers undergoing rapid retreat and stable tidewater glaciers.\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n===Other references===\n* Viens, R.  2001.

These glaciers terminate abruptly at the ocean interface,  with large pieces of the glacier fracturing and separating, or [[Ice calving|calving]], from the ice front as icebergs.\n\nClimate change causes a shift in the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of a glacier. This is the imaginary line on a glacier, above which snow accumulates faster than it ablates, and below which, the reverse is the case. This altitude shift, in turn, prompts a retreat or advance of the terminus toward a new steady-state position. However, this change in terminus behavior for calving glaciers is also a function of resulting changes in [[fjord]] geometry, and calving rate at the glacier terminus as it changes position.<ref name=\"Mercer\">{{Cite journal| last = Mercer| first = J.H.| author-link = | title = The response of fjord glaciers to changes in the firn limit| journal = Journal of Glaciology| volume = 3/29| pages = 850\u2013858| year = 1961}}</ref><ref name=\"Post1\">{{Cite journal| first =Post| last =Austen| title =Preliminary hydrography and historical terminal changes of Columbia Glacier| year =1975| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey Hydrologic Investigations Atlas HA-559}}</ref>\n\nCalving glaciers are different from land terminating glaciers in the variation in velocity along their length.

Using data collected from 13 Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Brown et al. (1982) derived the following relationship between calving speed and water depth: <math>V_C = CH_w + D</math>, where <math>V_C</math> is the mean calving speed ([[metre|m]]\u22c5[[Annum|a]]<sup>\u22121</sup>), <math>C</math> is a calving coefficient (27.1\u00b12&nbsp;a<sup>\u22121</sup>), <math>H_w</math> is the mean water depth at glacier front (m) and <math>D</math> is a constant (0&nbsp;m\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup>).

The following is a detailed review of the tidewater glacier cycle derived by Post, with numerous cited examples, the cycle is based on observations of temperate tidewater glaciers in Alaska, not outlet glaciers from large ice sheets or polar glaciers.\n\nThe ''accumulation area ratio'' of a glacier, AAR, is the percentage of a glacier that is a snow-covered accumulation zone at the end of the summer melt season.

They noted that the average calving rate from Columbia Glacier increased from 3&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> in the second half of 1983 to 4&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> during the first nine months of 1984. This rate was four times greater than that measured at the end of 1977 and increased again in 1985. The glacier flow, i.e., the movement of the ice toward the sea, also increased, it was inadequate to keep pace with the break-up and expulsion of icebergs.  The increase in speed instead seemed to just feed the ever faster conveyor to the terminus for iceberg production. This prompted the USGS to predict that the glacier would retreat 32&nbsp;km before stabilizing.<ref name=\"Meier\"/>  By 2006, it has retreated 16&nbsp;km. The water remains deep and the calving rate and glacier velocity very high, indicating retreat will continue. At this point, just like having a balloon payment in an adjustable rate mortgage, the glacier has to pay a whole new portion of its balance via icebergs.  The glacier accelerates as flow is enhanced by the calving process; this increases the export of icebergs from the glacier.  Large calving retreats are initiated by warming conditions causing ice thinning.  The resulting retreat to a new equilibrium conditions can be far more extensive than will be regained during the next advance stage. A good example of this is Muir Glacier.\n\nNext to Glacier Bay, Icy Bay has had the most extensive retreat. At the beginning of the 20th century, the coastline was nearly straight and the bay non-existent.  The entrance of the bay was filled by a tidewater glacier face that calved icebergs directly into the Gulf of Alaska.  A century later glacier retreat has opened a multi-armed bay more than 30 miles long.  The tidewater glacier has divided into three independent glaciers, Yahtse, Tsaa and Guyot Glacier. Other examples of glaciers currently in the retreat phase are South Sawyer and Sawyer Glaciers in Alaska, retreating 2.1 and 2.3&nbsp;km respectively from 1961 to 2005.\n\nIn Patagonia an example of a rapidly retreating glacier is the Jorge Montt Glacier which drains into Baja Jorge Montt in the Pacific Ocean. The glacier\u2019s ice thinning, at low elevations, from 1975 to 2000 reached 18&nbsp;m\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> at the lowest elevations. The glacier calving front experienced a major retreat of 8.5&nbsp;km in those 25 years as a result of rapid thinning [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16337].\n\n===Stable-retracted===\nAt some point the glacier reaches a pinning point where calving is reduced due to a fjord narrowing or shoaling and the glacier\u2019s AAR is near 100.  This is occurring with [[LeConte Glacier]] and [[Yathse Glacier]].  Le Conte Glacier currently has an AAR of 90, is at a retracted position and seems likely to be set to advance after building a terminus shoal.<ref name=\"Motyka2003\">{{cite journal|last=Motyka |first=RJ |author2=L Hunter |author3=K Echelmeyer |author4=C Connor |title=Submarine melting at the terminus of a temperate tidewater glacier, LeConte Glacier, Alaska |journal=Annals of Glaciology |volume=36 |publisher=International Glaciological Society |year=2003 |url=http://www.uas.alaska.edu/envs/publications/pubs/Motyka_et_al.pdf |accessdate=2007-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202455/http://www.uas.alaska.edu/envs/publications/pubs/Motyka_et_al.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2008 }}</ref> The drop in calving rate allows the glacier to reestablish equilibrium.\n\n==Examples of tidewater glacier behavior==\n===Taku Glacier===\nThe Taku Glacier provides a good example of this cycle.

After 1948, the now non-calving Taku Glacier, possessed an AAR only slightly reduced (86 and 63). This drove 1.5&nbsp;km of further advance at a reduced rate of 37&nbsp;m\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup>.  In 1990, the Taku Glacier\u2019s AAR was 82 high enough, to prompt Pelto and Miller to conclude that the Taku Glacier would continue to advance for the remaining decade of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Pelto4\"/> From 1986 to 2005, the equilibrium line altitude on the glacier rose without a significant terminus shift causing the AAR to decline to about 72.  Pelto and Miller concluded that the current reduction in rate of advance is since 1970 is attributable to the laterally expanding terminal lobe as opposed to declining mass balance and that the primary force behind the Taku Glacier\u2019s advance since about 1900 is due to positive mass balance.<ref name=\"Pelto4\"/>  The recent lack of positive mass balance will eventually slow the retreat if it persists.\n\n==Effects of climate change==\nThe size of tidewater glaciers is such that the tidewater glacier cycle is several hundred years in length. A tidewater glacier is not sensitive to climate during the advancing and drastically retreating phases of its cycle.  In the same region, disparate terminus responses are observed amongst tidewater calving glaciers, but not land terminating glaciers.  This is exemplified by the 17 major glaciers of the [[Juneau Icefield]], 5 have retreated more than 500 m since 1948, 11 more than 1000 m, and one glacier the Taku has advanced.  This difference highlights the unique impacts on terminus behavior of the tidewater glacier cycle, which has caused the Taku Glacier to be insensitive to climate change in the last 60 years.\nConcurrently, in both Patagonia<ref name=\"Warren\"/> and Alaska,<ref name=\"Brown1982\"/> there are tidewater glaciers that have advanced for a considerable period, tidewater glaciers undergoing rapid retreat and stable tidewater glaciers.\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n===Other references===\n* Viens, R.  2001.

Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General George S Patton christened it as a Patton. It was designed as a replacement for the [[M26 Pershing]], [[M4 Sherman]] variants and [[M46 Patton]]s used in the [[Korean War]], and as the successor to the [[M47 Patton]].{{r|1991_Terry|page=5}} Nearly 12,000 M48s were built, mainly by [[Chrysler]] and [[American Locomotive Company]], from 1952 to 1961. The M48 underwent many design modifications and improvements during its production life. This led to a wide variety of suspension systems, [[Gun turret#Cupola|cupola styles]], power packs, fenders and other details among individual tanks. The early designs, up to the M48A2C, were powered by a gasoline engine. The M48A3 and A5 versions used a diesel engine, however gasoline engine versions were still in use in the US Army National Guard through 1968 and through 1975 by many West German Army units. Numerous examples of the M48 saw combat use in [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|various Arab\u2013Israeli conflicts]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Beginning in 1959, most American M48A1s and A2s were upgraded to the M48A3 model.\n\nThe M48 Patton-series saw widespread service with the United States and NATO until it was superseded by the M60 tank as well as being widely exported. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles and bridge layers. Some M48A5 models served into the mid-1980s with US Army National Guard units, and were used as targets for weapons and radar testing into the mid-1990s. Many M48s remain in service in other countries though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield. The [[Turkish Army]] has the largest number of modernized M48 MBTs, with more than 1,400 in its inventory. Of these, around 1,000 have been phased out, placed in storage, or modified as [[armoured recovery vehicle]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vietnam. Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M-48 tank. - NARA - 532441.tif|thumb|Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M48A3 tank, Vietnam, 1966]]\nAfter the conclusion of [[World War II]], the United States [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|Ordance Tank-Automotive Command]] (OTAC) drastically slowed or canceled many tank development and design programs. On {{date|1950-11-07}}, the Ordnance Technical Committee mandated a change in the nomenclature for tanks in the US Military.{{r|1991_Terry|page=2}} It was decided that weight designations (Light, Medium, Heavy) were no longer applicable due to changes in the way tanks were developed and employed on the battlefield, and the varying calibers of main guns now available. Thus the caliber of the gun replaced its weight designation. For example, the M103 Heavy Tank was redesignated as the [[M103 (heavy tank)|120mm Gun Tank M103]] and the Light Tank M41 Walker Bulldog as the [[M41 Walker Bulldog|76mm Gun Tank M41 Walker Bulldog]].{{r|2014_DavidB}} The M47 Patton entered production in 1951 and was used by the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the [[Korean War]]. This forced the US to field older tank models, such as the [[M26 Pershing]] and [[M46 Patton]]. In response, the Army launched several design projects for a replacement of the M46 and M26. The United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the Korean War, when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to its quantity production.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=31|q=Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure the speedy fielding of new tanks. Such rapid production guaranteed teething troubles, but the importance attached to rapidly equipping combat unirs with the new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.}} Notable among these were the [[T42 medium tank|T42]], [[T69 (tank)|T69]] and T48 projects as well as continuing to pursue further improvements to the M47. General [[Bruce C. Clarke]] stated \"We know exactly what we want. We want a fast, highly mobile, fully armored, lightweight vehicle. It must be able to swim, cross any terrain, and climb 30 degree hills. It must be air-transportable. It must have a simple but powerful engine, requiring little or no maintenance. The operating range should be several hundred miles. We would also like it to be invisible\".{{r|1960_Clarke|page=11}}\n\n===T48 Project===\nThe T48 was to focus on improving the turret design and a more powerful engine. 1/4 and 1/8 scale [[mockup]]s of the turret were constructed during May 1950. The design study was accepted by the Army in December the same year and a contract for the design and manufacture of a 90mm armed tank, the T48 was given to the Chrysler Corporation. Six prototypes were built, the first by December 1951.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=11}} The hull was redesigned, moving the driver's station to the front center and the bow-mounted machine gun and its associated crew station were removed and converted to safe container storage for additional main gun ammunition.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}  The front glacis was redesigned into a slope and offered much better ballistic protection than former welded and rather flat designs.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} The driver steered the vehicle using an aircraft styled steering wheel. Initially the power pack consisted of the Continental AV-1790-5B gasoline engine producing 704 brake horsepower coupled to an Allison CD-850-4A cross-drive transmission with 2 forward and 1 reverse ranges. The hull armor was increased to {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the front glacis of rolled homogeneous steel. It had six roadwheel pairs per side and five return rollers, a torsion bar suspension system, using the T97E2 steel track assembly.\n\nA new hemispherically shaped turret was implemented for the T48. This was to eliminate the noted shot traps in the M47's turret design and also lowered the vehicle's height in comparison to the M46 and M47. It was initially armed with the M31/T119 90&nbsp;mm main gun and used a Y-shaped muzzle brake on the barrel.{{r|2020_Alex}} The full image stereoscopic T46E1/M12 rangefinder was placed in the central section of the turret.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nOn {{date|1951-02-27}}, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes (OTCM) #33791 initiated the simultaneous production and design refinement of the new tank, designating it the 90mm Gun Tank M48.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=85,152}} The Army planned to produce some 9,000 M48s within three years of development. Such rapid, mass production would close the imbalance between Soviet and American tank forces. Meeting this goal, however, required production simultaneous with operational testing and development. Chrysler Corporation became the principal producer of the tank. Expected production and teething troubles led to the creation of integrating committees to coordinate tank and component development. These Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committees included military and industrial representatives who provided early warning of defects and recommended remedies.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}22}} Testing trials of the T48 tanks began in February 1952 and continued until the end of 1955. However the perceived immediate threat of Soviet aggression in Western Europe and the ongoing Korean War impelled Army senior leadership to rush the T48 tank into series production before the inevitable bugs could be worked out of the new tank design. Instead, it was decided that any needed design changes uncovered by the continued testing and evaluation of the T48 tanks at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal Test Center would be incorporated into the M48 series production vehicles as quickly as possible.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}27}}\n\n===Components===\n\n====Armor====\nIn conjunction with the development of the T48 project there was some discussion regarding armor. The weight of conventional armored steel needed to provide protection against the emerging large-calibered high-velocity main guns and improved APDS kinetic energy penetrators was making its continued use impractical. Composite [[applique armour|applique armor panels]] made with fused silica glass was envisioned to be fitted to the hull. It was also desired that a turret be constructed using this special armor.{{r|1958_Salter}} The [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|OTAC]] and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] began development of the armor in November 1952 at [[Fort Belvoir]] VA as Project TT2-782/51.{{r|1958_Salter}} This composite armor provides protection against HEAT, HEP, and HE rounds. Its overall slow development kept it from being used on the T48 and was dropped from consideration in the M48 by 1953, however its development was continued with the [[T95 Medium Tank]] until 1958.\n\nThere were two different hulls used for the M48 series. The M48 hull had a wedge-shaped front glacis compared to the M46's rather flat design. Early Mod A hulls had smaller diameter turret and driver's hatches. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. The engine exhaust vents were located on the top of the rear deck. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly. The drive sprocket was located at the rear of the hull. Shock absorbers were mounted at the first two and last roadwheel arms. This hull design was manufactured for the original M48 and M48A1 versions of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe M48A2 hull design saw several modifications including a reduction from five to three return rollers per side. The suspension system was simplified, a more compact [[Powerpack (drivetrain)|powerpack]] and additional fuel cells, with large louvered grill access doors replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This hull was used on newly constructed M48A2 and M48A3 tanks of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe turret used for the M48 series was hemispherical in shape and was made from cast homogeneous steel. It had a flat gun shield and a standard pop-up styled hatch for the commander and an additional hatch for the loader's station. Early production models of the turret had somewhat smaller diameter hatches. The gunner was provided with an M37 .30 cal machine gun with 5,900 rounds of ammunition.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\n====Rangefinders and Fire Control Systems====\nDuring WWII and the Korean War, most tanks used a direct sighting system where the gun sights and rangefinders were slaved directly to the gun's barrel but its long range accuracy depended upon the focusing abilities of the individual gunner. There are two basic types of optical [[rangefinders]], stereoscopic and coincidence. With a [[stereoscopic rangefinder|stereoscopic model]] range determination occurred by measuring the distance from the observer to a target using the observer's capability of [[binocular vision]]. The [[coincidence rangefinder]] uses a single eyepiece. Light from the target enters the rangefinder through two windows located at either end of the instrument. The ARCOVE emphasis upon increased long range accuracy led to the incorporation of a fire control system (FCS) in the M48. The fire control system included a rangefinder, mechanical ballistic computer, ballistic drive, and gunner's sight. Collectively, these mechanical devices resembled in miniature the fire control systems used in [[naval gunnery]]. Only after the Second World War did such systems become small enough for use in combat vehicles. These mechanical fire control systems permitted tanks to engage effectively at much longer ranges than in [[World War II]], a critical consideration for the Army, expecting to enter the European battlefield outnumbered. Instead of a gunner's sight being slaved to the gun tube, the ballistic computer and drive computed the range and elevated the gun. The gunner's primary responsibility lay in keeping the sight on the target. The mechanical ballistic computer made a more accurate computation of range possible by mathematically accounting for such factors as vehicle cant and ammunition type.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=1{{ndash}}2}} Many developmental range finders based on pulses of IR light, such as the Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) rangefinder of the [[T95 Medium Tank|T95]] continued into 1957.{{r|1991_Ogorkiewicz|page=174|q=The first major attempt to use an electro-optical rangefinder was represented by the T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) system, which was tested on the US T95 tank between 1955 and 1957}}\n\n====Autoloader systems====\nAnother requirement of the T48 project was to explore the use of [[autoloader]]s for the main gun as they became available. Preliminary experiments with a loading system using the T48 turret were unsuccessful due to the limited space and the need to line up the breach with the loading system after each firing. It also was dropped from consideration for use on the M48 but was further developed on the T69 tank as the 90&nbsp;mm T178 gun. It was fitted with an eight-round auto-loader system mounted in an oscillating turret.\n\n====90 mm Main Gun====\nARCOVE also involved the Ordnance Department with the goal of improving the 90&nbsp;mm gun and its ammunition. The Army expected difficulties in engagements with the Soviet [[IS tank family#Object 703 IS-3|IS-3 heavy tank]], since the M48's 90&nbsp;mm T119/M36 rifled main gun could not consistently penetrate its frontal armor, even with special armor-piercing capped (APC) or HEAT ammunition.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} Work was performed to address this by developing the improved T300E53 HEAT ammunition using the T139 gun and a new series of Hypervelocity Armor-Piercing Discarding-Sabot (HVAP-DS or simply APDS) ammunition using the smooth-bored T208 gun. The T139 allowed for easier barrel changing and weighed less than the preceding M36/T119 gun. The new APDS round could penetrate {{convert|11.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of homogeneous steel armor, angled at 30 degrees, at a distance of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, but was not accepted for service for the original variant of the M48.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} The T139 was later standardized as the 90mm Gun M41 and was fitted to M48A2 and A3 tank versions.\n\n====Turret Cupolas====\nThe T48 tank featured a remote controllable machine gun mount as the tank commander's weapon on a pedestal, which allowed him to fire the .50 caliber (12.7mm) M2HB machine gun from within the vehicle's turret. It used a 100-round ammunition box and could also be employed manually by the commander. However, servicing and reloading of the weapon required the tank commander to open his roof hatch and expose his head and upper torso. This remote controllable mount was designated as the .50 Caliber Machine Gun Mount, M1 and designed by Chrysler Defense Engineering.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} By October 1954, the Army decided to amend the design of the tank by installing a cupola. During the production of M48s it was modified several times resulting in a wide mix of cupola styles among individual tanks. Afterwards it was renamed as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun, M1.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=23}} The new tank commander cupola would allow the tank commander to aim and fire his weapon while remaining under armor protection via a remote controlled M2HB machine gun, however the commander had to open the cupola hatch and expose his head to reload or service the machine gun due to the limited headroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} These cupolas had a small rearward opening hatch and a single, non-removable vision block. They were designed by [[AAI Corporation|Aircraft Armaments Incorporated]]. Because of its smaller turret roof hatch opening those M1 cupolas retro-fitted to early production M48 tanks used an adaptor ring.\n\nThe M1E1 cupola design used a G305 cupola riser with 9 non-removable vision blocks installed (some versions had 7 with the 2 rear blocks deleted) between the turret roof and the cupola. It also came with a new bulged hatch cover to provide the tank commander with more headroom and allowed him to reload the weapon while remaining under armor protection. A major drawback of both these cupolas was their inability to mount either daylight or infrared vision devices in the already cramped cupola's interior. Also due to restraints in the cupola, smaller 50 round ammunition boxes were used. Development of its eventual replacement, the [[M60 Patton#M19 Commander's Cupola|T9/M19 cupola]] of the XM60 tank was continued into {{year|1958}} and some M19 cupolas were retro-fitted to M48A5s to allow for the use of IR and daylight periscopes by the commander.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|pages=109{{ndash}}111}}\n\n===M48===\nChrysler began building the new [[Newark Assembly|Newark Tank Plant]] in Newark, Delaware in 1951 to produce the M48 while Chrysler Defense Engineering and ARCOVE continued advanced production engineering (APE) to evolve the design using the T48 prototypes at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. In May 1952 Chrysler came to an agreement to take control on a Government Owned and Contractor Operated (GOCO) basis of the Newark Tank plant production facility with the US Government and to continue production design refinement of the T48 at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. The first Chrysler production tank was unveiled on {{date|1952-07-01}} as the 90mm Gun Tank M48 and christened the M48 Patton by Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General [[George S Patton]].{{r|Christened}}\n \nTo meet the urgent need for tanks, production contracts were also awarded to [[General Motors]] [[Fisher Body]] Division and [[Ford Motor Company]] to produce the tank in Michigan starting in 1952. Also in July 1952 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company]] a $200 million contract to start producing the tank in 1953 at the Schenectady Tank Plant in New York.{{r|TankOrder}} All four companies were given initial production contracts in that same year for around 400 tanks each.\n\nThe M48 featured a gasoline-powered engine, different models were used depending on availability and manufacturer. Originally the M48(Mod A) was built at the Chrysler Defense using the Continental AV-1790-5B coupled to a General Motors CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission as used for the M47.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=317}} The M48(Mod B) used a Continental AV-1790-5C gasoline engine and either an Allison CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission. Most of these were built by the American Locomotive Company. Additionally a two-cylinder, gasoline, air-cooled engine (sometimes referred to as the \"Little Joe\" by tank crews) was provided to power a 28 volt, 300 ampere generator when the main engine was not needed. Fuel capacity was {{convert|200|gal|l|abbr=on}}  providing a cruising range of about {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly as were the previous M46 and M47 tanks.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} It had hydraulic shock absorbers mount on the first, second and sixth roadwheel pairs (opposite of the M46 and M47). The bow mounted machine gun and its related crew station was eliminated thus providing more ammunition storage for the main gun. The driver's station was moved to the front center of the hull. The steering controls were redesigned. A large aircraft-styled steering wheel (replacing the wobble stick control of the M46 and M47) and placing the transmission range selector on the floor to the driver's right. Mod A hulls had a small oval overhead hatch for the driver. It incorporated a mechanism that dropped his three periscope heads to provide clearance for the hatch door as it swung to the right, and the driver then had to reposition the periscopes by hand once the hatch was closed again. The vehicle did not have an [[NBC protection]] system for the crew and a fording depth of approximately {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe M48's turret consisted of a redesigned flat gun shield and standard pop-up hatch for the commander's station. The M48 Mod A turret design had a smaller roof hatches for both the commander and loader. A .50 cal M2HB using a M1 remote control mount on a pedestal was available for the commander. When not in use, the machine gun mount could be stowed on a bracket welded to the turret roof in front of the loader. The M48's direct fire control system consisted of an M12/T41 stereoscopic rangefinder with a field of view of 5 degrees and magnification of x7.5, an azimuth indicator, an M20 gunner's periscope and a T13 superelevation actuator. Two main bearings are bolted to the mounting plate on the roof of the tank turret to support the range finder on steel radial ball bearings. A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.{{r|TM9718A|page=60|q=A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.}} A .30 caliber M1919E4 machine gun was coaxially mounted to the main gun's right and was operated by the gunner. An M12 full field optical range finder was used, the same as the M47. The tank was not fitted with any night fighting or computerized fire control systems.{{r|M47_PattonMania}} It featured the 90&nbsp;mm T139 main gun using a Y-shaped muzzle brake on the barrel and carried 53 rounds. Eight ready rounds were stored in the left side of the turret bustle for the loader, the rest were stored inside safe containers in the hull. Tank crews complained that the Y-shaped fume extractor was found to be prone to snagging brush. It was replaced with a T-shaped model early in production.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nThese early M48 tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems. The M12 rangefinder was too fragile and often broke. Army Field Forces (AFF) found these tanks to be unsuitable for combat use in Europe and was regulated to limited use by US Army CONUS units until numerous shortcomings were corrected. Furthermore, some 120 hulls were found to have insufficient hull armor. These were denoted as the M48C and relegated to the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) for non-ballistic training use by the Armor School at [[Fort Knox]] to train crewmembers and maintenance personnel.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A1===\n[[File:Tensions_ran_high_at_Checkpoint_Charlie_in_1961_as_Easterners_fled_to_West,_Berlin_Wall_went_up.jpg|thumb|right|Two M48A1 face off against T-54's during one of several standoffs at Checkpoint Charlie in 1961]]\nThe Army concluded in January 1952 that the T42{{r|1952_Baldwin}} had failed as a tank capable of combat in Europe against Soviet tanks and reached the same conclusion in November 1953 for the M48 Mod A/B versions.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=32|q=The M48s width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.}} The M48A1 focused on improving the engine and the vehicle's operational range and fixing numerous mechanical problems. To cope with the lack of range, an add-on modification allowed the use of 4 external jettisonable fuel drums {{convert|55|USgal|l|abbr=on}} of [[Avgas|MOGAS]] (motor gasoline) was mounted to the rear deck, extending the range to {{convert|135|mi|km|abbr=on}}. This proved very unpopular with tank crews and operational range remained unsatisfactory.{{r|2016_Pike}} Further ARCOVE changes included a desire for the commander to observe and operate his weapons station while remaining under armor protection.{{r|2016_Pike}} At this same time the US Army Field Forces (USAAFF) declared the T42 medium tank unfit for production in November 1952, mainly due to serious shortcomings of its hull design. Ford's production of the M48 ended in August 1953 after a fire destroyed most of the Livonia Tank Plant.{{r|2020_Jackson}}\n\nTesting and feedback from ARCOVE had uncovered the fact that the original driver's hatch design of the M48(Mod A)/T48 tank proved to be too small and made for an uncomfortable seating position for the driver when operating the tank with his hatch in the open position. To rectify this problem a new larger driver hatch was devised that was introduced into series production vehicle as early as possible.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Also the front vision block was removable and could be replaced with an infrared IR vision block. A redesigned power pack featured an AV-1790-7B gasoline engine and CD-850-4B transmission.{{r|2019_Conners}} The turret was fitted with the M1 cupola that enclosed the M2HB machine gun.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} In April 1953, the Army standardized this configuration as the 90mm Gun Tank M48A1 Patton.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBetween April 1952 and December 1954, nearly 7,000 M48s and M48A1s were produced, with production contracts for an additional 2,500 M48A1s to be built through 1956. Combat units immediately received 2,120 of these early tanks, but correction of defects discovered after production delayed the fielding of the remaining tanks.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=62{{ndash}}64}} The first production vehicles suffered from excessive oil consumption and engine failures after only {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The gasoline engine managed only {{convert|0.33|mpgus|km/L|abbr=on}}, limiting range to {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} miles. The M48's width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=70{{ndash}}72}} Operational readiness rates of M48-equipped units tended to be low. The tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems, and the M12 stereoscopic rangefinder was uncomfortable to operate.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} However, the M48A1 was considered an even match for its Soviet counterpart, the T-54. {{As of|alt=On October 25, 1954|1954|10|25|post=,}} the Army decided to amend its designation of the M48 tank. Thereafter, the tanks with the original small driver's hatch and the Chrysler-designed M1 remote-control machine gun mount attached to the tank commander's cupola would remain the 90mm gun tank M48. However, all those tanks with the larger driver hatch and fitted with a new small turreted M1 cupola armed with a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun would be designated as the 90mm gun tank M48A1.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=41}} Many of these tanks were later upgraded to the A2 and A3 standards.\n\n===M48A2===\nThe concurrent testing of the T48 and production of the M48 was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2 as well as better quality control. Under the ARCOVE's \"single, efficient producer\" model, Defense Secretary [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] directed the Army to reduce the number of contractors producing each model of tank. In a new round of production bids for the M48A2, [[General Motors]] underbid Chrysler, and in September 1953 Army Secretary [[Robert T. Stevens]] awarded GM's [[Fisher Body]] division a $200 million contract to become the sole producer of the M48A2 and started production at its [[Grand Blanc Metal Center|Grand Blanc Tank Plant]] in Michigan in April 1953.{{r|underbid|q=WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 -- Robert T. Stevens, Secretary of the Army, announced today his decision to award to the Fisher body division of General Motors a contract of approximately $200,000,000 for the building of M-48 medium tanks.}} The decision raised skepticism among lawmakers. Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] noted the move would effectively leave GM as the only producer of light and medium tanks when the Chrysler production contract for M48 production was set to expire in April 1956.\n\nDuring the ARCOVE Questionmark III conference in June 1954 it was predicted that the Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and a compression ignition engine. In response to these findings an eventual replacement for the M48 was proposed, resulting in the T95 Tank Program. Months later Chrysler underbid GM in the new round of proposals. In September 1954 the Army awarded Chrysler an exclusive $160.6 million contract to restart production.{{r|Chrysler_underbids}} In November 1955 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company|Alco Products]] a $73 million contract to begin producing 600 M48A2s the next year at the Schenectady Tank Plant, New York.{{r|Alco}} However Alco opted to wrap up its tank business when its contract ended in July 1956. In May the Army awarded Chrysler, the only bidder, a $119 million contract to continue production of the M48A2 at the Delaware Tank Plant.{{r|1957_NYT}} In December 1953 Chrysler took on orders initially intended for the American Locomotive after the AlCo opted production cutbacks to its tank program and ceased further tank production by 1956.{{r|American Locomotive canceled}}\n\nThe engine deck was redesigned with two large louvered doors that replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This new rear hull arrangement on the M48A2 tank helped in cooling the engine and minimizing the infrared (heat) signature of the vehicle.{{r|1992_Crismon|page=73}} The suspension system was simplified. The track tensioner arm was eliminated, modifications to the idler arm, the addition of bumper springs and friction snubbers, and a relocation of the air cleaner assembly. The number of return rollers was reduced to 3 per side. With the more compact AVI-1790-8 engine, additional fuel tanks were installed in the engine compartment, increasing fuel capacity to 335 gallons.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Many older model M48s and M48A1s were rebuilt to this production configurations but retained their original 5 return rollers per side.{{r|1999_Decker|page=144}}\n\nThe M48A2C saw improvements for the turret. The M12 rangefinder was replaced with a full-field coincidence model. The M13 Fire Control included an improved turret control system M13 Fire Control System (FCS). The M13 FCS consists of the M5A2 ballistic drive and mechanical M13A3 gun data computer which integrated barrel temperature data{{r|1980_M60}} with an M17 coincidence range finder.{{r|2019_Conners}} The rangefinder is a [[Coincidence rangefinder|double image coincidence image instrument]] used as the ranging device of the gunner's primary direct sighting and fire control system. The gunner is provided with an M20 day periscope with a magnification of x8 and an M105D day telescopic sight with a magnification of x8 and a field of view of 7.5 degrees.{{r|1980_M60}} Range information from the rangefinder is fed into the ballistic computer through a shaft. The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A3===\n\nThe continued use of gasoline engines was undesirable due mainly to its high fuel consumption, poor low-end torque and fuel flammability. ARCOVE industrial representatives had expressed desires for a diesel engine for the tank since 1953.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} Continental Motors and OTAC began to develop an experimental X-shaped [[compression ignition]] engine in 1954 with [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 tank]] but it remained unreliable. In June 1955, OTAC adopted the recommendations and allowed a diesel engine to be used if it significantly contributed to better fuel economy.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=31}} By August 1956 the diesel powered AVDS-1790 was recommended for the M48 and the Army requested the initial retrofitting of approximately 1020 older M48A1s and A2s with the new engine in December.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a Soviet [[T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.{{r|2018_Beast}} After a brief examination of this tank's armor and [[D-10 tank gun|100&nbsp;mm gun]] by a British military attach\u00e9, the UK decided that their [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20 pounder]] (84mm L/66.7) was apparently incapable of defeating it. There were also rumors of an even larger [[U-5TS|115&nbsp;mm gun]] in the works.{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=137}} In response to this the US Army started [[M60 Patton#XM60 Development|development of the XM60]] to replace the M48 tank series and the development of a new main gun, the [[Royal Ordnance L7|105mm T254]].\n\nIn addition to the conversion of older model M48s, Chrysler continued to build new vehicles. New vehicles built to this standard used the M48A2 hull design (with 3 return rollers) and had redesigned fenders and mudguards, armored boxes around the taillights among other minor details. They were fitted with another re-designed commander's cupola, a modified M1E1. It had a modified hatch to allow more room in comparison to the previous M1 cupola and the two rear vision blocks were eliminated.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=87}} The driver's steering wheel was replaced with a T-bar control and received a padded seat.{{r|2019_Conners}} M48A3 hull production ended in May 1961. The Newark Tank plant was closed in October.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=103}}\n\nInstead of immediately getting a 105mm main gun, the M48A3 tanks were to retain their existing M41 90mm main guns for several reasons. First, funding shortfalls made it impossible to supply enough 105mm main gun rounds for all the planned converted tanks. Second, there were still large stockpiles of 90&nbsp;mm main gun rounds on hand. Third was its planned replacement, the [[M60 Patton]] was set to start production in 1959. This newest version of the M48 series received the designation Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked; 90mm Gun, M48A3 on 19 March 1958.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=29}}\n\nBy February 1960, the US Army had around 600 converted M48A3 Patton tanks and by 1964 the US Marine Corps had received 419.{{r|2015_Tencza}} The A3 model introduced the diesel engine, countering the earlier versions' characteristic of catching fire.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Because many M48A3 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A3 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\n===M48A5===\n[[File:US_M48A5_Patton.jpg|thumb|right|M48A5 Patton on display at [[National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey|Lawrenceville National Guard Museum]]]]\nIn the mid-1970s, the vehicle was modified to carry the heavier 105&nbsp;mm gun. The original program designation was XM736. The designation was subsequently changed to M48A3E1 and was finally standardized as M48A5. As many components from the [[M60 Patton|M60A1]] were utilized as possible. [[Anniston Army Depot]] was issued a contract to convert 501 M48A3 tanks to the M48A5 standard and this was completed in December 1976. These early M48A5's were essentially M48A3 tanks with the 105mm gun added. They retained the M1 cupola armed with a .50 cal machine gun.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBased on Israeli experience in upgrading M48 series tanks, further changes were included starting in August 1976. These included replacing the M1 cupola with a low-profile \"Urdan\" type cupola that mounted an [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun for use by the tank commander. A second [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun was mounted on the turret roof for use by the loader. Internal ammunition stowage for the 105mm main gun was also increased to 54 rounds. These tanks were initially given the designation M48A5API; but, after early conversions were brought up to the later standard, the API was removed and these tanks were known simply as M48A5.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nIn addition to the conversion of M48A3 tanks, an additional conversion process for bringing M48A1 tanks to M48A5 standard was also developed. By March 1978, 708 M48A5 tanks had been converted from the M48A1 model.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nWork continued until December 1979, at which time 2069 M48A5's had been converted.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nThe vast majority of M48A5 tanks in service with US Army units were assigned to National Guard and Army Reserve Units. A notable exception was the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], who replaced their M60A1 tanks with M48A5's, which arrived in June and July 1978. On [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] M48A5 tanks the commander's [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] was replaced with a [[M2 Browning|.50 caliber M2 machine gun]].{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the M48s were phased out of U.S. service. Many other countries, however, continued to use these M48 models.\n\n==Combat service==\n===Vietnam===\n[[File:Vietnam....Marines riding atop an M-48 tank cover their ears as te 90mm gun fires during a road sweep southwest of... - NARA - 532483.tif|thumb|US Marines riding atop an M48 tank in Vietnam in April 1968.]]\nThe M48 saw extensive action with the US military during the Vietnam War.

Each battalion consisted of approximately 57 tanks. M48s were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam until replaced by [[M551 Sheridan]] Armored Reconnaissance Airborne Assault Vehicles (ARAAV) in the Divisional Cavalry Squadrons. M48A3 tanks remained in service with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] until the unit was withdrawn from the conflict. The M67A1 [[flame tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} From 1965 to 1968, 120 US M48A3 tanks were written off.{{r|armor.kiev.ua}}\n\n[[File:Men of Troop B, Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Men of Troop B, 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, and their M48 Patton tank move through the dense jungle in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in June 1969.]]\nThe M48 Patton has the distinction of playing a unique role in an event that was destined to radically alter the conduct of armored warfare.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} When US forces commenced redeployment operations, many of the M48A3 Pattons were turned over to the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) forces, in particular creating the battalion-sized ARVN 20th Tank Regiment; which supplemented their [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] units. During the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) [[Easter Offensive]] in 1972, tank clashes between NVA [[T-54]]/[[PT-76]] and ARVN M48/M41 units became commonplace. But, on {{date|1972-04-23}}, tankers of the 20th Tank Regiment were attacked by an NVA infantry-tank team, which was equipped with the new ''[[9M14 Malyutka|9M14M Malyutka]]'' (NATO designation: Sagger) wire-guided [[anti-tank missile]]. During this battle, one M48A3 Patton tank and one [[M113 armored personnel carrier#M113 armored cavalry assault vehicle (ACAV) variant|M113]] Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle (ACAV) were destroyed, becoming the first losses to the Sagger missile; losses that would echo on an even larger scale a year later during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in the Middle East in 1973.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} By 2 May, 20th Tank Regiment had lost all of their tanks to enemy fire.{{r|1979_Starry|page=212}} During the first month of the [[First Battle of Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]] all ARVN M48 Pattons were lost.{{efn|1=1st Armor Brigade lost 43 M48s and 66 M41s, 20th Tank Regiment lost 57 M48s}}{{r|1979_Ngo|page=52}}\n[[File:NARA 111-CCV-372-CC33992 25th Infantry Division M48A3 Patton moving through Viet Cong territory Operation Lincoln 1966.jpg|thumb|A 1st Battalion, 69th Armor Patton during [[Operation Lincoln (Vietnam)|Operation Lincoln]]]]\nThe M48s performed admirably{{r|1987_Nolan}} in Vietnam in the infantry-support role.

South Vietnamese M48s and M41s fought in the [[1975 Spring Offensive]]. In several incidents, the ARVN successfully defeated NVA [[T-34]] and [[T-55]] tanks and even slowed the North's offensive. However, due to shortages of fuel and munitions faced by the South Vietnamese military because of the US Congress-placed ban on the further funding and supply of military equipment and logistics to the country, the American-made tanks soon ran out of ammunition and fuel and were quickly abandoned to the NVA, which then put them in their service after the war ended in May 1975. In total, 250 of the ARVN's M48A3s were destroyed and captured{{r|1976_NM|page=10}} and those captured (at least 30) were only used briefly before being phased out and turned into war-memorial displays all over Vietnam.[[File:M48A3 Detonates Mine Vietnam.jpg|thumb|A destroyed M48A3 during Vietnam war]]{{anchor|M48-land-mines}} M48s, along with Australian [[20 pounder|20 pounder (84mm)]]-gunned{{r|1979_Starry|page=113}} [[Centurion tank|Centurions]] of the [[1st Armoured Regiment (Australia)|1st Armoured Regiment]],{{r|1982_Dunstan}} were the only vehicles in use by the anti-communist side in the Vietnam War that could reasonably protect their crews from [[land mine]]s. They were often used for minesweeping operations along Highway 19 in the Central Highlands, a two-lane paved road between [[An Khe]] and [[Pleiku]]. Daily convoys moved both ways along Highway 19. These convoys were held up each morning while the road was swept for mines. At that time, minesweeping was done by soldiers walking slowly over the dirt shoulders of the highway with hand-held mine detectors. During this slow process, convoys would build up into a dangerously-inviting target for the enemy, especially their guerillas and partisans. As a result, a faster method was improvised, the ''\"Thunder Run\"'', in which one M48 lined up on each side of the road, with one track on the dirt shoulder and the other track on the asphalt, and then with all guns firing,{{r|1979_Starry|page=80}} they raced to a designated position miles away. If the M48s made it without striking a mine, the road was clear and the convoys could proceed. In most cases, an M48 that struck a land mine in these operations only lost a road wheel or two in the explosion; seldom was there any hull damage that would be considered a [[catastrophic kill]].{{r|1979_Starry}}\n\nSupply of M48A3 tanks to South Vietnam:\n\n* 1971: 54.{{r|2015_Hatcher}}\n* May 1972: 120.{{r|2005_Mo\u00efse|page=135}}\n* October 1972: 72.{{r|2005_Mo\u00efse|page=135}}\n* November 1972: 59.{{r|1979_Starry|page=218}}\n* January 1973 - July 1974: 16.<ref>Better Management of Secondary Items by the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces Would Reduce U.S. Investment; Department of Defense: Report to the Congress by the Comptroller General of the United States.

During [[Operation Grand Slam]], Pakistani tank forces, composed mainly of M47 and M48 Patton tanks, thrust through the Indian defence-lines very quickly and swiftly defeated back Indian Army armoured counter-attacks. The Pakistanis used approximately a division's worth of tanks in the operation, although not all were Pattons, with upgraded Shermans included as well. In contrast, Pakistan's Patton tank failed to live up to its high expectations in the [[Battle of Asal Uttar]] in September 1965, where about 97 Pakistani tanks were lost, the majority of them being Pattons (M47s and M48s). Later, the Patton tank was the main Pakistani tank at the [[Battle of Chawinda]] and its performance at that battle was deemed satisfactory against Indian armour.\n\nThe Patton was later used by Pakistan again, this time, in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. A counter-attack led by the 13th Lancers and the 31st Cavalry army units was defeated by the Indian 54th Division around [[Battle of Barapind]] in December 1971. The Pakistan Army Patton tanks could not stop an assault by Indian T-55 Soviet-supplied tanks of the 2th Armored Brigade.{{r|strategic_affairs}} At least 9 of the Pattons were destroyed by T-55 tanks during the battle of Nainakot.{{r|1995_Chakravorty|page=342}} It total, more than 80 Pakistani Pattons were knocked out during battle, mainly by Centurion and T-55 fire.{{r|strategic_affairs}}\n\nIndia later set up a temporary war-memorial so named \"''Patton Nagar''\" (or \"Patton City\") in [[Khemkaran]] District in Punjab, where the captured Pakistani Patton tanks were displayed for a short period of time before being scrapped or sent all across India for use as war monuments and military memorials.\n\nAnalysing their overall performance in their wars with India, the Pakistani military held that the Patton was held in reasonably-high esteem by both sides and that combat-tactics were to blame for their utter defeat and the following debacle at Asal Uttar.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, a post-war US study of the tank battles in South Asia concluded that the Patton's armor could, in fact, be penetrated by the [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder tank gun]] (84&nbsp;mm) of the Centurion (later replaced by the even-more successful L7 105mm gun on the Mk. 7 version which India also possessed) as well as the 75&nbsp;mm tank gun of the [[AMX-13]] light tank.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Middle East===\n[[File:Israeli M48 tank captured by Egypt.jpg|thumb|An ex-Israeli M48 Patton tank captured by Egypt during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973.]]\nM48s were also used with mixed results during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967. On the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] battlefront, [[Israel]]i M48s upgunned with the then-advanced 105&nbsp;mm L7 rifled tank gun were used with considerable success against [[Egypt]]ian [[IS-3 (tank)|IS-3]]s, T-54s/T-55s, T-34/85s and [[SU-100]]s supplied by the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1950s and the 1960s (such as during the [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967)|Second Battle of Abu-Ageila]]. However, on the [[West Bank]] war-front, [[Jordan]]ian M48s (Jordan was also a user of the M48 Patton as was Israel at the same time-period) were often defeated by Israeli 105mm-armed Centurions and WWII-era upgraded M4 Shermans ([[Super Sherman|M-51s]] upgunned with French-built 105&nbsp;mm tank guns (not to be confused with the British L7 105mm tank gun)). In purely-technical terms, the Pattons were far superior to the much-older Shermans, with shots at more than 1,000 meters simply glancing off the M48's armor. However, the 105&nbsp;mm main gun of the Israeli Shermans fired a [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|HEAT]] round designed to defeat the Soviet [[T-62|T-62 tank]], which was the USSR's response to the M48's successor in US service, the [[M60 Patton]]. The Jordanian Pattons' general failure on the West Bank could also be attributed to excellent Israeli [[air superiority]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The Israeli Army captured about 100 Jordanian M48 and M48A1 tanks and pressed them into service in their own units after the war, as the same as were the Jordanian M113 APCs they seized during the war.\n\nIsrael used 445 M48 tanks in 1973 during the [[Yom Kippur War]].{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=20}} From 15 to 18 October, M48 tanks participated in the largest{{r|2011_Zaloga|page=34}} tank battle of the war - [[Battle of the Chinese Farm]].

Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General George S Patton christened it as a Patton. It was designed as a replacement for the [[M26 Pershing]], [[M4 Sherman]] variants and [[M46 Patton]]s used in the [[Korean War]], and as the successor to the [[M47 Patton]].{{r|1991_Terry|page=5}} Nearly 12,000 M48s were built, mainly by [[Chrysler]] and [[American Locomotive Company]], from 1952 to 1961. The M48 underwent many design modifications and improvements during its production life. This led to a wide variety of suspension systems, [[Gun turret#Cupola|cupola styles]], power packs, fenders and other details among individual tanks. The early designs, up to the M48A2C, were powered by a gasoline engine. The M48A3 and A5 versions used a diesel engine, however gasoline engine versions were still in use in the US Army National Guard through 1968 and through 1975 by many West German Army units. Numerous examples of the M48 saw combat use in [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|various Arab\u2013Israeli conflicts]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Beginning in 1959, most American M48A1s and A2s were upgraded to the M48A3 model.\n\nThe M48 Patton-series saw widespread service with the United States and NATO until it was superseded by the M60 tank as well as being widely exported. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles and bridge layers. Some M48A5 models served into the mid-1980s with US Army National Guard units, and were used as targets for weapons and radar testing into the mid-1990s. Many M48s remain in service in other countries though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield. The [[Turkish Army]] has the largest number of modernized M48 MBTs, with more than 1,400 in its inventory. Of these, around 1,000 have been phased out, placed in storage, or modified as [[armoured recovery vehicle]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vietnam. Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M-48 tank. - NARA - 532441.tif|thumb|Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M48A3 tank, Vietnam, 1966]]\nAfter the conclusion of [[World War II]], the United States [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|Ordance Tank-Automotive Command]] (OTAC) drastically slowed or canceled many tank development and design programs. On {{date|1950-11-07}}, the Ordnance Technical Committee mandated a change in the nomenclature for tanks in the US Military.{{r|1991_Terry|page=2}} It was decided that weight designations (Light, Medium, Heavy) were no longer applicable due to changes in the way tanks were developed and employed on the battlefield, and the varying calibers of main guns now available. Thus the caliber of the gun replaced its weight designation. For example, the M103 Heavy Tank was redesignated as the [[M103 (heavy tank)|120mm Gun Tank M103]] and the Light Tank M41 Walker Bulldog as the [[M41 Walker Bulldog|76mm Gun Tank M41 Walker Bulldog]].{{r|2014_DavidB}} The M47 Patton entered production in 1951 and was used by the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the [[Korean War]]. This forced the US to field older tank models, such as the [[M26 Pershing]] and [[M46 Patton]]. In response, the Army launched several design projects for a replacement of the M46 and M26. The United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the Korean War, when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to its quantity production.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=31|q=Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure the speedy fielding of new tanks. Such rapid production guaranteed teething troubles, but the importance attached to rapidly equipping combat unirs with the new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.}} Notable among these were the [[T42 medium tank|T42]], [[T69 (tank)|T69]] and T48 projects as well as continuing to pursue further improvements to the M47. General [[Bruce C. Clarke]] stated \"We know exactly what we want. We want a fast, highly mobile, fully armored, lightweight vehicle. It must be able to swim, cross any terrain, and climb 30 degree hills. It must be air-transportable. It must have a simple but powerful engine, requiring little or no maintenance. The operating range should be several hundred miles. We would also like it to be invisible\".{{r|1960_Clarke|page=11}}\n\n===T48 Project===\nThe T48 was to focus on improving the turret design and a more powerful engine. 1/4 and 1/8 scale [[mockup]]s of the turret were constructed during May 1950. The design study was accepted by the Army in December the same year and a contract for the design and manufacture of a 90mm armed tank, the T48 was given to the Chrysler Corporation. Six prototypes were built, the first by December 1951.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=11}} The hull was redesigned, moving the driver's station to the front center and the bow-mounted machine gun and its associated crew station were removed and converted to safe container storage for additional main gun ammunition.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}  The front glacis was redesigned into a slope and offered much better ballistic protection than former welded and rather flat designs.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} The driver steered the vehicle using an aircraft styled steering wheel. Initially the power pack consisted of the Continental AV-1790-5B gasoline engine producing 704 brake horsepower coupled to an Allison CD-850-4A cross-drive transmission with 2 forward and 1 reverse ranges. The hull armor was increased to {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the front glacis of rolled homogeneous steel. It had six roadwheel pairs per side and five return rollers, a torsion bar suspension system, using the T97E2 steel track assembly.\n\nA new hemispherically shaped turret was implemented for the T48. This was to eliminate the noted shot traps in the M47's turret design and also lowered the vehicle's height in comparison to the M46 and M47. It was initially armed with the M31/T119 90&nbsp;mm main gun and used a Y-shaped muzzle brake on the barrel.{{r|2020_Alex}} The full image stereoscopic T46E1/M12 rangefinder was placed in the central section of the turret.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nOn {{date|1951-02-27}}, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes (OTCM) #33791 initiated the simultaneous production and design refinement of the new tank, designating it the 90mm Gun Tank M48.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=85,152}} The Army planned to produce some 9,000 M48s within three years of development. Such rapid, mass production would close the imbalance between Soviet and American tank forces. Meeting this goal, however, required production simultaneous with operational testing and development. Chrysler Corporation became the principal producer of the tank. Expected production and teething troubles led to the creation of integrating committees to coordinate tank and component development. These Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committees included military and industrial representatives who provided early warning of defects and recommended remedies.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}22}} Testing trials of the T48 tanks began in February 1952 and continued until the end of 1955. However the perceived immediate threat of Soviet aggression in Western Europe and the ongoing Korean War impelled Army senior leadership to rush the T48 tank into series production before the inevitable bugs could be worked out of the new tank design. Instead, it was decided that any needed design changes uncovered by the continued testing and evaluation of the T48 tanks at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal Test Center would be incorporated into the M48 series production vehicles as quickly as possible.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}27}}\n\n===Components===\n\n====Armor====\nIn conjunction with the development of the T48 project there was some discussion regarding armor. The weight of conventional armored steel needed to provide protection against the emerging large-calibered high-velocity main guns and improved APDS kinetic energy penetrators was making its continued use impractical. Composite [[applique armour|applique armor panels]] made with fused silica glass was envisioned to be fitted to the hull. It was also desired that a turret be constructed using this special armor.{{r|1958_Salter}} The [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|OTAC]] and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] began development of the armor in November 1952 at [[Fort Belvoir]] VA as Project TT2-782/51.{{r|1958_Salter}} This composite armor provides protection against HEAT, HEP, and HE rounds. Its overall slow development kept it from being used on the T48 and was dropped from consideration in the M48 by 1953, however its development was continued with the [[T95 Medium Tank]] until 1958.\n\nThere were two different hulls used for the M48 series. The M48 hull had a wedge-shaped front glacis compared to the M46's rather flat design. Early Mod A hulls had smaller diameter turret and driver's hatches. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. The engine exhaust vents were located on the top of the rear deck. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly. The drive sprocket was located at the rear of the hull. Shock absorbers were mounted at the first two and last roadwheel arms. This hull design was manufactured for the original M48 and M48A1 versions of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe M48A2 hull design saw several modifications including a reduction from five to three return rollers per side. The suspension system was simplified, a more compact [[Powerpack (drivetrain)|powerpack]] and additional fuel cells, with large louvered grill access doors replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This hull was used on newly constructed M48A2 and M48A3 tanks of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe turret used for the M48 series was hemispherical in shape and was made from cast homogeneous steel. It had a flat gun shield and a standard pop-up styled hatch for the commander and an additional hatch for the loader's station. Early production models of the turret had somewhat smaller diameter hatches. The gunner was provided with an M37 .30 cal machine gun with 5,900 rounds of ammunition.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\n====Rangefinders and Fire Control Systems====\nDuring WWII and the Korean War, most tanks used a direct sighting system where the gun sights and rangefinders were slaved directly to the gun's barrel but its long range accuracy depended upon the focusing abilities of the individual gunner. There are two basic types of optical [[rangefinders]], stereoscopic and coincidence. With a [[stereoscopic rangefinder|stereoscopic model]] range determination occurred by measuring the distance from the observer to a target using the observer's capability of [[binocular vision]]. The [[coincidence rangefinder]] uses a single eyepiece. Light from the target enters the rangefinder through two windows located at either end of the instrument. The ARCOVE emphasis upon increased long range accuracy led to the incorporation of a fire control system (FCS) in the M48. The fire control system included a rangefinder, mechanical ballistic computer, ballistic drive, and gunner's sight. Collectively, these mechanical devices resembled in miniature the fire control systems used in [[naval gunnery]]. Only after the Second World War did such systems become small enough for use in combat vehicles. These mechanical fire control systems permitted tanks to engage effectively at much longer ranges than in [[World War II]], a critical consideration for the Army, expecting to enter the European battlefield outnumbered. Instead of a gunner's sight being slaved to the gun tube, the ballistic computer and drive computed the range and elevated the gun. The gunner's primary responsibility lay in keeping the sight on the target. The mechanical ballistic computer made a more accurate computation of range possible by mathematically accounting for such factors as vehicle cant and ammunition type.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=1{{ndash}}2}} Many developmental range finders based on pulses of IR light, such as the Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) rangefinder of the [[T95 Medium Tank|T95]] continued into 1957.{{r|1991_Ogorkiewicz|page=174|q=The first major attempt to use an electro-optical rangefinder was represented by the T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) system, which was tested on the US T95 tank between 1955 and 1957}}\n\n====Autoloader systems====\nAnother requirement of the T48 project was to explore the use of [[autoloader]]s for the main gun as they became available. Preliminary experiments with a loading system using the T48 turret were unsuccessful due to the limited space and the need to line up the breach with the loading system after each firing. It also was dropped from consideration for use on the M48 but was further developed on the T69 tank as the 90&nbsp;mm T178 gun. It was fitted with an eight-round auto-loader system mounted in an oscillating turret.\n\n====90 mm Main Gun====\nARCOVE also involved the Ordnance Department with the goal of improving the 90&nbsp;mm gun and its ammunition. The Army expected difficulties in engagements with the Soviet [[IS tank family#Object 703 IS-3|IS-3 heavy tank]], since the M48's 90&nbsp;mm T119/M36 rifled main gun could not consistently penetrate its frontal armor, even with special armor-piercing capped (APC) or HEAT ammunition.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} Work was performed to address this by developing the improved T300E53 HEAT ammunition using the T139 gun and a new series of Hypervelocity Armor-Piercing Discarding-Sabot (HVAP-DS or simply APDS) ammunition using the smooth-bored T208 gun. The T139 allowed for easier barrel changing and weighed less than the preceding M36/T119 gun. The new APDS round could penetrate {{convert|11.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of homogeneous steel armor, angled at 30 degrees, at a distance of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, but was not accepted for service for the original variant of the M48.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} The T139 was later standardized as the 90mm Gun M41 and was fitted to M48A2 and A3 tank versions.\n\n====Turret Cupolas====\nThe T48 tank featured a remote controllable machine gun mount as the tank commander's weapon on a pedestal, which allowed him to fire the .50 caliber (12.7mm) M2HB machine gun from within the vehicle's turret. It used a 100-round ammunition box and could also be employed manually by the commander. However, servicing and reloading of the weapon required the tank commander to open his roof hatch and expose his head and upper torso. This remote controllable mount was designated as the .50 Caliber Machine Gun Mount, M1 and designed by Chrysler Defense Engineering.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} By October 1954, the Army decided to amend the design of the tank by installing a cupola. During the production of M48s it was modified several times resulting in a wide mix of cupola styles among individual tanks. Afterwards it was renamed as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun, M1.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=23}} The new tank commander cupola would allow the tank commander to aim and fire his weapon while remaining under armor protection via a remote controlled M2HB machine gun, however the commander had to open the cupola hatch and expose his head to reload or service the machine gun due to the limited headroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} These cupolas had a small rearward opening hatch and a single, non-removable vision block. They were designed by [[AAI Corporation|Aircraft Armaments Incorporated]]. Because of its smaller turret roof hatch opening those M1 cupolas retro-fitted to early production M48 tanks used an adaptor ring.\n\nThe M1E1 cupola design used a G305 cupola riser with 9 non-removable vision blocks installed (some versions had 7 with the 2 rear blocks deleted) between the turret roof and the cupola. It also came with a new bulged hatch cover to provide the tank commander with more headroom and allowed him to reload the weapon while remaining under armor protection. A major drawback of both these cupolas was their inability to mount either daylight or infrared vision devices in the already cramped cupola's interior. Also due to restraints in the cupola, smaller 50 round ammunition boxes were used. Development of its eventual replacement, the [[M60 Patton#M19 Commander's Cupola|T9/M19 cupola]] of the XM60 tank was continued into {{year|1958}} and some M19 cupolas were retro-fitted to M48A5s to allow for the use of IR and daylight periscopes by the commander.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|pages=109{{ndash}}111}}\n\n===M48===\nChrysler began building the new [[Newark Assembly|Newark Tank Plant]] in Newark, Delaware in 1951 to produce the M48 while Chrysler Defense Engineering and ARCOVE continued advanced production engineering (APE) to evolve the design using the T48 prototypes at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. In May 1952 Chrysler came to an agreement to take control on a Government Owned and Contractor Operated (GOCO) basis of the Newark Tank plant production facility with the US Government and to continue production design refinement of the T48 at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. The first Chrysler production tank was unveiled on {{date|1952-07-01}} as the 90mm Gun Tank M48 and christened the M48 Patton by Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General [[George S Patton]].{{r|Christened}}\n \nTo meet the urgent need for tanks, production contracts were also awarded to [[General Motors]] [[Fisher Body]] Division and [[Ford Motor Company]] to produce the tank in Michigan starting in 1952. Also in July 1952 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company]] a $200 million contract to start producing the tank in 1953 at the Schenectady Tank Plant in New York.{{r|TankOrder}} All four companies were given initial production contracts in that same year for around 400 tanks each.\n\nThe M48 featured a gasoline-powered engine, different models were used depending on availability and manufacturer. Originally the M48(Mod A) was built at the Chrysler Defense using the Continental AV-1790-5B coupled to a General Motors CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission as used for the M47.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=317}} The M48(Mod B) used a Continental AV-1790-5C gasoline engine and either an Allison CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission. Most of these were built by the American Locomotive Company. Additionally a two-cylinder, gasoline, air-cooled engine (sometimes referred to as the \"Little Joe\" by tank crews) was provided to power a 28 volt, 300 ampere generator when the main engine was not needed. Fuel capacity was {{convert|200|gal|l|abbr=on}}  providing a cruising range of about {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly as were the previous M46 and M47 tanks.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} It had hydraulic shock absorbers mount on the first, second and sixth roadwheel pairs (opposite of the M46 and M47). The bow mounted machine gun and its related crew station was eliminated thus providing more ammunition storage for the main gun. The driver's station was moved to the front center of the hull. The steering controls were redesigned. A large aircraft-styled steering wheel (replacing the wobble stick control of the M46 and M47) and placing the transmission range selector on the floor to the driver's right. Mod A hulls had a small oval overhead hatch for the driver. It incorporated a mechanism that dropped his three periscope heads to provide clearance for the hatch door as it swung to the right, and the driver then had to reposition the periscopes by hand once the hatch was closed again. The vehicle did not have an [[NBC protection]] system for the crew and a fording depth of approximately {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe M48's turret consisted of a redesigned flat gun shield and standard pop-up hatch for the commander's station. The M48 Mod A turret design had a smaller roof hatches for both the commander and loader. A .50 cal M2HB using a M1 remote control mount on a pedestal was available for the commander. When not in use, the machine gun mount could be stowed on a bracket welded to the turret roof in front of the loader. The M48's direct fire control system consisted of an M12/T41 stereoscopic rangefinder with a field of view of 5 degrees and magnification of x7.5, an azimuth indicator, an M20 gunner's periscope and a T13 superelevation actuator. Two main bearings are bolted to the mounting plate on the roof of the tank turret to support the range finder on steel radial ball bearings. A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.{{r|TM9718A|page=60|q=A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.}} A .30 caliber M1919E4 machine gun was coaxially mounted to the main gun's right and was operated by the gunner. An M12 full field optical range finder was used, the same as the M47. The tank was not fitted with any night fighting or computerized fire control systems.{{r|M47_PattonMania}} It featured the 90&nbsp;mm T139 main gun using a Y-shaped muzzle brake on the barrel and carried 53 rounds. Eight ready rounds were stored in the left side of the turret bustle for the loader, the rest were stored inside safe containers in the hull. Tank crews complained that the Y-shaped fume extractor was found to be prone to snagging brush. It was replaced with a T-shaped model early in production.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nThese early M48 tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems. The M12 rangefinder was too fragile and often broke. Army Field Forces (AFF) found these tanks to be unsuitable for combat use in Europe and was regulated to limited use by US Army CONUS units until numerous shortcomings were corrected. Furthermore, some 120 hulls were found to have insufficient hull armor. These were denoted as the M48C and relegated to the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) for non-ballistic training use by the Armor School at [[Fort Knox]] to train crewmembers and maintenance personnel.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A1===\n[[File:Tensions_ran_high_at_Checkpoint_Charlie_in_1961_as_Easterners_fled_to_West,_Berlin_Wall_went_up.jpg|thumb|right|Two M48A1 face off against T-54's during one of several standoffs at Checkpoint Charlie in 1961]]\nThe Army concluded in January 1952 that the T42{{r|1952_Baldwin}} had failed as a tank capable of combat in Europe against Soviet tanks and reached the same conclusion in November 1953 for the M48 Mod A/B versions.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=32|q=The M48s width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.}} The M48A1 focused on improving the engine and the vehicle's operational range and fixing numerous mechanical problems. To cope with the lack of range, an add-on modification allowed the use of 4 external jettisonable {{convert|55|USgal|l|abbr=on}} of [[Avgas|MOGAS]] (motor gasoline) fuel drums was mounted to the rear deck, extending the range to {{convert|135|mi|km|abbr=on}}. This proved very unpopular with tank crews and operational range remained unsatisfactory.{{r|2016_Pike}} Further ARCOVE changes included a desire for the commander to observe and operate his weapons station while remaining under armor protection.{{r|2016_Pike}} At this same time the US Army Field Forces (USAAFF) declared the T42 medium tank unfit for production in November 1952, mainly due to serious shortcomings of its hull design. Ford's production of the M48 ended in August 1953 after a fire destroyed most of the Livonia Tank Plant.{{r|2020_Jackson}}\n\nTesting and feedback from ARCOVE had uncovered the fact that the original driver's hatch design of the M48(Mod A)/T48 tank proved to be too small and made for an uncomfortable seating position for the driver when operating the tank with his hatch in the open position. To rectify this problem a new larger driver hatch was devised that was introduced into series production vehicle as early as possible.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Also the front vision block was removable and could be replaced with an infrared IR vision block. A redesigned power pack featured an AV-1790-7B gasoline engine and CD-850-4B transmission.{{r|2019_Conners}} The turret was fitted with the M1 cupola that enclosed the M2HB machine gun.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} In April 1953, the Army standardized this configuration as the 90mm Gun Tank M48A1 Patton.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBetween April 1952 and December 1954, nearly 7,000 M48s and M48A1s were produced, with production contracts for an additional 2,500 M48A1s to be built through 1956. Combat units immediately received 2,120 of these early tanks, but correction of defects discovered after production delayed the fielding of the remaining tanks.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=62{{ndash}}64}} The first production vehicles suffered from excessive oil consumption and engine failures after only {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The gasoline engine managed only {{convert|0.33|mpgus|km/L|abbr=on}}, limiting range to {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} miles. The M48's width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=70{{ndash}}72}} Operational readiness rates of M48-equipped units tended to be low. The tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems, and the M12 stereoscopic rangefinder was uncomfortable to operate.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} However, the M48A1 was considered an even match for its Soviet counterpart, the T-54. {{As of|alt=On October 25, 1954|1954|10|25|post=,}} the Army decided to amend its designation of the M48 tank. Thereafter, the tanks with the original small driver's hatch and the Chrysler-designed M1 remote-control machine gun mount attached to the tank commander's cupola would remain the 90mm gun tank M48. However, all those tanks with the larger driver hatch and fitted with a new small turreted M1 cupola armed with a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun would be designated as the 90mm gun tank M48A1.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=41}} Many of these tanks were later upgraded to the A2 and A3 standards.\n\n===M48A2===\nThe concurrent testing of the T48 and production of the M48 was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2 as well as better quality control. Under the ARCOVE's \"single, efficient producer\" model, Defense Secretary [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] directed the Army to reduce the number of contractors producing each model of tank. In a new round of production bids for the M48A2, [[General Motors]] underbid Chrysler, and in September 1953 Army Secretary [[Robert T. Stevens]] awarded GM's [[Fisher Body]] division a $200 million contract to become the sole producer of the M48A2 and started production at its [[Grand Blanc Metal Center|Grand Blanc Tank Plant]] in Michigan in April 1953.{{r|underbid|q=WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 -- Robert T. Stevens, Secretary of the Army, announced today his decision to award to the Fisher body division of General Motors a contract of approximately $200,000,000 for the building of M-48 medium tanks.}} The decision raised skepticism among lawmakers. Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] noted the move would effectively leave GM as the only producer of light and medium tanks when the Chrysler production contract for M48 production was set to expire in April 1956.\n\nDuring the ARCOVE Questionmark III conference in June 1954 it was predicted that the Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and a compression ignition engine. In response to these findings an eventual replacement for the M48 was proposed, resulting in the T95 Tank Program. Months later Chrysler underbid GM in the new round of proposals. In September 1954 the Army awarded Chrysler an exclusive $160.6 million contract to restart production.{{r|Chrysler_underbids}} In November 1955 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company|Alco Products]] a $73 million contract to begin producing 600 M48A2s the next year at the Schenectady Tank Plant, New York.{{r|Alco}} However Alco opted to wrap up its tank business when its contract ended in July 1956. In May the Army awarded Chrysler, the only bidder, a $119 million contract to continue production of the M48A2 at the Delaware Tank Plant.{{r|1957_NYT}} In December 1953 Chrysler took on orders initially intended for the American Locomotive after the AlCo opted production cutbacks to its tank program and ceased further tank production by 1956.{{r|American Locomotive canceled}}\n\nThe engine deck was redesigned with two large louvered doors that replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This new rear hull arrangement on the M48A2 tank helped in cooling the engine and minimizing the infrared (heat) signature of the vehicle.{{r|1992_Crismon|page=73}} The suspension system was simplified. The track tensioner arm was eliminated, modifications to the idler arm, the addition of bumper springs and friction snubbers, and a relocation of the air cleaner assembly. The number of return rollers was reduced to 3 per side. With the more compact AVI-1790-8 engine, additional fuel tanks were installed in the engine compartment, increasing fuel capacity to 335 gallons.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Many older model M48s and M48A1s were rebuilt to this production configurations but retained their original 5 return rollers per side.{{r|1999_Decker|page=144}}\n\nThe M48A2C saw improvements for the turret. The M12 rangefinder was replaced with a full-field coincidence model. The M13 Fire Control included an improved turret control system M13 Fire Control System (FCS). The M13 FCS consists of the M5A2 ballistic drive and mechanical M13A3 gun data computer which integrated barrel temperature data{{r|1980_M60}} with an M17 coincidence range finder.{{r|2019_Conners}} The rangefinder is a [[Coincidence rangefinder|double image coincidence image instrument]] used as the ranging device of the gunner's primary direct sighting and fire control system. The gunner is provided with an M20 day periscope with a magnification of x8 and an M105D day telescopic sight with a magnification of x8 and a field of view of 7.5 degrees.{{r|1980_M60}} Range information from the rangefinder is fed into the ballistic computer through a shaft. The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A3===\n\nThe continued use of gasoline engines was undesirable due mainly to its high fuel consumption, poor low-end torque and fuel flammability. ARCOVE industrial representatives had expressed desires for a diesel engine for the tank since 1953.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} Continental Motors and OTAC began to develop an experimental X-shaped [[compression ignition]] engine in 1954 with [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 tank]] but it remained unreliable. In June 1955, OTAC adopted the recommendations and allowed a diesel engine to be used if it significantly contributed to better fuel economy.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=31}} By August 1956 the diesel powered AVDS-1790 was recommended for the M48 and the Army requested the initial retrofitting of approximately 1020 older M48A1s and A2s with the new engine in December.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a Soviet [[T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.{{r|2018_Beast}} After a brief examination of this tank's armor and [[D-10 tank gun|100&nbsp;mm gun]] by a British military attach\u00e9, the UK decided that their [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20 pounder]] (84mm L/66.7) was apparently incapable of defeating it. There were also rumors of an even larger [[U-5TS|115&nbsp;mm gun]] in the works.{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=137}} In response to this the US Army started [[M60 Patton#XM60 Development|development of the XM60]] to replace the M48 tank series and the development of a new main gun, the [[Royal Ordnance L7|105mm T254]].\n\nIn addition to the conversion of older model M48s, Chrysler continued to build new vehicles. New vehicles built to this standard used the M48A2 hull design (with 3 return rollers) and had redesigned fenders and mudguards, armored boxes around the taillights among other minor details. They were fitted with another re-designed commander's cupola, a modified M1E1. It had a modified hatch to allow more room in comparison to the previous M1 cupola and the two rear vision blocks were eliminated.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=87}} The driver's steering wheel was replaced with a T-bar control and received a padded seat.{{r|2019_Conners}} M48A3 hull production ended in May 1961. The Newark Tank plant was closed in October.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=103}}\n\nInstead of immediately getting a 105mm main gun, the M48A3 tanks were to retain their existing M41 90mm main guns for several reasons. First, funding shortfalls made it impossible to supply enough 105mm main gun rounds for all the planned converted tanks. Second, there were still large stockpiles of 90&nbsp;mm main gun rounds on hand. Third was its planned replacement, the [[M60 Patton]] was set to start production in 1959. This newest version of the M48 series received the designation Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked; 90mm Gun, M48A3 on 19 March 1958.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=29}}\n\nBy February 1960, the US Army had around 600 converted M48A3 Patton tanks and by 1964 the US Marine Corps had received 419.{{r|2015_Tencza}} The A3 model introduced the diesel engine, countering the earlier versions' characteristic of catching fire.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Because many M48A3 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A3 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\n===M48A5===\n[[File:US_M48A5_Patton.jpg|thumb|right|M48A5 Patton on display at [[National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey|Lawrenceville National Guard Museum]]]]\nIn the mid-1970s, the vehicle was modified to carry the heavier 105&nbsp;mm gun. The original program designation was XM736. The designation was subsequently changed to M48A3E1 and was finally standardized as M48A5. As many components from the [[M60 Patton|M60A1]] were utilized as possible. [[Anniston Army Depot]] was issued a contract to convert 501 M48A3 tanks to the M48A5 standard and this was completed in December 1976. These early M48A5's were essentially M48A3 tanks with the 105mm gun added. They retained the M1 cupola armed with a .50 cal machine gun.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBased on Israeli experience in upgrading M48 series tanks, further changes were included starting in August 1976. These included replacing the M1 cupola with a low-profile \"Urdan\" type cupola that mounted an [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun for use by the tank commander. A second [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun was mounted on the turret roof for use by the loader. Internal ammunition stowage for the 105mm main gun was also increased to 54 rounds. These tanks were initially given the designation M48A5API; but, after early conversions were brought up to the later standard, the API was removed and these tanks were known simply as M48A5.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nIn addition to the conversion of M48A3 tanks, an additional conversion process for bringing M48A1 tanks to M48A5 standard was also developed. By March 1978, 708 M48A5 tanks had been converted from the M48A1 model.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nWork continued until December 1979, at which time 2069 M48A5's had been converted.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nThe vast majority of M48A5 tanks in service with US Army units were assigned to National Guard and Army Reserve Units. A notable exception was the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], who replaced their M60A1 tanks with M48A5's, which arrived in June and July 1978. On [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] M48A5 tanks the commander's [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] was replaced with a [[M2 Browning|.50 caliber M2 machine gun]].{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the M48s were phased out of U.S. service. Many other countries, however, continued to use these M48 models.\n\n==Combat service==\n===Vietnam===\n[[File:Vietnam....Marines riding atop an M-48 tank cover their ears as te 90mm gun fires during a road sweep southwest of... - NARA - 532483.tif|thumb|US Marines riding atop an M48 tank in Vietnam in April 1968.]]\nThe M48 saw extensive action with the US military during the Vietnam War.

Each battalion consisted of approximately 57 tanks. M48s were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam until replaced by [[M551 Sheridan]] Armored Reconnaissance Airborne Assault Vehicles (ARAAV) in the Divisional Cavalry Squadrons. M48A3 tanks remained in service with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] until the unit was withdrawn from the conflict. The M67A1 [[flame tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} From 1965 to 1968, 120 US M48A3 tanks were written off.{{r|armor.kiev.ua}}\n\n[[File:Men of Troop B, Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Men of Troop B, 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, and their M48 Patton tank move through the dense jungle in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in June 1969.]]\nThe M48 Patton has the distinction of playing a unique role in an event that was destined to radically alter the conduct of armored warfare.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} When US forces commenced redeployment operations, many of the M48A3 Pattons were turned over to the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) forces, in particular creating the battalion-sized ARVN 20th Tank Regiment; which supplemented their [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] units. During the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) [[Easter Offensive]] in 1972, tank clashes between NVA [[T-54]]/[[PT-76]] and ARVN M48/M41 units became commonplace. But, on {{date|1972-04-23}}, tankers of the 20th Tank Regiment were attacked by an NVA infantry-tank team, which was equipped with the new ''[[9M14 Malyutka|9M14M Malyutka]]'' (NATO designation: Sagger) wire-guided [[anti-tank missile]]. During this battle, one M48A3 Patton tank and one [[M113 armored personnel carrier#M113 armored cavalry assault vehicle (ACAV) variant|M113]] Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle (ACAV) were destroyed, becoming the first losses to the Sagger missile; losses that would echo on an even larger scale a year later during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in the Middle East in 1973.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} By 2 May, 20th Tank Regiment had lost all of their tanks to enemy fire.{{r|1979_Starry|page=212}} During the first month of the [[First Battle of Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]] all ARVN M48 Pattons were lost.{{efn|1=1st Armor Brigade lost 43 M48s and 66 M41s, 20th Tank Regiment lost 57 M48s}}{{r|1979_Ngo|page=52}}\n[[File:NARA 111-CCV-372-CC33992 25th Infantry Division M48A3 Patton moving through Viet Cong territory Operation Lincoln 1966.jpg|thumb|A 1st Battalion, 69th Armor Patton during [[Operation Lincoln (Vietnam)|Operation Lincoln]]]]\nThe M48s performed admirably{{r|1987_Nolan}} in Vietnam in the infantry-support role.

South Vietnamese M48s and M41s fought in the [[1975 Spring Offensive]]. In several incidents, the ARVN successfully defeated NVA [[T-34]] and [[T-55]] tanks and even slowed the North's offensive. However, due to shortages of fuel and munitions faced by the South Vietnamese military because of the US Congress-placed ban on the further funding and supply of military equipment and logistics to the country, the American-made tanks soon ran out of ammunition and fuel and were quickly abandoned to the NVA, which then put them in their service after the war ended in May 1975. In total, 250 of the ARVN's M48A3s were destroyed and captured{{r|1976_NM|page=10}} and those captured (at least 30) were only used briefly before being phased out and turned into war-memorial displays all over Vietnam.[[File:M48A3 Detonates Mine Vietnam.jpg|thumb|A destroyed M48A3 during Vietnam war]]{{anchor|M48-land-mines}} M48s, along with Australian [[20 pounder|20 pounder (84mm)]]-gunned{{r|1979_Starry|page=113}} [[Centurion tank|Centurions]] of the [[1st Armoured Regiment (Australia)|1st Armoured Regiment]],{{r|1982_Dunstan}} were the only vehicles in use by the anti-communist side in the Vietnam War that could reasonably protect their crews from [[land mine]]s. They were often used for minesweeping operations along Highway 19 in the Central Highlands, a two-lane paved road between [[An Khe]] and [[Pleiku]]. Daily convoys moved both ways along Highway 19. These convoys were held up each morning while the road was swept for mines. At that time, minesweeping was done by soldiers walking slowly over the dirt shoulders of the highway with hand-held mine detectors. During this slow process, convoys would build up into a dangerously-inviting target for the enemy, especially their guerillas and partisans. As a result, a faster method was improvised, the ''\"Thunder Run\"'', in which one M48 lined up on each side of the road, with one track on the dirt shoulder and the other track on the asphalt, and then with all guns firing,{{r|1979_Starry|page=80}} they raced to a designated position miles away. If the M48s made it without striking a mine, the road was clear and the convoys could proceed. In most cases, an M48 that struck a land mine in these operations only lost a road wheel or two in the explosion; seldom was there any hull damage that would be considered a [[catastrophic kill]].{{r|1979_Starry}}\n\nSupply of M48A3 tanks to South Vietnam:\n\n* 1971: 54.{{r|2015_Hatcher}}\n* May 1972: 120.{{r|2005_Mo\u00efse|page=135}}\n* October 1972: 72.{{r|2005_Mo\u00efse|page=135}}\n* November 1972: 59.{{r|1979_Starry|page=218}}\n* January 1973 - July 1974: 16.<ref>Better Management of Secondary Items by the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces Would Reduce U.S. Investment; Department of Defense: Report to the Congress by the Comptroller General of the United States.

During [[Operation Grand Slam]], Pakistani tank forces, composed mainly of M47 and M48 Patton tanks, thrust through the Indian defence-lines very quickly and swiftly defeated back Indian Army armoured counter-attacks. The Pakistanis used approximately a division's worth of tanks in the operation, although not all were Pattons, with upgraded Shermans included as well. In contrast, Pakistan's Patton tank failed to live up to its high expectations in the [[Battle of Asal Uttar]] in September 1965, where about 97 Pakistani tanks were lost, the majority of them being Pattons (M47s and M48s). Later, the Patton tank was the main Pakistani tank at the [[Battle of Chawinda]] and its performance at that battle was deemed satisfactory against Indian armour.\n\nThe Patton was later used by Pakistan again, this time, in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. A counter-attack led by the 13th Lancers and the 31st Cavalry army units was defeated by the Indian 54th Division around [[Battle of Barapind]] in December 1971. The Pakistan Army Patton tanks could not stop an assault by Indian T-55 Soviet-supplied tanks of the 2th Armored Brigade.{{r|strategic_affairs}} At least 9 of the Pattons were destroyed by T-55 tanks during the battle of Nainakot.{{r|1995_Chakravorty|page=342}} It total, more than 80 Pakistani Pattons were knocked out during battle, mainly by Centurion and T-55 fire.{{r|strategic_affairs}}\n\nIndia later set up a temporary war-memorial so named \"''Patton Nagar''\" (or \"Patton City\") in [[Khemkaran]] District in Punjab, where the captured Pakistani Patton tanks were displayed for a short period of time before being scrapped or sent all across India for use as war monuments and military memorials.\n\nAnalysing their overall performance in their wars with India, the Pakistani military held that the Patton was held in reasonably-high esteem by both sides and that combat-tactics were to blame for their utter defeat and the following debacle at Asal Uttar.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, a post-war US study of the tank battles in South Asia concluded that the Patton's armor could, in fact, be penetrated by the [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder tank gun]] (84&nbsp;mm) of the Centurion (later replaced by the even-more successful L7 105mm gun on the Mk. 7 version which India also possessed) as well as the 75&nbsp;mm tank gun of the [[AMX-13]] light tank.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Middle East===\n[[File:Israeli M48 tank captured by Egypt.jpg|thumb|An ex-Israeli M48 Patton tank captured by Egypt during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973.]]\nM48s were also used with mixed results during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967. On the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] battlefront, [[Israel]]i M48s upgunned with the then-advanced 105&nbsp;mm L7 rifled tank gun were used with considerable success against [[Egypt]]ian [[IS-3 (tank)|IS-3]]s, T-54s/T-55s, T-34/85s and [[SU-100]]s supplied by the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1950s and the 1960s (such as during the [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967)|Second Battle of Abu-Ageila]]. However, on the [[West Bank]] war-front, [[Jordan]]ian M48s (Jordan was also a user of the M48 Patton as was Israel at the same time-period) were often defeated by Israeli 105mm-armed Centurions and WWII-era upgraded M4 Shermans ([[Super Sherman|M-51s]] upgunned with French-built 105&nbsp;mm tank guns (not to be confused with the British L7 105mm tank gun)). In purely-technical terms, the Pattons were far superior to the much-older Shermans, with shots at more than 1,000 meters simply glancing off the M48's armor. However, the 105&nbsp;mm main gun of the Israeli Shermans fired a [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|HEAT]] round designed to defeat the Soviet [[T-62|T-62 tank]], which was the USSR's response to the M48's successor in US service, the [[M60 Patton]]. The Jordanian Pattons' general failure on the West Bank could also be attributed to excellent Israeli [[air superiority]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The Israeli Army captured about 100 Jordanian M48 and M48A1 tanks and pressed them into service in their own units after the war, as the same as were the Jordanian M113 APCs they seized during the war.\n\nIsrael used 445 M48 tanks in 1973 during the [[Yom Kippur War]].{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=20}} From 15 to 18 October, M48 tanks participated in the largest{{r|2011_Zaloga|page=34}} tank battle of the war - [[Battle of the Chinese Farm]].

As a [[Metropolitan archbishop|metropolitan]] church, it has as suffragans: Acqui, Alba, Aosta, Asti, Cuneo, Fossano, Ivrea, Mondov\u00ec, Pinerolo, Saluzzo and Susa.<ref>Diocesi di Torino, [http://www.diocesi.torino.it/diocesi/ ''Diocesi: Storia'']; retrieved: 9 July 2018. {{in lang|it}}</ref> Its [[mother church]] is the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (Turin)|Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist]].\n\nSince 2010 the [[Archbishop]] of [[Turin]] has been [[Cesare Nosiglia]].\n\n==History==\nThe earliest bishop of Turin whose name has survived was [[Maximus of Turin|St Maximus]]. Fedele Savio, in fact, argues that Maximus was the first bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 285-286: ''Ma niuna memoria essendo rimasta di vescovi anteriori a S. Massimo e l'episcopato di questo Santo non potendosi protrarre molto in su nel secolo IV, noi incliniamo a credere che l'episcopato di Torino fosse instituto insieme con quello di Novara nel 398, oppure verso questo tempo''.</ref> Maximus, many of whose [[homily|homilies]] are extant, died between 408 and 423.<ref>Savio, pp. 283-294, at p. 293. Semeria, pp. 24-26.</ref>\n\nBishop Ursicinus (569-609) underwent captivity and loss of his property at the hands of the [[Franks]]. [[Pope Gregory I]] complained to Bishop Syagrius of Autun that someone else was made bishop in place of Ursicinus, in violation of Canon Law, and Ursicinus' diocese was taken away from him.<ref>Savio, pp. 225-226. Kehr, p. 81, no. 1. J. P. Migne, ''Patrologia Latina'' Vol 77, p. 1045 no 115.</ref> It has been inferred that the [[Diocese of Moriana]] (Maurienne) was detached from that of Turin on this occasion.{{sfn|Herbermann|1913}}\n\nDuke Garibold of Turin, who had assassinated the Lombard King Godebert in 662, was murdered in an act of revenge, in the Baptistry of S. Giovanni il Battisto in the Cathedral of Turin.<ref>Rondolino, p. 10, citing Paul the Deacon at p. 23 note 10. Semeria, p. 50.</ref>\n\nOther bishops were: [[Claudius of Turin]] (817-27), a copious and controversial writer, famous for his opposition to the veneration of images;<ref name=\"ODCC\">{{harvnb|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=359}}</ref> Regimirus (of uncertain date, in the 9th century), who established a rule of common life among his canons; [[Amulo]] (880-98), who incurred the ill-will of the Turinese and was driven out by them; [[Gezo (bishop of Turin)|Gezo]] (1000), who founded the monastery of San Solutore in Turin; [[Landulf (bishop of Turin)|Landulf]] (1037), who founded the Abbey of [[Cavour (TO)|Cavour]] and repaired the damage inflicted on his Church by the [[Saracen]] incursions; [[Cunibert of Turin]] (1046\u20131080), to whom [[Peter Damian|St Peter Damian]] wrote a letter (''Epistolae'' IV.iii) exhorting him to repress the laxity of his clergy in matters of clerical celibacy; [[Boso of Sant'Anastasia|Boso]] (1122\u2013c.1127), who resigned as a cardinal to become bishop.\n\nIn 1074 Bishop [[Cunibert of Turin]] (1046\u20131080) was summoned by [[Pope Gregory VII]] to attend a synod which was announced for 30 November in that year. One of the matters to be treated was the controversy between Cunibert and Abbot Benedict of S. Michele di Chiusa.<ref>{{cite book|author=H. E. J. Cowdrey|title=Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9SG3pEWGfkC&pg=PA66|date=20 August 1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-158459-6|pages=66, 282\u2013283}} The controversy had already involved [[Pope Alexander II]], according to William of Chiusa, the biographer of Abbot Benedict: ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores'' [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_1925-1933__MGH__1_Scriptores._SS_12._Historiae_Aevi_Salici__LT.pdf.html Tomus XII] (Hannover: Hahn 1856), p. 204.</ref> The Bishop claimed that the monastery was situated on allodial property of the diocese, and therefore the bishop had the right to install the abbot and collect the [[Tithe|''decima'' tax]]. On 12 December 1074, the Pope wrote again, in considerable anger, because Cunibert had refused to attend the synod (''venire contempsit''); the Pope further advised Cunibert that another synod was going to be held toward the end of February 1075, which he was warned he must attend, and in the meantime he was to stop disturbing the monastery. When the synod took place, Cunibert was suspended from office, and in a letter of 9 April 1075 Pope Gregory again chastised him for breaking his promise and continuing to harass the monks of S. Michele. Cunibert was given until 11 November, the next synod meeting day, to reach a peaceable settlement with Abbot Benedict, or else to put in an appearance at the synod, where his case would be given final judgement. The case dragged on, however, and on 24 November 1078, after Bishop Cunibert finally appeared at the Papal Court, the Pope gave final judgement, requiring Cunibert to return whatever he had taken from the monks, and the monks likewise, under the supervision of the Bishops of Asti and Aqui and the Abbot of Fruttuaria. If the Bishop still wished to assert that the monastery had been built on land belonging to the diocese and was under his jurisdiction, he should come to the next synod and present his proofs; otherwise, he should hold his peace.<ref>Semeria, pp. 80-83. Kehr, pp. 82-84, nos. 7-13.</ref>\n\n===Two episcopal 'elections'===\nIn 1243, Bishop Hugo (Uguccione) de Cagnola (1231\u20131243) abdicated the bishopric of Turin and became a [[Cistercian]]. Before he retired to a monastery (the house of the Cistercians in Genoa) though, he was required to administer his diocese until a successor was elected. On 15 November 1243, [[Pope Innocent IV]] ordered Bishop Hugo to see to the election of the Pope's Chamberlain, Nicholas, Provost of Genoa as the next Bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, p. 372. \u00c9lie Berger, ''Les registres d'Innocent IV'', Tome premier (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1884), p. 41 no. 228.</ref> On 10 May 1244, Pope Innocent ordered the Papal Legate Gregorio de Montelongo, Papal Subdeacon and Notary, to see to the election of the Abbot of San Gennaro near Trino in the diocese of Vercelli, Giovanni Arborio, as the next bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 372-373. Berger, p. 115, no. 675.</ref>\n\n===An episcopal election===\nThe episcopal election of 1319 is unusually well-attested. Bishop Teodisius Revelli (1301\u20131319) died in the Spring of 1319. The Cathedral Chapter met on 16 May to choose his successor. One of the electors, the Primicerius Thomas de Pellizonus, was ill and was the subject of threats on the part of some disaffected citizens of Turin, and was therefore unable to attend the meeting. He sent a notarized explanation of his absence by means of two procurators, Canon Guilelmus de Cavaglata and Canon Guido de Canalibus. The electoral assembly duly took place later that day, and Canon Guido de Canalibus was elected Bishop of Turin. An electoral statement was drawn up immediately, and carried to the home of the Primicerius Thomas, who approved and ratified the election, still on 16 May. This too was written down and properly notarized. The documents indicate that Bishop Guido was the immediate successor of the late Bishop Teodisius.<ref>Chiuso, pp. 443-445. Semeria, p. 492. These documents make it clear that there was no intermediate bishop, the alleged Thomas de Sabaudia, as indicated by Eubel, I, p. 475, repeating information from Gams, p. 824. The alleged date of Bishop Teodesius' death, October 1318, is merely the date of his latest known document.</ref>\n\nBishop Guido Canale had the unenviable task of annulling the marriage of Frederick of Saluzzo and Jacobina de Blandrata in 1333, on the grounds of affinity in the third degree. The matter needed to be repaired by papal bulls of [[Pope John XXII]].<ref>Chiuso, pp. 448-453.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Turin had a palace at Pinerolo, from which numerous surviving documents have been dated.\n\n===Creation of the archdiocese===\n\nOn 21 May 1515, during the Tenth Session of the [[Fifth Lateran Council]], [[Pope Leo X]] removed the diocese of Turin from the metropolitan obedience of Milan, and created Turin an archiepiscopal see with the diocese of [[diocese of Mondov\u00ec|Mondov\u00ec]] and [[diocese of Ivrea|Ivrea]] as its suffragans, other sees being added later.<ref>Semeria, p. 265.</ref> On the same day, the Pope sent a letter to Bishop [[Giovanni Francesco della Rovere]], notifying him of his promotion to the rank of archbishop, and another to the new suffragans, notifying them of the creation of the archdiocese.<ref>Ughelli, IV, pp. 1058-1060.</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the diocese saw the rise the [[Waldensian]] sect<ref>Semeria, pp. 161-164.</ref> and of [[Calvinism]]. It is known that, in the Spring of 1536, [[John Calvin]] himself, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino of Aosta, and he was forced to flee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean Mary Stone|title=Reformation and Renaissance (circa 1377-1610)|url=https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog|year=1904|publisher=Duckworth and Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog/page/n345 313]}}</ref> The [[Council of Trent]] called upon bishops everywhere to attempt to restore Roman Catholicism. Archbishop [[Girolamo della Rovere]], in 1566, engaged in a public disputation with the Protestants of the Piedmont, and was victorious, which was greeted with great satisfaction by the Duke. In 1567, he conducted a visitation of the valley of the Stura, and preached to and conversed with many Protestants who had come into Piedmont from France, again with some success.<ref>Semeria, p. 287.</ref> During his administration, [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Duke Emanuele Filiberto]] brought to Turin from his castle in Chamb\u00e9ry the Holy [[Shroud of Turin|Shroud]], the personal property of his family, and, on 29 December 1590, the body of [[St Maurice]], the martyr.<ref>Semeria, pp. 338-341.</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the wars between France and Savoy with the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559#Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis (1559)|Peace of Cateau Cambresis]] and the French withdrawal, in 1563 the permanent principal residence of the Dukes of Savoy became the city of Turin. The university was moved from Mondov\u00ec, where it had retreated during the French occupation. A Jesuit college was opened in Turin in 1567, with an annual subsidy from the Duke, and the Jesuit Collegio dei Nobili in 1572.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aldo Scaglione|title=The Liberal Arts and the Jesuit College System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dD09hNd79pIC&pg=PA138|year=1986|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|location=Amsterdam-Philadelphia|isbn=90-272-2035-2|pages=137\u2013138}}</ref> In 1577, Archbishop della Rovere began the construction of the church ''Santi Martiri'' for the Jesuits in Turin.<ref>Semeria, p. 288-289.</ref>\n\nCardinal Gerolamo della Rovere (1564-1592) had the rare honor of dying while in Conclave in Rome, to elect a successor to [[Pope Innocent IX]] (Facchinetti).

At the same time the [[Risorgimento]] and the operations of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] had brought about a revolution in Rome, which drove [[Pope Pius IX]] into exile. Piedmontese policy called for a reform of the rights of the Church, especially of the regular clergy. Fransoni's vocal reaction to these events and policies helped to stimulate the already widespread anticlericalism in Italy,<ref>Manuel Borutta, \"Anti-Catholicism and the Culture War in Risorgimento Italy,\" in: {{cite book|author1=S.

It is conjectured that the building was the work of the first Bishop, Maximus, which would place the date around the beginning of the 5th century.<ref>Rondolino, pp. 9-10.</ref> It was constituted of three interconnected churches, San Salvatore, San Giovanni Battista and Santa Maria.

Massimo e l'episcopato di questo Santo non potendosi protrarre molto in su nel secolo IV, noi incliniamo a credere che l'episcopato di Torino fosse instituto insieme con quello di Novara nel 398, oppure verso questo tempo''.</ref> Maximus, many of whose [[homily|homilies]] are extant, died between 408 and 423.<ref>Savio, pp. 283-294, at p. 293. Semeria, pp. 24-26.</ref>\n\nBishop Ursicinus (569-609) underwent captivity and loss of his property at the hands of the [[Franks]].

Semeria, p. 50.</ref>\n\nOther bishops were: [[Claudius of Turin]] (817-27), a copious and controversial writer, famous for his opposition to the veneration of images;<ref name=\"ODCC\">{{harvnb|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=359}}</ref> Regimirus (of uncertain date, in the 9th century), who established a rule of common life among his canons; [[Amulo]] (880-98), who incurred the ill-will of the Turinese and was driven out by them; [[Gezo (bishop of Turin)|Gezo]] (1000), who founded the monastery of San Solutore in Turin; [[Landulf (bishop of Turin)|Landulf]] (1037), who founded the Abbey of [[Cavour (TO)|Cavour]] and repaired the damage inflicted on his Church by the [[Saracen]] incursions; [[Cunibert of Turin]] (1046\u20131080), to whom [[Peter Damian|St Peter Damian]] wrote a letter (''Epistolae'' IV.iii) exhorting him to repress the laxity of his clergy in matters of clerical celibacy; [[Boso of Sant'Anastasia|Boso]] (1122\u2013c.1127), who resigned as a cardinal to become bishop.\n\nIn 1074 Bishop [[Cunibert of Turin]] (1046\u20131080) was summoned by [[Pope Gregory VII]] to attend a synod which was announced for 30 November in that year. One of the matters to be treated was the controversy between Cunibert and Abbot Benedict of S. Michele di Chiusa.<ref>{{cite book|author=H. E. J. Cowdrey|title=Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9SG3pEWGfkC&pg=PA66|date=20 August 1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-158459-6|pages=66, 282\u2013283}} The controversy had already involved [[Pope Alexander II]], according to William of Chiusa, the biographer of Abbot Benedict: ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores'' [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_1925-1933__MGH__1_Scriptores._SS_12._Historiae_Aevi_Salici__LT.pdf.html Tomus XII] (Hannover: Hahn 1856), p. 204.</ref> The Bishop claimed that the monastery was situation on allodial property of the diocese, and therefore the bishop had the right to install the abbot and to collect the [[Tithe|''decima'' tax]]. On 12 December 1074, the Pope wrote again, in considerable anger, because Cunibert had refused to attend the synod (''venire contempsit''); the Pope further advised Cunibert that another synod was going to be held toward the end of February 1075, which he was warned he must attend, and in the meantime he was to stop disturbing the monastery. When the synod took place, Cunibert was suspended from office, and in a letter of 9 April 1075 Pope Gregory again chastised him for breaking his promise and continuing to harass the monks of S. Michele. Cunibert was given until 11 November, the next synod meeting day, to reach a peaceable settlement with Abbot Benedict, or else to put in an appearance at the synod, where his case would be given final judgement. The case dragged on, however, and on 24 November 1078, after Bishop Cunibert finally appeared at the Papal Court, the Pope gave final judgement, requiring Cunibert to return whatever he had taken from the monks, and the monks likewise, under the supervision of the Bishops of Asti and Aqui and the Abbot of Fruttuaria. If the Bishop still wished to assert that the monastery had been built on land belonging to the diocese and was under his jurisdiction, he should come to the next synod and present his proofs; otherwise, he should hold his peace.<ref>Semeria, pp. 80-83. Kehr, pp. 82-84, nos. 7-13.</ref>\n\n===Two episcopal 'elections'===\nIn 1243, Bishop Hugo (Uguccione) de Cagnola (1231\u20131243) abdicated the bishopric of Turin and became a [[Cistercian]]. Before he retired to a monastery (the house of the Cistercians in Genoa) though, he was required to administer his diocese until a successor was elected. On 15 November 1243, [[Pope Innocent IV]] ordered Bishop Hugo to see to the election of the Pope's Chamberlain, Nicholas, Provost of Genoa as the next Bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, p. 372. \u00c9lie Berger, ''Les registres d'Innocent IV'', Tome premier (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1884), p. 41 no. 228.</ref> On 10 May 1244, Pope Innocent ordered the Papal Legate Gregorio de Montelongo, Papal Subdeacon and Notary, to see to the election of the Abbot of San Gennaro near Trino in the diocese of Vercelli, Giovanni Arborio, as the next bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 372-373. Berger, p. 115, no. 675.</ref>\n\n===An episcopal election===\nThe episcopal election of 1319 is unusually well-attested. Bishop Teodisius Revelli (1301\u20131319) died in the Spring of 1319. The Cathedral Chapter met on 16 May to choose his successor. One of the electors, the Primicerius Thomas de Pellizonus, was ill and was the subject of threats on the part of some disaffected citizens of Turin, and was therefore unable to attend the meeting. He sent a notarized explanation of his absence by means of two procurators, Canon Guilelmus de Cavaglata and Canon Guido de Canalibus. The electoral assembly duly took place later that day, and Canon Guido de Canalibus was elected Bishop of Turin. An electoral statement was drawn up immediately, and carried to the home of the Primicerius Thomas, who approved and ratified the election, still on 16 May. This too was written down and properly notarized. The documents indicate that Bishop Guido was the immediate successor of the late Bishop Teodisius.<ref>Chiuso, pp. 443-445. Semeria, p. 492. These documents make it clear that there was no intermediate bishop, the alleged Thomas de Sabaudia, as indicated by Eubel, I, p. 475, repeating information from Gams, p. 824. The alleged date of Bishop Teodesius' death, October 1318, is merely the date of his latest known document.</ref>\n\nBishop Guido Canale had the unenviable task of annulling the marriage of Frederick of Saluzzo and Jacobina de Blandrata in 1333, on the grounds of affinity in the third degree. The matter needed to be repaired by papal bulls of [[Pope John XXII]].<ref>Chiuso, pp. 448-453.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Turin had a palace at Pinerolo, from which numerous surviving documents have been dated.\n\n===Creation of the archdiocese===\n\nOn 21 May 1515, during the Tenth Session of the [[Fifth Lateran Council]], [[Pope Leo X]] removed the diocese of Turin from the metropolitan obedience of Milan, and created Turin an archiepiscopal see with the diocese of [[diocese of Mondov\u00ec|Mondov\u00ec]] and [[diocese of Ivrea|Ivrea]] as its suffragans, other sees being added later.<ref>Semeria, p. 265.</ref> On the same day, the Pope sent a letter to Bishop [[Giovanni Francesco della Rovere]], notifying him of his promotion to the rank of archbishop, and another to the new suffragans, notifying them of the creation of the archdiocese.<ref>Ughelli, IV, pp. 1058-1060.</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the diocese saw the rise the [[Waldensian]] sect<ref>Semeria, pp. 161-164.</ref> and of [[Calvinism]]. It is known that, in the Spring of 1536, [[John Calvin]] himself, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino of Aosta, and he was forced to flee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean Mary Stone|title=Reformation and Renaissance (circa 1377-1610)|url=https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog|year=1904|publisher=Duckworth and Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog/page/n345 313]}}</ref> The [[Council of Trent]] called upon bishops everywhere to attempt to restore Roman Catholicism. Archbishop [[Girolamo della Rovere]], in 1566, engaged in a public disputation with the Protestants of the Piedmont, and was victorious, which was greeted with great satisfaction by the Duke.

At the same time the [[Risorgimento]] and the operations of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] had brought about a revolution in Rome, which drove [[Pope Pius IX]] into exile. Piedmontese policy called for a reform of the rights of the Church, especially of the regular clergy.

Colleges of Canons were being created at cathedrals in accordance with the French Council of Aquisgranda (816) and the Roman council of [[Pope Eugene II]] (826).</ref> The Cathedral Chapter consisted of five dignities and twenty Canons and twenty prebends. The dignities were: the Provost, the Archdeacon, the Treasurer, the Archpriest, and the Primicerius (Cantor).

In Courgn\u00e8 there was a Provost and six Canons. In Giaveno, at San Lorenzo, there was a Provost and eight Canons. In Moncalieri, at Santa Maria della Scala, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost and six Canons. At Santa Maria di Rivoli, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost, an Archpriest, a Cantor, and five Canons. At Savigliano, at S. Andrea, founded in 1028, which was in charge of four parishes, there was a college of Canons Regular; [[Pope Clement XII]] secularized the Canons, who were thereafter sixteen in number (of whom one was the Penitentiary), presided over by an Abbot, an Archpriest and a Primicerius.<ref>Cappelletti, pp. 72-73</ref>\n\n===Seminary===\nThe seminary of the diocese of Turin was established by Cardinal Girolamo della Rovere on 4 June 1567, in accordance with the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].
