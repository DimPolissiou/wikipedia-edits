Graduate School of The University of Texas, p. 56</ref>\n\nThe [[Samnites]], people from the areas of [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]], and allies of the Romans, conquered Greek Cumae between 423 and 420 BC and it is likely that all the surrounding territory, including Pompeii, was already conquered around 424 BC. The new rulers gradually imposed their architecture and enlarged the town.\n\nFrom 343 BC, the first Roman army entered the Campanian plain bringing with it the customs and traditions of Rome and in the Roman [[Latin War]] the Samnites were faithful to Rome. Pompeii, although governed by the Samnites, entered the Roman orbit, to which it remained faithful even during the third Samnite war and in the war against [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]. In the late 4th c. BC the city began to expand from its nucleus and into the open walled area. The street plan of the new areas was more regular and more conformal to [[Hippodamus]]'s street plan. The city walls were reinforced in [[Sarno]] stone in the early 3rd century BC (the limestone ''enceinte'', or the \"first Samnite wall\"). It formed the basis for the currently visible walls with an outer wall of rectangular limestone blocks as a terrace wall supporting a large ''[[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]]'', or earth embankment, behind it.\n\nAfter the [[Samnite Wars]] from 290 BC, Pompeii was forced to accept the status of ''[[socii]]'' of Rome, maintaining, however, linguistic and administrative autonomy.\n\nFrom the outbreak of the [[Second Punic War]] (218\u2013201 BC) in which Pompeii remained faithful to Rome, an additional internal wall was built of [[tufa]] and the internal ''agger'' and outer fa\u00e7ade raised resulting in a double parapet with wider wall-walk.<ref name=\"Etienne-1992\"/> Despite the political uncertainty of these events and the progressive migration of wealthy men to quieter cities in the eastern Mediterranean, Pompeii continued to flourish due to the production and trade of wine and oil with places like [[Provence]] and Spain,<ref>Paul Zanker, ''Pompeii: society, urban images and forms of living'', Turin, Giulio Einaudi Editore, 1993. {{ISBN|88-06-13282-2}} p. 60</ref> as well as to intensive agriculture on farms around the city.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, Pompeii enriched itself by taking part in Rome's conquest of the east as shown by a statue of Apollo in the Forum erected by [[Lucius Mummius]] in gratitude for their support in the sack of [[Corinth]] and the eastern campaigns. These riches enabled Pompeii to bloom and expand to its ultimate limits. The [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] and many public and private buildings of high architectural quality were built, including the large theatre, the sanctuary to Jupiter, the Basilica, the Comitium, the Stabian Baths and a new two-story portico.<ref>ecolo a.C.\" In Sicilia ellenistica, consuetudo italica.

Many nearby buildings inside the walls were also destroyed.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 396</ref> Although the battle-hardened troops of the Social League, headed by [[Lucius Cluentius]], helped in resisting the Romans, Pompeii was forced to surrender after the conquest of Nola. \n\nThe result was that Pompeii became a Roman colony with the name of ''Colonia [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelia]] [[Venus (mythology)|Veneria]] Pompeianorum''. Many of Sulla's veterans were given land and property in and around the city, while many of those who opposed Rome were depossessed of their property. Despite this, the Pompeians were granted [[Roman citizenship]] and they were quickly assimilated into the Roman world. The main language in the city became Latin,<ref name=\"Pompeii\">{{cite book |last = Beard |first = Mary |title = Pompeii |publisher = Profile Books LTD|isbn = 978-1-86197-596-6|date = 2008}}</ref> and many of Pompeii's old aristocratic families Latinized their names as a sign of assimilation.<ref name=\"Pompeii-The Living City\">{{cite book|last = Butterworth|first = Alex|title = Pompeii \u2013 The Living City|publisher = St Martin's Press; 1st edition|isbn = 978-0-312-35585-2|date = 2005|url = https://archive.org/details/pompeiilivingcit00alex}}</ref> \n\nThe city became an important passage for goods that arrived by sea and had to be sent toward Rome or [[southern Italy]] along the nearby [[Appian Way]]. Many public buildings were built or refurbished and improved under the new order; new buildings included the amphitheatre in 70 BC,   the Forum Baths and the ''theatrum tectum'' while the forum was embellished with the colonnade of Popidius before 80 BC.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 172</ref> These buildings raised the status of Pompeii as a cultural centre in the region as it outshone its neighbours in the number of places for entertainment which significantly enhanced the social and economic development of the city.\n\nUnder [[Augustus]] from about 30 BC a major expansion in new public buildings, as in the rest of the empire, included the Eumachia building, the Sanctuary of Augustus and the [[Macellum]]. From about 20 BC, Pompeii was fed with running water by a spur from the Serino aqueduct or [[Aqua Augusta (Naples)]] built by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]].\n\nIn AD 59, there was a serious riot and bloodshed in the amphitheatre between Pompeians and [[Nuceria]]ns (which is recorded in a fresco) and which led the Roman senate to send the [[Praetorian Guard]] to restore order and to ban further events for a period of ten years.<ref>Tacitus: Ann. 14.17</ref><ref>See W.

The nearby cities of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Nuceria]] were also affected.<ref name=\"archaeology1\"/>\n\nBetween 62 and the eruption in 79 most rebuilding was done in the private sector and older, damaged frescoes were often covered with newer ones, for example. In the public sector the opportunity was taken to improve buildings and the city plan e.g. in the forum.<ref>''The World of Pompeii'', Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W.

The new baths took over a whole ''insula'' by demolishing houses, which may have been made easier by the earthquake that had damaged these houses. This shows that the city was still flourishing rather than struggling to recover from the earthquake.<ref>John J. Dobbins, Pedar W.

By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nA multidisciplinary [[Vulcanology|volcanological]] and [[Biological anthropology|bio-anthropological]] study<ref>{{Harvnb|Mastrolorenzo|Petrone|Pappalardo|Guarino|2010|p=e11127}}.</ref> of the eruption products and victims, merged with numerical simulations and experiments, indicates that at Pompeii and surrounding towns [[heat]] was the main cause of death of people, previously believed to have died by ash [[suffocation]].

The people and buildings of Pompeii were covered in up to 12 different layers of [[tephra]], in total up to {{convert|6|m|ft|1}} deep.\n\n[[Pliny the Younger]] provided a first-hand account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius from his position across the [[Bay of Naples]] at [[Misenum]] but written 25 years after the event. His uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]], with whom he had a close relationship, died while attempting to rescue stranded victims.

Further eruptions particularly in 471\u20133 and 512 covered the remains more deeply.\n\nThe next known date that any part was unearthed was in 1592, when architect [[Domenico Fontana]] while digging an underground aqueduct ran into ancient walls covered with paintings and inscriptions. He unearthed a few frescoes, then covered them over again, and nothing more came of the discovery. \n\nA wall inscription had mentioned a ''decurio Pompeii'' ('the town councillor of Pompeii') but its reference to the long-forgotten Roman city was missed.\n\nHerculaneum itself was rediscovered in 1738 by workmen digging for the foundations of a [[summer palace]] for the [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]], [[Charles III of Spain|Charles of Bourbon]]. Due to the spectacular quality of the finds, the Spanish military engineer [[Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre]] made excavations to find further remains at the site of Pompeii in 1748, even if the city was not identified.<ref name=\"Ozgenel 2008 13\">{{Harvnb|Ozgenel|2008|p=13}}.</ref> Charles of Bourbon took great interest in the finds, even after leaving to become king of Spain, because the display of antiquities reinforced the political and cultural prestige of Naples.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ozgenel|2008|p=19}}</ref> On August 20, 1763, an inscription ''[...] Rei Publicae Pompeianorum [...]'' was found and the city was identified as Pompeii.<ref>Giuseppe Fiorelli: Pompeianarum Antiquitatum Historia.

The land on which Pompeii lies was expropriated and up to 700 workers were used in the excavations. The excavated areas in the north and south were connected. Parts of the Via dell'Abbondanza were also exposed in west\u2013east direction and for the first time an impression of the size and appearance of the ancient town could be appreciated. In the following years, the excavators struggled with lack of money and excavations progressed slowly, but with significant finds such as the houses of the [[House of the Faun|Faun]], of [[Meleager]], the [[House of the Tragic Poet|Tragic Poet]] and the [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri]].\n\n[[Giuseppe Fiorelli]] took charge of the excavations in 1863 and made greater progress.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/pompeii_rediscovery_01.shtml#two |title=Pompeii: Its Discovery and Preservation |first=Salvatore Ciro |last=Nappo |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |website=BBC |quote=Giuseppe Fiorelli directed the Pompeii excavation from 1863 to 1875 }}</ref> During early excavations of the site, occasional voids in the ash layer had been found that contained human remains. It was Fiorelli who realised these were spaces left by the decomposed bodies and so devised the technique of injecting [[plaster]] into them to recreate the forms of Vesuvius's victims. This technique is still in use today, with a clear [[resin]] now used instead of plaster because it is more durable, and does not destroy the bones, allowing further analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pompeionline.net/edifici/regione-i/pompei-orto-dei-fuggiaschi|last=Gracco|first=Tiberio|title=Orto dei Fuggiaschi|website=Pompei Online|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFiorelli also introduced scientific documentation. He divided the city into the present nine areas (''regiones'') and blocks (''insulae'') and numbered the entrances of the individual houses (''domus''), so that each is identified by these three numbers. Fiorelli also published the first periodical with excavation reports. Under Fiorelli's successors the entire west of the city was exposed.\n\n===Modern archaeology===\n\nIn the 1920s [[Amedeo Maiuri]] excavated for the first time in older layers than that of 79 AD in order to learn about the settlement history. Maiuri made the last excavations on a grand scale in the 1950s, and the area south of the Via dell'Abbondanza and the city wall was almost completely uncovered, but they were poorly documented scientifically. Preservation was haphazard and presents today's archaeologists with great difficulty. Questionable reconstruction was done in the 1980s and 1990s after the severe earthquake of 1980, which caused great destruction. Since then, except for targeted soundings and excavations, work was confined to the excavated areas. Further excavations on a large scale are not planned and today archaeologists try to reconstruct, to document and, above all, to stop the ever faster decay.\n\nUnder the ''Great Pompeii Project'' over 2.5&nbsp;km of ancient walls are being relieved of danger of collapse by treating the unexcavated areas behind the street fronts in order to increase drainage and reduce the pressure of ground water and earth on the walls, a problem especially in the rainy season. As of August 2019, these excavations have resumed on unexcavated areas of ''Regio V''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pompeiisites.org/en/press-kit-en/discoveries-continue-at-the-regio-v-site/ |title=Discoveries Continue at the Regio V Site |website=Archaeological Park of Pompeii |access-date=August 20, 2019 |date=2018-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n=== Conservation ===\n{{Main|Conservation issues of Pompeii and Herculaneum}}\n\nObjects buried beneath Pompeii were well-preserved for almost 2,000 years as the lack of air and moisture allowed little to no deterioration. However, once exposed, Pompeii has been subject to both natural and man-made forces, which have rapidly increased deterioration.\n\nWeathering, erosion, light exposure, water damage, poor methods of excavation and reconstruction, introduced plants and animals, tourism, vandalism and theft have all damaged the site in some way. The lack of adequate weather protection of all but the most interesting and important buildings has allowed original interior decoration to fade or be lost. Two-thirds of the city has been excavated, but the remnants of the city are rapidly deteriorating.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/ashes-to-ashes-the-latter-day-ruin-of-pompeii |last=Popham |first=Peter |title=Ashes to ashes: the latter-day ruin of Pompeii |journal=Prospect Magazine |date=May 2010 |location=London |accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, during [[World War II]] many buildings were badly damaged or destroyed by bombs dropped in several raids by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/pompeii/destruction.html |title=The Last Days of Pompeii: Destruction in World War II |access-date=August 27, 2019 |website=The J.

It was a wealthy town, enjoying many fine public buildings and luxurious private houses with lavish decorations, furnishings and works of art which were the main attractions for the early excavators.

Graduate School of The University of Texas, p. 56</ref>\n\nThe [[Samnites]], people from the areas of [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]], and allies of the Romans, conquered Greek Cumae between 423 and 420 BC and it is likely that all the surrounding territory, including Pompeii, was already conquered around 424 BC. The new rulers gradually imposed their architecture and enlarged the town.\n\nFrom 343 BC, the first Roman army entered the Campanian plain bringing with it the customs and traditions of Rome and in the Roman [[Latin War]] the Samnites were faithful to Rome. Pompeii, although governed by the Samnites, entered the Roman orbit, to which it remained faithful even during the third Samnite war and in the war against [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]. In the late 4th c. BC the city began to expand from its nucleus and into the open walled area. The street plan of the new areas was more regular and more conformal to [[Hippodamus]]'s street plan. The city walls were reinforced in [[Sarno]] stone in the early 3rd century BC (the limestone ''enceinte'', or the \"first Samnite wall\"). It formed the basis for the currently visible walls with an outer wall of rectangular limestone blocks as a terrace wall supporting a large ''[[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]]'', or earth embankment, behind it.\n\nAfter the [[Samnite Wars]] from 290 BC, Pompeii was forced to accept the status of ''[[socii]]'' of Rome, maintaining, however, linguistic and administrative autonomy.\n\nFrom the outbreak of the [[Second Punic War]] (218\u2013201 BC) in which Pompeii remained faithful to Rome, an additional internal wall was built of [[tufa]] and the internal ''agger'' and outer fa\u00e7ade raised resulting in a double parapet with wider wall-walk.<ref name=\"Etienne-1992\"/> Despite the political uncertainty of these events and the progressive migration of wealthy men to quieter cities in the eastern Mediterranean, Pompeii continued to flourish due to the production and trade of wine and oil with places like [[Provence]] and Spain,<ref>Paul Zanker, ''Pompeii: society, urban images and forms of living'', Turin, Giulio Einaudi Editore, 1993. {{ISBN|88-06-13282-2}} p. 60</ref> as well as to intensive agriculture on farms around the city.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, Pompeii enriched itself by taking part in Rome's conquest of the east as shown by a statue of Apollo in the Forum erected by [[Lucius Mummius]] in gratitude for their support in the sack of [[Corinth]] and the eastern campaigns. These riches enabled Pompeii to bloom and expand to its ultimate limits. The [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] and many public and private buildings of high architectural quality were built, including the large theatre, the sanctuary to Jupiter, the Basilica, the Comitium, the Stabian Baths and a new two-story portico.<ref>ecolo a.C.\" In Sicilia ellenistica, consuetudo italica.

Many nearby buildings inside the walls were also destroyed.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W.

Many of Sulla's veterans were given land and property in and around the city, while many of those who opposed Rome were depossessed of their property. Despite this, the Pompeians were granted [[Roman citizenship]] and they were quickly assimilated into the Roman world. The main language in the city became Latin,<ref name=\"Pompeii\">{{cite book |last = Beard |first = Mary |title = Pompeii |publisher = Profile Books LTD|isbn = 978-1-86197-596-6|date = 2008}}</ref> and many of Pompeii's old aristocratic families Latinized their names as a sign of assimilation.<ref name=\"Pompeii-The Living City\">{{cite book|last = Butterworth|first = Alex|title = Pompeii \u2013 The Living City|publisher = St Martin's Press; 1st edition|isbn = 978-0-312-35585-2|date = 2005|url = https://archive.org/details/pompeiilivingcit00alex}}</ref> \n\nThe city became an important passage for goods that arrived by sea and had to be sent toward Rome or [[southern Italy]] along the nearby [[Appian Way]]. Many public buildings were built or refurbished and improved under the new order; new buildings included the amphitheatre in 70 BC,   the Forum Baths and the ''theatrum tectum'' while the forum was embellished with the colonnade of Popidius before 80 BC.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 172</ref> These buildings raised the status of Pompeii as a cultural centre in the region as it outshone its neighbours in the number of places for entertainment which significantly enhanced the social and economic development of the city.\n\nUnder [[Augustus]] from about 30 BC a major expansion in new public buildings, as in the rest of the empire, included the Eumachia building, the Sanctuary of Augustus and the [[Macellum]]. From about 20 BC, Pompeii was fed with running water by a spur from the Serino aqueduct or [[Aqua Augusta (Naples)]] built by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]].\n\nIn AD 59, there was a serious riot and bloodshed in the amphitheatre between Pompeians and [[Nuceria]]ns (which is recorded in a fresco) and which led the Roman senate to send the [[Praetorian Guard]] to restore order and to ban further events for a period of ten years.<ref>Tacitus: Ann. 14.17</ref><ref>See W.

Chaos followed the earthquake; fires caused by oil lamps that had fallen during the quake added to the panic. The nearby cities of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Nuceria]] were also affected.<ref name=\"archaeology1\"/>\n\nBetween 62 and the eruption in 79 most rebuilding was done in the private sector and older, damaged frescoes were often covered with newer ones, for example. In the public sector the opportunity was taken to improve buildings and the city plan e.g. in the forum.<ref>''The World of Pompeii'', Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 173</ref> \n\nAn important field of current research concerns structures that were restored between the earthquake of 62 and the eruption. It was thought until recently that some of the damage had still not been repaired at the time of the eruption but this has been shown to be doubtful as the evidence of missing forum statues and marble wall-veneers are most likely due to robbers after the city's burial.<ref>Dobbins, J.

The new baths took over a whole ''insula'' by demolishing houses, which may have been made easier by the earthquake that had damaged these houses. This shows that the city was still flourishing rather than struggling to recover from the earthquake.<ref>John J. Dobbins, Pedar W.

By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nA multidisciplinary [[Vulcanology|volcanological]] and [[Biological anthropology|bio-anthropological]] study<ref>{{Harvnb|Mastrolorenzo|Petrone|Pappalardo|Guarino|2010|p=e11127}}.</ref> of the eruption products and victims, merged with numerical simulations and experiments, indicates that at Pompeii and surrounding towns [[heat]] was the main cause of death of people, previously believed to have died by ash [[suffocation]]. The results of the study, published in 2010, show that exposure to at least {{convert|250|C|F|-1}} hot [[pyroclastic flows]] at a distance of {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the vent was sufficient to cause instant death, even if people were sheltered within buildings. The people and buildings of Pompeii were covered in up to 12 different layers of [[tephra]], in total up to {{convert|6|m|ft|1}} deep.\n\n[[Pliny the Younger]] provided a first-hand account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius from his position across the [[Bay of Naples]] at [[Misenum]] but written 25 years after the event. His uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]], with whom he had a close relationship, died while attempting to rescue stranded victims. As admiral of the fleet, Pliny the Elder had ordered the ships of the Imperial Navy stationed at Misenum to cross the bay to assist evacuation attempts. Volcanologists have recognised the importance of Pliny the Younger's account of the eruption by calling similar events \"[[Plinian eruption|Plinian]]\".  It had long been thought that the eruption was an August event based on one version of the letter but another version<ref name=\"Stefani 2006 10\u201314\">{{Harvnb|Stefani|2006|pp=10\u201314}}.</ref> gives a date of the eruption as late as 23 November.

Further eruptions particularly in 471-3 and 512 covered the remains more deeply.\n\nThe next known date that any part was unearthed was in 1592, when architect [[Domenico Fontana]] while digging an underground aqueduct ran into ancient walls covered with paintings and inscriptions. He unearthed a few frescoes, then covered them over again, and nothing more came of the discovery. \n\nA wall inscription had mentioned a ''decurio Pompeii'' ('the town councillor of Pompeii') but its reference to the long-forgotten Roman city was missed.\n\nHerculaneum itself was rediscovered in 1738 by workmen digging for the foundations of a [[summer palace]] for the [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]], [[Charles III of Spain|Charles of Bourbon]]. Due to the spectacular quality of the finds, the Spanish military engineer [[Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre]] made excavations to find further remains at the site of Pompeii in 1748, even if the city was not identified.<ref name=\"Ozgenel 2008 13\">{{Harvnb|Ozgenel|2008|p=13}}.</ref> Charles of Bourbon took great interest in the finds, even after leaving to become king of Spain, because the display of antiquities reinforced the political and cultural prestige of Naples.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ozgenel|2008|p=19}}</ref> On August 20, 1763, an inscription ''[...] Rei Publicae Pompeianorum [...]'' was found and the city was identified as Pompeii.<ref>Giuseppe Fiorelli: Pompeianarum Antiquitatum Historia.

The land on which Pompeii lies was expropriated and up to 700 workers were used in the excavations. The excavated areas in the north and south were connected. Parts of the Via dell'Abbondanza were also exposed in west\u2013east direction and for the first time an impression of the size and appearance of the ancient town could be appreciated. In the following years, the excavators struggled with lack of money and excavations progressed slowly, but with significant finds such as the houses of the [[House of the Faun|Faun]], of [[Meleager]], the [[House of the Tragic Poet|Tragic Poet]] and the [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri]].\n\n[[Giuseppe Fiorelli]] took charge of the excavations in 1863 and made greater progress.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/pompeii_rediscovery_01.shtml#two |title=Pompeii: Its Discovery and Preservation |first=Salvatore Ciro |last=Nappo |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |website=BBC |quote=Giuseppe Fiorelli directed the Pompeii excavation from 1863 to 1875 }}</ref> During early excavations of the site, occasional voids in the ash layer had been found that contained human remains. It was Fiorelli who realised these were spaces left by the decomposed bodies and so devised the technique of injecting [[plaster]] into them to recreate the forms of Vesuvius's victims. This technique is still in use today, with a clear [[resin]] now used instead of plaster because it is more durable, and does not destroy the bones, allowing further analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pompeionline.net/edifici/regione-i/pompei-orto-dei-fuggiaschi|last=Gracco|first=Tiberio|title=Orto dei Fuggiaschi|website=Pompei Online|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFiorelli also introduced scientific documentation. He divided the city into the present nine areas (''regiones'') and blocks (''insulae'') and numbered the entrances of the individual houses (''domus''), so that each is identified by these three numbers. Fiorelli also published the first periodical with excavation reports. Under Fiorelli's successors the entire west of the city was exposed.\n\n===Modern archaeology===\n\nIn the 1920s [[Amedeo Maiuri]] excavated for the first time in older layers than that of 79 AD in order to learn about the settlement history. Maiuri made the last excavations on a grand scale in the 1950s, and the area south of the Via dell'Abbondanza and the city wall was almost completely uncovered, but they were poorly documented scientifically. Preservation was haphazard and presents today's archaeologists with great difficulty. Questionable reconstruction was done in the 1980s and 1990s after the severe earthquake of 1980, which caused great destruction. Since then, except for targeted soundings and excavations, work was confined to the excavated areas. Further excavations on a large scale are not planned and today archaeologists try to reconstruct, to document and, above all, to stop the ever faster decay.\n\nUnder the ''Great Pompeii Project'' over 2.5&nbsp;km of ancient walls are being relieved of danger of collapse by treating the unexcavated areas behind the street fronts in order to increase drainage and reduce the pressure of ground water and earth on the walls, a problem especially in the rainy season. As of August 2019, these excavations have resumed on unexcavated areas of ''Regio V''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pompeiisites.org/en/press-kit-en/discoveries-continue-at-the-regio-v-site/ |title=Discoveries Continue at the Regio V Site |website=Archaeological Park of Pompeii |access-date=August 20, 2019 |date=2018-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n=== Conservation ===\n{{Main|Conservation issues of Pompeii and Herculaneum}}\n\nObjects buried beneath Pompeii were well-preserved for almost 2,000 years as the lack of air and moisture allowed little to no deterioration. However, once exposed, Pompeii has been subject to both natural and man-made forces, which have rapidly increased deterioration.\n\nWeathering, erosion, light exposure, water damage, poor methods of excavation and reconstruction, introduced plants and animals, tourism, vandalism and theft have all damaged the site in some way. The lack of adequate weather protection of all but the most interesting and important buildings has allowed original interior decoration to fade or be lost. Two-thirds of the city has been excavated, but the remnants of the city are rapidly deteriorating.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/ashes-to-ashes-the-latter-day-ruin-of-pompeii |last=Popham |first=Peter |title=Ashes to ashes: the latter-day ruin of Pompeii |journal=Prospect Magazine |date=May 2010 |location=London |accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, during [[World War II]] many buildings were badly damaged or destroyed by bombs dropped in several raids by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/pompeii/destruction.html |title=The Last Days of Pompeii: Destruction in World War II |access-date=August 27, 2019 |website=The J.

Agricultural policymaker [[Columella]] suggested that each vineyard in Rome produced a quota of three [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|cullei]] of wine per [[jugerum]], otherwise the vineyard would be uprooted. The nutrient-rich lands near Pompeii were extremely efficient at this and were often able to exceed these requirements by a steep margin, therefore providing the incentive for local wineries to establish themselves.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Pompeii\"/> While wine was exported for Pompeii's economy, the majority of the other agricultural goods were likely produced in quantities sufficient for the city's consumption.\n\nRemains of large formations of constructed wineries were found in the ''[[Forum Boarium]]'', covered by cemented casts from the eruption of Vesuvius.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Pompeii\"/> It is speculated that these historical vineyards are strikingly similar in structure to the modern day vineyards across Italy.\n\nCarbonised food plant remains, roots, seeds and pollens, have been found from gardens in Pompeii, Herculaneum and from the Roman villa at [[Torre Annunziata]].

The company had the capability to produce about four hundred barrels of salt per day when they first started producing salt in 1885.{{sfn|Bersey|1890|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=p5kcAQAAMAAJ&dq=%22Pere+Marquette+Lumber+Company%22+%22Delos+L.+Filer.%22&q=%22ranks+among+the+largest+salt+%22#v=onepage&q&f 104]}} They annually produced about 90,000 [[Barrel (unit)|barrel]]s of salt by 1898.{{sfn|Hotchkiss|1898|page=249}} The grades of salt they produced were No. 1 fine grade, and packers' salt. The Pere Marquette Lumber Company in the city of Ludington ranked among the largest salt and lumber producers in the state of Michigan by 1890.

It is Carlton's first album on The Inc. Records, after Irv Gotti signed her to a record deal there in late 2006, and Gotti has said that ''Heroes & Thieves'' is the first album on which he is acting as \"co-pilot\" rather than \"dictator\".<ref name=\"MTVNews-Rodriguez\"/>\n\nThe album itself was a commercial failure, becoming her first not to enter the Top 40 of the ''Billboard'' 200, selling just over 18,000 copies in its first week of release. As of 2011, the album has sold approximately 75,000 copies in the United States. Due to its commercial failure, the album only spawned two singles. The first, [[Nolita Fairytale]], was a minor success for Carlton, having some radio success in the United States. The follow-up single, \"[[Hands on Me (Vanessa Carlton song)|Hands On Me]]\", was more successful, reaching the Top 40 in Australia, as well as becoming her first song in five years to chart in New Zealand. Although it was a commercial failure in the US, it did receive minimal airplay on mainstream radio.\n\nDespite minimal chart success, the album was a critical success, becoming Carlton's highest rated album on [[Metacritic]], with a 79% approval rate. [[Allmusic]] awarded the album three and a half stars, while [[PopMatters]] rated the album an eight out of a possible ten. ''[[USA Today]]'' also praised the album, awarding it three out of four stars. ''Slant Magazine'' awarded the album three out of five stars, and the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' rated the album at a \"B\".\n\n==Background==\nIn January 2005, two months after the release of ''Harmonium'', Carlton co-wrote three songs with production team [[The Matrix (music producer)|The Matrix]]: \"It's Now\", \"Summer Child\" (alternatively titled \"Tuesday\") and \"Underneath\".<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/bands/p/projects_time_forgot/news_feature_013105/ \"The Projects That Time Forgot\"].

It\u2019s already spawned its share of detractors, specifically reviewers who question whether Carlton has the vocal goods to pull off some of the more complicated numbers. I think her imperfect singing keeps her sounding human and give her props for not messing with a pitch correction program. And if you feel the same, well, maybe you too should start thinking you might have a problem with \u2018Nessa addiction. See you at the next \u2018Nessaholics meeting.\"<ref name=\"popmattersreview\" />\n\nNeil Drumming of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the album as well, stating \"With a youthful voice and a predilection for flowery lyrics, the 27-year-old still comes off as an angst-afflicted teenager adapting her diary into song \u2014 even though she's now rhapsodizing about adult stuff like rent-controlled apartments (''Nolita Fairytale'') and temp work (''Hands on Me''). This can be surprisingly touching and personal, as on the exuberant title track, or simply pretentious, as on ''Come Undone,'' where she muses, ''I'm a sycophantic courtier with an elegant repost.'' However precious her poetry can be, Carlton always pins it to melodies that morph and expand evocatively. ''Heroes'' climaxes grandly in the soaring ballad ''Home,'' followed by the choral volcano that is ''More Than This''. As sappy as this combination is, the orchestral one-two punch is also inescapably moving. And it's the kind of thing Carlton does best \u2014 no matter what label she's on.\" The reviewer later awarded the album a \"B\" rating.<ref name=\"ewreview\" />\n\n''[[Slant Magazine]]'''s Sal Cinquemani gave the album a mixed review in their review, saying \"Carlton's voice continues to mature (there's a gritty quality to her vocals on songs like \"Fools Like Me,\" and the earthiness of guest Stevie Nicks's alto harmonies on the country-leaning \"The One\" tempers Carlton's more reedy lead vocal), but the material in general isn't exactly what you'd expect from an artist who left the nest in search of creative freedom and appreciation, making ''Heroes & Thieves'' somewhat less rewarding than her last album.\"<ref name=\"slantreview\" />\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Heroes & Thieves'' debuted at No. 44 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200, selling 18,200 copies in its first week of release.<ref>Tebben, Susan.

Records, after Irv Gotti signed her to a record deal there in late 2006, and Gotti has said that ''Heroes & Thieves'' is the first album on which he is acting as \"co-pilot\" rather than \"dictator\".<ref name=\"MTVNews-Rodriguez\"/>\n\nThe album itself was a commercial failure, becoming her first not to enter the Top 40 of the ''Billboard'' 200, selling just over 18,000 copies in its first week of release. As of 2011, the album has sold approximately 75,000 copies in the United States. Due to its commercial failure, the album only spawned two singles. The first, [[Nolita Fairytale]], was a minor success for Carlton, having some radio success in the United States. The follow-up single, \"[[Hands on Me (Vanessa Carlton song)|Hands On Me]]\", was more successful, reaching the Top 40 in Australia, as well as becoming her first song in five years to chart in New Zealand. Although it was a commercial failure in the US, it did receive minimal airplay on mainstream radio.\n\nDespite minimal chart success, the album was a critical success, becoming Carlton's highest rated album on [[Metacritic]], with a 79% approval rate. [[Allmusic]] awarded the album three and a half stars, while [[PopMatters]] rated the album an eight out of a possible ten. ''[[USA Today]]'' also praised the album, awarding it three out of four stars. ''Slant Magazine'' awarded the album three out of five stars, and the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' rated the album at a \"B\".\n\n==Background==\nIn January 2005, two months after the release of ''Harmonium'', Carlton co-wrote three songs with production team [[The Matrix (music producer)|The Matrix]]: \"It's Now\", \"Summer Child\" (alternatively titled \"Tuesday\") and \"Underneath\".<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/bands/p/projects_time_forgot/news_feature_013105/ \"The Projects That Time Forgot\"].

This can be surprisingly touching and personal, as on the exuberant title track, or simply pretentious, as on ''Come Undone,'' where she muses, ''I'm a sycophantic courtier with an elegant repost.'' However precious her poetry can be, Carlton always pins it to melodies that morph and expand evocatively. ''Heroes'' climaxes grandly in the soaring ballad ''Home,'' followed by the choral volcano that is ''More Than This''. As sappy as this combination is, the orchestral one-two punch is also inescapably moving. And it's the kind of thing Carlton does best \u2014 no matter what label she's on.\" The reviewer later awarded the album a \"B\" rating.<ref name=\"ewreview\" />\n\n''[[Slant Magazine]]'''s Sal Cinquemani gave the album a mixed review in their review, saying \"Carlton's voice continues to mature (there's a gritty quality to her vocals on songs like \"Fools Like Me,\" and the earthiness of guest Stevie Nicks's alto harmonies on the country-leaning \"The One\" tempers Carlton's more reedy lead vocal), but the material in general isn't exactly what you'd expect from an artist who left the nest in search of creative freedom and appreciation, making ''Heroes & Thieves'' somewhat less rewarding than her last album.\"<ref name=\"slantreview\" />\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Heroes & Thieves'' debuted at No. 44 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200, selling 18,200 copies in its first week of release.<ref>Tebben, Susan.
