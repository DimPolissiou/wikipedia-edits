He was created a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1921.<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>\n\nIn 1929 he was elected to the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]] as [[Ulster Unionist Party]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for the [[Lisnaskea (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Lisnaskea]] division of [[County Fermanagh]]. In the words of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', \"his thin, wiry frame, with the inevitable cigarette in hand, and clipped, [[anglicised]] accent were to be a feature of [[Stormont Estate|Stormont]] for the next forty years.\"\n\n===Cabinet minister===\nBrooke became [[Minister of Agriculture for Northern Ireland|Minister of Agriculture]] in 1933.

Although a peer, he retained his seat in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland|House of Commons]] at [[Stormont Estate|Stormont]] and remained PM for another decade.\n\nAs the [[Northern Ireland economy]] began to de-industrialise in the mid-1950s, leading to high unemployment amongst the Protestant working classes, Brookeborough faced increasing disenchantment amongst UUP [[backbenchers]] for what was regarded as his indifferent and ineffectual approach to mounting economic problems. As this disenchantment grew, British civil servants and some members of the UUP combined to exert discreet and ultimately effective pressure on Brookeborough to resign to make way for [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[Terence O'Neill]], who was [[Minister of Finance (Northern Ireland)|Minister of Finance]].<ref>MacDonald, Michael, ''Children of Wrath'', Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 1986, p. 71</ref>\n\nIn 1963, his health having worsened, he resigned (at the age of 75) as Prime Minister. But he remained a member of the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]] until the [[1969 Northern Ireland general election|1969 general election]], becoming the [[Father of the House]] in 1965. During his last years in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] he publicly opposed the liberal policies of his successor Terence O'Neill, who actively sought to improve relationships with the [[Republic of Ireland]], and who attempted to address some of the grievances of [[Irish Catholics|Catholics]] and grant many of the demands of the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA).\n\nBrookeborough was noted for his casual style towards his ministerial duties. Terence O'Neill later wrote of him: \"he was good company and a good raconteur, and those who met him imagined that he was relaxing away from his desk. However they did not realise that there was no desk.\"<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>\n\nWhile Graham Walker wrote \"...Brookeborough's achievements over twenty years were substantial: the Unionist Party maintained essential unity, the anti-partitionist project was thwarted, and a potentially difficult post-war relationship with Britain under Labour was managed to the long-term benefit of Northern Ireland's full participation in the welfare state and new educational opportunities...\",<ref>Graham Walker, p.149</ref> increased educational opportunities for Catholics increased their self-confidence and expectations, which added momentum to the 1960s civil rights movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m69v-9b24B8C&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=northern+ireland+welfare+state+education+catholics&source=bl&ots=k_rs5YcYKB&sig=dgomon4ZSzTK8HZP5RRTsb8Gz2g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwi-gLTmrpzIAhUHThQKHdykAzA#v=onepage&q=northern+ireland+welfare+state+education+catholics&f=false|title=The British State and the Northern Ireland Crisis, 1969-73: From Violence to Power-sharing|first=William Beattie|last=Smith|date=4 July 2018|publisher=US Institute of Peace Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Later life and death==\nIn his retirement Brookeborough developed commercial interests; as chairman of Carreras (Northern Ireland), a director of Devenish Trade, and president of the Northern Ireland [[Institute of Directors]].

He opposed the [[Westminster]] [[white paper]] on the future of Northern Ireland and caused some embarrassment to his son, Captain [[John Brooke, 2nd Viscount Brookeborough|John Brooke]], the UUP Chief Whip and an ally of [[Brian Faulkner]], by speaking against the [[Faulkner ministry]]'s proposals.<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>\n\nLord Brookeborough died at his home, Colebrooke Park, on the Colebrooke Estate, on 18 August 1973.

In its obituary, ''[[The Times]]'' indirectly blamed him for the continuing Troubles: ''\u201cBrookeborough was a man of courage, conviction and great charm.  But his political sense was seriously found wanting by the intransigence with which he excluded the Roman Catholic minority from responsibility and participation.\u201d'' The obituary continued remarking that Brookeborough was ''\u201c[a] staunch representative of the [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocracy and an unyielding believer in the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]...The sectarian strife now tearing at the fabric of Northern Ireland's society is in part attributable to the immobility imposed in his long period of political leadership.\u201d''<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>\n\nBrookeborough's estate<ref>probate, 5 December 1975, CGPLA NIre. \u2022 \u00a342,793 in [[England and Wales]]: probate, 7 November 1973, CGPLA Eng. & Wales</ref> was valued at [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]406,591.83.<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>\n<ref>[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]</ref> His only surviving son, [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[The Right Honourable]] John W.

He founded his own paramilitary group, Brooke's [[Fermanagh Vigilance]], from men returning from the war front in 1918.  Although the umbrella [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF) had been quiescent during the war, it was not defunct. It re-emerged strongly in 1920, subsuming groups like Brooke's.<ref>Townshend, \"Easter 1916\" p.181.</ref>\n\nIn 1920, having reached the [[Ranks in the British Army|rank]] of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]], Brooke left the [[British Army]] to farm the Colebrooke Estate, his family's [[country estate]] at [[Brookeborough]] in west [[Ulster]], at which point he turned towards a career in politics.<ref>Timothy Bowman, 'The Ulster Volunteer Force, 1910\u20131920: New Perspectives', in Boyce and O'Day (eds.), Ulster Crisis, pp.256\u20138.</ref>\n\n==Political career==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2008}}\n\nBrooke had a very long political career. When he resigned the [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Premiership of Northern Ireland]] in March 1963, he was [[Northern Ireland]]'s longest-serving prime minister, having held office for two months short of 20 years.<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/> He had also established a United Kingdom record by holding government office continuously for 33 years.<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>\n\nIn 1921 [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Brooke was elected to the [[Senate of Northern Ireland]], but he resigned the following year to become Commandant of the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] (USC) in their fight against the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA). He was created a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1921.<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>\n\nIn 1929 he was elected to the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]] as [[Ulster Unionist Party]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for the [[Lisnaskea (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Lisnaskea]] division of [[County Fermanagh]]. In the words of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', \"his thin, wiry frame, with the inevitable cigarette in hand, and clipped, [[anglicised]] accent were to be a feature of [[Stormont Estate|Stormont]] for the next forty years.\"\n\n===Cabinet minister===\nBrooke became [[Minister of Agriculture for Northern Ireland|Minister of Agriculture]] in 1933. By virtue of this appointment, he also acquired the rank of [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Councillor of Northern Ireland]].<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/> He was thus known, from 1933 until his elevation to the [[British peerage|peerage]] in 1952, as [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[The Right Honourable]] Sir Basil Brooke, 5th [[Baronet]], [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]], [[Military Cross]], [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland]], [[Member of Parliament]]. From 1941 to 1943 he was [[Minister of Commerce for Northern Ireland|Minister of Commerce]].\n\nCapt. Brooke addressed an [[Orange Institution]] rally at [[Newtownbutler]] on 12 July 1933, where he said:\n{{quote|Many in this audience employ Catholics, but I have not one about my place.

Although a peer, he retained his seat in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland|House of Commons]] at [[Stormont Estate|Stormont]] and remained PM for another decade.\n\nAs the [[Northern Ireland economy]] began to de-industrialise in the mid-1950s, leading to high unemployment amongst the Protestant working classes, Brookeborough faced increasing disenchantment amongst UUP [[backbenchers]] for what was regarded as his indifferent and ineffectual approach to mounting economic problems. As this disenchantment grew, British civil servants and some members of the UUP combined to exert discreet and ultimately effective pressure on Brookeborough to resign to make way for [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[Terence O'Neill]], who was [[Minister of Finance (Northern Ireland)|Minister of Finance]].<ref>MacDonald, Michael, ''Children of Wrath'', Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 1986, p. 71</ref>\n\nIn 1963, his health having worsened, he resigned (at the age of 75) as Prime Minister. But he remained a member of the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]] until the [[1969 Northern Ireland general election|1969 general election]], becoming the [[Father of the House]] in 1965. During his last years in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] he publicly opposed the liberal policies of his successor Terence O'Neill, who actively sought to improve relationships with the [[Republic of Ireland]], and who attempted to address some of the grievances of [[Irish Catholics|Catholics]] and grant many of the demands of the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA).\n\nBrookeborough was noted for his casual style towards his ministerial duties. Terence O'Neill later wrote of him: \"he was good company and a good raconteur, and those who met him imagined that he was relaxing away from his desk. However they did not realise that there was no desk.\"<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>\n\nWhile Graham Walker wrote \"...Brookeborough's achievements over twenty years were substantial: the Unionist Party maintained essential unity, the anti-partitionist project was thwarted, and a potentially difficult post-war relationship with Britain under Labour was managed to the long-term benefit of Northern Ireland's full participation in the welfare state and new educational opportunities...\",<ref>Graham Walker, p.149</ref> increased educational opportunities for Catholics increased their self-confidence and expectations, which added momentum to the 1960s civil rights movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m69v-9b24B8C&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=northern+ireland+welfare+state+education+catholics&source=bl&ots=k_rs5YcYKB&sig=dgomon4ZSzTK8HZP5RRTsb8Gz2g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwi-gLTmrpzIAhUHThQKHdykAzA#v=onepage&q=northern+ireland+welfare+state+education+catholics&f=false|title=The British State and the Northern Ireland Crisis, 1969-73: From Violence to Power-sharing|first=William Beattie|last=Smith|date=4 July 2018|publisher=US Institute of Peace Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Later life and death==\nIn his retirement Brookeborough developed commercial interests; as chairman of Carreras (Northern Ireland), a director of Devenish Trade, and president of the Northern Ireland [[Institute of Directors]]. He was also made an honorary LLD of [[Queen's University of Belfast|The Queen's University of Belfast]].\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, years in which the Stormont institution came under its greatest strain and eventually crumbled, Brookeborough made only occasional forays into political life.<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>  In 1972 he appeared next to [[William Craig (Northern Ireland politician)|Bill Craig]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] on the balcony of [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]] at [[Stormont Estate|Stormont]], a diminutive figure beside the leader of the [[Ulster Vanguard]] who was rallying right-wing Unionists against the Government of Northern Ireland. He opposed the [[Westminster]] [[white paper]] on the future of Northern Ireland and caused some embarrassment to his son, Captain [[John Brooke, 2nd Viscount Brookeborough|John Brooke]], the UUP Chief Whip and an ally of [[Brian Faulkner]], by speaking against the [[Faulkner ministry]]'s proposals.<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>\n\nLord Brookeborough died at his home, Colebrooke Park, on the Colebrooke Estate, on 18 August 1973.  His remains were cremated at [[Roselawn Cemetery]], East Belfast, three days later, and, in accordance with his wishes, his ashes were scattered on the [[demesne]] surrounding his beloved Colebrooke Park.  In its obituary, ''[[The Times]]'' indirectly blamed him for the continuing Troubles: ''\u201cBrookeborough was a man of courage, conviction and great charm.  But his political sense was seriously found wanting by the intransigence with which he excluded the Roman Catholic minority from responsibility and participation.\u201d'' The obituary continued remarking that Brookeborough was ''\u201c[a] staunch representative of the [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocracy and an unyielding believer in the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]...The sectarian strife now tearing at the fabric of Northern Ireland's society is in part attributable to the immobility imposed in his long period of political leadership.\u201d''<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>\n\nBrookeborough\u2019s estate<ref>probate, 5 December 1975, CGPLA NIre. \u2022 \u00a342,793 in [[England and Wales]]: probate, 7 November 1973, CGPLA Eng. & Wales</ref> was valued at [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]406,591.83.<ref name=\"The Times, 20 August 1973\"/>\n<ref>[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]</ref> His only surviving son, [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[The Right Honourable]] John W.

They were married on 3 June 1919 at [[St George's, Hanover Square]]. Their families were already close owing to Surgison's sister's being married to Brookeborough's cousin.<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/>  Following their marriage the Brookes went to live at Colebrooke Park.

He served as [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] between 1913 and 1918.\n\n==Early life==\nO'Brien was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], the son of Mark Joseph O'Brien and Jane, daughter of William Dunne.<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\">[http://thepeerage.com/p24201.htm thepeerage.com Ignatius John O'Brien, 1st and last Baron Shandon]</ref> He was educated at the [[Vincentian Family|Vincentian]] School there and, at the age of 16, entered the [[Catholic University of Ireland]] in Dublin but left after two years due to family circumstances. He worked as a junior reporter for the ''Saunders Newsletter'', a Dublin Conservative daily newspaper and then for ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'' while studying part-time for the Bar. Called to the [[barrister|Irish Bar]], [[King's Inn]], in 1881, O'Brien was slow to build a practice and continued to support himself through freelance journalism, within three years he had established a small practice on the [[Munster]] circuit.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Keller Case==\nIn 1887 O'Brien became involved in the case of [[Canon Keller]] which was to establish his legal career and reputation. Keller, who was the parish priest of [[Youghal]], was called to give evidence in the Bankruptcy Court regarding the financial circumstances of some of his Parishioners involved in the \"[[Plan of Campaign]]\" rent strikes. Keller refused to answer questions of the grounds that he had obtained this information in his capacity as a [[confessor]], and that breaching the seal of the confessional contravened [[Catholic]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]. As a result, Keller was imprisoned for [[contempt of court]]. O'Brien argued in support of a writ of [[habeas corpus]]. Although unsuccessful in the [[Court of Queen's Bench (Ireland)|Court of Queen's Bench]], his argument prevailed in the [[Irish Court of Appeal]]<ref>''In re Keller'' (1887) 22 L.R.Ir. 158</ref>\n\n==Later legal and political career==\nPropelled by the reputation he won in the Keller case, O'Brien gave up [[Circuit Court (Ireland)|circuit court]] work and concentrated on [[Court of equity|Chancery]] and Bankruptcy matters and became a leading authority on bankruptcy law. He was called to the Inner Bar as an Irish [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1899, became a bencher of [[King's Inns]] in 1907 and was appointed [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Serjeant at Law]] (then the highest rank for an Irish barrister) in 1910. A supporter of [[Irish Home Rule|Home Rule]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], O'Brien campaigned on behalf of Liberal candidates but did not stand for parliament himself. In 1911 he was appointed [[Solicitor General for Ireland]] in [[H. H. Asquith]]'s Liberal administration and advanced to [[Attorney General for Ireland|Attorney General]] in 1912, becoming a member of the [[Irish Privy Council]] in the same year. In 1913 the office of [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] fell vacant and O'Brien, as Attorney General, was by a longstanding tradition entitled to claim the position. As a judge he was not highly regarded; his pompous manner in Court  led to unkind comparison with a [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]]; more seriously there were frequent complaints that his constant interruptions from the Bench  made it almost impossible for counsel to present their cases properly.\n\n==Lord Chancellor==\nO'Brien's tenure as Lord Chancellor was only secure as long as the Liberal Party remained in government at Westminster. In 1915 the Asquith Government was forced to resign and enter into a wartime coalition with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. British Conservatives sought to replace O'Brien with his [[Irish Unionist|Unionist]] rival [[James Campbell, 1st Baron Glenavy|James Campbell]]. Out of consideration for [[Irish Nationalist]] opinion, O'Brien remained in office and was created a '''Baronet''', of Ardtona in the Parish of Dundrum in the County of Dublin, in 1916.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=29483 |date=22 February 1916 |page=1946 }}</ref> By 1918 however, Conservative and Unionist opinion was ascendant and O'Brien was replaced as Lord Chancellor by Campbell. He received a [[peerage]] as a consolation and became '''Baron Shandon''', of the City of Cork.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30793 |date=12 July 1918 |page=8199 }}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nA constitutional nationalist who supported home rule without breaking the imperial link with Great Britain, O'Brien was opposed to the aims and methods of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. After an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] raid on his home, he left Ireland for good, settling in the [[Isle of Wight]]. Although sceptical of the [[House of Lords]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, O'Brien found the peers agreeable and became reconciled with its largely hereditary nature. His participation in the House of Lords was usually limited to matters effecting Ireland or issues on which he had legal expertise. He took an active part in the debates and negotiations surrounding the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]].\n\nBaron Shandon had no issue but wished to pass on his titles to his nephew but, in order to achieve this, he would need a Letter of Remainder, which could be acquired by an application to the Crown Office at the House of Parliament, Westminster. On reflection, in 1929, he realised that this was not an option open to him as Ireland was no longer under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and that both the Baronetcy and Barony were outside that jurisdiction. Added to this fact, the 1922 Act, section 5, precluded them from granting such a Letter of Remainder. \n\nThe Baron believed that he could pass his titles by Way of Remainder and this he so did through his Last Will and Testament.

He served as [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] between 1913 and 1918.\n\n==Early life==\nO'Brien was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], the son of Mark Joseph O'Brien and Jane, daughter of William Dunne.<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\">[http://thepeerage.com/p24201.htm thepeerage.com Ignatius John O'Brien, 1st and last Baron Shandon]</ref> He was educated at the [[Vincentian Family|Vincentian]] School there and, at the age of 16, entered the [[Catholic University of Ireland]] in Dublin but left after two years due to family circumstances. He worked as a junior reporter for the ''Saunders Newsletter'', a Dublin Conservative daily newspaper and then for ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'' while studying part-time for the Bar. Called to the [[barrister|Irish Bar]], [[King's Inn]], in 1881, O'Brien was slow to build a practice and continued to support himself through freelance journalism, within three years he had established a small practice on the [[Munster]] circuit.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Keller Case==\nIn 1887 O'Brien became involved in the case of [[Canon Keller]] which was to establish his legal career and reputation. Keller, who was the parish priest of [[Youghal]], was called to give evidence in the Bankruptcy Court regarding the financial circumstances of some of his Parishioners involved in the \"[[Plan of Campaign]]\" rent strikes. Keller refused to answer questions of the grounds that he had obtained this information in his capacity as a [[confessor]], and that breaching the seal of the confessional contravened [[Catholic]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]. As a result, Keller was imprisoned for [[contempt of court]]. O'Brien argued in support of a writ of [[habeas corpus]]. Although unsuccessful in the [[Court of Queen's Bench (Ireland)|Court of Queen's Bench]], his argument prevailed in the [[Irish Court of Appeal]]<ref>''In re Keller'' (1887) 22 L.R.Ir. 158</ref>\n\n==Later legal and political career==\nPropelled by the reputation he won in the Keller case, O'Brien gave up [[Circuit Court (Ireland)|circuit court]] work and concentrated on [[Court of equity|Chancery]] and Bankruptcy matters and became a leading authority on bankruptcy law. He was called to the Inner Bar as an Irish [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1899, became a bencher of [[King's Inns]] in 1907 and was appointed [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Serjeant at Law]] (then the highest rank for an Irish barrister) in 1910. A supporter of [[Irish Home Rule|Home Rule]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], O'Brien campaigned on behalf of Liberal candidates but did not stand for parliament himself. In 1911 he was appointed [[Solicitor General for Ireland]] in [[H. H. Asquith]]'s Liberal administration and advanced to [[Attorney General for Ireland|Attorney General]] in 1912, becoming a member of the [[Irish Privy Council]] in the same year. In 1913 the office of [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] fell vacant and O'Brien, as Attorney General, was by a longstanding tradition entitled to claim the position. As a judge he was not highly regarded; his pompous manner in Court  led to unkind comparison with a [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]]; more seriously there were frequent complaints that his constant interruptions from the Bench  made it almost impossible for counsel to present their cases properly.\n\n==Lord Chancellor==\nO'Brien's tenure as Lord Chancellor was only secure as long as the Liberal Party remained in government at Westminster. In 1915 the Asquith Government was forced to resign and enter into a wartime coalition with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. British Conservatives sought to replace O'Brien with his [[Irish Unionist|Unionist]] rival [[James Campbell, 1st Baron Glenavy|James Campbell]]. Out of consideration for [[Irish Nationalist]] opinion, O'Brien remained in office and was created a '''Baronet''', of Ardtona in the Parish of Dundrum in the County of Dublin, in 1916.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=29483 |date=22 February 1916 |page=1946 }}</ref> By 1918 however, Conservative and Unionist opinion was ascendant and O'Brien was replaced as Lord Chancellor by Campbell. He received a [[peerage]] as a consolation and became '''Baron Shandon''', of the City of Cork.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30793 |date=12 July 1918 |page=8199 }}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nA constitutional nationalist who supported home rule without breaking the imperial link with Great Britain, O'Brien was opposed to the aims and methods of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. After an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] raid on his home, he left Ireland for good, settling in the [[Isle of Wight]]. Although sceptical of the [[House of Lords]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, O'Brien found the peers agreeable and became reconciled with its largely hereditary nature. His participation in the House of Lords was usually limited to matters effecting Ireland or issues on which he had legal expertise. He took an active part in the debates and negotiations surrounding the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]].\n\nBaron Shandon had no issue but wished to pass on his titles to his nephew but, in order to achieve this, he would need a Letter of Remainder, which could be acquired by an application to the Crown Office at the House of Parliament, Westminster. On reflection, in 1929, he realised that this was not an option open to him as Ireland was no longer under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and that both the Baronetcy and Barony were outside that jurisdiction. Added to this fact, the 1922 Act, section 5, precluded them from granting such a Letter of Remainder. \n\nThe Baron believed that he could pass his titles by Way of Remainder and this he so did through his Last Will and Testament. The Letters Patent to both Baronetcy and Barony, along with his Lord Chancellor\u2019s Purse, the silver casket containing the Freedom of the City of Cork, various other historical letters patent and other artefacts were passed to his nephew, Gerald Horan KC, first Master of the Rolls and then Master of the High Court in Ireland.

They typically included gun emplacements, pill boxes, fire control or [[observation post]]s, [[camouflage]] strategies, underground [[bunker]]s, sometimes with interconnected tunnels, containing [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]], supply and plotting rooms and protected engine rooms supplying power to the [[gun turret]]s and [[searchlight]]s.

It had developed no coastal defences of any consequence and was becoming increasingly sensitive to how vulnerable its harbours were to attack by a hostile power or opportunistic [[Commerce raiding|raider]]. In the aftermath of the [[Crimean war]], Tsarist [[Russia]] seemed particularly suspicious.\t\n\n<blockquote>\n(In 1873 an [[Auckland]] editor perpetrated) ...what has been hailed the greatest spoof in the country's history. The Monday, 18 February 1873 edition of the ''Southern Cross'' reported the sudden declaration of war between England and [[Russia]]. As a result, the Russian warship ''Kaskowiski'' \u2013 whose very name should have made sober readers suspicious \u2013 had allegedly entered Auckland Harbour on the previous Saturday night and proceeded to capture a British ship, along with the city's arms and ammunition supply, and hold a number of leading citizens for ransom. The 954-man Russian vessel obviously meant business, with a dozen 30-ton guns as well as a remarkably new advance in warfare, a paralysing and deadly \"water-gas\" that could be injected into enemy ships from a great distance.<ref name=Wolfe>Wolfe, Richard (2007) ''With Honour \u2013 Our Army Our Nation Our History.'' Page 51. {{ISBN|978-0-670-04565-5}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe ''Southern Cross'' article created panic and the Government commissioned its first reports on the colony's defences. It was now clearly understood that Britain would protect its territories and vital shipping routes, but the defence of individual ports was the responsibility of each self-governing colony. Then Russia declared [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|war on Turkey]] in 1877 producing another \"scare\". The decision was taken to construct fortifications and [[Early naval vessels of New Zealand#Fears of Russian invasion|purchase naval boats]] which would protect the harbours at [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] and [[Port Chalmers]]. These [[coastal artillery]] fortifications or [[Land battery|land batteries]] were to be based on British designs. Heavy [[artillery]] pieces and ammunition was ordered from Britain. By 1885 work started in earnest on the construction of what eventually became seventeen forts, further encouraged by yet another [[Panjdeh Incident|Russian scare]].<ref name=Wolfe />\n\n===Artillery===\n[[File:North Head South Battery.jpg|right|thumb|[[BL 8 inch Mk I - VII naval gun|BL 8-inch]] Armstrong [[disappearing gun]] at [[North Head, New Zealand|North Head]].]]\nIn 1885 the New Zealand Government bought ten Armstrong [[BL 8 inch Mk I - VII naval gun|BL 8-inch]] and thirteen Armstrong [[BL 6 inch gun Mk V|BL 6-inch]] guns on disappearing carriages. The [[disappearing gun]] was the very latest in military technology in the 1880s. It was \"disappearing\" because as it fired, the recoil pushed the gun back underground where it could be reloaded under cover.

This was mainly a response to a perceived threat of invasion by the [[Japan]]ese after the attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. From 1942 until 1944, when the threat receded, 42 [[coastal artillery]] fortifications or [[Land battery|land batteries]] were either developed using historical fortifications or were built from scratch. The fortifications were built from [[United Kingdom|British]] designs adapted to New Zealand conditions.

This plan consisted of a 120-page intelligence document called ''Naval War Plan for the Attack of Auckland, New Zealand''. The intelligence for the report was gathered during the visit of the [[Great White Fleet]] to Auckland over six days in 1908. The plan advocated [[Manukau Harbour]] as the best invasion point and landing heavy guns on [[Rangitoto Island]] to shell the forts on the [[North Shore City|North Shore]]. The plan was not very realistic and may have been an exercise to keep young officers busy (see [[United States color-coded war plans|United States war plans]]; which allocated the colour Garnet to New Zealand as part of [[War Plan Red]]).<ref>Stevens, David and Reeve, John (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5LremxKXzkMC&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=%22naval+war+plan+for+the+attack+of+auckland%22&source=web&ots=ojirAVaYnA&sig=ghD3VDDCZFBrIDuuvb0uKWmBRSM#PPA187,M1 ''Southern Trident: Strategy, History and the Rise of Australian Naval Power'', Page 184\u2013188.] Allen & Unwin. {{ISBN|978-1-86508-462-6}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early naval vessels of New Zealand]]\n* [[Coastal defences of Australia during World War II]]\n* [[Coastal Forces of the Royal New Zealand Navy]]\n* [[Axis naval activity in New Zealand waters]]\n* [[British hardened field defences of World War II]]\n* [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II]]\n* [[Seacoast Defense (US)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Cooke, Peter (2002) [https://web.archive.org/web/20030615141423/http://capitaldefence.orcon.net.nz/review/dnzcoke.htm ''Defending New Zealand: Ramparts on the Sea 1840s\u20131950s.''] (Wellington).

They typically included gun emplacements, pill boxes, fire control or [[observation post]]s, [[camouflage]] strategies, underground [[bunker]]s, sometimes with interconnected tunnels, containing [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]], supply and plotting rooms and protected engine rooms supplying power to the [[gun turret]]s and [[searchlight]]s.

It had developed no coastal defences of any consequence and was becoming increasingly sensitive to how vulnerable its harbours were to attack by a hostile power or opportunistic [[Commerce raiding|raider]]. In the aftermath of the [[Crimean war]], Tsarist [[Russia]] seemed particularly suspicious.\t\n\n<blockquote>\n(In 1873 an [[Auckland]] editor perpetrated) ...what has been hailed the greatest spoof in the country's history. The Monday, 18 February 1873 edition of the ''Southern Cross'' reported the sudden declaration of war between England and [[Russia]]. As a result, the Russian warship ''Kaskowiski'' \u2013 whose very name should have made sober readers suspicious \u2013 had allegedly entered Auckland Harbour on the previous Saturday night and proceeded to capture a British ship, along with the city's arms and ammunition supply, and hold a number of leading citizens for ransom. The 954-man Russian vessel obviously meant business, with a dozen 30-ton guns as well as a remarkably new advance in warfare, a paralysing and deadly \"water-gas\" that could be injected into enemy ships from a great distance.<ref name=Wolfe>Wolfe, Richard (2007) ''With Honour \u2013 Our Army Our Nation Our History.'' Page 51. {{ISBN|978-0-670-04565-5}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe ''Southern Cross'' article created panic and the Government commissioned its first reports on the colony's defences. It was now clearly understood that Britain would protect its territories and vital shipping routes, but the defence of individual ports was the responsibility of each self-governing colony. Then Russia declared [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|war on Turkey]] in 1877 producing another \"scare\". The decision was taken to construct fortifications and [[Early naval vessels of New Zealand#Fears of Russian invasion|purchase naval boats]] which would protect the harbours at [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] and [[Port Chalmers]]. These [[coastal artillery]] fortifications or [[Land battery|land batteries]] were to be based on British designs. Heavy [[artillery]] pieces and ammunition was ordered from Britain. By 1885 work started in earnest on the construction of what eventually became seventeen forts, further encouraged by yet another [[Panjdeh Incident|Russian scare]].<ref name=Wolfe />\n\n===Artillery===\n[[File:North Head South Battery.jpg|right|thumb|[[BL 8 inch Mk I - VII naval gun|BL 8-inch]] Armstrong [[disappearing gun]] at [[North Head, New Zealand|North Head]].]]\nIn 1885 the New Zealand Government bought ten Armstrong [[BL 8 inch Mk I - VII naval gun|BL 8-inch]] and thirteen Armstrong [[BL 6 inch gun Mk V|BL 6-inch]] guns on disappearing carriages. The [[disappearing gun]] was the very latest in military technology in the 1880s. It was \"disappearing\" because as it fired, the recoil pushed the gun back underground where it could be reloaded under cover.

This was mainly a response to a perceived threat of invasion by the [[Japan]]ese after the attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. From 1942 until 1944, when the threat receded, 42 [[coastal artillery]] fortifications or [[Land battery|land batteries]] were either developed using historical fortifications or were built from scratch. The fortifications were built from [[United Kingdom|British]] designs adapted to New Zealand conditions.  [[Radar]] was installed which allowed long range shooting at night and replaced the traditional fortress system of [[Rangefinder|range finding]].<ref name=CoastArtill />\n\n===Ordnance===\n[[File:NZ-StonyBatter3.jpg|right|thumb|9.2 inch gun emplacement at [[Stony Batter]].]]\nThe fortifications were equipped with both old and new [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]], mostly British.

This plan consisted of a 120-page intelligence document called ''Naval War Plan for the Attack of Auckland, New Zealand''. The intelligence for the report was gathered during the visit of the [[Great White Fleet]] to Auckland over six days in 1908. The plan advocated [[Manukau Harbour]] as the best invasion point and landing heavy guns on [[Rangitoto Island]] to shell the forts on the [[North Shore City|North Shore]].

The [[industrialisation]] of Denmark had begun in the mid-19th century and a period of rapid [[urbanisation]] had led to an emerging class of [[Proletariat|urban workers]]. The social democratic movement emerged from the desire to give this group [[political rights]] and [[Representation (politics)|representation]] in the [[Folketing]], the Danish [[parliament]]. In 1876, the party held an annual conference, adopting the first party manifesto. The stated policy was as follows: {{quote|The Danish Social Democratic Labour Party works in its national form, but is convinced of the international nature of the labour movement and ready to sacrifice everything and fulfill all obligations to provide: Freedom, equality and brotherhood among all nations.}}\n\nIn 1884, the party had their first two members of parliament elected, namely [[Peter Thygesen Holm]] and [[Chresten H\u00f8rdum]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1906, the party created the Social Democratic Youth Association, lasting until 1920 when the [[Social Democratic Youth of Denmark]] and current party's [[youth wing]] was founded.\n\nIn the [[1924 Danish Folketing election|1924 elections]], the party won the majority with 36.6 percent of the vote and its first government was put in place with [[Thorvald Stauning]] as [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/86834:Danmark--Den-skjulte-forskel|title=Den skjulte forskel|work=Kristeligt Dagblad|date=5 February 2005|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718072428/http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/86834:Danmark--Den-skjulte-forskel|archivedate=18 July 2013}}</ref> That same year, he appointed [[Nina Bang]] as the world's first female minister, nine years after [[women's suffrage]] had been given in Denmark.

By the early 20th century, it had become the party with the largest representation in the Folketing, a distinction it would hold for 77 years. It first formed a government after the [[1924 Danish Folketing election|1924 elections]] under [[Thorvald Stauning]], the longest-serving [[List of Prime Ministers of Denmark|Danish Prime Minister]] of the 20th century. During Stauning's government which lasted until the [[1926 Danish Folketing election|1926 elections]], the Social Democrats exerted a profound influence on [[Danish society]], laying the foundation of the Danish [[welfare state]].

This name was formally carried by the party for almost a hundred years, although in practice it also used a number of other names until it changed its name to Social Democracy in 1965.

The [[industrialisation]] of Denmark had begun in the mid-19th century and a period of rapid [[urbanisation]] had led to an emerging class of [[Proletariat|urban workers]]. The social democratic movement emerged from the desire to give this group [[political rights]] and [[Representation (politics)|representation]] in the [[Folketing]], the Danish [[parliament]]. In 1876, the party held an annual conference, adopting the first party manifesto. The stated policy was as follows: {{quote|The Danish Social Democratic Labour Party works in its national form, but is convinced of the international nature of the labour movement and ready to sacrifice everything and fulfill all obligations to provide: Freedom, equality and brotherhood among all nations.}}\n\nIn 1884, the party had their first two members of parliament elected, namely [[Peter Thygesen Holm]] and [[Chresten H\u00f8rdum]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1906, the party created the Social Democratic Youth Association, lasting until 1920 when the [[Social Democratic Youth of Denmark]] and current party's [[youth wing]] was founded.\n\nIn the [[1924 Danish Folketing election|1924 elections]], the party won the majority with 36.6 percent of the vote and its first government was put in place with [[Thorvald Stauning]] as [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/86834:Danmark--Den-skjulte-forskel|title=Den skjulte forskel|work=Kristeligt Dagblad|date=5 February 2005|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718072428/http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/86834:Danmark--Den-skjulte-forskel|archivedate=18 July 2013}}</ref> That same year, he appointed [[Nina Bang]] as the world's first female minister, nine years after [[women's suffrage]] had been given in Denmark.

In 1917, during the [[First World War]], he wrote the \"[[Lansdowne Letter]]\" advocating, in vain, a compromise peace. He has the distinction of having held senior positions in [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] governments.\n\n==Early life and career, 1845\u20131882==\nThe great-grandson of the British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] (later 1st Marquess of Lansdowne), and the eldest son of [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 4th Marquess of Lansdowne]], and his wife, [[Emily Petty-Fitzmaurice, Marchioness of Lansdowne|Emily, 8th Lady Nairne]] (n\u00e9e (Joseph), Henry Charles Keith Petty-Fitzmaurice was born in London in 1845. He held the courtesy title ''Viscount Clanmaurice'' from birth until 1863 and then the courtesy title ''Earl of Kerry'' until he succeeded to the marquessate in 1866. Upon his mother's death in 1895, he succeeded her as the [[Lord Nairne|9th Lord Nairne]] in the [[Peerage of Scotland]].\n\nAfter studying at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], he succeeded his father as 5th Marquess of Lansdowne (in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]) and 6th Earl of Kerry (in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]) at the relatively early age of 21 on 5 June 1866. He was [[heir]] to a vast estate, including [[Bowood House]], a Wiltshire estate of over 121,000 [[Acre|acres]], and also great wealth. At one of his inherited properties, [[Derreen House and Gardens|Derreen House]] (Lauragh, [[County Kerry]], [[Republic of Ireland]]), Lord Lansdowne started to create a great garden from 1871 onwards. For most of the rest of his life, he spent three months every year at Derreen.\n\nLord Lansdowne entered the [[House of Lords]] as a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1866. He served in [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone's]] government as a [[Lord of the Treasury]] from 1869 to 1872 and as [[Under-Secretary of State for War]] from 1872 to 1874. He was appointed [[Under-Secretary of State for India]] in 1880, and, having gained experience in overseas administration, was appointed Governor General of Canada in 1883. The present-day town of [[Lansdowne, India|Lansdowne]] in Uttarakhand, [[India]], was established in 1887 and named after him.\n\n==Governor General of Canada, 1883\u20131888==\nLord Lansdowne was Governor General during turbulent times in Canada. His Irish connections made him unpopular with the Catholic Irish element.<ref>Donald Creighton, ''John A. Macdonald: The Old Chieftain'' (1955) 2: 355\u201356.</ref> Sir [[John A. Macdonald]]'s government was in its second term and facing allegations of scandal over the building of the railway (the [[Pacific Scandal]]), and the economy was once again sliding into recession. The [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885 and the controversy caused by its leader, [[Louis Riel]], posed a serious threat to the equilibrium of Canadian politics.<ref name=dcb/> To calm the situation he travelled extensively throughout western Canada in 1885, meeting many of Canada's Indian ([[First Nations]]) peoples.  His experiences in western Canada gave Lansdowne a great love of the Canadian outdoors and the physical beauty of Canada. He was an avid fisherman, and was also intensely interested in winter sports. His love of the wilderness and Canadian countryside led him to purchase a second residence (first was Cascapedia House built in 1880 later renamed Lorne Cottage and in 1884 New Dereen Camp<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cascapedia.org/fishingcamps/index.htm|title=Fishing Camps :: The Cascapedia River Museum|first=Jessica Elizabeth|last=Dell|website=www.cascapedia.org|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref>) on the [[Cascap\u00e9dia River]] in Quebec.<ref name=dcb>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=7958|title=Biography \u2013 PETTY-FITZMAURICE, HENRY CHARLES KEITH, 5th Marquess of LANSDOWNE \u2013 Volume XV (1921-1930) \u2013 Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref> Lansdowne proved himself an adept statesman in helping to negotiate a settlement of a dispute between Canada and the United States in 1886\u201387 over fishing rights.<ref name=dcb/> He was also a supporter of scientific development, presiding over the inaugural session of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1884.\n\nLord Lansdowne departed Canada, \"with its clear skies, its exhilarating sports, and within the bright fire of Gatineau logs, with our children and friends gathered round us\" to his regret.<ref name=dcb/> He gave his wife a great deal of the credit for his success in Canada. One of her happiest and most successful endeavours while at [[Rideau Hall]] was a party she threw for 400 Sunday school children. Lady Lansdowne was decorated with the [[Royal Order of Victoria and Albert|Order of Victoria and Albert]] and the Imperial [[Order of the Crown of India]]. Lord Lansdowne's military secretary, Lord Melgund, later became [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]] and served as Governor General between 1898 and 1904.\n\n==Viceroy of India, 1888\u20131894==\nLord Lansdowne was appointed [[Viceroy of India]] in the same year he left Canada. The viceroyalty, which he held from 1888 to 1894 became the first viceroy of India had been born during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] as her representative, was offered to him by the [[Tories (British political party)|Conservative]] prime minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], and marked the pinnacle of his career. He worked to reform the army, police, local government and the mint. There was an [[Anglo-Manipur War]] in 1890, in which Manipuri were suppressed, Lansdowne securing the death penalty for the leader in the face of considerable opposition from Britain. His attempt in 1893 to curtail trial by jury was, however, over-ruled by home government. He returned to England in 1894.

The Prime Minister, [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], appointed Lord Lansdowne to the post of [[Secretary of State for War]] in June 1895. The unpreparedness of the [[British Army]] during the [[Second Boer War]] brought calls for Lansdowne's impeachment in 1899. His biographer, P. B. Waite, considers that he was unjustly criticized for British military failures: ever the good minister, he took full responsibility and said nothing.<ref name=dcb/>\n\n==Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 1900\u20131905==\nAfter the Unionist victory in the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|general election of October 1900]], Salisbury reorganised his cabinet and gave up the post of [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], appointing Lansdowne to replace him. Lansdowne remained at the Foreign Office under Salisbury's successor [[Arthur Balfour]]. As British Foreign Secretary, he signed the 1902 [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] at his London home (the back half of which still exists as the [[Lansdowne Club]]) and negotiated the 1904 Anglo-French [[Entente Cordiale]] with the French foreign minister, [[Theophile Delcass\u00e9]].<ref>[[G.

The retaliation was to be done by threatening to impose tariffs in response against that country's goods. His Liberal Unionists had split from the Liberals, who promoted [[Free Trade]], and the speech was a landmark in the group's slide towards [[Protectionism]]. Landsdowne argued that threatening retaliatory tariffs was similar to getting respect in a room of armed men by showing a big revolver (his exact words were \"a rather larger revolver than everybody else's\"). The \"Big Revolver\" became a catchphrase of the day, often used in speeches and cartoons.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hugh Montgomery|author2=Philip George Cambray|title=A Dictionary of Political Phrases and Allusions: With a Short Bibliography|publisher=S.

In his new role as head of the opposition Peers, he was instrumental in the Unionist leader [[Arthur Balfour]]'s plans to obstruct Liberal policies through the Unionist majority in the upper house. Although he and Balfour both had some misgivings, he led the Lords to reject the [[People's Budget]] of 1909. After the Liberals won two elections in 1910 on the pledge to reform the House of Lords and remove its veto power, and after a series of failed negotiations in which Lansdowne was of key importance, the Liberals moved forward to end the Lords veto, if necessary by recommending to the King that he create hundreds of new Liberal peers. Lansdowne and the other Conservative leaders were anxious to prevent such an action by allowing the bill, distasteful as they found it, to pass, but soon Lansdowne found that he could not count on many of the more reactionary peers, who planned on a last-ditch resistance. Ultimately, enough Unionist peers either (like Lansdowne himself) abstained from the vote (\"hedgers\") or even voted for the bill (\"rats\") to ensure its passage into the [[Parliament Act 1911]].\n\nIn the following years, Lansdowne continued as Opposition Leader in the Lords, his stature increasing when Balfour resigned as party leader and was replaced by the inexperienced [[Bonar Law]], who had never held cabinet office. In 1914, suffragettes [[Flora Drummond]] and Norah Dacre Fox (later known as [[Norah Elam]]) besieged Lansdowne's home, arguing that Ulster incitement to militancy passed without notice whilst suffragettes were charged and imprisoned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk/|title=Home - Mosley's Old Suffragette: A Biography of Norah Dacre Fox|date=2012-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154415/http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk/|access-date=2020-03-03|archive-date=13 January 2012}}</ref> In 1915, Lansdowne joined the wartime coalition cabinet of [[H. H. Asquith]] as a Minister without Portfolio, but was not given a post in the [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] government formed the following year, despite Conservative pre-eminence in that government. In 1917, having discussed the idea with colleagues for some time with no response, he published the controversial \"[[Lansdowne Letter]]\", which called for a statement of postwar intentions from the Entente Powers. He was criticised as acting contrary to cabinet policy.<ref>Harold Kurtz,  \"The Lansdowne Letter.\" ''History Today'' 18.2 (1968): 84\u201392.</ref><ref>Douglas Newton,  \"The Lansdowne 'Peace Letter' of 1917 and the Prospect of Peace by Negotiation with Germany.\" ''Australian Journal of Politics & History'' 48.1 (2002): 16\u201339.</ref><ref>\"Branded a traitor for just seeking peace- a Tory statesman became a pariah when he wrote to The Times calling for an end to the Great War\" [[The Times]] issue no 72,390 (dated Saturday 25 November 2017), p. 37.</ref>\n\nWhen Lansdowne died, his estate was valued at probate at \u00a31,044,613 in land, with another \u00a3233,888 in other assets.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Lady Maud Evelyn Hamilton, Marchioness of Lansdowne by Cowell, Simla, India.jpg|thumb|right|Lady Maud Evelyn Hamilton, Marchioness of Lansdowne by Cowell, Simla, India]]\nHenry Petty-FitzMaurice married [[Maud Petty-Fitzmaurice, Marchioness of Lansdowne|Lady Maud Evelyn Hamilton]], a daughter of [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn]], and his wife Lady [[Louisa Jane Russell]], V.A., daughter of [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|John, 6th Duke of Bedford]] in 1869.

In 1917, during the [[First World War]], he wrote the \"[[Lansdowne Letter]]\" advocating, in vain, a compromise peace. He has the distinction of having held senior positions in [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] governments.\n\n==Early life and career, 1845\u20131882==\nThe great-grandson of the British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] (later 1st Marquess of Lansdowne), and the eldest son of [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 4th Marquess of Lansdowne]], and his wife, [[Emily Petty-Fitzmaurice, Marchioness of Lansdowne|Emily, 8th Lady Nairne]] (n\u00e9e (Joseph), Henry Charles Keith Petty-Fitzmaurice was born in London in 1845. He held the courtesy title ''Viscount Clanmaurice'' from birth until 1863 and then the courtesy title ''Earl of Kerry'' until he succeeded to the marquessate in 1866. Upon his mother's death in 1895, he succeeded her as the [[Lord Nairne|9th Lord Nairne]] in the [[Peerage of Scotland]].\n\nAfter studying at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], he succeeded his father as 5th Marquess of Lansdowne (in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]) and 6th Earl of Kerry (in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]) at the relatively early age of 21 on 5 June 1866. He was [[heir]] to a vast estate, including [[Bowood House]], a Wiltshire estate of over 121,000 [[Acre|acres]], and also great wealth. At one of his inherited properties, [[Derreen House and Gardens|Derreen House]] (Lauragh, [[County Kerry]], [[Republic of Ireland]]), Lord Lansdowne started to create a great garden from 1871 onwards. For most of the rest of his life, he spent three months every year at Derreen.\n\nLord Lansdowne entered the [[House of Lords]] as a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1866. He served in [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone's]] government as a [[Lord of the Treasury]] from 1869 to 1872 and as [[Under-Secretary of State for War]] from 1872 to 1874. He was appointed [[Under-Secretary of State for India]] in 1880, and, having gained experience in overseas administration, was appointed Governor General of Canada in 1883. The present-day town of [[Lansdowne, India|Lansdowne]] in Uttarakhand, [[India]], was established in 1887 and named after him.\n\n==Governor General of Canada, 1883\u20131888==\nLord Lansdowne was Governor General during turbulent times in Canada. His Irish connections made him unpopular with the Catholic Irish element.<ref>Donald Creighton, ''John A. Macdonald: The Old Chieftain'' (1955) 2: 355\u201356.</ref> Sir [[John A. Macdonald]]'s government was in its second term and facing allegations of scandal over the building of the railway (the [[Pacific Scandal]]), and the economy was once again sliding into recession.

His experiences in western Canada gave Lansdowne a great love of the Canadian outdoors and the physical beauty of Canada. He was an avid fisherman, and was also intensely interested in winter sports. His love of the wilderness and Canadian countryside led him to purchase a second residence (first was Cascapedia House built in 1880 later renamed Lorne Cottage and in 1884 New Dereen Camp<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cascapedia.org/fishingcamps/index.htm|title=Fishing Camps :: The Cascapedia River Museum|first=Jessica Elizabeth|last=Dell|website=www.cascapedia.org|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref>) on the [[Cascap\u00e9dia River]] in Quebec.<ref name=dcb>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=7958|title=Biography \u2013 PETTY-FITZMAURICE, HENRY CHARLES KEITH, 5th Marquess of LANSDOWNE \u2013 Volume XV (1921-1930) \u2013 Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref> Lansdowne proved himself an adept statesman in helping to negotiate a settlement of a dispute between Canada and the United States in 1886-87 over fishing rights.<ref name=dcb/> He was also a supporter of scientific development, presiding over the inaugural session of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1884.\n\nLord Lansdowne departed Canada, \"with its clear skies, its exhilarating sports, and within the bright fire of Gatineau logs, with our children and friends gathered round us\" to his regret.<ref name=dcb/> He gave his wife a great deal of the credit for his success in Canada. One of her happiest and most successful endeavours while at [[Rideau Hall]] was a party she threw for 400 Sunday school children. Lady Lansdowne was decorated with the [[Royal Order of Victoria and Albert|Order of Victoria and Albert]] and the Imperial [[Order of the Crown of India]]. Lord Lansdowne's military secretary, Lord Melgund, later became [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]] and served as Governor General between 1898 and 1904.\n\n==Viceroy of India, 1888\u20131894==\nLord Lansdowne was appointed [[Viceroy of India]] in the same year he left Canada.

He worked to reform the army, police, local government and the mint. There was an [[Anglo-Manipur War]] in 1890, in which Manipuri were suppressed, Lansdowne securing the death penalty for the leader in the face of considerable opposition from Britain. His attempt in 1893 to curtail trial by jury was, however, over-ruled by home government. He returned to England in 1894.

The Prime Minister, [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], appointed Lord Lansdowne to the post of [[Secretary of State for War]] in June 1895. The unpreparedness of the [[British Army]] during the [[Second Boer War]] brought calls for Lansdowne's impeachment in 1899. His biographer, P. B. Waite, considers that he was unjustly criticized for British military failures: ever the good minister, he took full responsibility and said nothing.<ref name=dcb/>\n\n==Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 1900\u20131905==\nAfter the Unionist victory in the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|general election of October 1900]], Salisbury reorganised his cabinet and gave up the post of [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], appointing Lansdowne to replace him. Lansdowne remained at the Foreign Office under Salisbury's successor [[Arthur Balfour]]. As British Foreign Secretary, he signed the 1902 [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] at his London home (the back half of which still exists as the [[Lansdowne Club]]) and negotiated the 1904 Anglo-French [[Entente Cordiale]] with the French foreign minister, [[Theophile Delcass\u00e9]].<ref>[[G.

The retaliation was to be done by threatening to impose tariffs in response against that country's goods. His Liberal Unionists had split from the Liberals, who promoted [[Free Trade]], and the speech was a landmark in the group's slide towards [[Protectionism]]. Landsdowne argued that threatening retaliatory tariffs was similar to getting respect in a room of armed men by showing a big revolver (his exact words were \"a rather larger revolver than everybody else's\"). The \"Big Revolver\" became a catchphrase of the day, often used in speeches and cartoons.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hugh Montgomery|author2=Philip George Cambray|title=A Dictionary of Political Phrases and Allusions: With a Short Bibliography|publisher=S.

In his new role as head of the opposition Peers, he was instrumental in the Unionist leader [[Arthur Balfour]]'s plans to obstruct Liberal policies through the Unionist majority in the upper house. Although he and Balfour both had some misgivings, he led the Lords to reject the [[People's Budget]] of 1909. After the Liberals won two elections in 1910 on the pledge to reform the House of Lords and remove its veto power, and after a series of failed negotiations in which Lansdowne was of key importance, the Liberals moved forward to end the Lords veto, if necessary by recommending to the King that he create hundreds of new Liberal peers. Lansdowne and the other Conservative leaders were anxious to prevent such an action by allowing the bill, distasteful as they found it, to pass, but soon Lansdowne found that he could not count on many of the more reactionary peers, who planned on a last-ditch resistance. Ultimately, enough Unionist peers either (like Lansdowne himself) abstained from the vote (\"hedgers\") or even voted for the bill (\"rats\") to ensure its passage into the [[Parliament Act 1911]].\n\nIn the following years, Lansdowne continued as Opposition Leader in the Lords, his stature increasing when Balfour resigned as party leader and was replaced by the inexperienced [[Bonar Law]], who had never held cabinet office. In 1914, suffragettes [[Flora Drummond]] and Norah Dacre Fox (later known as [[Norah Elam]]) besieged Lansdowne's home, arguing that Ulster incitement to militancy passed without notice whilst suffragettes were charged and imprisoned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk/|title=Home - Mosley's Old Suffragette: A Biography of Norah Dacre Fox|date=2012-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154415/http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk/|access-date=2020-03-03|archive-date=13 January 2012}}</ref> In 1915, Lansdowne joined the wartime coalition cabinet of [[H.

In 1917, having discussed the idea with colleagues for some time with no response, he published the controversial \"[[Lansdowne Letter]]\", which called for a statement of postwar intentions from the Entente Powers. He was criticised as acting contrary to cabinet policy.<ref>Harold Kurtz,  \"The Lansdowne Letter.\" ''History Today'' 18.2 (1968): 84\u201392.</ref><ref>Douglas Newton,  \"The Lansdowne 'Peace Letter' of 1917 and the Prospect of Peace by Negotiation with Germany.\" ''Australian Journal of Politics & History'' 48.1 (2002): 16\u201339.</ref><ref>\"Branded a traitor for just seeking peace- a Tory statesman became a pariah when he wrote to The Times calling for an end to the Great War\" [[The Times]] issue no 72,390 (dated Saturday 25 November 2017), p. 37.</ref>\n\nWhen Lansdowne died, his estate was valued at probate at \u00a31,044,613 in land, with another \u00a3233,888 in other assets.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Lady Maud Evelyn Hamilton, Marchioness of Lansdowne by Cowell, Simla, India.jpg|thumb|right|Lady Maud Evelyn Hamilton, Marchioness of Lansdowne by Cowell, Simla, India]]\nHenry Petty-FitzMaurice married [[Maud Petty-Fitzmaurice, Marchioness of Lansdowne|Lady Maud Evelyn Hamilton]], a daughter of [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn]], and his wife Lady [[Louisa Jane Russell]], V.A., daughter of [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|John, 6th Duke of Bedford]] in 1869.

Tracks usually consist of [[steel]] rails, installed on [[Railroad tie|ties]] (sleepers) set in [[track ballast|ballast]], on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also possible, such as slab track. This is where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface.\n[[File:World railway network.png|thumb|<center>Map of world railway network {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:traveler/World Railways|interactive map]])}}</center>]] \n[[File:JR_tokai_shinkansen_0kei.jpg|thumb|[[0 Series Shinkansen]] is the first [[High-speed rail|high speed train]] of the world.It started operate between [[Tokyo]] and [[Shin-\u014csaka Station|Shin-\u014csaka]] on the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] since 1964.]]\n[[File:KTT_train.jpg|thumb|KTT is a train set used by the [[MTR Corporation Limited]] in [[Hong Kong]] on the [[Guangzhou-Kowloon through train|Guangdong Through Train (KCRC)]] route.

The [[rail transport operations|operation]] is carried out by a [[railway company]], providing transport between [[train station]]s or freight customer facilities. Power is provided by [[locomotive]]s which either draw [[electric power]] from a [[railway electrification system]] or produce their own power, usually by [[diesel engine]]s or, historically, [[steam locomotive|steam]] engines. Most tracks are accompanied by a [[railway signaling|signalling system]]. Railways are a safe land transport system when compared to other forms of transport.<ref group=\"Nb\">According to [{{cite report |url=http://www.railwatch.org.uk/backtrack/rw94/rw094p06.pdf |title=Face the facts on transport safety |author=Norman Bradbury |work=Railwatch |date=November 2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011093930/http://www.railwatch.org.uk/backtrack/rw94/rw094p06.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2010}}], railways are the safest on both a per-mile and per-hour basis, whereas [[Aviation|air transport]] is safe only on a per-mile basis.</ref> Railway transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilization and energy efficiency, but is often less flexible and more [[capital (economics)|capital]]-intensive than road transport, when lower traffic levels are considered.\n\nThe oldest known, man/animal-hauled railways date back to the 6th century BC in [[Corinth]], [[Greece]]. Rail transport then commenced in mid 16th century in [[Germany]] in the form of horse-powered [[funicular]]s and [[wagonway]]s. Modern rail transport commenced with the British development of the [[steam locomotive]]s in the early 19th century. Thus the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railway system in Great Britain]] is the oldest in the world. Built by [[George Stephenson]] and his son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]]'s company [[Robert Stephenson and Company]], the [[Locomotion No. 1|''Locomotion'' No. 1]] is the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line, the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825. George Stephenson also built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use only the steam locomotives all the time, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] which [[Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opened in 1830]]. With steam engines, one could construct mainline railways, which were a key component of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Also, railways reduced the costs of [[shipping]], and allowed for fewer lost goods, compared with water transport, which faced occasional sinking of ships. The change from [[canals]] to railways allowed for \"national markets\" in which prices varied very little from city to city. The spread of the railway network and the use of railway timetables, led to the standardisation of time (railway time) in Britain based on Greenwich Mean Time. Prior to this, major towns and cities varied their local time relative to GMT. The invention and development of the railway in the United Kingdom was one of the most important technological inventions of the 19th century. The world's first underground railway, the [[Metropolitan Railway]] (part of the [[London Underground]]), opened in 1863.\n\nIn the 1880s, [[railway electrification system|electrified]] trains were introduced, leading to electrification of tramways and rapid transit systems. Starting during the 1940s, the non-electrified railways in most countries had their steam locomotives replaced by [[diesel fuel|diesel]]-electric locomotives, with the process being almost complete by the 2000s. During the 1960s, electrified [[high-speed rail|high-speed railway systems]] were introduced in [[Japan]] and later in some other countries. Many countries are in the process of replacing diesel locomotives with electric locomotives, mainly due to environmental concerns, a notable example being [[Switzerland]], which has completely electrified its network.

[[John Curr]], a Sheffield colliery manager, invented this flanged rail in 1787, though the exact date of this is disputed. The plate rail was taken up by [[Benjamin Outram]] for wagonways serving his canals, manufacturing them at his [[Butterley Company|Butterley ironworks]]. In 1803, [[William Jessop]] opened the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], a double track plateway, erroneously sometimes cited as world's first public railway, in south London.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.stephensonloco.fsbusiness.co.uk/surreyiron.htm| title=Surrey Iron Railway 200th \u2013 26th July 2003| publisher=Stephenson Locomotive Society| work=Early Railways| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512032233/http://www.stephensonloco.fsbusiness.co.uk/surreyiron.htm| archivedate=12 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chpr fishbelly.jpg|thumb|left|Cast iron fishbelly edge rail manufactured by Outram at the [[Butterley Company]] ironworks for the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] (1831).

In 1790, Jessop and his partner Outram began to manufacture edge-rails. Jessop became a partner in the Butterley Company in 1790. The first public edgeway (thus also first public railway) built was [[Lake Lock Rail Road]] in 1796. Although the primary purpose of the line was to carry coal, it also carried passengers.\n\nThese two systems of constructing iron railways, the \"L\" plate-rail and the smooth edge-rail, continued to exist side by side until well into the early 19th century. The flanged wheel and edge-rail eventually proved its superiority and became the standard for railways.\n\nCast iron used in rails proved unsatisfactory because it was brittle and broke under heavy loads. The [[wrought iron]] invented by [[John Birkinshaw]] in 1820 replaced cast iron. [[Wrought iron]] (usually simply referred to as \"iron\") was a ductile material that could undergo considerable deformation before breaking, making it more suitable for iron rails. But iron was expensive to produce until [[Henry Cort]] patented the [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] in 1784. In 1783 Cort also patented the [[rolling (metalworking)|rolling process]], which was 15 times faster at consolidating and shaping iron than hammering.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present|last=Landes|first= David.

The softness and dross tended to make iron rails distort and delaminate and they lasted less than 10 years. Sometimes they lasted as little as one year under high traffic. All these developments in the production of iron eventually led to replacement of composite wood/iron rails with superior all iron rails.\n\nThe introduction of the [[Bessemer process]], enabling steel to be made inexpensively, led to the era of great expansion of railways that began in the late 1860s.

This was a large [[stationary engine]], powering cotton mills and a variety of machinery; the state of boiler technology necessitated the use of low pressure steam acting upon a vacuum in the cylinder, which required a separate [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] and an [[air pump]]. Nevertheless, as the construction of boilers improved, Watt investigated the use of high-pressure steam acting directly upon a piston, raising the possibility of a smaller engine that might be used to power a vehicle.

In 1914, world's first functional diesel\u2013electric railcars were produced for the ''K\u00f6niglich-S\u00e4chsische Staatseisenbahnen'' ([[Royal Saxon State Railways]]) by [[Waggonfabrik Rastatt]] with electric equipment from [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] and diesel engines from [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer AG]]. They were classified as [[Saxon DET 1-2|DET 1 and DET 2]] ([[:de:S\u00e4chsischer DET 1\u20132|de.wiki]]). The first regular use of diesel\u2013electric locomotives was in [[Switcher|switching]] (shunter) applications. General Electric produced several small switching locomotives in the 1930s (the famous \"[[44-tonner]]\" switcher was introduced in 1940) Westinghouse Electric and Baldwin collaborated to build switching locomotives starting in 1929.\n\nIn 1929, the [[Canadian National Railways]] became the first North American railway to use diesels in mainline service with two units, 9000 and 9001, from Westinghouse.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=409}}\n\n=== High-speed rail ===\n{{main|High-speed rail}}\nAlthough steam and diesel services reaching speeds up to 200&nbsp;km/h were started before the 1960s in Europe, they were not very successful{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}.\n\n[[File:Shinkansen type 0 Hikari 19890506a.jpg|thumb|0-Series [[Shinkansen]], introduced in 1964, triggered the intercity train travel boom.]]\nThe first electrified [[high-speed rail]] [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] was introduced in 1964 between [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]] in Japan. Since then [[high-speed rail]] transport, functioning at speeds up to and above 300&nbsp;km/h, has been built in Japan, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, the People's Republic of China, Taiwan (Republic of China), the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Korea]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]. The construction of many of these lines has resulted in the dramatic decline of short haul flights and automotive traffic between connected cities, such as the London\u2013Paris\u2013Brussels corridor, Madrid\u2013Barcelona, Milan\u2013Rome\u2013Naples, as well as many other major lines.{{Citation needed|reason=\nIf this is correct, it's a strong argument in favor of building more high speed rail lines. It would help to have quantitative estimates of the magnitude of this effect including as a function of distance with credible sources for those estimates. For example, could similar effects be obtained from high speed rail between San Francisco and Los Angeles, where the distances are 60 percent more than between [[London]], [[Paris]] and Brussels?|date=December 2013}}\n\nHigh-speed trains normally operate on [[standard gauge]] tracks of [[continuously welded rail]] on [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] that incorporates a large [[Minimum railway curve radius|turning radius]] in its design. While high-speed rail is most often designed for passenger travel, some high-speed systems also offer freight service.\n\n==Trains==\n{{Main|Train}}\nA train is a connected series of rail vehicles that move along the track. Propulsion for the train is provided by a separate locomotive or from individual motors in self-propelled multiple units. Most trains carry a revenue load, although non-revenue cars exist for the railway's own use, such as for [[maintenance-of-way]] purposes. The [[railroad engineer|engine driver]] (engineer in North America) controls the locomotive or other power cars, although [[people mover]]s and some rapid transits are under automatic control.\n\n===Haulage===\n[[File:2TE10U Russian Locomotive.jpg|thumb|Russian 2TE10U Diesel-electric locomotive]]\nTraditionally, trains are pulled using a locomotive. This involves one or more powered vehicles being located at the front of the train, providing sufficient [[tractive force]] to haul the weight of the full train. This arrangement remains dominant for freight trains and is often used for passenger trains. A [[push\u2013pull train]] has the end passenger car equipped with a driver's cab so that the engine driver can remotely control the locomotive. This allows one of the locomotive-hauled train's drawbacks to be removed, since the locomotive need not be moved to the front of the train each time the train changes direction. A [[railroad car]] is a vehicle used for the haulage of either passengers or freight.\n\nA multiple unit has powered wheels throughout the whole train. These are used for rapid transit and tram systems, as well as many both short- and long-haul passenger trains. A [[railcar]] is a single, self-powered car, and may be electrically-propelled or powered by a [[diesel engine]]. Multiple units have a driver's cab at each end of the unit, and were developed following the ability to build [[electric motor]]s and [[engine (motor)|engines]] small enough to fit under the coach. There are only a few freight multiple units, most of which are high-speed post trains.\n\n===Motive power===\n[[File:H\u017d 7123 series DMU (06).JPG|thumb|A [[RegioSwinger]] multiple unit of the [[Croatian Railways]]]]\n[[Steam locomotive]]s are locomotives with a [[steam engine]] that provides adhesion. [[Coal]], [[petroleum]], or [[wood]] is burned in a [[firebox (steam engine)|firebox]], boiling water in the [[fire-tube boiler|boiler]] to create pressurized steam. The steam travels through the [[smokebox]] before leaving via the chimney or smoke stack. In the process, it powers a [[piston]] that transmits power directly through a [[connecting rod]] (US: main rod) and a [[crankpin]] (US: wristpin) on the [[driving wheel]] (US main driver) or to a [[crankshaft|crank]] on a driving axle. Steam locomotives have been phased out in most parts of the world for economical and safety reasons, although many are preserved in working order by [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n[[Electric locomotive]]s draw power from a stationary source via an [[Overhead lines|overhead wire]] or [[third rail]]. Some also or instead use a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. In locomotives that are powered by high voltage [[alternating current]], a [[transformer]] in the locomotive converts the high voltage, low current power to low voltage, high current used in the [[electric motor|traction motors]] that power the wheels. Modern locomotives may use [[Electric motor#Three-phase AC induction motors|three-phase AC induction motors]] or [[direct current]] motors. Under certain conditions, electric locomotives are the most powerful traction.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} They are also the cheapest to run and provide less noise and no local air pollution.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} However, they require high capital investments both for the [[overhead lines]] and the supporting infrastructure, as well as the generating station that is needed to produce electricity. Accordingly, electric traction is used on urban systems, lines with high traffic and for high-speed rail.\n\n[[Diesel locomotive]]s use a diesel engine as the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]. The energy transmission may be either [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]], diesel-mechanical or diesel-hydraulic but diesel-electric is dominant. [[Electro-diesel locomotive]]s are built to run as diesel-electric on unelectrified sections and as electric locomotives on electrified sections.\n\nAlternative methods of motive power include [[maglev (transport)|magnetic levitation]], horse-drawn, [[funicular|cable]], gravity, [[pneumatics]] and [[gas turbine]].\n\n===Passenger trains===\n[[File:InterCity2 - passenger car interior.jpg|thumb|Interior view of the top deck of a [[VR Group|VR]] InterCity2 [[Bilevel rail car|double-deck carriage]]]]A passenger train travels between stations where passengers may embark and disembark. The oversight of the train is the duty of a [[conductor (transportation)|guard/train manager/conductor]]. Passenger trains are part of public transport and often make up the stem of the service, with buses feeding to stations. Passenger trains provide long-distance intercity travel, daily commuter trips, or local urban transit services. They even include a diversity of vehicles, operating speeds, right-of-way requirements, and service frequency. Passenger trains usually can be divided into two operations: intercity railway and intracity transit. Whereas intercity railway involve higher speeds, longer routes, and lower frequency (usually scheduled), intracity transit involves lower speeds, shorter routes, and higher frequency (especially during peak hours).<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003.

Trains typically have amenities such as a [[dining car]]. Some lines also provide over-night services with [[sleeping car]]s. Some long-haul trains have been given a [[lists of named passenger trains|specific name]]. [[Regional rail|Regional trains]] are medium distance trains that connect cities with outlying, surrounding areas, or provide a regional service, making more stops and having lower speeds. [[Commuter rail|Commuter trains]] serve suburbs of urban areas, providing a daily [[commuting]] service. [[Airport rail link]]s provide quick access from city centres to [[airport]]s.\n\n[[High-speed rail]] are special inter-city trains that operate at much higher speeds than conventional railways, the limit being regarded at {{convert|200|to|320|km/h}}. High-speed trains are used mostly for long-haul service and most systems are in Western Europe and East Asia. The [[land speed record for railed vehicles|speed record]] is {{convert|574.8|km/h|abbr=on}}, set by a modified French [[TGV]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/03/TGVspeedrecord.ap/index.html| title=French train breaks speed record| date=4 April 2007| accessdate=3 April 2007| agency=Associated Press| work=CNN|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407194558/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/03/TGVspeedrecord.ap/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 April 2007| authorlink= Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aW23Aw20niIo&refer=europe| title=French TGV Sets Record, Reaching 357 Miles an Hour (Update2)|author1=Fouquet, Helene  |author2=Viscousi, Gregory |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher=Bloomberg L.P.| date=3 April 2007 | accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref> [[Maglev (transport)|Magnetic levitation]] trains such as the Shanghai airport train use under-riding magnets which attract themselves upward towards the underside of a guideway and this line has achieved somewhat higher peak speeds in day-to-day operation than conventional high-speed railways, although only over short distances. Due to their heightened speeds, route alignments for high-speed rail tend to have shallower grades and broader curves than conventional railways.\n\nTheir high kinetic energy translates to higher horsepower-to-ton ratios (e.g. {{convert|20|hp/ST|disp=or}}); this allows trains to accelerate and maintain higher speeds and negotiate steep grades as momentum builds up and recovered in downgrades (reducing cut, fill, and tunnelling requirements). Since lateral forces act on curves, curvatures are designed with the highest possible radius. All these features are dramatically different from freight operations, thus justifying exclusive high-speed rail lines if it is economically feasible.<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\n[[Higher-speed rail]] services are intercity rail services that have top speeds higher than conventional intercity trains but the speeds are not as high as those in the high-speed rail services. These services are provided after improvements to the conventional rail infrastructure in order to support trains that can operate safely at higher speeds.\n[[File:SEPTA Silverliner II.jpg|alt=|thumb|301x301px|SEPTA Regional Railroad Train]]\n[[Rapid transit]] is an intracity system built in large cities and has the highest capacity of any passenger transport system. It is usually grade-separated and commonly built underground or elevated. At street level, smaller [[tram]]s can be used. [[Light rail]]s are upgraded trams that have step-free access, their own right-of-way and sometimes sections underground. [[Monorail]] systems are elevated, medium-capacity systems. A [[people mover]] is a driverless, grade-separated train that serves only a few stations, as a shuttle. Due to the lack of uniformity of rapid transit systems, route alignment varies, with diverse rights-of-way (private land, side of road, street median) and [[track geometry|geometric characteristics]] (sharp or broad curves, steep or gentle grades). For instance, the [[Chicago 'L']] trains are designed with extremely short cars to negotiate the sharp curves in the [[The Loop (CTA)|Loop]]. New Jersey's [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] has similar-sized cars to accommodate curves in the trans-Hudson tunnels. San Francisco's [[BART]] operates large cars on its routes.<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003.

Freight trains are very efficient, with economy of scale and high energy efficiency. However, their use can be reduced by lack of flexibility, if there is need of transshipment at both ends of the trip due to lack of tracks to the points of pick-up and delivery. Authorities often encourage the use of cargo rail transport due to its fame.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/environmental-issues/| title=Environmental Issues| publisher=The Environmental Blog| date=3 April 2007| accessdate=10 October 2010| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111153436/http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/environmental-issues/| archivedate=11 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Containerization|Container trains]] have become the beta type in the US for bulk haulage. Containers can easily be transshipped to other modes, such as ships and trucks, using cranes. This has succeeded the [[boxcar]] (wagon-load), where the cargo had to be loaded and unloaded into the train manually. The intermodal [[containerization]] of cargo has revolutionized the [[supply chain]] [[logistics]] industry, reducing ship costs significantly. In Europe, the [[Goods van#Sliding wall wagons|sliding wall wagon]] has largely superseded the [[Goods van|ordinary covered wagons]]. Other types of cars include [[refrigerator car]]s, [[stock car (rail)|stock cars]] for livestock and [[autorack]]s for road vehicles. When rail is combined with road transport, a [[roadrailer]] will allow [[semi-trailer|trailers]] to be driven onto the train, allowing for easy transition between road and rail.\n\n[[Bulk material handling|Bulk handling]] represents a key advantage for rail transport. Low or even zero transshipment costs combined with energy efficiency and low inventory costs allow trains to handle [[bulk cargo|bulk]] much cheaper than by road. Typical bulk cargo includes coal, ore, grains and liquids. Bulk is transported in [[gondola (rail)|open-topped cars]], [[hopper car]]s and [[tank car]]s.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    = Left: Railway turnouts; Right: [[Chicago Transit Authority]] [[control tower]] 18 guides elevated [[Chicago 'L']] north and southbound [[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple]] and [[Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Brown]] lines intersecting with east and westbound [[Pink Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Pink]] and [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green]] lines and the looping [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange line]] above the [[Wells Street (Chicago)|Wells]] and [[Lake Street (Chicago)|Lake street]] [[intersection (road)|intersection]] in the [[Loop (CTA)|loop]] at an elevated right of way.\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = P\u00f6\u00f6rangud Tartu raudteejaamas.jpg\n | width1    = 177\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  =\n | image2    = CTA loop junction.jpg\n | width2    = 200\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n}}\n\n===Right of way===\nRailway tracks are laid upon land owned or leased by the railway company. Owing to the desirability of maintaining modest grades, rails will often be laid in circuitous routes in hilly or mountainous terrain. Route length and grade requirements can be reduced by the use of alternating [[cutting (transportation)|cuttings]], bridges and tunnels&nbsp;\u2013 all of which can greatly increase the capital expenditures required to develop a right of way, while significantly reducing operating costs and allowing higher speeds on longer radius curves. In densely urbanized areas, railways are sometimes laid in tunnels to minimize the effects on existing properties.\n\n===Track===\n{{main|Track (rail transport)|l1=Track}}\n[[File:European railway map.jpg|thumb|Map of railways in Europe with main operational lines shown in black, [[heritage railway]] lines in green and former routes in light blue]]\n[[File:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|thumb|Long freight train crossing the Stoney Creek viaduct on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in southern [[British Columbia]]]]\n\nTrack consists of two parallel steel rails, anchored [[perpendicular]] to members called [[railroad tie|ties]] (sleepers) of timber, concrete, steel, or plastic to maintain a consistent distance apart, or [[rail gauge]]. Rail gauges are usually categorized as [[standard gauge]] (used on approximately 55% of the world's existing railway lines), [[broad gauge]], and [[narrow gauge]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In addition to the rail gauge, the tracks will be laid to conform with a [[Loading gauge]] which defines the maximum height and width for railway vehicles and their loads to ensure safe passage through bridges, tunnels and other structures.\n\nThe track guides the conical, flanged wheels, keeping the cars on the track without active steering and therefore allowing trains to be much longer than road vehicles. The rails and ties are usually placed on a foundation made of compressed earth on top of which is placed a bed of [[track ballast|ballast]] to distribute the load from the ties and to prevent the track from [[buckling]] as the ground settles over time under the weight of the vehicles passing above.\n\nThe ballast also serves as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is attached by [[direct fixation]] without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By [[Thermite welding|welding]] rails together to form lengths of [[continuous welded rail]], additional wear and tear on rolling stock caused by the small surface gap at the joints between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for a quieter ride.\n\nOn curves the outer rail may be at a higher level than the inner rail. This is called superelevation or [[cant (road/rail)|cant]]. This reduces the forces tending to displace the track and makes for a more comfortable ride for standing livestock and standing or seated passengers. A given amount of superelevation is most effective over a limited range of speeds.\n\n[[Railroad switch|Turnouts]], also known as points and switches, are the means of directing a train onto a diverging section of track. Laid similar to normal track, a point typically consists of a [[Switch frog|frog]] (common crossing), check rails and two switch rails. The switch rails may be moved left or right, under the control of the signalling system, to determine which path the train will follow.\n\nSpikes in wooden ties can loosen over time, but split and rotten ties may be individually replaced with new wooden ties or concrete substitutes. Concrete ties can also develop cracks or splits, and can also be replaced individually. Should the rails settle due to soil subsidence, they can be lifted by specialized machinery and additional ballast tamped under the ties to level the rails.\n\nPeriodically, ballast must be removed and replaced with clean ballast to ensure adequate drainage. Culverts and other passages for water must be kept clear lest water is impounded by the trackbed, causing landslips. Where trackbeds are placed along rivers, additional protection is usually placed to prevent streambank erosion during times of high water. Bridges require inspection and maintenance, since they are subject to large surges of stress in a short period of time when a heavy train crosses.\n\n===Train inspection systems===\n[[File:HBD DD1.jpg|thumb|A [[Defect detector#Sensors|Hot bearing detector]] with dragging equipment unit]]The inspection of railway equipment is essential for the safe movement of trains. Many types of [[defect detector]]s are in use on the world's railroads. These devices utilize technologies that vary from a simplistic paddle and switch to [[infrared]] and laser scanning, and even [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasonic audio analysis]]. Their use has avoided many rail accidents over the 70 years they have been used.\n\n===Signalling===\n[[File:LeicesterAndSwannington02A.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bardon Hill]] box in [[England]] is a [[Midland Railway]] box dating from 1899, although the original mechanical lever frame has been replaced by electrical switches. Seen here in 2009.]]\n{{Main|Railway signalling}}\n[[Railway signalling]] is a system used to control railway traffic safely to prevent trains from colliding. Being guided by fixed [[Track (rail transport)|rails]] which generate low friction, trains are uniquely susceptible to collision since they frequently operate at speeds that do not enable them to stop quickly or within the driver's sighting distance; road vehicles, which encounter a higher level of friction between their rubber tyres and the road surface, have much shorter braking distances. Most forms of train control involve movement authority being passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network to the train crew. Not all methods require the use of signals, and some systems are specific to [[single track (rail)|single track]] railways.\n\nThe signalling process is traditionally carried out in a [[signal box]], a small building that houses the [[lever frame]] required for the signalman to operate switches and signal equipment. These are placed at various intervals along the route of a railway, controlling specified sections of track. More recent technological developments have made such operational doctrine superfluous, with the centralization of signalling operations to regional control rooms. This has been facilitated by the increased use of computers, allowing vast sections of track to be monitored from a single location. The common method of [[Railway signalling#Blocks|block signalling]] divides the track into zones guarded by combinations of block signals, operating rules, and automatic-control devices so that only one train may be in a block at any time.\n\n===Electrification===\n{{Main|Railway electrification system}}\nThe electrification system provides electrical energy to the trains, so they can operate without a prime mover on board. This allows lower operating costs, but requires large capital investments along the lines. Mainline and tram systems normally have overhead wires, which hang from poles along the line. Grade-separated rapid transit sometimes use a ground [[third rail]].\n\nPower may be fed as [[direct current|direct]] (DC) or [[alternating current]] (AC). The most common DC voltages are 600 and 750&nbsp;V for tram and rapid transit systems, and 1,500&nbsp;and 3,000&nbsp;V for mainlines. The two dominant AC systems are [[15 kV AC railway electrification|15&nbsp;kV]] and [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25&nbsp;kV]].\n\n===Stations===\n[[File:Rang gueter bahnhof small.jpg|thumb|right|Goods station in [[Lucerne]], Switzerland]]\n{{Main|Train station}}\n\nA [[railway station]] serves as an area where passengers can board and alight from trains. A [[goods station]] is a yard which is exclusively used for loading and unloading cargo. Large passenger stations have at least one building providing conveniences for passengers, such as purchasing tickets and food. Smaller stations typically only consist of a [[railway platform|platform]]. Early stations were sometimes built with both passenger and goods facilities.<ref>{{cite journal| title=The Inception of the English Railway Station| journal=[[Architectural History (journal)|Architectural History]]| volume=4| year=1961| pages=63\u201376| doi=10.2307/1568245| jstor=1568245}}</ref>\n\nPlatforms are used to allow easy access to the trains, and are connected to each other via [[underpass]]es, [[footbridge]]s and level crossings. Some large stations are built as [[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]], with trains only operating out from one direction. Smaller stations normally serve local residential areas, and may have connection to feeder bus services. Large stations, in particular [[central station]]s, serve as the main [[transport hub|public transport hub]] for the city, and have transfer available between rail services, and to rapid transit, tram or bus services.\n\n==Operations==\n\n===Ownership===\n[[File:UP 6670.jpg|thumb|In the United States, railroads such as the [[Union Pacific]] traditionally own and operate both their rolling stock and infrastructure, with the company itself typically being privately owned.]]\n\nSince the 1980s, there has been an increasing trend to split up railway companies, with companies owning the rolling stock separated from those owning the infrastructure. This is particularly true in Europe, where this arrangement is required by the European Union. This has allowed open access by any train operator to any portion of the European railway network. In the UK, the railway track is state owned, with a public controlled body ([[Network Rail]]) running, maintaining and developing the track, while Train Operating Companies have run the trains since [[privatisation of British Rail|privatization in the 1990s]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.networkrail.co.uk/about-us/|title = About Us|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141009231027/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/about-us/|archive-date = 9 October 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the U.S., virtually all rail networks and infrastructure outside the [[Northeast corridor|Northeast Corridor]] are privately owned by freight lines. Passenger lines, primarily [[Amtrak]], operate as tenants on the freight lines. Consequently, operations must be closely synchronized and coordinated between freight and passenger railroads, with passenger trains often being dispatched by the host freight railroad. Due to this shared system, both are regulated by the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) and may follow the [[American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association|AREMA]] recommended practices for track work and [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] standards for vehicles.<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\n===Financing===\nThe main source of income for railway companies is from [[train ticket|ticket]] revenue (for passenger transport) and shipment fees for cargo. Discounts and monthly passes are sometimes available for frequent travellers (e.g. [[season ticket]] and [[rail pass]]). Freight revenue may be sold per container slot or for a whole train. Sometimes, the shipper owns the cars and only rents the haulage. For passenger transport, [[advertisement]] income can be significant.\n\nGovernments may choose to give subsidies to rail operation, since rail transport has fewer [[externalities]] than other dominant modes of transport. If the railway company is state-owned, the state may simply provide direct subsidies in exchange for increased production. If operations have been privatized, several options are available. Some countries have a system where the infrastructure is owned by a government agency or company&nbsp;\u2013 with open access to the tracks for any company that meets safety requirements. In such cases, the state may choose to provide the tracks free of charge, or for a fee that does not cover all costs. This is seen as analogous to the government providing free access to roads. For passenger operations, a direct subsidy may be paid to a public-owned operator, or [[public service obligation]] tender may be helt, and a time-limited contract awarded to the lowest bidder. [[Rail transport in Europe#Subsidies|Total EU rail subsidies]] amounted to \u20ac73 billion in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/technical_report_2007_3/download |title=EU Technical Report 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Amtrak]], the US passenger rail service, and Canada's [[Via Rail]] are private railroad companies chartered by their respective national governments. As private passenger services declined because of competition from automobiles and airlines, they became [[shareholder]]s of Amtrak either with a cash entrance fee or relinquishing their locomotives and rolling stock. The government subsidizes Amtrak by supplying start-up [[capital (economics)|capital]] and making up for losses at the end of the [[fiscal year]].<ref name=\"EuDaly, K, et al. 2009.

Possible accidents include [[derailment]] (jumping the track), a collision with another train or collision with automobiles, other vehicles or pedestrians at [[level crossing]]s. The last accounts for the majority of rail accidents and casualties. The most important safety measures to prevent accidents are strict operating rules, e.g. [[railway signalling]] and gates or [[grade separation]] at crossings. [[Train whistle]]s, bells or [[train horn|horns]] warn of the presence of a train, while trackside signals maintain the distances between trains.\n\nAn important element in the safety of many high-speed inter-city networks such as Japan's [[Shinkansen]] is the fact that trains only run on dedicated railway lines, without level crossings. This effectively eliminates the potential for collision with automobiles, other vehicles or pedestrians, vastly reduces the likelihood of collision with other trains and helps ensure services remain timely.\n\n===Maintenance===\nAs in any [[infrastructure]] asset, railways must keep up with periodic inspection and maintenance in order to minimize effect of infrastructure failures that can disrupt freight revenue operations and passenger services. Because passengers are considered the most ''crucial cargo'' and usually operate at higher speeds, steeper grades, and higher capacity/frequency, their lines are especially important. Inspection practices include [[track geometry car]]s or walking inspection. Curve maintenance especially for transit services includes gauging, fastener tightening, and rail replacement.\n\nRail corrugation is a common issue with transit systems due to the high number of light-axle, wheel passages which result in grinding of the wheel/rail interface. Since maintenance may overlap with operations, maintenance windows (nighttime hours, [[off-peak]] hours, altering train schedules or routes) must be closely followed. In addition, passenger safety during maintenance work (inter-track fencing, proper storage of materials, track work notices, hazards of equipment near states) must be regarded at all times. At times, maintenance access problems can emerge due to tunnels, elevated structures, and congested cityscapes. Here, specialized equipment or smaller versions of conventional maintenance gear are used.<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\nUnlike [[highways]] or [[road network]]s where capacity is disaggregated into unlinked trips over individual route segments, railway capacity is fundamentally considered a network system. As a result, many components are causes and effects of system disruptions. Maintenance must acknowledge the vast array of a route's performance (type of train service, origination/destination, seasonal impacts), line's capacity (length, terrain, number of tracks, types of train control), trains throughput (max speeds, acceleration/deceleration rates), and service features with shared passenger-freight tracks (sidings, terminal capacities, switching routes, and design type).<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\n==Social, economical, and energetic aspects==\n\n===Energy===\n[[File:BNSF 5350 20040808 Prairie du Chien WI.jpg|thumb|[[BNSF Railway]] freight service in the United States|alt=Orange locomotive hauling freight]]\n[[File:DeutscheBahn gobeirne.jpg|thumb|German [[InterCityExpress]] (ICE)|alt=Sleek white passenger train at a station]]\nRail transport is an [[energy efficiency in transport|energy-efficient]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/news/article.asp?id=16740 |title=Railroad Fuel Efficiency Sets New Record |author=American Association of Railroads |accessdate=12 April 2009}}</ref> but [[capital intensive|capital-intensive]] means of mechanized land transport. The tracks provide smooth and hard surfaces on which the wheels of the train can roll with a relatively low level of friction being generated. Moving a vehicle on and/or through a medium (land, sea, or air) requires that it overcomes resistance to its motion caused by friction. A land vehicle's total resistance (in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] or [[Newtons]]) is a [[quadratic function]] of the vehicle's speed:\n\n:<math>\\qquad\\qquad R = a + bv + cv^2 </math>\n\nwhere:\n:''R'' denotes total resistance\n:''a'' denotes initial constant resistance\n:''b'' denotes velocity-related constant\n:''c'' denotes constant that is function of shape, frontal area, and sides of vehicle\n:''v'' denotes velocity\n:''v''<sup>2</sup> denotes velocity, squared<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\nEssentially, resistance differs between vehicle's contact point and surface of roadway. Metal wheels on metal rails have a significant advantage of overcoming resistance compared to rubber-tyred wheels on any road surface (railway{{Snd}} 0.001g at {{convert|10|mph}} and 0.024g at {{convert|60|mph}}; truck{{Snd}} 0.009g at {{convert|10|mph}} and 0.090 at {{convert|60|mph}}).

Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/> Most trains take 250\u2013400 trucks off the road, thus making the road more safe.\n\nIn terms of the horsepower to weight ratio, a slow-moving barge requires {{convert|0.2|hp/ST}}, a railway and pipeline requires {{convert|2.5|hp/ST}}, and truck requires {{convert|10|hp/ST}}. However, at higher speeds, a railway overcomes the barge and proves most economical.<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\nAs an example, a typical modern wagon can hold up to {{convert|113|t|ST}} of freight on two four-wheel [[bogie]]s. The track distributes the weight of the train evenly, allowing significantly greater loads per [[axle]] and wheel than in road transport, leading to less wear and tear on the permanent way. This can save energy compared with other forms of transport, such as road transport, which depends on the friction between rubber tyres and the road. Trains have a small frontal area in relation to the load they are carrying, which reduces [[air resistance]] and thus energy usage.\n\nIn addition, the presence of track guiding the wheels allows for very long trains to be pulled by one or a few engines and driven by a single operator, even around curves, which allows for [[economies of scale]] in both manpower and energy use; by contrast, in road transport, more than two [[Articulated vehicle|articulations]] causes [[fishtailing]] and makes the vehicle unsafe.\n\n====Energy efficiency====\n{{main|Energy efficiency in transportation#Trains}}\nConsidering only the energy spent to move the means of transport, and using the example of the urban area of [[Lisbon]], electric trains seem to be on average 20 times more efficient than automobiles for transportation of passengers, if we consider energy spent per passenger-distance with similar occupation ratios.<ref>{{cite web|author=Publicada por Jo\u00e3o Pimentel Ferreira |url=http://www.veraveritas.eu/2013/02/carro-ou-comboio.html |title=Carro ou comboio? |publisher=Veraveritas.eu |accessdate=2015-01-03}}</ref> Considering an automobile with a consumption of around {{convert|6|l/100 km|abbr=on}} of fuel, the average car in Europe has an occupancy of around 1.2 passengers per automobile (occupation ratio around 24%) and that [[Fuel efficiency|one litre of fuel]] amounts to about {{convert|8.8| kWh|abbr=on}}, equating to an average of {{convert|441| Wh|abbr=on}} per passenger-km.

It is ubiquitous in Europe, with an integrated network covering virtually the whole continent. In India, China, South Korea and Japan, many millions use trains as regular transport. In North America, freight rail transport is widespread and heavily used, but intercity passenger rail transport is relatively scarce outside the [[Northeast Corridor]], due to increased preference of other modes, particularly automobiles and airplanes.<ref name=\"EuDaly, K, et al. 2009.

(1986) The Railway Journey: Industrialization and Perception of Time and Space in the 19th Century. Oxford: Berg.</ref> The process of modernization in the 19th century involved a transition from a spatially oriented world to a time oriented world. Exact time was essential, and everyone had to know what the time was, resulting in clocks towers for railway stations, clocks in public places, pocket watches for railway workers and for travelers.  Trains left on time (they never left early). By contrast, in the premodern era, passenger ships left when the captain had enough passengers. In the premodern era, local time was set at noon, when the sun was at its highest. Every place east to west had a different time and that changed with the introduction of standard time zones. Printed time tables were a convenience for the travelers, but more elaborate time tables, called [[Train order operation|train orders]], were even more essential for the train crews, the maintenance workers, the station personnel, and for the repair and maintenance crews, who knew when to expect a train would come along. Most trackage was single track, with sidings and signals to allow lower priority trains to be sidetracked. Schedules told everyone what to do, where to be, and exactly when. If bad weather disrupted the system, telegraphers relayed immediate corrections and updates throughout the system.  Just as railways as business organizations created the standards and models for modern big business, so too the railway timetable was adapted to myriad uses, such as schedules for buses ferries, and airplanes, for radio and television programs, for school schedules, for factory time clocks. The modern world was ruled by the clock and the timetable.<ref>Tony Judt, ''When the Facts Change: Essays 1995\u20132010'' (2015) pp. 287\u2013288.</ref>\n\n====Model of corporate management====\nAccording to historian [[Henry Adams]] the system of railroads needed:\n:the energies of a generation, for it required all the new machinery to be created{{Snd}} capital, banks, mines, furnaces, shops, power-houses, technical knowledge, mechanical population, together with a steady remodelling of social and political habits, ideas, and institutions to fit the new scale and suit the new conditions.

Railroading became a lifetime career for young men; women were almost never hired. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakemen at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57. White-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.  At each level they had more and more knowledge, experience, and [[human capital]]. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care. Hiring, firing, and wage rates were set not by foremen, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was done by the book, whereby an increasingly complex set of rules dictated to everyone exactly what should be done in every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be. By the 1880s the career railroaders were retiring, and pension systems were invented for them.<ref name=\"Walter Licht 1983 pp 262-63\">{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Licht |title=Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century |url=https://archive.org/details/workingforrailro0000lich |url-access=registration |year=1983 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/workingforrailro0000lich/page/262 262]\u2013263, 289 |publisher=Princeton, N.J. : Princeton University Press }}</ref>\n\n====Transportation====\nRailways contribute to social vibrancy and economic competitiveness by transporting multitudes of customers and workers to [[city centre]]s and [[inner suburbs]].

means of [[transport|transferring passengers and goods]] on wheeled vehicles running on rails, which are located on [[Track (rail transport)|tracks]]. In contrast to [[road transport]], where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles ([[rolling stock]]) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of [[steel]] rails, installed on [[Railroad tie|ties]] (sleepers) set in [[track ballast|ballast]], on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also possible, such as slab track. This is where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface.\n[[File:World railway network.png|thumb|<center>Map of world railway network {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:traveler/World Railways|interactive map]])}}</center>]] \n[[File:JR_tokai_shinkansen_0kei.jpg|thumb|[[0 Series Shinkansen]] is the first [[High-speed rail|high speed train]] of the world.It started operate between [[Tokyo]] and [[Shin-\u014csaka Station|Shin-\u014csaka]] on the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] since 1964.]]\n[[File:KTT_train.jpg|thumb|KTT is a train set used by the [[MTR Corporation Limited]] in [[Hong Kong]] on the [[Guangzhou-Kowloon through train| Guangdong Through Train (KCRC)]] route.

The [[rail transport operations|operation]] is carried out by a [[railway company]], providing transport between [[train station]]s or freight customer facilities. Power is provided by [[locomotive]]s which either draw [[electric power]] from a [[railway electrification system]] or produce their own power, usually by [[diesel engine]]s or, historically, [[steam locomotive|steam]] engines. Most tracks are accompanied by a [[railway signaling|signalling system]]. Railways are a safe land transport system when compared to other forms of transport.<ref group=\"Nb\">According to [{{cite report |url=http://www.railwatch.org.uk/backtrack/rw94/rw094p06.pdf |title=Face the facts on transport safety |author=Norman Bradbury |work=Railwatch |date=November 2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011093930/http://www.railwatch.org.uk/backtrack/rw94/rw094p06.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2010}}], railways are the safest on both a per-mile and per-hour basis, whereas [[Aviation|air transport]] is safe only on a per-mile basis.</ref> Railway transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilization and energy efficiency, but is often less flexible and more [[capital (economics)|capital]]-intensive than road transport, when lower traffic levels are considered.\n\nThe oldest known, man/animal-hauled railways date back to the 6th century BC in [[Corinth]], [[Greece]]. Rail transport then commenced in mid 16th century in [[Germany]] in the form of horse-powered [[funicular]]s and [[wagonway]]s. Modern rail transport commenced with the British development of the [[steam locomotive]]s in the early 19th century. Thus the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railway system in Great Britain]] is the oldest in the world. Built by [[George Stephenson]] and his son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]]'s company [[Robert Stephenson and Company]], the [[Locomotion No. 1|''Locomotion'' No. 1]] is the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line, the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825. George Stephenson also built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use only the steam locomotives all the time, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] which [[Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opened in 1830]]. With steam engines, one could construct mainline railways, which were a key component of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Also, railways reduced the costs of [[shipping]], and allowed for fewer lost goods, compared with water transport, which faced occasional sinking of ships. The change from [[canals]] to railways allowed for \"national markets\" in which prices varied very little from city to city. The spread of the railway network and the use of railway timetables, led to the standardisation of time (railway time) in Britain based on Greenwich Mean Time. Prior to this, major towns and cities varied their local time relative to GMT. The invention and development of the railway in the United Kingdom was one of the most important technological inventions of the 19th century. The world's first underground railway, the [[Metropolitan Railway]] (part of the [[London Underground]]), opened in 1863.\n\nIn the 1880s, [[railway electrification system|electrified]] trains were introduced, leading to electrification of tramways and rapid transit systems. Starting during the 1940s, the non-electrified railways in most countries had their steam locomotives replaced by [[diesel fuel|diesel]]-electric locomotives, with the process being almost complete by the 2000s. During the 1960s, electrified [[high-speed rail|high-speed railway systems]] were introduced in [[Japan]] and later in some other countries. Many countries are in the process of replacing diesel locomotives with electric locomotives, mainly due to environmental concerns, a notable example being [[Switzerland]], which has completely electrified its network. Other forms of guided ground transport outside the traditional railway definitions, such as [[monorail]] or [[maglev]], have been tried but have seen limited use.\n\nFollowing a decline after [[World War II]] due to competition from cars and airplanes, rail transport has had a revival in recent decades due to road congestion and rising fuel prices, as well as governments [[rail subsidies|investing in rail]] as a means of reducing [[CO2 emissions|CO<sub>2</sub> emissions]] in the context of concerns about [[global warming]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of rail transport}}\nThe history of rail transport began in the 6th century BC in [[Ancient Greece]].

In 1790, Jessop and his partner Outram began to manufacture edge-rails. Jessop became a partner in the Butterley Company in 1790. The first public edgeway (thus also first public railway) built was [[Lake Lock Rail Road]] in 1796. Although the primary purpose of the line was to carry coal, it also carried passengers.\n\nThese two systems of constructing iron railways, the \"L\" plate-rail and the smooth edge-rail, continued to exist side by side until well into the early 19th century. The flanged wheel and edge-rail eventually proved its superiority and became the standard for railways.\n\nCast iron used in rails proved unsatisfactory because it was brittle and broke under heavy loads. The [[wrought iron]] invented by [[John Birkinshaw]] in 1820 replaced cast iron. [[Wrought iron]] (usually simply referred to as \"iron\") was a ductile material that could undergo considerable deformation before breaking, making it more suitable for iron rails. But iron was expensive to produce until [[Henry Cort]] patented the [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] in 1784. In 1783 Cort also patented the [[rolling (metalworking)|rolling process]], which was 15 times faster at consolidating and shaping iron than hammering.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present|last=Landes|first= David.

The softness and dross tended to make iron rails distort and delaminate and they lasted less than 10 years. Sometimes they lasted as little as one year under high traffic. All these developments in the production of iron eventually led to replacement of composite wood/iron rails with superior all iron rails.\n\nThe introduction of the [[Bessemer process]], enabling steel to be made inexpensively, led to the era of great expansion of railways that began in the late 1860s.

This was a large [[stationary engine]], powering cotton mills and a variety of machinery; the state of boiler technology necessitated the use of low pressure steam acting upon a vacuum in the cylinder, which required a separate [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] and an [[air pump]]. Nevertheless, as the construction of boilers improved, Watt investigated the use of high-pressure steam acting directly upon a piston, raising the possibility of a smaller engine that might be used to power a vehicle.

U.S. Patent No. 1,154,785, filed 8 April 1914, and issued 28 September 1915. ''Accessed via Google Patent Search at: [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT1154785&id=UhpBAAAAEBAJ&dq=1154785 US Patent #1,154,785] on 8 February 2007.''</ref> Lemp's design used a single lever to control both engine and generator in a coordinated fashion, and was the [[prototype]] for all [[diesel\u2013electric locomotive]] control systems. In 1914, world's first functional diesel\u2013electric railcars were produced for the ''K\u00f6niglich-S\u00e4chsische Staatseisenbahnen'' ([[Royal Saxon State Railways]]) by [[Waggonfabrik Rastatt]] with electric equipment from [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] and diesel engines from [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer AG]]. They were classified as [[Saxon DET 1-2|DET 1 and DET 2]] ([[:de:S\u00e4chsischer DET 1\u20132|de.wiki]]). The first regular use of diesel\u2013electric locomotives was in [[Switcher|switching]] (shunter) applications. General Electric produced several small switching locomotives in the 1930s (the famous \"[[44-tonner]]\" switcher was introduced in 1940) Westinghouse Electric and Baldwin collaborated to build switching locomotives starting in 1929.\n\nIn 1929, the [[Canadian National Railways]] became the first North American railway to use diesels in mainline service with two units, 9000 and 9001, from Westinghouse.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=409}}\n\n=== High-speed rail ===\n{{main|High-speed rail}}\nAlthough steam and diesel services reaching speeds up to 200&nbsp;km/h were started before the 1960s in Europe, they were not very successful{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}.\n\n[[File:Shinkansen type 0 Hikari 19890506a.jpg|thumb|0-Series [[Shinkansen]], introduced in 1964, triggered the intercity train travel boom.]]\nThe first electrified [[high-speed rail]] [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] was introduced in 1964 between [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]] in Japan. Since then [[high-speed rail]] transport, functioning at speeds up to and above 300&nbsp;km/h, has been built in Japan, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, the People's Republic of China, Taiwan (Republic of China), the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Korea]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]. The construction of many of these lines has resulted in the dramatic decline of short haul flights and automotive traffic between connected cities, such as the London\u2013Paris\u2013Brussels corridor, Madrid\u2013Barcelona, Milan\u2013Rome\u2013Naples, as well as many other major lines.{{Citation needed|reason=\nIf this is correct, it's a strong argument in favor of building more high speed rail lines. It would help to have quantitative estimates of the magnitude of this effect including as a function of distance with credible sources for those estimates. For example, could similar effects be obtained from high speed rail between San Francisco and Los Angeles, where the distances are 60 percent more than between [[London]], [[Paris]] and Brussels?|date=December 2013}}\n\nHigh-speed trains normally operate on [[standard gauge]] tracks of [[continuously welded rail]] on [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] that incorporates a large [[Minimum railway curve radius|turning radius]] in its design. While high-speed rail is most often designed for passenger travel, some high-speed systems also offer freight service.\n\n==Trains==\n{{Main|Train}}\nA train is a connected series of rail vehicles that move along the track. Propulsion for the train is provided by a separate locomotive or from individual motors in self-propelled multiple units. Most trains carry a revenue load, although non-revenue cars exist for the railway's own use, such as for [[maintenance-of-way]] purposes. The [[railroad engineer|engine driver]] (engineer in North America) controls the locomotive or other power cars, although [[people mover]]s and some rapid transits are under automatic control.\n\n===Haulage===\n[[File:2TE10U Russian Locomotive.jpg|thumb|Russian 2TE10U Diesel-electric locomotive]]\nTraditionally, trains are pulled using a locomotive. This involves one or more powered vehicles being located at the front of the train, providing sufficient [[tractive force]] to haul the weight of the full train. This arrangement remains dominant for freight trains and is often used for passenger trains. A [[push\u2013pull train]] has the end passenger car equipped with a driver's cab so that the engine driver can remotely control the locomotive. This allows one of the locomotive-hauled train's drawbacks to be removed, since the locomotive need not be moved to the front of the train each time the train changes direction. A [[railroad car]] is a vehicle used for the haulage of either passengers or freight.\n\nA multiple unit has powered wheels throughout the whole train. These are used for rapid transit and tram systems, as well as many both short- and long-haul passenger trains. A [[railcar]] is a single, self-powered car, and may be electrically-propelled or powered by a [[diesel engine]]. Multiple units have a driver's cab at each end of the unit, and were developed following the ability to build [[electric motor]]s and [[engine (motor)|engines]] small enough to fit under the coach. There are only a few freight multiple units, most of which are high-speed post trains.\n\n===Motive power===\n[[File:H\u017d 7123 series DMU (06).JPG|thumb|A [[RegioSwinger]] multiple unit of the [[Croatian Railways]]]]\n[[Steam locomotive]]s are locomotives with a [[steam engine]] that provides adhesion. [[Coal]], [[petroleum]], or [[wood]] is burned in a [[firebox (steam engine)|firebox]], boiling water in the [[fire-tube boiler|boiler]] to create pressurized steam. The steam travels through the [[smokebox]] before leaving via the chimney or smoke stack. In the process, it powers a [[piston]] that transmits power directly through a [[connecting rod]] (US: main rod) and a [[crankpin]] (US: wristpin) on the [[driving wheel]] (US main driver) or to a [[crankshaft|crank]] on a driving axle. Steam locomotives have been phased out in most parts of the world for economical and safety reasons, although many are preserved in working order by [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n[[Electric locomotive]]s draw power from a stationary source via an [[Overhead lines|overhead wire]] or [[third rail]]. Some also or instead use a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. In locomotives that are powered by high voltage [[alternating current]], a [[transformer]] in the locomotive converts the high voltage, low current power to low voltage, high current used in the [[electric motor|traction motors]] that power the wheels. Modern locomotives may use [[Electric motor#Three-phase AC induction motors|three-phase AC induction motors]] or [[direct current]] motors. Under certain conditions, electric locomotives are the most powerful traction.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} They are also the cheapest to run and provide less noise and no local air pollution.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} However, they require high capital investments both for the [[overhead lines]] and the supporting infrastructure, as well as the generating station that is needed to produce electricity. Accordingly, electric traction is used on urban systems, lines with high traffic and for high-speed rail.\n\n[[Diesel locomotive]]s use a diesel engine as the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]. The energy transmission may be either [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]], diesel-mechanical or diesel-hydraulic but diesel-electric is dominant. [[Electro-diesel locomotive]]s are built to run as diesel-electric on unelectrified sections and as electric locomotives on electrified sections.\n\nAlternative methods of motive power include [[maglev (transport)|magnetic levitation]], horse-drawn, [[funicular|cable]], gravity, [[pneumatics]] and [[gas turbine]].\n\n===Passenger trains===\n[[File:InterCity2 - passenger car interior.jpg|thumb|Interior view of the top deck of a [[VR Group|VR]] InterCity2 [[Bilevel rail car|double-deck carriage]]]]A passenger train travels between stations where passengers may embark and disembark. The oversight of the train is the duty of a [[conductor (transportation)|guard/train manager/conductor]]. Passenger trains are part of public transport and often make up the stem of the service, with buses feeding to stations. Passenger trains provide long-distance intercity travel, daily commuter trips, or local urban transit services. They even include a diversity of vehicles, operating speeds, right-of-way requirements, and service frequency. Passenger trains usually can be divided into two operations: intercity railway and intracity transit. Whereas intercity railway involve higher speeds, longer routes, and lower frequency (usually scheduled), intracity transit involves lower speeds, shorter routes, and higher frequency (especially during peak hours).<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003.

Trains typically have amenities such as a [[dining car]]. Some lines also provide over-night services with [[sleeping car]]s. Some long-haul trains have been given a [[lists of named passenger trains|specific name]]. [[Regional rail|Regional trains]] are medium distance trains that connect cities with outlying, surrounding areas, or provide a regional service, making more stops and having lower speeds. [[Commuter rail|Commuter trains]] serve suburbs of urban areas, providing a daily [[commuting]] service. [[Airport rail link]]s provide quick access from city centres to [[airport]]s.\n\n[[High-speed rail]] are special inter-city trains that operate at much higher speeds than conventional railways, the limit being regarded at {{convert|200|to|320|km/h}}. High-speed trains are used mostly for long-haul service and most systems are in Western Europe and East Asia. The [[land speed record for railed vehicles|speed record]] is {{convert|574.8|km/h|abbr=on}}, set by a modified French [[TGV]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/03/TGVspeedrecord.ap/index.html| title=French train breaks speed record| date=4 April 2007| accessdate=3 April 2007| agency=Associated Press| work=CNN|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407194558/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/03/TGVspeedrecord.ap/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 April 2007| authorlink= Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aW23Aw20niIo&refer=europe| title=French TGV Sets Record, Reaching 357 Miles an Hour (Update2)|author1=Fouquet, Helene  |author2=Viscousi, Gregory |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher=Bloomberg L.P.| date=3 April 2007 | accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref> [[Maglev (transport)|Magnetic levitation]] trains such as the Shanghai airport train use under-riding magnets which attract themselves upward towards the underside of a guideway and this line has achieved somewhat higher peak speeds in day-to-day operation than conventional high-speed railways, although only over short distances. Due to their heightened speeds, route alignments for high-speed rail tend to have shallower grades and broader curves than conventional railways.\n\nTheir high kinetic energy translates to higher horsepower-to-ton ratios (e.g. {{convert|20|hp/ST|disp=or}}); this allows trains to accelerate and maintain higher speeds and negotiate steep grades as momentum builds up and recovered in downgrades (reducing cut, fill, and tunnelling requirements). Since lateral forces act on curves, curvatures are designed with the highest possible radius. All these features are dramatically different from freight operations, thus justifying exclusive high-speed rail lines if it is economically feasible.<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\n[[Higher-speed rail]] services are intercity rail services that have top speeds higher than conventional intercity trains but the speeds are not as high as those in the high-speed rail services. These services are provided after improvements to the conventional rail infrastructure in order to support trains that can operate safely at higher speeds.\n[[File:SEPTA Silverliner II.jpg|alt=|thumb|301x301px|SEPTA Regional Railroad Train]]\n[[Rapid transit]] is an intracity system built in large cities and has the highest capacity of any passenger transport system. It is usually grade-separated and commonly built underground or elevated. At street level, smaller [[tram]]s can be used. [[Light rail]]s are upgraded trams that have step-free access, their own right-of-way and sometimes sections underground. [[Monorail]] systems are elevated, medium-capacity systems. A [[people mover]] is a driverless, grade-separated train that serves only a few stations, as a shuttle. Due to the lack of uniformity of rapid transit systems, route alignment varies, with diverse rights-of-way (private land, side of road, street median) and [[track geometry|geometric characteristics]] (sharp or broad curves, steep or gentle grades). For instance, the [[Chicago 'L']] trains are designed with extremely short cars to negotiate the sharp curves in the [[The Loop (CTA)|Loop]]. New Jersey's [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] has similar-sized cars to accommodate curves in the trans-Hudson tunnels. San Francisco's [[BART]] operates large cars on its routes.<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\n===Freight train===\n{{main|Rail freight transport}}\n[[File:Wagons 550.jpg|thumb|Bulk cargo of minerals]]\n\nA freight train hauls [[cargo]] using [[goods wagon|freight cars]] specialized for the type of goods. Freight trains are very efficient, with economy of scale and high energy efficiency. However, their use can be reduced by lack of flexibility, if there is need of transshipment at both ends of the trip due to lack of tracks to the points of pick-up and delivery. Authorities often encourage the use of cargo rail transport due to its fame.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/environmental-issues/| title=Environmental Issues| publisher=The Environmental Blog| date=3 April 2007| accessdate=10 October 2010| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111153436/http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/environmental-issues/| archivedate=11 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Containerization|Container trains]] have become the beta type in the US for bulk haulage. Containers can easily be transshipped to other modes, such as ships and trucks, using cranes. This has succeeded the [[boxcar]] (wagon-load), where the cargo had to be loaded and unloaded into the train manually. The intermodal [[containerization]] of cargo has revolutionized the [[supply chain]] [[logistics]] industry, reducing ship costs significantly. In Europe, the [[Goods van#Sliding wall wagons|sliding wall wagon]] has largely superseded the [[Goods van|ordinary covered wagons]]. Other types of cars include [[refrigerator car]]s, [[stock car (rail)|stock cars]] for livestock and [[autorack]]s for road vehicles. When rail is combined with road transport, a [[roadrailer]] will allow [[semi-trailer|trailers]] to be driven onto the train, allowing for easy transition between road and rail.\n\n[[Bulk material handling|Bulk handling]] represents a key advantage for rail transport. Low or even zero transshipment costs combined with energy efficiency and low inventory costs allow trains to handle [[bulk cargo|bulk]] much cheaper than by road. Typical bulk cargo includes coal, ore, grains and liquids. Bulk is transported in [[gondola (rail)|open-topped cars]], [[hopper car]]s and [[tank car]]s.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    = Left: Railway turnouts; Right: [[Chicago Transit Authority]] [[control tower]] 18 guides elevated [[Chicago 'L']] north and southbound [[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple]] and [[Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Brown]] lines intersecting with east and westbound [[Pink Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Pink]] and [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green]] lines and the looping [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange line]] above the [[Wells Street (Chicago)|Wells]] and [[Lake Street (Chicago)|Lake street]] [[intersection (road)|intersection]] in the [[Loop (CTA)|loop]] at an elevated right of way.\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = P\u00f6\u00f6rangud Tartu raudteejaamas.jpg\n | width1    = 177\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  =\n | image2    = CTA loop junction.jpg\n | width2    = 200\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n}}\n\n===Right of way===\nRailway tracks are laid upon land owned or leased by the railway company. Owing to the desirability of maintaining modest grades, rails will often be laid in circuitous routes in hilly or mountainous terrain. Route length and grade requirements can be reduced by the use of alternating [[cutting (transportation)|cuttings]], bridges and tunnels&nbsp;\u2013 all of which can greatly increase the capital expenditures required to develop a right of way, while significantly reducing operating costs and allowing higher speeds on longer radius curves. In densely urbanized areas, railways are sometimes laid in tunnels to minimize the effects on existing properties.\n\n===Track===\n{{main|Track (rail transport)|l1=Track}}\n[[File:European railway map.jpg|thumb|Map of railways in Europe with main operational lines shown in black, [[heritage railway]] lines in green and former routes in light blue]]\n[[File:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|thumb|Long freight train crossing the Stoney Creek viaduct on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in southern [[British Columbia]]]]\n\nTrack consists of two parallel steel rails, anchored [[perpendicular]] to members called [[railroad tie|ties]] (sleepers) of timber, concrete, steel, or plastic to maintain a consistent distance apart, or [[rail gauge]]. Rail gauges are usually categorized as [[standard gauge]] (used on approximately 55% of the world's existing railway lines), [[broad gauge]], and [[narrow gauge]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In addition to the rail gauge, the tracks will be laid to conform with a [[Loading gauge]] which defines the maximum height and width for railway vehicles and their loads to ensure safe passage through bridges, tunnels and other structures.\n\nThe track guides the conical, flanged wheels, keeping the cars on the track without active steering and therefore allowing trains to be much longer than road vehicles. The rails and ties are usually placed on a foundation made of compressed earth on top of which is placed a bed of [[track ballast|ballast]] to distribute the load from the ties and to prevent the track from [[buckling]] as the ground settles over time under the weight of the vehicles passing above.\n\nThe ballast also serves as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is attached by [[direct fixation]] without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By [[Thermite welding|welding]] rails together to form lengths of [[continuous welded rail]], additional wear and tear on rolling stock caused by the small surface gap at the joints between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for a quieter ride.\n\nOn curves the outer rail may be at a higher level than the inner rail. This is called superelevation or [[cant (road/rail)|cant]]. This reduces the forces tending to displace the track and makes for a more comfortable ride for standing livestock and standing or seated passengers. A given amount of superelevation is most effective over a limited range of speeds.\n\n[[Railroad switch|Turnouts]], also known as points and switches, are the means of directing a train onto a diverging section of track. Laid similar to normal track, a point typically consists of a [[Switch frog|frog]] (common crossing), check rails and two switch rails. The switch rails may be moved left or right, under the control of the signalling system, to determine which path the train will follow.\n\nSpikes in wooden ties can loosen over time, but split and rotten ties may be individually replaced with new wooden ties or concrete substitutes. Concrete ties can also develop cracks or splits, and can also be replaced individually. Should the rails settle due to soil subsidence, they can be lifted by specialized machinery and additional ballast tamped under the ties to level the rails.\n\nPeriodically, ballast must be removed and replaced with clean ballast to ensure adequate drainage. Culverts and other passages for water must be kept clear lest water is impounded by the trackbed, causing landslips. Where trackbeds are placed along rivers, additional protection is usually placed to prevent streambank erosion during times of high water. Bridges require inspection and maintenance, since they are subject to large surges of stress in a short period of time when a heavy train crosses.\n\n===Train inspection systems===\n[[File:HBD DD1.jpg|thumb|A [[Defect detector#Sensors|Hot bearing detector]] with dragging equipment unit]]The inspection of railway equipment is essential for the safe movement of trains. Many types of [[defect detector]]s are in use on the world's railroads. These devices utilize technologies that vary from a simplistic paddle and switch to [[infrared]] and laser scanning, and even [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasonic audio analysis]]. Their use has avoided many rail accidents over the 70 years they have been used.\n\n===Signalling===\n[[File:LeicesterAndSwannington02A.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bardon Hill]] box in [[England]] is a [[Midland Railway]] box dating from 1899, although the original mechanical lever frame has been replaced by electrical switches. Seen here in 2009.]]\n{{Main|Railway signalling}}\n[[Railway signalling]] is a system used to control railway traffic safely to prevent trains from colliding. Being guided by fixed [[Track (rail transport)|rails]] which generate low friction, trains are uniquely susceptible to collision since they frequently operate at speeds that do not enable them to stop quickly or within the driver's sighting distance; road vehicles, which encounter a higher level of friction between their rubber tyres and the road surface, have much shorter braking distances. Most forms of train control involve movement authority being passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network to the train crew. Not all methods require the use of signals, and some systems are specific to [[single track (rail)|single track]] railways.\n\nThe signalling process is traditionally carried out in a [[signal box]], a small building that houses the [[lever frame]] required for the signalman to operate switches and signal equipment. These are placed at various intervals along the route of a railway, controlling specified sections of track. More recent technological developments have made such operational doctrine superfluous, with the centralization of signalling operations to regional control rooms. This has been facilitated by the increased use of computers, allowing vast sections of track to be monitored from a single location. The common method of [[Railway signalling#Blocks|block signalling]] divides the track into zones guarded by combinations of block signals, operating rules, and automatic-control devices so that only one train may be in a block at any time.\n\n===Electrification===\n{{Main|Railway electrification system}}\nThe electrification system provides electrical energy to the trains, so they can operate without a prime mover on board. This allows lower operating costs, but requires large capital investments along the lines. Mainline and tram systems normally have overhead wires, which hang from poles along the line. Grade-separated rapid transit sometimes use a ground [[third rail]].\n\nPower may be fed as [[direct current|direct]] (DC) or [[alternating current]] (AC). The most common DC voltages are 600 and 750&nbsp;V for tram and rapid transit systems, and 1,500&nbsp;and 3,000&nbsp;V for mainlines. The two dominant AC systems are [[15 kV AC railway electrification|15&nbsp;kV]] and [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25&nbsp;kV]].\n\n===Stations===\n[[File:Rang gueter bahnhof small.jpg|thumb|right|Goods station in [[Lucerne]], Switzerland]]\n{{Main|Train station}}\n\nA [[railway station]] serves as an area where passengers can board and alight from trains. A [[goods station]] is a yard which is exclusively used for loading and unloading cargo. Large passenger stations have at least one building providing conveniences for passengers, such as purchasing tickets and food. Smaller stations typically only consist of a [[railway platform|platform]]. Early stations were sometimes built with both passenger and goods facilities.<ref>{{cite journal| title=The Inception of the English Railway Station| journal=[[Architectural History (journal)|Architectural History]]| volume=4| year=1961| pages=63\u201376| doi=10.2307/1568245| jstor=1568245}}</ref>\n\nPlatforms are used to allow easy access to the trains, and are connected to each other via [[underpass]]es, [[footbridge]]s and level crossings. Some large stations are built as [[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]], with trains only operating out from one direction. Smaller stations normally serve local residential areas, and may have connection to feeder bus services. Large stations, in particular [[central station]]s, serve as the main [[transport hub|public transport hub]] for the city, and have transfer available between rail services, and to rapid transit, tram or bus services.\n\n==Operations==\n\n===Ownership===\n[[File:UP 6670.jpg|thumb|In the United States, railroads such as the [[Union Pacific]] traditionally own and operate both their rolling stock and infrastructure, with the company itself typically being privately owned.]]\n\nSince the 1980s, there has been an increasing trend to split up railway companies, with companies owning the rolling stock separated from those owning the infrastructure. This is particularly true in Europe, where this arrangement is required by the European Union. This has allowed open access by any train operator to any portion of the European railway network. In the UK, the railway track is state owned, with a public controlled body ([[Network Rail]]) running, maintaining and developing the track, while Train Operating Companies have run the trains since [[privatisation of British Rail|privatization in the 1990s]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.networkrail.co.uk/about-us/|title = About Us|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141009231027/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/about-us/|archive-date = 9 October 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the U.S., virtually all rail networks and infrastructure outside the [[Northeast corridor|Northeast Corridor]] are privately owned by freight lines. Passenger lines, primarily [[Amtrak]], operate as tenants on the freight lines. Consequently, operations must be closely synchronized and coordinated between freight and passenger railroads, with passenger trains often being dispatched by the host freight railroad. Due to this shared system, both are regulated by the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) and may follow the [[American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association|AREMA]] recommended practices for track work and [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] standards for vehicles.<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\n===Financing===\nThe main source of income for railway companies is from [[train ticket|ticket]] revenue (for passenger transport) and shipment fees for cargo. Discounts and monthly passes are sometimes available for frequent travellers (e.g. [[season ticket]] and [[rail pass]]). Freight revenue may be sold per container slot or for a whole train. Sometimes, the shipper owns the cars and only rents the haulage. For passenger transport, [[advertisement]] income can be significant.\n\nGovernments may choose to give subsidies to rail operation, since rail transport has fewer [[externalities]] than other dominant modes of transport. If the railway company is state-owned, the state may simply provide direct subsidies in exchange for increased production. If operations have been privatized, several options are available. Some countries have a system where the infrastructure is owned by a government agency or company&nbsp;\u2013 with open access to the tracks for any company that meets safety requirements. In such cases, the state may choose to provide the tracks free of charge, or for a fee that does not cover all costs. This is seen as analogous to the government providing free access to roads. For passenger operations, a direct subsidy may be paid to a public-owned operator, or [[public service obligation]] tender may be helt, and a time-limited contract awarded to the lowest bidder. [[Rail transport in Europe#Subsidies|Total EU rail subsidies]] amounted to \u20ac73 billion in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/technical_report_2007_3/download |title=EU Technical Report 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Amtrak]], the US passenger rail service, and Canada's [[Via Rail]] are private railroad companies chartered by their respective national governments. As private passenger services declined because of competition from automobiles and airlines, they became [[shareholder]]s of Amtrak either with a cash entrance fee or relinquishing their locomotives and rolling stock.

Possible accidents include [[derailment]] (jumping the track), a collision with another train or collision with automobiles, other vehicles or pedestrians at [[level crossing]]s. The last accounts for the majority of rail accidents and casualties. The most important safety measures to prevent accidents are strict operating rules, e.g. [[railway signalling]] and gates or [[grade separation]] at crossings. [[Train whistle]]s, bells or [[train horn|horns]] warn of the presence of a train, while trackside signals maintain the distances between trains.\n\nAn important element in the safety of many high-speed inter-city networks such as Japan's [[Shinkansen]] is the fact that trains only run on dedicated railway lines, without level crossings. This effectively eliminates the potential for collision with automobiles, other vehicles or pedestrians, vastly reduces the likelihood of collision with other trains and helps ensure services remain timely.\n\n===Maintenance===\nAs in any [[infrastructure]] asset, railways must keep up with periodic inspection and maintenance in order to minimize effect of infrastructure failures that can disrupt freight revenue operations and passenger services. Because passengers are considered the most ''crucial cargo'' and usually operate at higher speeds, steeper grades, and higher capacity/frequency, their lines are especially important. Inspection practices include [[track geometry car]]s or walking inspection. Curve maintenance especially for transit services includes gauging, fastener tightening, and rail replacement.\n\nRail corrugation is a common issue with transit systems due to the high number of light-axle, wheel passages which result in grinding of the wheel/rail interface. Since maintenance may overlap with operations, maintenance windows (nighttime hours, [[off-peak]] hours, altering train schedules or routes) must be closely followed. In addition, passenger safety during maintenance work (inter-track fencing, proper storage of materials, track work notices, hazards of equipment near states) must be regarded at all times. At times, maintenance access problems can emerge due to tunnels, elevated structures, and congested cityscapes. Here, specialized equipment or smaller versions of conventional maintenance gear are used.<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\nUnlike [[highways]] or [[road network]]s where capacity is disaggregated into unlinked trips over individual route segments, railway capacity is fundamentally considered a network system. As a result, many components are causes and effects of system disruptions. Maintenance must acknowledge the vast array of a route's performance (type of train service, origination/destination, seasonal impacts), line's capacity (length, terrain, number of tracks, types of train control), trains throughput (max speeds, acceleration/deceleration rates), and service features with shared passenger-freight tracks (sidings, terminal capacities, switching routes, and design type).<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003.

The tracks provide smooth and hard surfaces on which the wheels of the train can roll with a relatively low level of friction being generated. Moving a vehicle on and/or through a medium (land, sea, or air) requires that it overcomes resistance to its motion caused by friction. A land vehicle's total resistance (in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] or [[Newtons]]) is a [[quadratic function]] of the vehicle's speed:\n\n:<math>\\qquad\\qquad R = a + bv + cv^2 </math>\n\nwhere:\n:''R'' denotes total resistance\n:''a'' denotes initial constant resistance\n:''b'' denotes velocity-related constant\n:''c'' denotes constant that is function of shape, frontal area, and sides of vehicle\n:''v'' denotes velocity\n:''v''<sup>2</sup> denotes velocity, squared<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\nEssentially, resistance differs between vehicle's contact point and surface of roadway. Metal wheels on metal rails have a significant advantage of overcoming resistance compared to rubber-tyred wheels on any road surface (railway{{Snd}} 0.001g at {{convert|10|mph}} and 0.024g at {{convert|60|mph}}; truck{{Snd}} 0.009g at {{convert|10|mph}} and 0.090 at {{convert|60|mph}}).

Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/> Most trains take 250\u2013400 trucks off the road, thus making the road more safe.\n\nIn terms of the horsepower to weight ratio, a slow-moving barge requires {{convert|0.2|hp/ST}}, a railway and pipeline requires {{convert|2.5|hp/ST}}, and truck requires {{convert|10|hp/ST}}. However, at higher speeds, a railway overcomes the barge and proves most economical.<ref name=\"AREMA. 2003. Practical Guide to Railway Engineering\"/>\n\nAs an example, a typical modern wagon can hold up to {{convert|113|t|ST}} of freight on two four-wheel [[bogie]]s. The track distributes the weight of the train evenly, allowing significantly greater loads per [[axle]] and wheel than in road transport, leading to less wear and tear on the permanent way. This can save energy compared with other forms of transport, such as road transport, which depends on the friction between rubber tyres and the road. Trains have a small frontal area in relation to the load they are carrying, which reduces [[air resistance]] and thus energy usage.\n\nIn addition, the presence of track guiding the wheels allows for very long trains to be pulled by one or a few engines and driven by a single operator, even around curves, which allows for [[economies of scale]] in both manpower and energy use; by contrast, in road transport, more than two [[Articulated vehicle|articulations]] causes [[fishtailing]] and makes the vehicle unsafe.\n\n====Energy efficiency====\n{{main|Energy efficiency in transportation#Trains}}\nConsidering only the energy spent to move the means of transport, and using the example of the urban area of [[Lisbon]], electric trains seem to be on average 20 times more efficient than automobiles for transportation of passengers, if we consider energy spent per passenger-distance with similar occupation ratios.<ref>{{cite web|author=Publicada por Jo\u00e3o Pimentel Ferreira |url=http://www.veraveritas.eu/2013/02/carro-ou-comboio.html |title=Carro ou comboio? |publisher=Veraveritas.eu |accessdate=2015-01-03}}</ref> Considering an automobile with a consumption of around {{convert|6|l/100 km|abbr=on}} of fuel, the average car in Europe has an occupancy of around 1.2 passengers per automobile (occupation ratio around 24%) and that [[Fuel efficiency|one litre of fuel]] amounts to about {{convert|8.8| kWh|abbr=on}}, equating to an average of {{convert|441| Wh|abbr=on}} per passenger-km. This compares to a modern train with an average occupancy of 20% and a consumption of about {{convert|8.5| kWh/km|abbr=on}}, equating to {{convert|21.5| Wh|abbr=on}} per passenger-km, 20 times less than the automobile.\n\n===Usage===\nDue to these benefits, rail transport is a major form of passenger and freight transport in many countries. It is ubiquitous in Europe, with an integrated network covering virtually the whole continent. In India, China, South Korea and Japan, many millions use trains as regular transport. In North America, freight rail transport is widespread and heavily used, but intercity passenger rail transport is relatively scarce outside the [[Northeast Corridor]], due to increased preference of other modes, particularly automobiles and airplanes.<ref name=\"EuDaly, K, et al. 2009.

(1986) The Railway Journey: Industrialization and Perception of Time and Space in the 19th Century. Oxford: Berg.</ref> The process of modernization in the 19th century involved a transition from a spatially oriented world to a time oriented world. Exact time was essential, and everyone had to know what the time was, resulting in clocks towers for railway stations, clocks in public places, pocket watches for railway workers and for travelers.  Trains left on time (they never left early). By contrast, in the premodern era, passenger ships left when the captain had enough passengers. In the premodern era, local time was set at noon, when the sun was at its highest. Every place east to west had a different time and that changed with the introduction of standard time zones. Printed time tables were a convenience for the travelers, but more elaborate time tables, called [[Train order operation|train orders]], were even more essential for the train crews, the maintenance workers, the station personnel, and for the repair and maintenance crews, who knew when to expect a train would come along. Most trackage was single track, with sidings and signals to allow lower priority trains to be sidetracked. Schedules told everyone what to do, where to be, and exactly when. If bad weather disrupted the system, telegraphers relayed immediate corrections and updates throughout the system.  Just as railways as business organizations created the standards and models for modern big business, so too the railway timetable was adapted to myriad uses, such as schedules for buses ferries, and airplanes, for radio and television programs, for school schedules, for factory time clocks. The modern world was ruled by the clock and the timetable.<ref>Tony Judt, ''When the Facts Change: Essays 1995\u20132010'' (2015) pp. 287\u2013288.</ref>\n\n====Model of corporate management====\nAccording to historian [[Henry Adams]] the system of railroads needed:\n:the energies of a generation, for it required all the new machinery to be created{{Snd}} capital, banks, mines, furnaces, shops, power-houses, technical knowledge, mechanical population, together with a steady remodelling of social and political habits, ideas, and institutions to fit the new scale and suit the new conditions. The generation between 1865 and 1895 was already mortgaged to the railways, and no one knew it better than the generation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Henry |chapter-url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/hadams/eha16.html |title=The Education of Henry Adams |year=1918 |page=240 |chapter=The Press (1868) |accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref>\nThe impact can be examined through five aspects: shipping, finance, management, careers, and popular reaction.\n\n=====Shipping freight and passengers=====\nFirst they provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers across a large national market. The result was a transforming impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture, and finance. The United States now had an integrated national market practically the size of Europe, with no internal barriers or tariffs, all supported by a common language, and financial system and a common legal system.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2113700|title = Railroads as an Economic Force in American Development|journal = The Journal of Economic History|volume = 4|issue = 1|pages = 1\u201320|last1 = Jenks|first1 = Leland H.|year = 1944|doi = 10.1017/S002205070008400X}}</ref>\n\n=====Basis of the private financial system=====\nRailroads financing provided the basis for a dramatic expansion of the private (non-governmental) financial system. Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories. In 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion).<ref>Edward C.

Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading American innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.<ref>Alfred D.

Railroading became a lifetime career for young men; women were almost never hired. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakemen at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57. White-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.  At each level they had more and more knowledge, experience, and [[human capital]]. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care. Hiring, firing, and wage rates were set not by foremen, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was done by the book, whereby an increasingly complex set of rules dictated to everyone exactly what should be done in every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be. By the 1880s the career railroaders were retiring, and pension systems were invented for them.<ref name=\"Walter Licht 1983 pp 262-63\">{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Licht |title=Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century |url=https://archive.org/details/workingforrailro0000lich |url-access=registration |year=1983 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/workingforrailro0000lich/page/262 262]\u2013263, 289 |publisher=Princeton, N.J. : Princeton University Press }}</ref>\n\n====Transportation====\nRailways contribute to social vibrancy and economic competitiveness by transporting multitudes of customers and workers to [[city centre]]s and [[inner suburbs]].
