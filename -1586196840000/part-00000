It crosses the counties of [[Hampshire]], [[Surrey]], [[Sussex]] and [[Kent]]. It has three separate parts: the [[sandstone]] \"High Weald\" in the centre; the [[clay]] \"Low Weald\" periphery; and the [[Greensand Ridge]], which stretches around the north and west of the Weald and includes its highest points. The Weald once was covered with forest, and its name, [[Anglo-Saxons|Old English]] in origin, signifies \"woodland\". The term is still used today, as scattered farms and villages sometimes refer to the Weald in their names.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe nameWeald is derived from the [[Old English]] ''{{linktext|weald}}'', meaning \"forest\" (cognate of German ''Wald'', but unrelated to English \"wood\", which has a different origin). This comes from a Germanic root of the same meaning, and ultimately from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]. ''Weald'' is specifically a [[West Sexaon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] form; ''[[The Wolds|wold]]'' is the [[Anglian dialects#Dialects|Anglian]] form of the word.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'', edited by C.{{nbsp}}T. Onions, Oxford, 1966.</ref> The [[Middle English]] form of the word is ''w\u0113ld'', and the modern spelling is a reintroduction of the Old English form attributed to its use by [[William Lambarde]] in his ''A Perambulation of Kent'' of 1576.<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Second edition, 1989</ref>\n\nIn early medieval Britain, the area had the name ''Andredes weald'', meaning \"the forest of Andred\", the latter derived from ''[[Anderida]]'', the Roman name of present-day [[Pevensey]]. The area is also referred to in early English texts as ''Andredesleage'', where the second element, ''leage,'' is another Old English word for \"woodland\", represented by the modern ''{{linktext|leigh}}''.<ref>Eilert Ekwall, ''The Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names'', Oxford, 1936, under \"Weald\" and \"Andred\"</ref>\n\nThe adjective for \"Weald\" is \"wealden\".\n\n==Geology==\n{{see also|Geology of East Sussex|Weald Basin|Weald\u2013Artois anticline}}\n[[File:S East Geology.jpg|thumb|alt=Geological map of Southeast England|Geology of south-eastern England showing the High Weald in yellow-green (9a) and the Low Weald in darker green (9); chalk [[downland]] is in pale green (6)]]\n[[File:KentGeologyWealdenDomeSimple.svg|thumb|alt=Cross-sectional diagram of eroded layers of geological anticline|Geological section from north to south: High and Low Weald shown as one]]\nThe Weald is the eroded remains of a geological structure, an [[anticline]], a dome of layered [[Lower Cretaceous]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s cut through by [[weathering]] to expose the layers as [[sandstone]] ridges and [[clay]] valleys.

The peripheral areas are mostly of softer sandstones and clays and form a gentler rolling landscape, the ''Low Weald''. The [[Weald\u2013Artois Anticline]] continues some {{convert|40|mi}} further south-eastwards under the [[Straits of Dover]], and includes the [[Boulonnais (land area)|Boulonnais]] of [[France]].\n\nMany important fossils have been found in the sandstones and clays of the Weald, including, for example, ''[[Baryonyx]]''. The famous scientific hoax of [[Piltdown Man]] was claimed to have come from a gravel pit at [[Piltdown]] near [[Uckfield]]. The first ''[[Iguanodon]]'' was identified after Mary Mantell unearthed some fossilised teeth by a road in Sussex in 1822. Her husband, the geologist [[Gideon Mantell]], noticed they were similar to modern iguana teeth but many times larger; this important find led to the discovery of dinosaurs.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Igauanodon Teeth|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/collections-at-the-museum/museum-treasures/iguanodon-teeth/|publisher=Natural History Museum|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909145343/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/collections-at-the-museum/museum-treasures/iguanodon-teeth/|url-status=live|archivedate=9 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe area contains significant reserves of shale oil, totalling 4.4 billion [[Barrel (unit)|barrels of oil]] in the Wealden basin according to a 2014 study, which then Business and Energy Minister [[Michael Fallon]] said \"will bring jobs and business opportunities\" and significantly help with UK energy self-sufficiency.

With the [[Iron Age]] came the first use of the Weald as an industrial area. Wealden sandstones contain [[ironstone]], and with the additional presence of large amounts of timber for making [[charcoal]] for fuel, the area was the centre of the [[Wealden iron industry]] from then, through the [[Roman Britain|Roman times]], until the last forge was closed in 1813.<ref name=\"solarnavigator.net\">[http://www.solarnavigator.net/history/wealden_iron_industry.htm Wealden History of Early Iron Making]</ref><ref>[http://www.highweald.org/learn-about/timeline.html High Weald Timeline]</ref> The index to the Ordnance Survey Map of Roman Britain lists 33 iron mines; and 67% of these are in the Weald.\n\nThe entire Weald was originally heavily forested. According to the 9th-century ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', the Weald measured {{convert|120|mi|km|0}} or longer by {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} in the Saxon era, stretching from [[Lympne]], near [[Romney Marsh]] in Kent, to the [[Forest of Bere]] or even the [[New Forest]] in Hampshire.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">'The Kent and Sussex Weald, Peter Brandon, published by Phillimore and Company, 2003 {{ISBN|1-86077-241-2}}</ref> The area was sparsely inhabited and inhospitable, being used mainly as a resource by people living on its fringes, much as in other places in Britain such as [[Dartmoor]], [[the Fens]] and the [[Arden, Warwickshire|Forest of Arden]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  The Weald was used for centuries, possibly since the [[Iron Age]], for [[transhumance]] of animals along [[droveway]]s in the summer months.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Over the centuries, deforestation for the shipbuilding, charcoal, [[forest glass]], and brickmaking industries has left the Low Weald with only remnants of that woodland cover.\n\nWhile most of the Weald was used for [[transhumance]] by communities at the edge of the Weald, several parts of the forest on the higher ridges in the interior seem to have been used for hunting by the [[List of monarchs of Sussex|kings of Sussex]]. The pattern of droveways which occurs across the rest of the Weald is absent from these areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> These areas include [[St Leonard's Forest]], Worth Forest, [[Ashdown Forest]] and [[Dallington Forest]].\n\nThe forests of the Weald were often used as a place of refuge and sanctuary. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' relates events during the [[Anglo-Saxon]] conquest of [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] when the native [[Romano-Britons|Britons]] (whom the Anglo-Saxons called ''[[Welsh people|Welsh]]'') were driven from the coastal towns into the recesses of the forest for sanctuary,:\n\n{{quote|A.D. 477. This year came [[\u00c6lle of Sussex|\u00c6lle]] to Britain, with his three sons, Cymen, and Wlenking, and [[Cissa of Sussex|Cissa]], in three ships; landing at a place that is called [[Cymenshore]]. There they slew many of the Welsh; and some in flight they drove into the wood that is called Andred'sley.<ref>[http://mcllibrary.org/Anglo/part1.html Medieval and Classical Literature Library, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Part 1]</ref>}}\n\nUntil the [[Late Middle Ages]] the forest was a notorious hiding place for [[bandit]]s, [[highwaymen]] and [[outlaw]]s.<ref>[http://www.heathfield.net/historical-information Heathfield.net]</ref>\n\nSettlements on the Weald are widely scattered. Villages evolved from small settlements in the woods, typically {{convert|4|to|5|mi|abbr=off|spell=on|0}} apart; close enough to be an easy walk but not so close as to encourage unnecessary intrusion. Few of the settlements are mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]]; however Goudhurst's church dates from the early 12th century or before and Wadhurst was big enough by the mid-13th century to be granted a royal charter permitting a market to be held. Before then, the Weald was used as summer grazing land, particularly for [[pannage]] by inhabitants of the surrounding areas. Many places within the Weald have retained names from this time, linking them to the original communities by the addition of the suffix \"''-den''\": for example, [[Tenterden]] was the area used by the people of [[Isle of Thanet|Thanet]]. Permanent settlements in much of the Weald developed much later than in other parts of lowland Britain, although there were as many as one hundred furnaces and forges operating by the later 16th century, employing large numbers of people.<ref name=\"solarnavigator.net\"/>\n\nIn 1216 during the [[First Barons' War]], a guerilla force of archers from the Weald, led by [[William of Cassingham]] (nicknamed Willikin of the Weald), ambushed the French occupying army led by [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]] near [[Lewes]] and drove them to the coast at [[Winchelsea]]. The timely arrival of a French Fleet allowed the French forces to narrowly escape starvation. William was later granted a pension from the crown and made warden of the Weald in reward for his services.\n\nIn the first edition of ''[[On The Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] used an estimate for the erosion of the chalk, [[sandstone]] and clay strata of the Weald in his [[theory of natural selection]]. Charles Darwin was a follower of Lyell's theory of [[uniformitarianism]] and decided to expand upon Lyell's theory with a quantitative estimate to determine if there was enough time in the history of the Earth to uphold his principles of evolution. He assumed the rate of erosion was around one inch per century and calculated the age of the Weald at around 300 million years. Were that true, he reasoned, the Earth itself must be much older. In 1862, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later Lord Kelvin) published a paper \"On the age of the sun's heat\", in which \u2013 unaware of the process of solar fusion \u2013 he calculated the Sun had been burning for less than a million years, and put the outside limit of the [[age of the Earth]] at 200 million years. Based on these estimates he denounced Darwin's geological estimates as imprecise. Darwin saw Lord Kelvin's calculation as one of the most serious criticisms to his theory and removed his calculations on the Weald from the third edition of ''On the Origin of Species''.<ref>Joel Levy, ''Scientific Feuds'', New Holland Publishers (2010) {{ISBN|978-1-84773-717-5}}</ref>\n\nModern chronostratigraphy shows that the Weald Clays were laid down around 130 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=WC|title=BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units - Weald Clay Formation|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bgs.ac.uk|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Autumn, Weald of Kent Haughton.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of thick foliage of wooded slopes of a small valley at sunset|''Autumn, Weald of Kent'' (1904), by Benjamin Haughton]]\nThe Weald begins north-east of [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]] in [[Hampshire]] and extends across [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]] in the north, and Sussex in the south. The western parts in Hampshire and West Sussex, known as the [[Western Weald]], are included in the [[South Downs National Park]]. Other protected parts of the Weald are included in the [[Surrey Hills AONB|Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and the [[High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. In extent it covers about {{convert|85|mi|km}} from west to east, and about {{convert|30|mi|km}} from north to south, covering an area of some {{convert|500|sqmi|km2}}. The eastern end of the High Weald, the [[English Channel]] coast, is marked in the centre by the high sandstone cliffs from [[Hastings]] to [[Pett Level]]; and by former sea cliffs now fronted by the Pevensey and Romney Marshes on either side.\n\nMuch of the ''High Weald'', the central part, is designated as the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Its landscape is described as one of\n\n{{quote|rolling hills, studded with sandstone [[outcrop]]s and cut by streams to form steep-sided ravines (called gills); small irregular-shaped fields and patches of heathland, abundant woodlands; scattered farmsteads and sunken lanes and paths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.highweald.org/downloads/publications/high-weald-aonb-management-plan-documents/1475-high-weald-management-plan-3rd-edition-2014-2019/file.html |title=The High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Management Plan 2014-2019|location=Sussex|publisher=The High Weald Joint Advisory Committee|year=2014|accessdate=19 May 2015|page=5}}\n</ref>}}\n\n[[Ashdown Forest]], an extensive area of heathland and woodland occupying the highest sandy ridge-top at the centre of the High Weald, is a former royal deer-hunting forest created by the Normans and said to be the largest remaining part of ''Andredesweald''.<ref>Brandon (2003), p.23.</ref>\n\nThere are centres of settlement, the largest of which are [[Horsham]], [[Burgess Hill]], [[East Grinstead]], [[Haywards Heath]], [[Tonbridge]], [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], [[Crowborough]]; and the area along the coast from Hastings and [[Bexhill-on-Sea]] to [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]].\n\nThe geological map shows the High Weald in lime green (9a).\n\nThe ''Low Weald'',<ref>[http://www.countryside.gov.uk/LAR/Landscape/CC/SEL/low_weald.asp ''Natural England'': Notes on the Low Weald]</ref> the periphery of the Weald, is shown as darker green on the map (9),<ref>The additional green section on the map, outside the other two, is not part of The Weald: to the north it is the [[Vale of Holmesdale]]; to the south the Vale of Sussex</ref> and has an entirely different character. It is in effect the eroded outer edges of the High Weald, revealing a mixture of sandstone outcrops within the underlying clay. As a result, the landscape is of wide and low-lying clay vales with small woodlands ([[shaw (woodland)|\u201cshaws\u201d]]) and fields. There is a great deal of surface water: ponds and many meandering streams.\n\nSome areas, such as the flat plain around [[Crawley]], have been utilised for urban use: here are [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick Airport]] and its related developments and the [[Horley]]-Crawley commuter settlements. Otherwise the Low Weald retains its historic settlement pattern, where the villages and small towns occupy harder outcrops of rocks. There are no large towns on the Low Weald, although [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], [[Sevenoaks]] and [[Reigate]] lie immediately on the northern edge. Settlements tend to be small and linear, because of its original wooded nature and heavy clay soils.<ref>[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:JoaocL3AMS4J:www.countryside.gov.uk/Images/JCA121_tcm2-21571.pdf+Weald+timber+shipbuilding&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=5&gl=uk Notes on the Low Weald]</ref>\n\nThe Weald is drained by the many streams radiating from it, the majority being tributaries of the surrounding major rivers: particularly the [[River Mole, Surrey|Mole]], [[River Medway|Medway]], [[River Stour, Kent|Stour]], [[River Rother (Eastern)|Rother]], [[River Cuckmere|Cuckmere]], [[River Ouse, Sussex|Ouse]], [[River Adur|Adur]] and [[River Arun|Arun]]. Many of these streams provided the power for the [[watermill]]s, [[blast furnaces]] and hammers of the iron industry and the cloth mills.\n\n==Transport infrastructure==\nThe [[M25 motorway|M25]], [[M26 motorway|M26]] and [[M20 motorway]]s all use the [[Vale of Holmesdale]] to the north, and therefore run along or near the northern edge of the Weald. The [[M23 motorway|M23]]/[[A23 road]] to [[Brighton]], uses the western, narrower, part of the Weald where there are stream headwaters, crossing it from north to south. Other roads take similar routes, although they often have long hills and many bends: the more sedate, but busy [[A21 road (England)|A21]] trunk road to Hastings is still beset with traffic delays, despite having had some new sections.\n\nFive railways once crossed the Weald, now reduced to three.  Building them provided the engineers with difficulties in crossing the terrain, with the hard sandstone adding to their problems. The [[Brighton Main Line]] followed the same route as its road predecessors: although it necessitated the [[Balcombe tunnel|long tunnel near Balcombe]] and the [[Ouse Valley Viaduct]]. Tributaries of the River Ouse provided some assistance in the building of now-closed [[East Grinstead]]-[[Lewes]] and the [[Uckfield]]-Lewes lines. The principal [[Hastings Line|main-line railway]] to Hastings had to negotiate difficult terrain when it was first built, necessitating many sharp curves and tunnels; and similar problems had to be faced with the Ashford-Hastings line.\n\nSeveral [[long-distance trail|long-distance footpaths]] criss-cross the Weald, and it is well-mapped recreationally, covered by routes from:\n*The [[Ramblers' Association]]s and most District Councils for walkers\n*[[Sustrans]] and local county councils for [[cyclists]]\n\n==Farming==\n{{sources|section|date=February 2018}}\nNeither the thin infertile sands of the High Weald or the wet sticky clays of the Low Weald are suited to intensive arable farming and the [[topography]] of the area often increases the difficulties. There are limited areas of fertile greens and which can be used for intensive vegetable growing, as in the valley of the [[River Rother (Western)|Western Rother]]. Historically the area of cereals grown has varied greatly with changes in prices, increasing during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and during and since [[World War II]]. \n\nThe Weald has its own breed of cattle, called the [[Sussex cattle|Sussex]], although it has been as numerous in Kent and parts of Surrey. Bred from the strong hardy oxen, which continued to be used to plough the clay soils of the Low Weald longer than in most places, these red beef cattle were highly praised by [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]] in his book ''Agriculture of Sussex'' when visiting Sussex in the 1790s. [[William Cobbett]] commented on finding some of the finest cattle on some of the region's poorest subsistence farms on the High Weald. Pigs, which were kept by most households in the past, were able to be fattened in autumn on acorns in the extensive oak woods. In his novel ''Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man'', the poet and novelist [[Siegfried Sassoon]] refers to \"the agricultural serenity of the Weald widespread in the delicate hazy sunshine\".\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe Weald has largely maintained its wooded character, with woodland still covering 23% of the overall area (one of the highest levels in England) and the proportion is considerably higher in some central parts. The sandstones of the Wealden rocks are usually acidic, often leading to the development of acidic habitats such as [[heathland]], the largest remaining areas of which are in Ashdown Forest and near [[Thursley]].\n\nAlthough common in [[France]], the wild [[boar]] became extinct in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] by the 17th century, but wild breeding populations have recently returned in the Weald, following escapes from boar farms.<ref name=\"dfra\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/reports/Wild%20Boar%20Risk%20Assessment%201998.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130822084033/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/reports/Wild%20Boar%20Risk%20Assessment%201998.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-08-22|format=PDF|author =M.J.

The first ''[[Iguanodon]]'' was identified after Mary Mantell unearthed some fossilised teeth by a road in Sussex in 1822.

With the [[Iron Age]] came the first use of the Weald as an industrial area. Wealden sandstones contain [[ironstone]], and with the additional presence of large amounts of timber for making [[charcoal]] for fuel, the area was the centre of the [[Wealden iron industry]] from then, through the [[Roman Britain|Roman times]], until the last forge was closed in 1813.<ref name=\"solarnavigator.net\">[http://www.solarnavigator.net/history/wealden_iron_industry.htm Wealden History of Early Iron Making]</ref><ref>[http://www.highweald.org/learn-about/timeline.html High Weald Timeline]</ref> The index to the Ordnance Survey Map of Roman Britain lists 33 iron mines; and 67% of these are in the Weald.\n\nThe entire Weald was originally heavily forested. According to the 9th-century ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', the Weald measured {{convert|120|mi|km|0}} or longer by {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} in the Saxon era, stretching from [[Lympne]], near [[Romney Marsh]] in Kent, to the [[Forest of Bere]] or even the [[New Forest]] in Hampshire.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">'The Kent and Sussex Weald, Peter Brandon, published by Phillimore and Company, 2003 {{ISBN|1-86077-241-2}}</ref> The area was sparsely inhabited and inhospitable, being used mainly as a resource by people living on its fringes, much as in other places in Britain such as [[Dartmoor]], [[the Fens]] and the [[Arden, Warwickshire|Forest of Arden]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  The Weald was used for centuries, possibly since the [[Iron Age]], for [[transhumance]] of animals along [[droveway]]s in the summer months.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Over the centuries, deforestation for the shipbuilding, charcoal, [[forest glass]], and brickmaking industries has left the Low Weald with only remnants of that woodland cover.\n\nWhile most of the Weald was used for [[transhumance]] by communities at the edge of the Weald, several parts of the forest on the higher ridges in the interior seem to have been used for hunting by the [[List of monarchs of Sussex|kings of Sussex]]. The pattern of droveways which occurs across the rest of the Weald is absent from these areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> These areas include [[St Leonard's Forest]], Worth Forest, [[Ashdown Forest]] and [[Dallington Forest]].\n\nThe forests of the Weald were often used as a place of refuge and sanctuary. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' relates events during the [[Anglo-Saxon]] conquest of [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] when the native [[Romano-Britons|Britons]] (whom the Anglo-Saxons called ''[[Welsh people|Welsh]]'') were driven from the coastal towns into the recesses of the forest for sanctuary,:\n\n{{quote|A.D. 477.

Villages evolved from small settlements in the woods, typically {{convert|4|to|5|mi|abbr=off|spell=on|0}} apart; close enough to be an easy walk but not so close as to encourage unnecessary intrusion. Few of the settlements are mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]]; however Goudhurst's church dates from the early 12th century or before and Wadhurst was big enough by the mid-13th century to be granted a royal charter permitting a market to be held. Before then, the Weald was used as summer grazing land, particularly for [[pannage]] by inhabitants of the surrounding areas. Many places within the Weald have retained names from this time, linking them to the original communities by the addition of the suffix \"''-den''\": for example, [[Tenterden]] was the area used by the people of [[Isle of Thanet|Thanet]]. Permanent settlements in much of the Weald developed much later than in other parts of lowland Britain, although there were as many as one hundred furnaces and forges operating by the later 16th century, employing large numbers of people.<ref name=\"solarnavigator.net\"/>\n\nIn 1216 during the [[First Barons' War]], a guerilla force of archers from the Weald, led by [[William of Cassingham]] (nicknamed Willikin of the Weald), ambushed the French occupying army led by [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]] near [[Lewes]] and drove them to the coast at [[Winchelsea]]. The timely arrival of a French Fleet allowed the French forces to narrowly escape starvation. William was later granted a pension from the crown and made warden of the Weald in reward for his services.\n\nIn the first edition of ''[[On The Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] used an estimate for the erosion of the chalk, [[sandstone]] and clay strata of the Weald in his [[theory of natural selection]]. Charles Darwin was a follower of Lyell's theory of [[uniformitarianism]] and decided to expand upon Lyell's theory with a quantitative estimate to determine if there was enough time in the history of the Earth to uphold his principles of evolution. He assumed the rate of erosion was around one inch per century and calculated the age of the Weald at around 300 million years. Were that true, he reasoned, the Earth itself must be much older. In 1862, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later Lord Kelvin) published a paper \"On the age of the sun's heat\", in which \u2013 unaware of the process of solar fusion \u2013 he calculated the Sun had been burning for less than a million years, and put the outside limit of the [[age of the Earth]] at 200 million years. Based on these estimates he denounced Darwin's geological estimates as imprecise. Darwin saw Lord Kelvin's calculation as one of the most serious criticisms to his theory and removed his calculations on the Weald from the third edition of ''On the Origin of Species''.<ref>Joel Levy, ''Scientific Feuds'', New Holland Publishers (2010) {{ISBN|978-1-84773-717-5}}</ref>\n\nModern chronostratigraphy shows that the Weald Clays were laid down around 130 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=WC|title=BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units - Weald Clay Formation|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bgs.ac.uk|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Autumn, Weald of Kent Haughton.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of thick foliage of wooded slopes of a small valley at sunset|''Autumn, Weald of Kent'' (1904), by Benjamin Haughton]]\nThe Weald begins north-east of [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]] in [[Hampshire]] and extends across [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]] in the north, and Sussex in the south. The western parts in Hampshire and West Sussex, known as the [[Western Weald]], are included in the [[South Downs National Park]]. Other protected parts of the Weald are included in the [[Surrey Hills AONB|Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and the [[High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. In extent it covers about {{convert|85|mi|km}} from west to east, and about {{convert|30|mi|km}} from north to south, covering an area of some {{convert|500|sqmi|km2}}. The eastern end of the High Weald, the [[English Channel]] coast, is marked in the centre by the high sandstone cliffs from [[Hastings]] to [[Pett Level]]; and by former sea cliffs now fronted by the Pevensey and Romney Marshes on either side.\n\nMuch of the ''High Weald'', the central part, is designated as the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Its landscape is described as one of\n\n{{quote|rolling hills, studded with sandstone [[outcrop]]s and cut by streams to form steep-sided ravines (called gills); small irregular-shaped fields and patches of heathland, abundant woodlands; scattered farmsteads and sunken lanes and paths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.highweald.org/downloads/publications/high-weald-aonb-management-plan-documents/1475-high-weald-management-plan-3rd-edition-2014-2019/file.html |title=The High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Management Plan 2014-2019|location=Sussex|publisher=The High Weald Joint Advisory Committee|year=2014|accessdate=19 May 2015|page=5}}\n</ref>}}\n\n[[Ashdown Forest]], an extensive area of heathland and woodland occupying the highest sandy ridge-top at the centre of the High Weald, is a former royal deer-hunting forest created by the Normans and said to be the largest remaining part of ''Andredesweald''.<ref>Brandon (2003), p.23.</ref>\n\nThere are centres of settlement, the largest of which are [[Horsham]], [[Burgess Hill]], [[East Grinstead]], [[Haywards Heath]], [[Tonbridge]], [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], [[Crowborough]]; and the area along the coast from Hastings and [[Bexhill-on-Sea]] to [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]].\n\nThe geological map shows the High Weald in lime green (9a).\n\nThe ''Low Weald'',<ref>[http://www.countryside.gov.uk/LAR/Landscape/CC/SEL/low_weald.asp ''Natural England'': Notes on the Low Weald]</ref> the periphery of the Weald, is shown as darker green on the map (9),<ref>The additional green section on the map, outside the other two, is not part of The Weald: to the north it is the [[Vale of Holmesdale]]; to the south the Vale of Sussex</ref> and has an entirely different character. It is in effect the eroded outer edges of the High Weald, revealing a mixture of sandstone outcrops within the underlying clay. As a result, the landscape is of wide and low-lying clay vales with small woodlands ([[shaw (woodland)|\u201cshaws\u201d]]) and fields. There is a great deal of surface water: ponds and many meandering streams.\n\nSome areas, such as the flat plain around [[Crawley]], have been utilised for urban use: here are [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick Airport]] and its related developments and the [[Horley]]-Crawley commuter settlements. Otherwise the Low Weald retains its historic settlement pattern, where the villages and small towns occupy harder outcrops of rocks. There are no large towns on the Low Weald, although [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], [[Sevenoaks]] and [[Reigate]] lie immediately on the northern edge. Settlements tend to be small and linear, because of its original wooded nature and heavy clay soils.<ref>[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:JoaocL3AMS4J:www.countryside.gov.uk/Images/JCA121_tcm2-21571.pdf+Weald+timber+shipbuilding&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=5&gl=uk Notes on the Low Weald]</ref>\n\nThe Weald is drained by the many streams radiating from it, the majority being tributaries of the surrounding major rivers: particularly the [[River Mole, Surrey|Mole]], [[River Medway|Medway]], [[River Stour, Kent|Stour]], [[River Rother (Eastern)|Rother]], [[River Cuckmere|Cuckmere]], [[River Ouse, Sussex|Ouse]], [[River Adur|Adur]] and [[River Arun|Arun]]. Many of these streams provided the power for the [[watermill]]s, [[blast furnaces]] and hammers of the iron industry and the cloth mills.\n\n==Transport infrastructure==\nThe [[M25 motorway|M25]], [[M26 motorway|M26]] and [[M20 motorway]]s all use the [[Vale of Holmesdale]] to the north, and therefore run along or near the northern edge of the Weald. The [[M23 motorway|M23]]/[[A23 road]] to [[Brighton]], uses the western, narrower, part of the Weald where there are stream headwaters, crossing it from north to south. Other roads take similar routes, although they often have long hills and many bends: the more sedate, but busy [[A21 road (England)|A21]] trunk road to Hastings is still beset with traffic delays, despite having had some new sections.\n\nFive railways once crossed the Weald, now reduced to three.  Building them provided the engineers with difficulties in crossing the terrain, with the hard sandstone adding to their problems. The [[Brighton Main Line]] followed the same route as its road predecessors: although it necessitated the [[Balcombe tunnel|long tunnel near Balcombe]] and the [[Ouse Valley Viaduct]]. Tributaries of the River Ouse provided some assistance in the building of now-closed [[East Grinstead]]-[[Lewes]] and the [[Uckfield]]-Lewes lines. The principal [[Hastings Line|main-line railway]] to Hastings had to negotiate difficult terrain when it was first built, necessitating many sharp curves and tunnels; and similar problems had to be faced with the Ashford-Hastings line.\n\nSeveral [[long-distance trail|long-distance footpaths]] criss-cross the Weald, and it is well-mapped recreationally, covered by routes from:\n*The [[Ramblers' Association]]s and most District Councils for walkers\n*[[Sustrans]] and local county councils for [[cyclists]]\n\n==Farming==\n{{sources|section|date=February 2018}}\nNeither the thin infertile sands of the High Weald or the wet sticky clays of the Low Weald are suited to intensive arable farming and the [[topography]] of the area often increases the difficulties. There are limited areas of fertile greens and which can be used for intensive vegetable growing, as in the valley of the [[River Rother (Western)|Western Rother]]. Historically the area of cereals grown has varied greatly with changes in prices, increasing during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and during and since [[World War II]]. \n\nThe Weald has its own breed of cattle, called the [[Sussex cattle|Sussex]], although it has been as numerous in Kent and parts of Surrey. Bred from the strong hardy oxen, which continued to be used to plough the clay soils of the Low Weald longer than in most places, these red beef cattle were highly praised by [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]] in his book ''Agriculture of Sussex'' when visiting Sussex in the 1790s. [[William Cobbett]] commented on finding some of the finest cattle on some of the region's poorest subsistence farms on the High Weald. Pigs, which were kept by most households in the past, were able to be fattened in autumn on acorns in the extensive oak woods. In his novel ''Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man'', the poet and novelist [[Siegfried Sassoon]] refers to \"the agricultural serenity of the Weald widespread in the delicate hazy sunshine\".\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe Weald has largely maintained its wooded character, with woodland still covering 23% of the overall area (one of the highest levels in England) and the proportion is considerably higher in some central parts. The sandstones of the Wealden rocks are usually acidic, often leading to the development of acidic habitats such as [[heathland]], the largest remaining areas of which are in Ashdown Forest and near [[Thursley]].\n\nAlthough common in [[France]], the wild [[boar]] became extinct in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] by the 17th century, but wild breeding populations have recently returned in the Weald, following escapes from boar farms.<ref name=\"dfra\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/reports/Wild%20Boar%20Risk%20Assessment%201998.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130822084033/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/reports/Wild%20Boar%20Risk%20Assessment%201998.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-08-22|format=PDF|author =M.J.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>.

After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref><ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref>battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=\"Sunderland, Hoover's Gap\">Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref><ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref>battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W.

However, in medieval era stories of the Tamil tradition, Agastya pioneered the first ''sangam'' period that lasted 4,440 years, and took part in the second ''sangam'' period that lasted another 3,700 years.{{sfn|Richard S Weiss|2009|p=81\u201382}}\n\nThe ''Tirumantiram'' describes Agastya as an ascetic sage, who came from the north and settled in the southern [[Pothigai]] mountains because [[Shiva]] asked him to. He is described as the one who perfected and loved both Sanskrit and Tamil languages, amassing knowledge in both, thus becoming a symbol of integration, harmony and learning, instead of being opposed to either.{{sfn|Richard S Weiss|2009|p=82}} According to the [[Skanda Purana]], the whole world visited the Himalayas when [[Shiva]] was about to wed [[Parvati]]. This caused the earth to tip to one side. Shiva then requested Agastya to go to the southern region to restore the equilibrium.

A ''siddhar'' is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root ''sidh'' which means \"to accomplish or succeed\". As the first ''Siddhar'', Agastya is deemed as the first master, accomplished, the sage who perfected his knowledge of the natural and spiritual worlds.

One theory states that the root is ''Aj'' or ''Anj'', which connotes \"brighten, effulgent one\" and links Agastya to \"one who brightens\" in darkness, and Agastya is traditionally the Indian name for [[Canopus]], the second most brilliantly shining star found in South Asian skies, next to Sirius.{{sfn|Alf Hiltebeitel|2011|pp=407}} \nA third theory links it to Indo-European origins, through the Iranian word ''gasta'' which means \"sin, foul\", and ''a-gasta'' would mean \"not sin, not foul\".<ref>Edwin Bryant and Laurie Patton (2005), The Indo-Aryan Controversy, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-700-71462-6}}, pages 252\u2013253</ref> The fourth theory, based on folk etymology in verse 2.11 of the ''Ramayana'' states that Agastya is from ''aga'' (unmoving or mountain) and ''gam'' (move), and together these roots connote \"one who is mover-of-mountains\", or \"mover-of-the-unmoving\".{{sfn|Alain Dani\u00e9lou|1991|p=322\u2013323 with footnotes 5 and 6}} The word is also written as '''Agasti''' and '''Agathiyar''' ({{lang-ta|\u0b85\u0b95\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bb0\u0bcd}}  ''Agathiyar'';<ref name=\"Indian History\">{{citation |title=Indian History |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill |p=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CeEmpfmbxKEC&pg=SL1-PA240 }}</ref> {{lang-te|\u0c05\u0c17\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c2f}}; {{lang-kn|\u0c85\u0c97\u0cb8\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0caf}}; {{lang-ml|\u0d05\u0d17\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d7b or \u0d05\u0d17\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d2e\u0d41\u0d28\u0d3f}} {{lang-ms|Anggasta}}; {{lang-th|italic=yes|Akkhot}}).<ref name=\"Indian History\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:AgathiyarLopamudra.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Maharishi Agastya and [[Lopamudra|Lop\u0101mudr\u0101]]]]\nAgastya is the named author of several hymns of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' (3000-2000 BCE).

Her parents were unwilling to bless the engagement, concerned that she would be unable to live the austere lifestyle of Agastya in the forest. However, the legends state that Lopamudra accepted him as her husband, saying that Agastya has the wealth of ascetic living, her own youth will fade with seasons, and it is his virtue that makes him the right person.

Two legends place it in Northwest Maharashtra, on the banks of the river [[Godavari]], near [[Nashik]] in small towns named ''Agastyapuri'' and ''Akole''. Other putative sites mentioned in Northern and Eastern Indian sources is near [[Kolhapur]] (Western ghats at Maharashtra, Karnataka border), or near [[Kannauj]] (Uttar Pradesh), or in Agastyamuni village near [[Rudraprayag]] (Uttarakhand), or [[Satpura Range]] (Madhya Pradesh). In Southern sources and the North Indian ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]]'', his ''ashram'' is based in Tamil Nadu, variously placed in [[Tirunelveli]], [[Pothigai|Pothiyal hills]], or [[Thanjavur]].{{sfn|Roshen Dalal|2010|p=294}} Facing east, he penanced upon a rock at [[Kanyakumari]] immediately after the beginning of [[Kaliyuga]].

However, in medieval era stories of the Tamil tradition, Agastya pioneered the first ''sangam'' period that lasted 4,440 years, and took part in the second ''sangam'' period that lasted another 3,700 years.{{sfn|Richard S Weiss|2009|p=81\u201382}}\n\nThe ''Tirumantiram'' describes Agastya as an ascetic sage, who came from the north and settled in the southern [[Pothigai]] mountains because [[Shiva]] asked him to. He is described as the one who perfected and loved both Sanskrit and Tamil languages, amassing knowledge in both, thus becoming a symbol of integration, harmony and learning, instead of being opposed to either.{{sfn|Richard S Weiss|2009|p=82}} According to the [[Skanda Purana]], the whole world visited the Himalayas when [[Shiva]] was about to wed [[Parvati]]. This caused the earth to tip to one side. Shiva then requested Agastya to go to the southern region to restore the equilibrium. Thus, Agastya migrated south at Shiva's behest.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas|author=Swami Parmeshwaranand|publisher=Sarup & Sons, 2001 - Puranas - 1432 pages|page=9}}</ref>\n\n====Siddhar====\n[[File:Agathiyar.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Reverence at the Agastya shrine atop the peak of [[Agastya Mala|Agastya mala]], with garlands of fruits and flowers.]]\nAgastya, in Tamil Hindu traditions, is considered as the first and foremost [[Siddhar]] (Tamil: ''cittar'', Sanskrit: ''siddha''). A ''siddhar'' is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root ''sidh'' which means \"to accomplish or succeed\". As the first ''Siddhar'', Agastya is deemed as the first master, accomplished, the sage who perfected his knowledge of the natural and spiritual worlds. This Tamil concept has parallels to Tibetan ''mahasiddhas'', Sri Lankan Buddhist, and [[Nath]] Hindu yogi traditions of north India.{{sfn|Richard S Weiss|2009|p=47\u201348}}\n[[File:Sri Lobamudra Sameda Agasthiyar.jpg|thumb|Lobamudra sameda Agasthiyar Temple, A.

Agastya is also unique for the reverence he has received in historic texts all over the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Richard S Weiss|2009|p=47\u201348}}\n\nAccording to Venkatraman, the ''Siddhar''-related literature about Agastya is late medieval to early modern era.

He was particularly popular in Java Indonesia, till Islam started to spread throughout the islands of Indonesia. He is also found in Cambodia, Vietnam and other regions. The earliest mentions of Agastya is traceable to about the mid 1st millennium CE, but the 11th-century Javanese language text ''Agastya-parva'' is a remarkable combination of philosophy, mythology and genealogy attributed to sage Agastya.{{sfn|Jan Gonda|1975|pp=12\u201314}}{{sfn|Anne E.

The text is structured as a conversation between a ''Guru'' (teacher, Agastya) and a ''Sisya'' (student, Agastya's son Drdhasyu).{{sfn|Jan Gonda|1975|p=14}} The style is a mixture of didactic, philosophical and theological treatise, covering diverse range of topics much like Hindu Puranas. The chapters of the Javanese text include the Indian theory of cyclic existence, rebirth and [[samsara]], creation of the world by the churning of the ocean (''samudra manthan''), theories of the [[Samkhya]] and the [[Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]], major sections on god [[Shiva]] and [[Shaivism]], some discussion of [[Tantra]], a manual like summary of ceremonies associated with the rites of passage and others.{{sfn|Jan Gonda|1975|p=14}}\n\nWhile the similarities between the ''Agastya-parva'' text and classical Indian ideas are obvious, according to [[Jan Gonda]], the Indian counterpart of this text in Sanskrit or Tamil languages have not been found in Indonesia or in India.{{sfn|Jan Gonda|1975|p=15}} Similarly other Agastya-related Indonesian texts, dated to be from the 10th to 12th centuries, discuss ideas from multiple sub-schools of Shaivism such as theistic Shaivasiddhanta and monistic Agamic Pashupata, and these texts declare these theologies to be of equal merit and value.{{sfn|Jan Gonda|1975|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Agastya statue in southern niche of Sambisari temple.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Agastya on south side of the 9th-century Javanese [[Sambisari]] temple unearthed from volcanic mud.]]\nAgastya is common in medieval era Shiva temples of southeast Asia, such as the stone temples in Java ([[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]).
