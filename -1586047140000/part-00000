It is divided in [[Municipalities of Guerrero|81 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Chilpancingo]] and its largest city is [[Acapulco]].\n\nIt is located in Southwestern Mexico. It is bordered by the states of [[Michoac\u00e1n]] to the north and west, [[State of M\u00e9xico|M\u00e9xico]] and [[Morelos]] to the north, [[Puebla]] to the northeast and [[Oaxaca]] to the east.\n\nThe state was named after [[Vicente Guerrero]], one of the most prominent leaders in the [[Mexican War of Independence]] and the second [[President of Mexico]].<ref name=\"nomen\">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |title=Estado de Guerrero Nomenclatura |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M\u00e9xico |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=State of Guerrero Nomenclature |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003153/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |archivedate=March 6, 2012 }}</ref> It is the only [[Mexican state]] named after a president. The modern entity did not exist until 1849, when it was carved out of territories from the states of [[Mexico State|Mexico]], [[Puebla]] and [[Michoac\u00e1n]].\n\nIn addition to the capital city, the state's largest cities include [[Acapulco]], [[Petatlan]], [[Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero|Ciudad Altamirano]], [[Taxco]], [[Iguala]], [[Ixtapa]], [[Zihuatanejo]], and [[Santo Domingo, Guerrero|Santo Domingo]]. Today, it is home to a number of indigenous communities, including the [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]], [[Mixtec]]s and [[Amuzgo people|Amuzgos]]. It is also home to communities of [[Afro-Mexican]]s in the [[Costa Chica of Guerrero|Costa Chica]] region.\n\nGeographically, the state is mountainous and rugged with flat areas limited to small [[mesa]]s and the coast line. This coastline has been important economically for the area, first as the port of Acapulco in colonial and post-Independence area and today for the tourist destinations of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa. Tourism is the single most important economic factor of the state and Acapulco's tourism is important to the nation's economy as a whole. However, other sources of employment are scarce in the state, which has caused its ranking as number one in the emigration of workers to the United States.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistoric and Pre-Columbian periods===\n[[File:Two_Xochipala_figurines_(Met_by_Ched).jpg|thumb|left|Two figures from the Xochipala archeological site]]\nThe first humans in the state's territory were nomadic hunter-gatherers who left evidence of their existence in various caves starting about 20,000 years ago.<ref name=\"enchistoria\">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |title=Estado de Guerrero Historia |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M\u00e9xico |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=State of Guerrero History |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003153/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |archivedate=March 6, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"riquezahis\">{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&ArtOrder=ReadArt&Article=71 |title= La Riqueza Hist\u00f3rica de Guerrero |publisher= Government of Guerrero |location=Guerrero, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Historical Richness of Guerrero |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}</ref> Until about 8,000 years ago, climatic conditions better favored human habitation than those today;<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> however, sedentary human habitation happened around this time in the mountainous areas with more moisture, and better soil for agriculture.

It is characterized by its own sculpture and ceramics, distinguished by its simplicity.

Later, the culture assimilated aspects of the [[Teotihuacan]] model, which included the [[Mesoamerican ball game]] .<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nLater migrations to the area brought ethnicities such as the [[Pur\u00e9pecha people|Pur\u00e9pecha]], the Mixtecs, the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] and the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] who left traces on the local cultures as they established commercial centers around the 7th century. In the 8th century, [[Toltec]] influence was felt as they traveled the many trade routes through here in search of tropical bird plumage and [[amatl|amate paper]]. From the 12th century to the 15th, the various peoples of the state were influence by the [[Chichimeca]]s, culminating in [[Aztec Empire|Aztec domination]] by the 15th century.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nIn the 11th century, new migrations entered the area from the north, which included the Nahuas, who occupied what is now the center of the state and the Pur\u00e9pecha who took over the west. The Nahuas established themselves in [[La Uni\u00f3n de Isidoro Montes de Oca|Zacatula]], [[Atoyac de \u00c1lvarez|Atoyac]] and [[Tlacotepec]], later conquering the areas occupied by the [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal]]s and [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]]s.<ref name=\"riquezahis\"/>\n\nBy the 15th century, the territory of modern Guerrero state was inhabited by a number of peoples, none of whom had major cities or population centers. The most important of these peoples where the Pur\u00e9pecha, [[Cuitlatec people|Cuitlatec]]s, [[Ocuiteca]]s and Matlatzincas in the [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]], the Chontales, [[Mazatleco]]s and [[Tlahuica]]s in the Sierra del Norte, the [[Coixca]]s and [[Tepozteco]]s in the Central Valleys, the Tlapanecos and Mixtecs in the La Monta\u00f1a, the [[Jopi]]s, Mixtecos and Amuzgos in Costa Chica and [[Tolimeca]]s, [[Chubia]]s, [[Panteca]]s and Cuitlecas in [[Costa Grande of Guerrero|Costa Grande]]. Most of these lived in smaller dominions with moderate social stratification. One distinctive feature of the peoples of this was the use of cotton garments.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nThe Aztecs began making incursions in the Guerrero area as early as 1414 under [[Chimalpopoca]] as part of the conquest of the [[Toluca Valley]]. Incursions into the Tierra Caliente came around 1433 under [[Itzcoatl]] who attacked the Cuitlatecos settled between the [[Teloloapan River|Teloloapan]] and [[Cocula River]]s. By 1440, the Aztec Empire controlled the north of the state, or the La Monta\u00f1a area. Attempts to take the Costa Chica area began in 1452 against the Yopis, which failed. Various battles would be fought between 1452 and 1511 before most of the rest of the state became Aztec tributary provinces. The modern state of Guerrero comprised seven Aztec provinces.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:FacadePriscaTaxco.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Santa Prisca church in Taxco]]\nDuring the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the last Aztec emperor, [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] (who was the son of a Chontal princess and Ahuizotl), came from [[Ixcateopan]].  After the fall of [[Tenochtitlan]], there was little resistance by the peoples of the Guerrero area to the Spanish and a number of them, such as the Amuzgos, actively sided with the Europeans. In 1521, Rodrigo de Casta\u00f1eda entered the Taxco area, while [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] marched on the Chontal region, the Sierra del Norte, the [[Iguala]] valley and later the Costa Chica. Juan Rodriguz de Villafuerte took the Costa Grande area.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nAfter the Spanish Conquest, the territory was part of the \u201caudencia\u201d called \u201cMexico,\u201d which initially consisted of the lands of the former Aztec Empire, which was then diminished somewhat when it became a province of [[New Spain]].<ref name=\"riquezahis\"/> The Guerrero area<ref>[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.wdl/wdl.2701 ''C\u00f3dice Totomixtlahuaca'' or ''Codex Totomixtlahuaca''].

The first Spanish Pacific port was at Zihuatanejo, used for trade, fishing and pearls. Another important area for the Spanish was Taxco for its minerals. The lands were divided into 76 [[encomienda]]s given to the [[conquistador]]s to exploit and civilize the mines, farmlands, forest and native peoples. Evangelization efforts were undertaken by the [[Augustinian]]s in the Central Valleys, La Monta\u00f1a and Tierra Caliente regions while the [[Franciscans]] took the northern areas, the Costa Grande and Acapulco.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nMuch of the population decline occurred in the first half of the 16th century when diseases brought by the Europeans, as well as brutal exploitation, killed many natives. This was particularly true in the Costa Chica region, which would lead to the importation of African slaves to the area. During this time indigenous political bodies called \"pueblos\" or \"Indian Republics\" arose, which were local entities that represented the Indians of that area before Spanish authorities. They are credited with being one of the forerunners of the current municipality system in the state. At their height, there were 213 such pueblos in the Guerrero territory.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nDuring the colonial period, Acapulco became the main western port for New Spain, connecting this part of the Spanish empire to Asia. The [[Manila Galleon]] came here each year, bringing silks and other merchandise from China, India and other Asian areas.<ref name=\"riquezahis\"/> Also on board were thousands of Asian slaves.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2002|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PDVdU4YZWgC&pg=PA200&dq=slaves+manila+chinese+japanese+acapulco&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MD87U8SFGoTMsQSXx4KYCQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=slaves%20manila%20chinese%20japanese%20acapulco&f=false|quote= |volume=|page=200|title=Cultures in Contact: World Migrations in the Second Millennium|isbn=0822384078|edition=|author=Dirk Hoerder|others=Andrew Gordon, Alexander Keyssar, Daniel James}}</ref> These slaves and other Asian individuals that migrated of their own will during the colonial period form the basis of what is known as the \"[[Asian Mexican|cuarta ra\u00edz]]\" of Mexico.\n\nBy the second half of the 18th century, few indigenous people survived and exploitation of those that were left took on more varied forms in indentured servitude. Acapulco became the most important city in the area, and its mayor governed much of Guerrero's territory.  This territory then belonged into three \u201cintendencias\u201d or \u201calcaldias\u201d: Puebla, Mexico and [[Morelia|Valladolid]] and would remain so until the early Independence period.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\n===Independence and the later nineteenth century===\n[[File:Vicente Guerrero.jpg|thumb|[[Vicente Guerrero]]]]\nPeoples of the territory of Guerrero immediately supported the cause of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] which would culminate with the Independence of Mexico.<ref name=\"riquezahis\" /> During the first part of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]] fought on the side of Miguel Hidalgo in the southern part of Mexico, including the Acapulco area and the Costa Grande. However, the insurgents were never able to take the port. They were able to take control of territories in the center of the state.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" /> Morelos took Chilpancingo and set up the [[Congress of An\u00e1huac]], which would publish the document \"Sentimentos de la Naci\u00f3n\" on 6 November 1813. The Congress of An\u00e1huac also approved the Act of Independence written by [[Carlos Mar\u00eda Bustamante]]. Later, the Mexican flag was designed and first sewn in [[Iguala]], after [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] and Vicente Guerrero joined forces under the [[Plan of Iguala]] to end the war in 1821.<ref name=\"riquezahis\" />\n\nThe first government of an independent Mexico divided the country into twelve departments. The territory of modern Guerrero state was divided among the departments of Mexico, Puebla, Michoac\u00e1n and [[Oaxaca]]. The [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 Constitution]] made these entities states.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\n\nIn 1823, [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]] and Vicente Guerrero petitioned for the creation of a \"South State\" (Estado del Sur), encompassing the lands that Guerrero had military control over during the war, but without success. However, the federal government did recognize a military district centered on Chilpancingo which Guerrero headed until he became [[President of Mexico]] in 1824.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\n\nMuch of the country struggled between its liberal (federalist) and conservative (centralist) factions in the first half of the 19th century. In one of these battles, Vicente Guerrero was captured and executed in Oaxaca in 1831. With conservatives in charge, Nicolas Bravo proposed in 1836 a South Department with its capital in Chilpancingo, including the provinces of Acapulco, Chilapa, Tlapa and Taxco. In 1841, representatives from 42 communities in the area, called the \"amigos del sur,\" pushed to have a \"Acapulco Department\" created, but it was rejected by [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]].<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\n\nThere were other political and military reorganizations in the area during the 1840s. In 1847, Nicolas Bravo and [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] proposed creating a separate entity for the Acapulco, Chilapa and Taxco areas, but the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] intervened. After the war, the states of Puebla, Mexico and Michoac\u00e1n were persuaded to cede territory for a new entity.\n[[File:Juan Alvarez.PNG|thumb|left|[[Juan \u00c1lvarez]]]]\nIn 1849, President [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]] decreed the establishment of the state of Guerrero, with Juan \u00c1lvarez as its first governor. [[Tixtla]] was declared the first capital.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" /> The state was created from the districts of Acapulco, Chilapa and Taxco from the State of Mexico, Tlapa from Puebla and the municipality of Coyuca from the state of Michoac\u00e1n. The capital would later be moved to Chilpancingo in 1870.<ref name=\"riquezahis\" />\n\nIn this state, Juan \u00c1lvarez rebelled against the government of [[Ignacio Comonfort]] and declared the [[Plan of Ayutla]] in 1854. However, this rebellion was quelled by the federal government. More uprisings would ensue after the adoption of the [[1857 Constitution]]. These uprisings were part of the ongoing struggle between liberals and conservatives in the country. The state of Guerrero was a mostly conservative area of the country and it opposed both the 1857 Constitution and the [[Reform War|1859 Reform Laws]]. Intense battle between liberal and conservative elements would continue through most of the rest of the 19th century.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\n[[File:Ignacio Manuel Altamirano.jpg|thumb|[[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], born in Tixtla (Guerrero), liberal politician, writer]]\nFor most of the period of President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]'s regime (1876\u20131911), the state was in relative peace, electing nine governors, although only two of these were Guerrero natives. The economy became concentrated in the hands of a few landholders, military people and others. While the era was relatively prosperous, very little of this benefit reached the common people. Laws were passed and infrastructure in the state was created to benefit the major players of the economy.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In addition, indigenous people were forced from the north to the south to work, such as the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoos]] who were forced to work in the haciendas of the Costa Chica. Some of the first factories built in the state were constructed during this period. [[Acapulco]] was connected to Mexico City by rail in the 1890s. Despite the economic development, many people remained without work at the very end of the 19th century as mining and cotton farming waned.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\n\n===Mexican Revolution to the present===\n[[File:Zapatistas en el sitio El Jilguero.jpg|thumb|Zapatistas in El Jilguero]]\nSome of the first uprisings against Diaz occurred in the state. In 1873 in the La Monta\u00f1a region, Pascual Claudio pronounced the Plan de Xochihuahuetlan, with the backing of the Tlapanecos and Mixtecs of the state and pushed for the socialization of land. The revolt was put down one year later. In 1876, field workers in various regions rebelled against taxes, usurpation of lands and oppression against political prisoners. Another revolt occurred in 1887 in the Tlapa regions, led by Silverio Leon. In 1891, a movement led by Jos\u00e9 Cuevas has a messianic character to it and worked to bring down the Diaz government.  In this case, federal control over much of Guerrero was weakened. In the 1900s, a number of intellectuals, including Eusebio S. Almonte (great grandson of Morelos) rebelled politically against the state and federal governments. The revolt was put down by Victoriano Huerta.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nA number of other rebellions broke out in the state against the Diaz government until the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910. From that point, many of the local rebels became affiliated with the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]].<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nIn 1911, after D\u00edaz resigned, the last of his supporting troops in Guerrero surrendered in Acapulco. Rebels loyal to [[Francisco I. Madero]] chose Francisco Figueroa as the governor and established Guerrero's capital in Acapulco. While Madero was initially popular in Guerrero, he soon lost standing for failure to return lands which were claimed by various indigenous and rural farm groups. From this point, the Zapatistas turned on the Madero government with the next phase of the revolution breaking out in Guerrero and other states. The Zapatistas soon had control of the central valley and strategic positions in the north of the state. When [[Victoriano Huerta]] took control of the country, the Zapatistas in Guerrero joined forces with those loyal to [[Venustiano Carranza]], eventually controlling almost all of the state by 1914. During this time lands were redistributed. However, after Huerta resigned and Carranza assumed the presidency, the Zapatistas in Guerrero opposed him as well. Carranza offered the position of governor of Guerrero to Julian Blanco in 1915 but he was killed in an ambush a year later. From this point, there were battles between the Zapatistas and forces loyal to Carranza. This ended in 1919, when [[Emiliano Zapata]] died and his movement split.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nVarious battles among the factions of the Mexican Revolution had skirmishes in the state until the war was finally over in 1920. The Zapatistas, although fragmented, were recognized as a political force in Guerrero with many Zapatistas receiving political and military positions. This included Rodolfo Neri as governor, who initiated the Agrarian Reform in 1921, organized workers\u2019 unions and made education mandatory.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nAlthough the Revolution was over, there were still factional struggles among unions, local strongmen, foreign interests and rural farm organizations over land, education and politics. These would flare up into localized armed rebellions such as the one led by Romulo Figueroa in 1923 and federal attempts to recuperate lands in 1927. In addition, battles related to the [[Cristero War]] were fought in Guerrero as well. There were a number of strikes and other political actions by unions in the 1930s. Government intervention brought better agricultural production techniques as well as new crops such as coconut groves, sesame seed and coffee. Some industries were introduced as well, especially in Iguala and Chilpancingo.  Most of these are related to food processing, mining and energy production.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nFrom the 1930s, to the present, the making of crafts and tourism have played a significant role in the economy. In Taxco, silver mining and silversmithing made a comeback due to the efforts of [[William Spratling]].<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> Tourism is mostly centered on the coastal communities of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and the tourist resort of Ixtapa. Acapulco became the first major tourist attraction for the state in the 1950s, when Hollywood stars such as [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Brigitte Bardot]] and others made it fashionable. During the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel there.<ref name=\"nileg\">{{cite web |url= http://www.nileguide.com/destination/acapulco/overview/history |title= History for Acapulco |publisher=Niles\u2019 Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}</ref>  Zihuatanejo, with the nearby resort area of Ixtapa, were developed by the federal government in the 1970s and 1980s to increase tourism to the area.<ref name=\"encmuczihua\">{{cite web |author=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal (2005) |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M\u00e9xico ESTADO DE GUERRERO TENIENTE JOS\u00c9 AZUETA |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/municipios/12038a.htm |language=Spanish |trans-title=Encyclopedia of the Municipalities of Mexico State of Guerrero Teniento Jos\u00e9 Azueta |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317063209/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/municipios/12038a.htm |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, some teachers from rural areas, including Guerrero, opposed federal regulations which prevented them from automatic [[lifetime tenure]], the ability to sell or will their jobs, and the teaching of either English or computer skills.<ref>{{Cite news | first=David | last=Agren | title='Normalistas' fight changes in Mexico education system | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/usatoday/article/1748405?odyssey=mod%7cnewswell%7ctext%7cHome%7cp| work= | newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 4A | date=December 10, 2012 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref><!---hard copy source different from soft copy but is the identical article---> In September 2014, the municipality of Iguala was the site of a [[2014 Iguala mass kidnapping|mass kidnapping of 43 students]] that drew national and international attention.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote =\n|1895<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/subspop/mx-pop.aspx |title=Mexico: extended population list |publisher=GeoHive |accessdate=2011-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311141056/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/subspop/mx-pop.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-11 }}</ref> | 420926\n|1900 | 479205\n|1910 | 594278\n|1921 | 566836\n|1930 | 641690\n|1940 | 732910\n|1950 | 919386\n|1960 | 1186716\n|1970 | 1597360\n|1980 | 2109513\n|1990 | 2620637\n|1995 | 2916567\n|2000 | 3079649\n|2005 | 3115202\n|2010 | 3388768\n|2015<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic_2015_presentacion.pdf |title=Encuesta Intercensal 2015 |publisher=INEGI |accessdate=2015-12-08}}</ref> | 3533251\n}}\n\nThe state is home to four indigenous ethnic groups{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, most of whom live in rugged, isolated mountain areas such as Ixcateopan, [[Santa Mar\u00eda Oapan]], [[Ameyaltepec]], [[Chilapa de \u00c1lvarez]], [[Malinaltepec]], [[Tlapa de Comonfort]], [[Metlatonoc]], [[Zapotitlan Tablas]] and [[Xochistlahuaca]] and [[Xilitla]].<ref name=\"arqueomex\">{{cite web |url=http://www.arqueomex.com/S8N4GVesp82.html |title=Gu\u00eda de Viajeros Guerrero |author=Rosa Ma.

This group is known for [[Amuzgo textiles|its handwoven textiles]] done on backstrap looms with many pieces recognized by the [[CONACULTA|Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes]]. [[Cualac, Guerrero|Cualac]] is noted for its machetes which have blades decorated by etching miniature landscapes. [[Temalacacingo]] and [[Acapetlahuaya]] produce gourd items, toys and small lacquered items.

This group is found in Guerrero and the Costa Chica area of Oaxaca. This group has been relatively isolated from the rest of Mexico, with little modernization or formal education. To this day,{{When|date=December 2019}} there are many who have no birth certificates or know how to read or write. Much of the history of these people is preserved in oral tradition. Historically, afromexicanos have been [[Racism in Mexico|discriminated against and marginalized]]. Even among these people today, the concept of being \u201cnegro\u201d is considered bad and a number take to [[skin-lightening]] methods. The musical style associated with the group is \u201c[[chilena]]\u201d which became popular outside of Guerrero and Oaxaca after the 1960s. One of these songs, \u201c[[Soy negro de la Costa]]\u2026,\u201d has been preserved by CONACULTA and INAH as part of Mexico's cultural heritage. A major change for this community came with the building of the highway connecting [[Acapulco]] with [[Pinotepa Nacional]] and [[Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca|Puerto Escondido]], which opened it up to the outside world. This allowed the shipping of goods and influx of people.

Some of these artists include [[Casiano Garc\u00eda]], [[Ian Malaj]], [[Leonel Maciel]], [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Sotelo]], [[Gerza\u00edn Vargas]] and [[Hugo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]].\n\nThe literary arts have a longer tradition, at least as far back as the 17th century. The best-known writer from the state hailed from [[Taxco]], playwright [[Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n]]. He is considered to be one of the most notable writers from the Siglo de Oro of Spanish literature. Another notable writer from the state is [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], although he is better known for his role in the defeat of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] and as a politician than as a writer. Other writers from the state over the centuries include [[Celedonio Serrano]], [[Herminio Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Juan S\u00e1nchez Andraka]] and [[Andr\u00e9s Acosta]].<ref name=\"rincones1218\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Victor Manuel |editor1-last=Jimenez Gonzalez |title=Sonora: Gu\u00eda para descubrir los encantos del estado |trans-title=Guerrero: Guide to discover the charms of the state |year=2010 |publisher=Editorial Oc\u00e9ano de Mexico SA de CV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=978-607-400-178-5 |pages=12\u201318}}</ref>\n\nThe state has a long history of folk music, which has been the basis of much of the state's modern compositions as well.<ref name=\"rincones1218\"/> Because of the different ethnicities, traditions and customs vary from region to region. In the coastal lowlands, music such as \u201cson\u201d is most often heard and dances such as [[jarabe]]s.  The culture of the Costa Chica region of Guerrero is centered on the municipality of Tixtla. Dances performed here include the Arranca Zacete, Jarabes, Palomo or Chilena and the Fandango. Most of these are accompanied by bands playing wind instruments.<ref name=\"tradiciones\"/>  Another type of music which is endemic to the state is called \"calentana\", which comes from an area called the Tierra Caliente. Tixtleca music comes from the town of Tixtla in the center of the state. Guerrero's best known composer is [[Margarito Dami\u00e1n Vargas]], who was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was only 37 years old when he died, but he had written more than 200 musical works including \"Ondas del Pac\u00edfico,\" \"Me delirio,\" \"Adi\u00f3s a Acapulco,\" and \"Dolores,\" which have been performed by orchestras and popular singers. Other musicians include [[Jos\u00e9 Agust\u00edn Ram\u00edrez Altamirano]], [[Zacar\u00edas Salmer\u00f3n Daza]] and [[Joan Sebastian]].<ref name=\"rincones1218\"/>  As well, another singer from Guerrero, [[Aida Pierce]], became better known as an actress and comedian.\n\nSome interesting regional customs in Guerrero include the burning of \u201cmalo\u201d (evil) on 29 September made with dried flowers. Afterward, protective crosses of fresh flowers are placed on doors of homes. Other customs are the singing of \u201cPapaquis\u201d instead of \u201c[[Las Ma\u00f1anitas]]\u201d in Tixtla, the weddings of the Costa Grande where guests pay for their own food, the tiger fight dance in Zitlala and Tixtla and eating [[pozole]] on Thursdays in Chilpancingo.<ref name=\"atractivos\">{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/cult.htm |title= Estado de Guerrero Atractivos Culturales y Tur\u00edsticos|year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M\u00e9xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=State of Guerrero Cultural and tourist attractions |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nCuisine in the state is most strongly influenced by the indigenous, the Spanish and, to some extent, the French. Corn, chili pepper, beans and meat are indigenous ingredients. Indigenous preparations include the various moles (red, green, yellow and others), [[chalupa]]s, [[totopos]], [[atole]], [[pozole]] and many other dishes. Spanish contributions include wheat, leavened bread (including \u201cchilpancingue\u00f1as\") and dairy products. French influence comes from the French occupation of the country in the 19th century as well as French monks who had been in the area of Chilapa earlier. Regional dishes include [[mole (sauce)|mole de jumil]] (made from a particular type of native beetle) in Taxco, bean [[tamale]]s in [[Tepecoacuilco de Trujano|Tepecuacuilco]], quail dishes in Iguala and seafood \u201ccuatete\u201d in the Costa Chica area. A number of areas in the state produce [[mezcal]] and wine is made in the [[Huitzuco]] area.<ref name=\"atractivos\"/> Pozole blanco is widely and traditionally consumed on Thursdays and Saturdays in the state.<ref name=\"arqueomex\"/>\n\nThe state's ethnic groups are known for their unique musical styles as well as regional dances. The best known dance is the Danza de los Tlacoloteros. This originated in the Central Valleys region, and its theme is agriculture. The owners of \u201ctlacololes\u201d (cornfields) are called \u201ctlacololoeros.\u201d The basic premise is that these tlacololoeros chase away malevolent spirits from the crops, which are represented by [[nagual]]s or fierce tigers. The dance has 15 characters. It is most often performed in places such as [[Chichuihualco]], Taxco, Chilpancingo, Iguala and [[Atlixtac]]. Another dance that feature tigers is the Danza del Tecuano, where the animals stalk characters. This one is most often performed in [[Tuxpan, Guerrero|Tuxpan]], [[Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero|Ciudad Altamirano]] and Huitzuco. Other dances performed in the state include the Danza de los Diablos, the Danza de los Manueles, the Danza de los Gachupines, the Danza de los Siete Vicios, the Danza de los Pescados, the Danza de los Machos, the Danza de los Moros, the Danza de los Maizos, the Danza de los Zopilotes, the Danza de los Tejoneros and the Danza del Palomo de Guerrero.<ref name=\"danzas\">{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&ArtOrder=ReadArt&Article=64 |title= danzas  |publisher= Government of Guerrero |location=Guerrero, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Dances |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n\n===Triangle of the Sun===\n[[File:Acapulco Nautico area in Acapulco, Mexico.jpg|thumb|Acapulco Bay]]\nAlmost all of Guerrero's tourism is concentrated among the municipalities of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Taxco, which the state promotes as the \u201cTri\u00e1ngulo del Sol\u201d (Triangle of the Sun).

The best pieces of this type are made of a wood called linal\u00f3e ([[Bursera aloexylon]]) which is aromatic. Cheaper ones are made of pine, treated to smell like linal\u00f3e. The making of lacquered items is centered in the municipality of Olinal\u00e1, but also can be found in Temalcalcingo, [[Ocotepec, Guerrero|Ocotepec]] and [[Acapetlahuaya]]. Olinal\u00e1's lacquered items are traditional made with a wood called linaloe, with has a distinctive odor, but due to its relatively scarcity, pine is also being used. Items made include small boxes, chests, trays, masks, frames, jewelry boxes.<ref name=\"artesanias\"/><ref name=\"rincones3639\"/>\n\nPottery is a very traditional craft and is practices in many of the communities of the state, although most of the wares produced are basic and meant for local consumption. These items include cooking pots, water containers, pitchers, candle holders and some sculptured decorative items. Most of these items have been made the same way since the pre-Hispanic period. The best quality ware is considered to be made in the central valleys in municipalities such as [[Zacualpan, Guerrero|Zacualpan]], [[Nuitzalapa]], [[Atzacualoya]], and others. Some areas have become specialized for certain types of pieces. The San Juan neighborhood of Chilapa make figures of a cerarmic which is glassy after firing.

The most distinctive indigenous clothing item is the huipil although rebozos and other items are also made.. While much is made for local consumption, indigenous clothing can be found in tourist areas and other markets as well as tablecloths, napkins and other decorative pieces. Communities with reputation for their textiles include Tlacoachistlahuaca, Xochistlahuaca, Yolox\u00f3chilt ([[San Luis Acatl\u00e1n]]) and Acatl\u00e1n (Chilapa).<ref name=\"artesanias\"/>\n\nAnother craft, practiced mostly along the central and coastal areas, is that of palm frond weaving. With these fronds items like hats, bags, fans, mats, animal figures and more are made. A particular type of hat made in this fashion in Chilapa, Zitlala, Zapotitl\u00e1n Tablas and Ahuacoutzingo is called a \u201ccoste\u00f1o\u201d hat.<ref name=\"artesanias\"/>\n\nMost handcrafted furniture is made in Taxco and Ixcatepoan, in which an aromatic cedar is found. Other furniture producing areas are Chilpancingo, Iguala, Teloloapan and Ciudad Altamirano. In addition to furniture, items such as masks and figures are carved from wood.<ref name=\"artesanias\"/>\n\nOne craft which is specific to the state is painting using traditional amate or bark paper as a canvas. This craft began in the 1970s in Xalitla, located between Iguala and Chilpancingo. Since that time, these paintings or drawings have become known both inside and outside of Mexico.<ref name=\"artesanias\"/>  The best known works today come from the communities of Maxela, San Juan, Ahuelic\u00e1n and Ahuehuepan.

The Guerrero State is listed as a Level 4 - Do Not Travel by the United States Department of State stating \"Armed groups operate independently of the government in many areas of Guerrero. Members of these groups frequently maintain roadblocks and may use violence towards travelers. Violent crime, such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery, is widespread.\" The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Guerrero as travel by U.S. government employees to the state of Guerrero is completely prohibited. It is recommended that nobody travel to Guerrero if possible.\n\n==Geography, climate and nature==\n[[File:Mezcala (or Balsas) River in Guerrero, Mexico.jpg|thumb|Mezcala or Balsas River in Guerrero]]\nThe state of Guerrero has a territory of {{convert|63794|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. The state borders the states of Mexico, [[Morelos]], Puebla, Michoac\u00e1n, Oaxaca, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west.  Geographically, the state is divided into three regions: La Monta\u00f1a (mountains), [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] (hot lands) of the northeast and La Costa (coast).<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/> La Monta\u00f1a is mostly forested and is concentrated in the north and east of the state. Tierra Caliente and is situated in the lowlands along the Balsas River. This area also extends into Michoac\u00e1n state and is called similarly. La Costa is divided into two subregions called Costa Chica and Costa Grande. The Costa Chica extends from Acapulco to the border with Oaxaca. Costa Grande extends west of Acapulco to the Balsas River. Much of the state's current agriculture and livestock raising concentrated in La Costa as it is relatively flat.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nMost of the state is covered in mountains of varying heights, with deep canyons with flat areas limited to small mesas and the coastline. Most of the mountains belong to the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]]. The exception is the mountains of the Taxco area which belong to the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] and include the small mountain ranges of the Sierra de Sultepec, Sierra de Zacualpan and the Sierra de Zultepec. These are connected to the same volcanic system as the [[Nevado de Toluca]].<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nThe state's climate is dominated by the rainy tropical areas and rainy temperate areas. The former has high temperatures above {{convert|18|C|F|1}} year round and experiences most rain in the summer and early fall.  Most of this is found near the coast under {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|asl]]. In the higher elevations away from the coast in the Sierra Madre del Sur, the climate is temperate but also experiences the same pattern of rainfall. Most of the rain that falls in the state is produced from evaporation from the Pacific Ocean.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nThe coast extends for about {{convert|500|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and includes features such as the Balsas River delta, Mongles Point, Ixtapa Point, Zihuatanejo Bay, [[Isla Ixtapa|Ixtapa Island]], Acapulco Bay, Apies Island, Islas Blancas, San Gabriel Island, Islas Frailes Blancos or Rocas de Potosi, Punta Gorda, and others. There are a number of lagoons along the coast including the Laguna de Potosi in Morro de Petatl\u00e1n, Lagunas de Mitla, the Laguna de Nusco and the Laguna de Coyuca.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n[[File:La Roqueta Island in Acapulco, Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|La Roqueta Island off Acapulco]]\nThe Balsas River enters Guerrero from Puebla state where it is formed. Prior to reaching the town of Balsas, the river is called Mexcala, then Balsas to the ocean. The Nexapa River is a tributary of the upper portion of the Balsas. The Amacuzac River enters the state from the State of Mexico. It passes under the Grutas de Cacahuamilco, then reemerges to form part of the border between Guerrero and Morelos. The Tepecoacuilco or Huitzuco River forms within the state and is a tributary of the Balsas.  The Cocula or Iguala River forms in the Taxco area and is one of the major drainages of this region. Other rivers in the state include the Cuetzala, the Alohuixtla, the Cutzamala, the Tlapaneco Huamuxtitlan, the Milpilla or Zumpango, the R\u00edo del Oro, the Zayulapa, the Huautla and the R\u00edo Uni\u00f3n.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nThe [[Middle America Trench]] lies in the Pacific Ocean, parallel to Guerrero's coast. This trench is a [[subduction|subduction zone]], where the [[oceanic crust|oceanic]] [[Cocos Plate]] is sliding under the [[plate tectonics|continental]] [[North American Plate]]. Subduction zones can produce large [[earthquake]]s, like the [[2012 Guerrero\u2013Oaxaca earthquake]] on March 20, 2012.\n\nFlora of the state is determined by altitude and climate. The higher mountain areas have forests of pine and [[oyamel]] fir, with amate, and other tropical trees found in the lower elevations. Tropical hardwoods are mostly found in the lower elevations near the coast. The state has a wide variety of wildlife from deer, small mammals, large numbers of birds and reptiles and insects.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nFive terrestrial [[ecoregion]]s extend across the state. The [[Southern Pacific dry forests]] lie on the southern slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur, extending from the coast up to 1400 meters elevation. The forests are predominantly [[deciduous]] during the long dry season. The [[Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests]] occupy the higher slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur. These forests harbor a great diversity of species, including many endemic [[orchid]]s, butterflies, and birds. The [[Balsas dry forests]] lie in the basin of the Balsas River, north of the Sierra Madre del Sur, and are notable for the diversity of mammal species, including [[jaguarundi]], [[coati]], [[ocelot]], and [[collared peccary]]. The northernmost part of the state includes portions of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests]], which occupy the mountainous northern rim of the Balsas basin. The [[Mexican South Pacific mangroves]] are found in coastal lagoons along the coast of [[Michoac\u00e1n]], Guerrero, and [[Oaxaca]].\n\nThe Parque Natural de Guerrero is a natural reserve located in the central valleys of the state, extending for about eighty kilometers squared. Most of the area is covered in pine and holm oak forests that covered the high altitude valleys of this region.<ref name=\"rincones76\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Victor Manuel |editor1-last=Jimenez Gonzalez |title=Sonora: Gu\u00eda para descubrir los encantos del estado |trans-title=Guerrero: Guide to discover the charms of the state |year=2010 |publisher=Editorial Oc\u00e9ano de Mexico SA de CV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=978-607-400-178-5 |page=76}}</ref>\n\n<div align=center>\n<!-- galer\u00eda de mapas -->\n{| class=\"toc\" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=800px style=\"float:center; margin: 0.5em 0.5em 0.5em 1em; padding: 0.5e\n|colspan=8 style=\"background:#green; color:white; font-size:100%\" align=center bgcolor=\"green\"|'''Flora and fauna of Guerrero'''\n|-\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Cuniculus paca.jpg|125px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Iguana Aquarium Barcelona.jpg|125px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Hawksbill Turtle.jpg|125px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Canis latrans.jpg|125px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Granger Lake 013.jpg|125px]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Cuniculus paca]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Iguana]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Eretmochelys imbricata]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Canis latrans]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Armadillo]]\n|-\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Standing jaguar.jpg|120px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Pelican Brown122.JPG|120px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Tayassu pecari -Brazil-8.jpg|120px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Ocelot.jpg|120px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Boa constrictor (2).jpg|120px]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Panthera onca]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Pelican]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Tayassu pecari]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Leopardus pardalis]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Boa constrictor]]\n|-\n|-\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Ceiba pentandra 0008.jpg|120px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Field-pines-mountain.jpg|120px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Singapore Botanic Gardens Cactus Garden 2.jpg|120px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Tronco-Detalles-\u00c1rbol-del-Tule-Oaxaca-Mexico.jpg|120px]]\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Maguey landscape.jpg|120px]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Ceiba pentandra]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Abies religiosa]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Echinocactus grusonii]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Taxodium mucronatum]]\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|[[Agave|Agave potatorium]]\n|-\n|}\n</div>\n\n==Economy==\nAgricultural production is mostly of staple crops such as corn, rice and beans along with tomatoes, [[tomatillo]]s, [[okra]], green chili peppers, chickpeas, soybeans, yams, and other vegetables.

On a global scale, Guerrero shares the first place with [[Afghanistan]]. Mexico provides more than 90 percent of US's heroin. The poppy flower has become an economic support for many families in the \"Sierra de Guerrero\" (Guerrero mountain chain), since it is much more profitable than any other crop. Due to the high poverty rates, many peasants prefer to grow the poppy flower in order to cover their basic needs.\n\nThe state has large forests with logging potential, although most are [[ejido]] or other community property. Most of the loggable timber is pine.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nFishing is an important industry for the state with livestock raised is limited due to poor pastures due to overgrazing.

The main fishing ports are [[La Uni\u00f3n de Isidoro Montes de Oca|Petacalco]], Zihuatanejo, Acapulco, Barra de Tecoanapa and Puna Maldonado. Commercial fishing brings in shark, sailfish, sierra, sea bass, [[mojarra]], lobster, shrimp, clams and many other species.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nThe mountains in the interior of the state have mineral deposits, such as gold and lead as well as iron.

It is divided in [[Municipalities of Guerrero|81 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Chilpancingo]] and its largest city is [[Acapulco]].\n\nIt is located in Southwestern Mexico. It is bordered by the states of [[Michoac\u00e1n]] to the north and west, [[State of M\u00e9xico|M\u00e9xico]] and [[Morelos]] to the north, [[Puebla]] to the northeast and [[Oaxaca]] to the east.\n\nThe state was named after [[Vicente Guerrero]], one of the most prominent leaders in the [[Mexican War of Independence]] and the second [[President of Mexico]].<ref name=\"nomen\">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |title=Estado de Guerrero Nomenclatura |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M\u00e9xico |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=State of Guerrero Nomenclature |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003153/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |archivedate=March 6, 2012 }}</ref> It is the only [[Mexican state]] named after a president. The modern entity did not exist until 1849, when it was carved out of territories from the states of [[Mexico State|Mexico]], [[Puebla]] and [[Michoac\u00e1n]].\n\nIn addition to the capital city, the state's largest cities include [[Acapulco]], [[Petatlan]], [[Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero|Ciudad Altamirano]], [[Taxco]], [[Iguala]], [[Ixtapa]], [[Zihuatanejo]], and [[Santo Domingo, Guerrero|Santo Domingo]]. Today, it is home to a number of indigenous communities, including the [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]], [[Mixtec]]s and [[Amuzgo people|Amuzgos]]. It is also home to communities of [[Afro-Mexican]]s in the [[Costa Chica of Guerrero|Costa Chica]] region.\n\nGeographically, the state is mountainous and rugged with flat areas limited to small [[mesa]]s and the coast line. This coastline has been important economically for the area, first as the port of Acapulco in colonial and post-Independence area and today for the tourist destinations of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa. Tourism is the single most important economic factor of the state and Acapulco's tourism is important to the nation's economy as a whole. However, other sources of employment are scarce in the state, which has caused its ranking as number one in the emigration of workers to the United States.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistoric and Pre-Columbian periods===\n[[File:Two_Xochipala_figurines_(Met_by_Ched).jpg|thumb|left|Two figures from the Xochipala archeological site]]\nThe first humans in the state's territory were nomadic hunter-gatherers who left evidence of their existence in various caves starting about 20,000 years ago.<ref name=\"enchistoria\">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |title=Estado de Guerrero Historia |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M\u00e9xico |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=State of Guerrero History |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003153/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |archivedate=March 6, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"riquezahis\">{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&ArtOrder=ReadArt&Article=71 |title= La Riqueza Hist\u00f3rica de Guerrero |publisher= Government of Guerrero |location=Guerrero, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Historical Richness of Guerrero |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}</ref> Until about 8,000 years ago, climatic conditions better favored human habitation than those today;<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> however, sedentary human habitation happened around this time in the mountainous areas with more moisture, and better soil for agriculture.

It is characterized by its own sculpture and ceramics, distinguished by its simplicity. Olmec influence remained with this culture, especially evident in the grouping of villages, construction of ceremonial centers and a government dominated by priests. Later, the culture assimilated aspects of the [[Teotihuacan]] model, which included the [[Mesoamerican ball game]] .<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nLater migrations to the area brought ethnicities such as the [[Pur\u00e9pecha people|Pur\u00e9pecha]], the Mixtecs, the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] and the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] who left traces on the local cultures as they established commercial centers around the 7th century. In the 8th century, [[Toltec]] influence was felt as they traveled the many trade routes through here in search of tropical bird plumage and [[amatl|amate paper]]. From the 12th century to the 15th, the various peoples of the state were influence by the [[Chichimeca]]s, culminating in [[Aztec Empire|Aztec domination]] by the 15th century.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nIn the 11th century, new migrations entered the area from the north, which included the Nahuas, who occupied what is now the center of the state and the Pur\u00e9pecha who took over the west. The Nahuas established themselves in [[La Uni\u00f3n de Isidoro Montes de Oca|Zacatula]], [[Atoyac de \u00c1lvarez|Atoyac]] and [[Tlacotepec]], later conquering the areas occupied by the [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal]]s and [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]]s.<ref name=\"riquezahis\"/>\n\nBy the 15th century, the territory of modern Guerrero state was inhabited by a number of peoples, none of whom had major cities or population centers. The most important of these peoples where the Pur\u00e9pecha, [[Cuitlatec people|Cuitlatec]]s, [[Ocuiteca]]s and Matlatzincas in the [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]], the Chontales, [[Mazatleco]]s and [[Tlahuica]]s in the Sierra del Norte, the [[Coixca]]s and [[Tepozteco]]s in the Central Valleys, the Tlapanecos and Mixtecs in the La Monta\u00f1a, the [[Jopi]]s, Mixtecos and Amuzgos in Costa Chica and [[Tolimeca]]s, [[Chubia]]s, [[Panteca]]s and Cuitlecas in [[Costa Grande of Guerrero|Costa Grande]]. Most of these lived in smaller dominions with moderate social stratification. One distinctive feature of the peoples of this was the use of cotton garments.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nThe Aztecs began making incursions in the Guerrero area as early as 1414 under [[Chimalpopoca]] as part of the conquest of the [[Toluca Valley]]. Incursions into the Tierra Caliente came around 1433 under [[Itzcoatl]] who attacked the Cuitlatecos settled between the [[Teloloapan River|Teloloapan]] and [[Cocula River]]s. By 1440, the Aztec Empire controlled the north of the state, or the La Monta\u00f1a area. Attempts to take the Costa Chica area began in 1452 against the Yopis, which failed. Various battles would be fought between 1452 and 1511 before most of the rest of the state became Aztec tributary provinces. The modern state of Guerrero comprised seven Aztec provinces.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:FacadePriscaTaxco.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Santa Prisca church in Taxco]]\nDuring the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the last Aztec emperor, [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] (who was the son of a Chontal princess and Ahuizotl), came from [[Ixcateopan]].  After the fall of [[Tenochtitlan]], there was little resistance by the peoples of the Guerrero area to the Spanish and a number of them, such as the Amuzgos, actively sided with the Europeans. In 1521, Rodrigo de Casta\u00f1eda entered the Taxco area, while [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] marched on the Chontal region, the Sierra del Norte, the [[Iguala]] valley and later the Costa Chica. Juan Rodriguz de Villafuerte took the Costa Grande area.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nAfter the Spanish Conquest, the territory was part of the \u201caudencia\u201d called \u201cMexico,\u201d which initially consisted of the lands of the former Aztec Empire, which was then diminished somewhat when it became a province of [[New Spain]].<ref name=\"riquezahis\"/> The Guerrero area<ref>[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.wdl/wdl.2701 ''C\u00f3dice Totomixtlahuaca'' or ''Codex Totomixtlahuaca''].

The first Spanish Pacific port was at Zihuatanejo, used for trade, fishing and pearls. Another important area for the Spanish was Taxco for its minerals. The lands were divided into 76 [[encomienda]]s given to the [[conquistador]]s to exploit and civilize the mines, farmlands, forest and native peoples. Evangelization efforts were undertaken by the [[Augustinian]]s in the Central Valleys, La Monta\u00f1a and Tierra Caliente regions while the [[Franciscans]] took the northern areas, the Costa Grande and Acapulco.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nMuch of the population decline occurred in the first half of the 16th century when diseases brought by the Europeans, as well as brutal exploitation, killed many natives. This was particularly true in the Costa Chica region, which would lead to the importation of African slaves to the area. During this time indigenous political bodies called \"pueblos\" or \"Indian Republics\" arose, which were local entities that represented the Indians of that area before Spanish authorities. They are credited with being one of the forerunners of the current municipality system in the state. At their height, there were 213 such pueblos in the Guerrero territory.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nDuring the colonial period, Acapulco became the main western port for New Spain, connecting this part of the Spanish empire to Asia. The [[Manila Galleon]] came here each year, bringing silks and other merchandise from China, India and other Asian areas.<ref name=\"riquezahis\"/> Also on board were thousands of Asian slaves.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2002|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PDVdU4YZWgC&pg=PA200&dq=slaves+manila+chinese+japanese+acapulco&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MD87U8SFGoTMsQSXx4KYCQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=slaves%20manila%20chinese%20japanese%20acapulco&f=false|quote= |volume=|page=200|title=Cultures in Contact: World Migrations in the Second Millennium|isbn=0822384078|edition=|author=Dirk Hoerder|others=Andrew Gordon, Alexander Keyssar, Daniel James}}</ref> These slaves and other Asian individuals that migrated of their own will during the colonial period form the basis of what is known as the \"[[Asian Mexican|cuarta ra\u00edz]]\" of Mexico.\n\nBy the second half of the 18th century, few indigenous people survived and exploitation of those that were left took on more varied forms in indentured servitude. Acapulco became the most important city in the area, and its mayor governed much of Guerrero's territory.  This territory then belonged into three \u201cintendencias\u201d or \u201calcaldias\u201d: Puebla, Mexico and [[Morelia|Valladolid]] and would remain so until the early Independence period.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\n===Independence and the later nineteenth century===\n[[File:Vicente Guerrero.jpg|thumb|[[Vicente Guerrero]]]]\nPeoples of the territory of Guerrero immediately supported the cause of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] which would culminate with the Independence of Mexico.<ref name=\"riquezahis\" /> During the first part of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]] fought on the side of Miguel Hidalgo in the southern part of Mexico, including the Acapulco area and the Costa Grande. However, the insurgents were never able to take the port. They were able to take control of territories in the center of the state.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" /> Morelos took Chilpancingo and set up the [[Congress of An\u00e1huac]], which would publish the document \"Sentimentos de la Naci\u00f3n\" on 6 November 1813. The Congress of An\u00e1huac also approved the Act of Independence written by [[Carlos Mar\u00eda Bustamante]]. Later, the Mexican flag was designed and first sewn in [[Iguala]], after [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] and Vicente Guerrero joined forces under the [[Plan of Iguala]] to end the war in 1821.<ref name=\"riquezahis\" />\n\nThe first government of an independent Mexico divided the country into twelve departments. The territory of modern Guerrero state was divided among the departments of Mexico, Puebla, Michoac\u00e1n and [[Oaxaca]]. The [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 Constitution]] made these entities states.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\n\nIn 1823, [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]] and Vicente Guerrero petitioned for the creation of a \"South State\" (Estado del Sur), encompassing the lands that Guerrero had military control over during the war, but without success. However, the federal government did recognize a military district centered on Chilpancingo which Guerrero headed until he became [[President of Mexico]] in 1824.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\n\nMuch of the country struggled between its liberal (federalist) and conservative (centralist) factions in the first half of the 19th century. In one of these battles, Vicente Guerrero was captured and executed in Oaxaca in 1831. With conservatives in charge, Nicolas Bravo proposed in 1836 a South Department with its capital in Chilpancingo, including the provinces of Acapulco, Chilapa, Tlapa and Taxco. In 1841, representatives from 42 communities in the area, called the \"amigos del sur,\" pushed to have a \"Acapulco Department\" created, but it was rejected by [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]].<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\n\nThere were other political and military reorganizations in the area during the 1840s. In 1847, Nicolas Bravo and [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] proposed creating a separate entity for the Acapulco, Chilapa and Taxco areas, but the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] intervened. After the war, the states of Puebla, Mexico and Michoac\u00e1n were persuaded to cede territory for a new entity.\n[[File:Juan Alvarez.PNG|thumb|left|[[Juan \u00c1lvarez]]]]\nIn 1849, President [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]] decreed the establishment of the state of Guerrero, with Juan \u00c1lvarez as its first governor. [[Tixtla]] was declared the first capital.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" /> The state was created from the districts of Acapulco, Chilapa and Taxco from the State of Mexico, Tlapa from Puebla and the municipality of Coyuca from the state of Michoac\u00e1n. The capital would later be moved to Chilpancingo in 1870.<ref name=\"riquezahis\" />\n\nIn this state, Juan \u00c1lvarez rebelled against the government of [[Ignacio Comonfort]] and declared the [[Plan of Ayutla]] in 1854. However, this rebellion was quelled by the federal government. More uprisings would ensue after the adoption of the [[1857 Constitution]]. These uprisings were part of the ongoing struggle between liberals and conservatives in the country. The state of Guerrero was a mostly conservative area of the country and it opposed both the 1857 Constitution and the [[Reform War|1859 Reform Laws]]. Intense battle between liberal and conservative elements would continue through most of the rest of the 19th century.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\n[[File:Ignacio Manuel Altamirano.jpg|thumb|[[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], born in Tixtla (Guerrero), liberal politician, writer]]\nFor most of the period of President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]'s regime (1876\u20131911), the state was in relative peace, electing nine governors, although only two of these were Guerrero natives. The economy became concentrated in the hands of a few landholders, military people and others. While the era was relatively prosperous, very little of this benefit reached the common people. Laws were passed and infrastructure in the state was created to benefit the major players of the economy.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In addition, indigenous people were forced from the north to the south to work, such as the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoos]] who were forced to work in the haciendas of the Costa Chica. Some of the first factories built in the state were constructed during this period. [[Acapulco]] was connected to Mexico City by rail in the 1890s. Despite the economic development, many people remained without work at the very end of the 19th century as mining and cotton farming waned.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\n\n===Mexican Revolution to the present===\n[[File:Zapatistas en el sitio El Jilguero.jpg|thumb|Zapatistas in El Jilguero]]\nSome of the first uprisings against Diaz occurred in the state. In 1873 in the La Monta\u00f1a region, Pascual Claudio pronounced the Plan de Xochihuahuetlan, with the backing of the Tlapanecos and Mixtecs of the state and pushed for the socialization of land. The revolt was put down one year later. In 1876, field workers in various regions rebelled against taxes, usurpation of lands and oppression against political prisoners. Another revolt occurred in 1887 in the Tlapa regions, led by Silverio Leon. In 1891, a movement led by Jos\u00e9 Cuevas has a messianic character to it and worked to bring down the Diaz government.  In this case, federal control over much of Guerrero was weakened. In the 1900s, a number of intellectuals, including Eusebio S. Almonte (great grandson of Morelos) rebelled politically against the state and federal governments. The revolt was put down by Victoriano Huerta.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nA number of other rebellions broke out in the state against the Diaz government until the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910. From that point, many of the local rebels became affiliated with the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]].<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nIn 1911, after D\u00edaz resigned, the last of his supporting troops in Guerrero surrendered in Acapulco. Rebels loyal to [[Francisco I. Madero]] chose Francisco Figueroa as the governor and established Guerrero's capital in Acapulco. While Madero was initially popular in Guerrero, he soon lost standing for failure to return lands which were claimed by various indigenous and rural farm groups. From this point, the Zapatistas turned on the Madero government with the next phase of the revolution breaking out in Guerrero and other states. The Zapatistas soon had control of the central valley and strategic positions in the north of the state. When [[Victoriano Huerta]] took control of the country, the Zapatistas in Guerrero joined forces with those loyal to [[Venustiano Carranza]], eventually controlling almost all of the state by 1914. During this time lands were redistributed. However, after Huerta resigned and Carranza assumed the presidency, the Zapatistas in Guerrero opposed him as well. Carranza offered the position of governor of Guerrero to Julian Blanco in 1915 but he was killed in an ambush a year later. From this point, there were battles between the Zapatistas and forces loyal to Carranza. This ended in 1919, when [[Emiliano Zapata]] died and his movement split.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nVarious battles among the factions of the Mexican Revolution had skirmishes in the state until the war was finally over in 1920. The Zapatistas, although fragmented, were recognized as a political force in Guerrero with many Zapatistas receiving political and military positions. This included Rodolfo Neri as governor, who initiated the Agrarian Reform in 1921, organized workers\u2019 unions and made education mandatory.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nAlthough the Revolution was over, there were still factional struggles among unions, local strongmen, foreign interests and rural farm organizations over land, education and politics. These would flare up into localized armed rebellions such as the one led by Romulo Figueroa in 1923 and federal attempts to recuperate lands in 1927. In addition, battles related to the [[Cristero War]] were fought in Guerrero as well. There were a number of strikes and other political actions by unions in the 1930s. Government intervention brought better agricultural production techniques as well as new crops such as coconut groves, sesame seed and coffee. Some industries were introduced as well, especially in Iguala and Chilpancingo.  Most of these are related to food processing, mining and energy production.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nFrom the 1930s, to the present, the making of crafts and tourism have played a significant role in the economy. In Taxco, silver mining and silversmithing made a comeback due to the efforts of [[William Spratling]].<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> Tourism is mostly centered on the coastal communities of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and the tourist resort of Ixtapa. Acapulco became the first major tourist attraction for the state in the 1950s, when Hollywood stars such as [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Brigitte Bardot]] and others made it fashionable. During the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel there.<ref name=\"nileg\">{{cite web |url= http://www.nileguide.com/destination/acapulco/overview/history |title= History for Acapulco |publisher=Niles\u2019 Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}</ref>  Zihuatanejo, with the nearby resort area of Ixtapa, were developed by the federal government in the 1970s and 1980s to increase tourism to the area.<ref name=\"encmuczihua\">{{cite web |author=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal (2005) |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M\u00e9xico ESTADO DE GUERRERO TENIENTE JOS\u00c9 AZUETA |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/municipios/12038a.htm |language=Spanish |trans-title=Encyclopedia of the Municipalities of Mexico State of Guerrero Teniento Jos\u00e9 Azueta |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317063209/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/municipios/12038a.htm |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, some teachers from rural areas, including Guerrero, opposed federal regulations which prevented them from automatic [[lifetime tenure]], the ability to sell or will their jobs, and the teaching of either English or computer skills.<ref>{{Cite news | first=David | last=Agren | title='Normalistas' fight changes in Mexico education system | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/usatoday/article/1748405?odyssey=mod%7cnewswell%7ctext%7cHome%7cp| work= | newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 4A | date=December 10, 2012 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref><!---hard copy source different from soft copy but is the identical article---> In September 2014, the municipality of Iguala was the site of a [[2014 Iguala mass kidnapping|mass kidnapping of 43 students]] that drew national and international attention.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote =\n|1895<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/subspop/mx-pop.aspx |title=Mexico: extended population list |publisher=GeoHive |accessdate=2011-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311141056/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/subspop/mx-pop.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-11 }}</ref> | 420926\n|1900 | 479205\n|1910 | 594278\n|1921 | 566836\n|1930 | 641690\n|1940 | 732910\n|1950 | 919386\n|1960 | 1186716\n|1970 | 1597360\n|1980 | 2109513\n|1990 | 2620637\n|1995 | 2916567\n|2000 | 3079649\n|2005 | 3115202\n|2010 | 3388768\n|2015<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic_2015_presentacion.pdf |title=Encuesta Intercensal 2015 |publisher=INEGI |accessdate=2015-12-08}}</ref> | 3533251\n}}\n\nThe state is home to four indigenous ethnic groups{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, most of whom live in rugged, isolated mountain areas such as Ixcateopan, [[Santa Mar\u00eda Oapan]], [[Ameyaltepec]], [[Chilapa de \u00c1lvarez]], [[Malinaltepec]], [[Tlapa de Comonfort]], [[Metlatonoc]], [[Zapotitlan Tablas]] and [[Xochistlahuaca]] and [[Xilitla]].<ref name=\"arqueomex\">{{cite web |url=http://www.arqueomex.com/S8N4GVesp82.html |title=Gu\u00eda de Viajeros Guerrero |author=Rosa Ma.

This group is known for [[Amuzgo textiles|its handwoven textiles]] done on backstrap looms with many pieces recognized by the [[CONACULTA|Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes]]. [[Cualac, Guerrero|Cualac]] is noted for its machetes which have blades decorated by etching miniature landscapes. [[Temalacacingo]] and [[Acapetlahuaya]] produce gourd items, toys and small lacquered items. [[Olinal\u00e1]] has been an important producer of lacquer since pre-Hispanic times.<ref name=\"ra\u00edces\"/>\n\nAnother important group is the \u201cafromexicanos\u201d or [[Afro-Mexican]]s who are concentrated in the [[Costa Chica of Guerrero|Costa Chica]] region. This group is found in Guerrero and the Costa Chica area of Oaxaca. This group has been relatively isolated from the rest of Mexico, with little modernization or formal education. To this day,{{When|date=December 2019}} there are many who have no birth certificates or know how to read or write. Much of the history of these people is preserved in oral tradition. Historically, afromexicanos have been [[Racism in Mexico|discriminated against and marginalized]]. Even among these people today, the concept of being \u201cnegro\u201d is considered bad and a number take to [[skin-lightening]] methods. The musical style associated with the group is \u201c[[chilena]]\u201d which became popular outside of Guerrero and Oaxaca after the 1960s. One of these songs, \u201c[[Soy negro de la Costa]]\u2026,\u201d has been preserved by CONACULTA and INAH as part of Mexico's cultural heritage. A major change for this community came with the building of the highway connecting [[Acapulco]] with [[Pinotepa Nacional]] and [[Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca|Puerto Escondido]], which opened it up to the outside world. This allowed the shipping of goods and influx of people.

Some of these artists include [[Casiano Garc\u00eda]], [[Ian Malaj]], [[Leonel Maciel]], [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Sotelo]], [[Gerza\u00edn Vargas]] and [[Hugo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]].\n\nThe literary arts have a longer tradition, at least as far back as the 17th century. The best-known writer from the state hailed from [[Taxco]], playwright [[Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n]]. He is considered to be one of the most notable writers from the Siglo de Oro of Spanish literature. Another notable writer from the state is [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], although he is better known for his role in the defeat of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] and as a politician than as a writer. Other writers from the state over the centuries include [[Celedonio Serrano]], [[Herminio Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Juan S\u00e1nchez Andraka]] and [[Andr\u00e9s Acosta]].<ref name=\"rincones1218\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Victor Manuel |editor1-last=Jimenez Gonzalez |title=Sonora: Gu\u00eda para descubrir los encantos del estado |trans-title=Guerrero: Guide to discover the charms of the state |year=2010 |publisher=Editorial Oc\u00e9ano de Mexico SA de CV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=978-607-400-178-5 |pages=12\u201318}}</ref>\n\nThe state has a long history of folk music, which has been the basis of much of the state's modern compositions as well.<ref name=\"rincones1218\"/> Because of the different ethnicities, traditions and customs vary from region to region. In the coastal lowlands, music such as \u201cson\u201d is most often heard and dances such as [[jarabe]]s.  The culture of the Costa Chica region of Guerrero is centered on the municipality of Tixtla. Dances performed here include the Arranca Zacete, Jarabes, Palomo or Chilena and the Fandango. Most of these are accompanied by bands playing wind instruments.<ref name=\"tradiciones\"/>  Another type of music which is endemic to the state is called \"calentana\", which comes from an area called the Tierra Caliente. Tixtleca music comes from the town of Tixtla in the center of the state. Guerrero's best known composer is [[Margarito Dami\u00e1n Vargas]], who was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was only 37 years old when he died, but he had written more than 200 musical works including \"Ondas del Pac\u00edfico,\" \"Me delirio,\" \"Adi\u00f3s a Acapulco,\" and \"Dolores,\" which have been performed by orchestras and popular singers.

Members of these groups frequently maintain roadblocks and may use violence towards travelers. Violent crime, such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery, is widespread.\" The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Guerrero as travel by U.S. government employees to the state of Guerrero is completely prohibited. It is recommended that nobody travel to Guerrero if possible.\n\n==Geography, climate and nature==\n[[File:Mezcala (or Balsas) River in Guerrero, Mexico.jpg|thumb|Mezcala or Balsas River in Guerrero]]\nThe state of Guerrero has a territory of {{convert|63794|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. The state borders the states of Mexico, [[Morelos]], Puebla, Michoac\u00e1n, Oaxaca, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west.  Geographically, the state is divided into three regions: La Monta\u00f1a (mountains), [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] (hot lands) of the northeast and La Costa (coast).<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/> La Monta\u00f1a is mostly forested and is concentrated in the north and east of the state. Tierra Caliente and is situated in the lowlands along the Balsas River. This area also extends into Michoac\u00e1n state and is called similarly. La Costa is divided into two subregions called Costa Chica and Costa Grande. The Costa Chica extends from Acapulco to the border with Oaxaca. Costa Grande extends west of Acapulco to the Balsas River. Much of the state's current agriculture and livestock raising concentrated in La Costa as it is relatively flat.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nMost of the state is covered in mountains of varying heights, with deep canyons with flat areas limited to small mesas and the coastline. Most of the mountains belong to the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]]. The exception is the mountains of the Taxco area which belong to the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] and include the small mountain ranges of the Sierra de Sultepec, Sierra de Zacualpan and the Sierra de Zultepec. These are connected to the same volcanic system as the [[Nevado de Toluca]].<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nThe state's climate is dominated by the rainy tropical areas and rainy temperate areas. The former has high temperatures above {{convert|18|C|F|1}} year round and experiences most rain in the summer and early fall.  Most of this is found near the coast under {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|asl]]. In the higher elevations away from the coast in the Sierra Madre del Sur, the climate is temperate but also experiences the same pattern of rainfall. Most of the rain that falls in the state is produced from evaporation from the Pacific Ocean.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nThe coast extends for about {{convert|500|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and includes features such as the Balsas River delta, Mongles Point, Ixtapa Point, Zihuatanejo Bay, [[Isla Ixtapa|Ixtapa Island]], Acapulco Bay, Apies Island, Islas Blancas, San Gabriel Island, Islas Frailes Blancos or Rocas de Potosi, Punta Gorda, and others. There are a number of lagoons along the coast including the Laguna de Potosi in Morro de Petatl\u00e1n, Lagunas de Mitla, the Laguna de Nusco and the Laguna de Coyuca.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n[[File:La Roqueta Island in Acapulco, Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|La Roqueta Island off Acapulco]]\nThe Balsas River enters Guerrero from Puebla state where it is formed. Prior to reaching the town of Balsas, the river is called Mexcala, then Balsas to the ocean. The Nexapa River is a tributary of the upper portion of the Balsas. The Amacuzac River enters the state from the State of Mexico. It passes under the Grutas de Cacahuamilco, then reemerges to form part of the border between Guerrero and Morelos. The Tepecoacuilco or Huitzuco River forms within the state and is a tributary of the Balsas.  The Cocula or Iguala River forms in the Taxco area and is one of the major drainages of this region. Other rivers in the state include the Cuetzala, the Alohuixtla, the Cutzamala, the Tlapaneco Huamuxtitlan, the Milpilla or Zumpango, the R\u00edo del Oro, the Zayulapa, the Huautla and the R\u00edo Uni\u00f3n.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nThe [[Middle America Trench]] lies in the Pacific Ocean, parallel to Guerrero's coast. This trench is a [[subduction|subduction zone]], where the [[oceanic crust|oceanic]] [[Cocos Plate]] is sliding under the [[plate tectonics|continental]] [[North American Plate]]. Subduction zones can produce large [[earthquake]]s, like the [[2012 Guerrero\u2013Oaxaca earthquake]] on March 20, 2012.\n\nFlora of the state is determined by altitude and climate. The higher mountain areas have forests of pine and [[oyamel]] fir, with amate, and other tropical trees found in the lower elevations. Tropical hardwoods are mostly found in the lower elevations near the coast. The state has a wide variety of wildlife from deer, small mammals, large numbers of birds and reptiles and insects.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\nFive terrestrial [[ecoregion]]s extend across the state. The [[Southern Pacific dry forests]] lie on the southern slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur, extending from the coast up to 1400 meters elevation. The forests are predominantly [[deciduous]] during the long dry season. The [[Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests]] occupy the higher slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur. These forests harbor a great diversity of species, including many endemic [[orchid]]s, butterflies, and birds. The [[Balsas dry forests]] lie in the basin of the Balsas River, north of the Sierra Madre del Sur, and are notable for the diversity of mammal species, including [[jaguarundi]], [[coati]], [[ocelot]], and [[collared peccary]].

On a global scale, Guerrero shares the first place with [[Afghanistan]]. Mexico provides more than 90 percent of US's heroin. The poppy flower has become an economic support for many families in the \"Sierra de Guerrero\" (Guerrero mountain chain), since it is much more profitable than any other crop. Due to the high poverty rates, many peasants prefer to grow the poppy flower in order to cover their basic needs.\n\nThe state has large forests with logging potential, although most are [[ejido]] or other community property.
