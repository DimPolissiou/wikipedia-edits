If a linear map is a [[bijection]] then it is called a '''linear isomorphism'''.\n\nAn important special case is when {{math|1=''V'' = ''W''}}, in which case a linear map is called a (linear) '''[[endomorphism]]''' of {{math|''V''}}. Sometimes the term '''linear operator''' refers to this case.<ref>Linear transformations of {{mvar|V}} into {{mvar|V}} are often called ''linear operators'' on {{mvar|V}} {{harvnb|Rudin|1976|page=207}}</ref> In another convention, ''linear operator'' allows {{mvar|V}} and {{mvar|W}} to differ, while requiring them to be [[Real number|real]] vector spaces.<ref>Let {{mvar|V}} and {{mvar|W}} be two real vector spaces.

Linear maps can often be represented as [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], and simple examples include [[Rotations and reflections in two dimensions|rotation and reflection linear transformations]].\n\nIn the language of [[abstract algebra]], a linear map is a [[module homomorphism]].  In the language of [[category theory]], it is a [[morphism]] in the [[category of modules]] over a given [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]].\n\n== Definition and first consequences ==\nLet <math display=\"inline\">V</math> and <math display=\"inline\">W</math> be vector spaces over the same [[field (mathematics)|field]] <math display=\"inline\">K.</math> A function <math display=\"inline\">f : V \\to W</math> is said to be a ''linear map'' if for any two vectors <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\in V</math> and any scalar <math display=\"inline\">c \\in K</math> the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 20pt\"|<math>f(\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}) = f(\\mathbf{u})+f(\\mathbf{v})</math>\n| [[Additive map|additivity]] / operation of addition\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 20pt\"|<math>f(c \\mathbf{u}) = c f(\\mathbf{u})</math>\n| [[Homogeneous function|homogeneity]] of degree 1 / operation of scalar multiplication\n|}\n\nThus, a linear map is said to be ''operation preserving''.  In other words, it does not matter whether the linear map is applied before (the right hand sides of the above examples) or after (the left hand sides of the examples) the operations of addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nBy [[Addition#Associativity|the associativity of the addition operation]] denoted as +, for any vectors <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{u}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{u}_n \\in V</math> and scalars <math display=\"inline\">c_1, \\ldots, c_n \\in K,</math> the following equality holds:<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=14}}. Suppose now that {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are vector spaces ''over the same scalar field''. A mapping <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda: X \\to Y</math> is said to be ''linear'' if <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda(\\alpha x + \\beta y) = \\alpha\\Lambda x + \\beta\\Lambda y</math> for all <math display=\"inline\">x, y \\in X</math> and all scalars <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math>.

A mapping {{mvar|A}} of a vector space {{mvar|X}} into a vector space {{mvar|Y}} is said to be a ''linear transformation'' if: <math display=\"inline\">A\\left(\\bf{x}_1 + \\bf{x}_2\\right) = A\\bf{x}_1 + A\\bf{x}_2,\\  A(c\\bf{x}) = cA\\bf{x}</math> for all <math display=\"inline\">\\bf{x}, \\bf{x}_1, \\bf{x}_2 \\in X</math> and all scalars {{mvar|c}}.

It is then necessary to specify which of these ground fields is being used in the definition of \"linear\". If <math display=\"inline\">V</math> and <math display=\"inline\">W</math> are spaces over the same field <math display=\"inline\">K</math> as above, then we talk about <math display=\"inline\">K</math>-linear maps. For example, the [[complex conjugate|conjugation]] of [[complex numbers]] is an <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{R}</math>-linear map <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{C} \\to \\mathbf{C}</math>, but it is not <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{C}</math>-linear, where <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{R}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{C}</math> are symbols representing the sets of real numbers and complex numbers, respectively.\n\nA linear map <math display=\"inline\">V \\to K</math> with <math display=\"inline\">K</math> viewed as a one-dimensional vector space over itself is called a [[linear functional]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=14}}. Linear mappings of {{mvar|X}} onto its scalar field are called ''linear functionals''.</ref>\n\nThese statements generalize to any left-module <math display=\"inline\">{}_R M</math> over a ring <math display=\"inline\">R</math> without modification, and to any right-module upon reversing of the scalar multiplication.\n\n== Examples ==\n* The prototypical example that gives linear maps their name is the function {{nowrap|1=''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R''' : ''x'' \u21a6 ''cx''}}, of which the graph is a line through the origin.<ref>https://math.stackexchange.com/a/62791/401895</ref>\n* More generally, any [[homothecy]] centered in the origin of a vector space, <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{v} \\mapsto c\\mathbf{v}</math> where ''c'' is a scalar, is a linear operator.  This does not hold in general for modules, where such a map might only be [[semilinear map|semilinear]].\n* The zero map {{nowrap|''x'' \u21a6 0}} between two left-modules (or two right-modules) over the same ring is always linear.\n* The [[identity function|identity map]] on any module is a linear operator.\n* For real numbers, the map {{nowrap|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is not linear.\n* For real numbers, the map {{nowrap|''x'' \u21a6 ''x'' + 1}} is not linear (but is an [[affine transformation]]; {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x'' + 1}} is a [[linear equation]], as the term is used in [[analytic geometry]].)\n* If ''A'' is a real {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], then ''A'' defines a linear map from  '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> by sending the [[column vector]] {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} to the column vector {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}}. Conversely, any linear map between [[finite-dimensional]] vector spaces can be represented in this manner; see the [[#Matrices|following section]].\n* [[Derivative|Differentiation]] defines a linear map from the space of all differentiable functions to the space of all functions. It also defines a linear operator on the space of all [[smooth function]]s (a linear operator is a linear '''[[endomorphism]]''', that is a linear map where the [[Domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] of it is the same). An example is <math>\\frac{d}{dx}\\left( {{c}_{1}}{{f}_{1}}\\left( x \\right)+{{c}_{2}}{{f}_{2}}\\left( x \\right)+\\cdots +{{c}_{n}}{{f}_{n}}\\left( x \\right) \\right)={{c}_{1}}\\frac{d{{f}_{1}}\\left( x \\right)}{dx}+{{c}_{2}}\\frac{d{{f}_{2}}\\left( x \\right)}{dx}+\\cdots +{{c}_{n}}\\frac{d{{f}_{n}}\\left( x \\right)}{dx}</math>.\n* A definite [[integral]] over some [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] ''I'' is a linear map from the space of all real-valued integrable functions on ''I'' to '''R'''. For example,<math>\\int_{a}^{b}{[{{c}_{1}}{{f}_{1}}(x)+{{c}_{2}}{{f}_{2}}(x)+\\ldots +{{c}_{n}}{{f}_{n}}(x)]dx}={{c}_{1}}\\int_{a}^{b}{{{f}_{1}}(x)dx}+{{c}_{2}}\\int_{a}^{b}{{{f}_{2}}(x)dx}+\\ldots +{{c}_{n}}\\int_{a}^{b}{{{f}_{n}}(x)dx}</math>.\n* An indefinite [[integral]] (or [[antiderivative]]) with a fixed integration starting point defines a linear map from the space of all real-valued integrable functions on '''R''' to the space of all real-valued, differentiable functions on '''R'''. Without a fixed starting point, an exercise in group theory will show that the antiderivative maps to the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] of the differentiables over the [[equivalence relation]] \"differ by a constant\", which yields an identity class of the constant valued functions <math display=\"inline\">\\left(\\,\\int\\!:\\  I(\\Re) \\ \\to\\  D(\\Re)/\\Re\\,\\right)</math>.\n* If ''V'' and ''W'' are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field ''F'', then functions that send linear maps {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} to {{nowrap|dim<sub>''F''</sub>(''W'') \u00d7 dim<sub>''F''</sub>(''V'')}} matrices in the way described in the sequel are themselves linear maps (indeed [[linear isomorphism]]s).\n* The [[expected value]] of a [[Random variable#Definition|random variable]] (which is in fact a function, and as such a member of a vector space) is linear, as for random variables ''X'' and ''Y'' we have {{nowrap|1=E[''X'' + ''Y''] = E[''X''] + E[''Y'']}} and {{nowrap|1=E[''aX''] = ''a''E[''X'']}}, but the [[variance]] of a random variable is not linear.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Streckung eines Vektors.gif|The function <math display=\"inline\">f:\\R^2 \\to \\R^2</math> with <math display=\"inline\">f(x, y) = (2x, y)</math> is a linear map.

Then every <math display=\"inline\">A \\in L(X, Y)</math> determines a set of numbers <math display=\"inline\">a_{i,j}</math> such that\n\n:<math>A\\bf{x}_j = \\sum_{i=1}^m a_{i,j}\\bf{y}_i\\quad (1 \\leq j \\leq n).</math>\n\nIt is convenient to represent these numbers in a rectangular array of {{mvar|m}} rows and {{mvar|n}} columns, called an {{mvar|m}} ''by'' {{mvar|n}} ''matrix'':\n\n:<math>[A] = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \\ldots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \\ldots & a_{2,n} \\\\ \n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \\ldots & a_{m,n}\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nObserve that the coordinates <math display=\"inline\">a_{i,j}</math> of the vector <math display=\"inline\">A{\\bf x}_j</math> (with respect to the basis <math display=\"inline\">\\{\\bf{y}_1, \\ldots, \\bf{y}_m\\}</math>) appear in the ''j''<sup>th</sup> column of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>. The vectors <math display=\"inline\">A{\\bf x}_j</math> are therefore sometimes called the ''column vectors'' of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>. With this terminology, the ''range'' of {{mvar|A}} ''is spanned by the column vectors of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>''.\n</ref> This is useful because it allows concrete calculations. Matrices yield examples of linear maps: if ''A'' is a real {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, then {{nowrap|1=''f''('''x''') = ''A'''''x'''}} describes a linear map {{nowrap|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} (see [[Euclidean space]]).\n\nLet {'''v'''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, '''v'''<sub>''n''</sub>} be a basis for ''V''.  Then every vector '''v''' in ''V'' is uniquely determined by the coefficients ''c''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> in the field '''R''':\n\n: <math>c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathbf{v}_n.</math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is a linear map,\n\n: <math>f\\left(c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathbf{v}_n\\right) = c_1 f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1\\right) + \\cdots + c_n f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_n\\right),</math>\n\nwhich implies that the function ''f'' is entirely determined by the vectors ''f''('''v'''<sub>1</sub>), \u2026, ''f''('''v'''<sub>''n''</sub>). Now let {{nowrap|{'''w'''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, '''w'''<sub>''m''</sub>} }} be a basis for ''W''.  Then we can represent each vector ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) as\n\n: <math>f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_j\\right) = a_{1j} \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\cdots + a_{mj} \\mathbf{w}_m.</math>\n\nThus, the function ''f'' is entirely determined by the values of ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>. If we put these values into an {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''M'', then we can conveniently use it to compute the vector output of ''f'' for any vector in ''V''.  To get ''M'', every column ''j'' of ''M'' is a vector\n\n: <math>\\begin{pmatrix} a_{1j} & \\cdots & a_{mj} \\end{pmatrix}^\\textsf{T}</math>\n\ncorresponding to ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) as defined above. To define it more clearly, for some column ''j'' that corresponds to the mapping ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>),\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\ \\cdots & a_{1j} & \\cdots\\  \\\\\n           & \\vdots &          \\\\\n           & a_{mj} &\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere '''M''' is the matrix of ''f''. In other words, every column {{nowrap|1=''j'' = 1, \u2026, ''n''}} has a corresponding vector ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) whose coordinates ''a''<sub>1''j''</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''mj''</sub> are the elements of column ''j''. A single linear map may be represented by many matrices. This is because the values of the elements of a matrix depend on the bases chosen.\n\nThe matrices of a linear transformation can be represented visually:\n\n# Matrix for <math display=\"inline\">T</math> relative to <math display=\"inline\">B</math>: <math display=\"inline\">A</math>\n# Matrix for <math display=\"inline\">T</math> relative to <math display=\"inline\">B'</math>: <math display=\"inline\">A'</math>\n# Transition matrix from <math display=\"inline\">B'</math> to <math display=\"inline\">B</math>: <math display=\"inline\">P</math>\n# Transition matrix from <math display=\"inline\">B</math> to <math display=\"inline\">B'</math>: <math display=\"inline\">P^{-1}</math>\n\n[[File:Linear_transformation_visualization.svg|The relationship between matrices in a linear transformation]]\n\nSuch that starting in the bottom left corner <math display=\"inline\">\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'}</math> and looking for the bottom right corner <math display=\"inline\">\\left[T\\left(\\vec{v}\\right)\\right]_{B'}</math>, one would left-multiply\u2014that is, <math display=\"inline\">A'\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'} = \\left[T\\left(\\vec{v}\\right)\\right]_{B'}</math>. The equivalent method would be the \"longer\" method going clockwise from the same point such that <math display=\"inline\">\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'}</math> is left-multiplied with <math display=\"inline\">P^{-1}AP</math>, or <math display=\"inline\">P^{-1}AP\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'} = \\left[T\\left(\\vec{v}\\right)\\right]_{B'}</math>.\n\n== Examples of linear transformation matrices ==\nIn two-[[dimension]]al space '''R'''<sup>2</sup> linear maps are described by [[2 \u00d7 2 real matrices]]. These are some examples:\n\n* [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]\n** by 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1\\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n** by an angle ''\u03b8'' counterclockwise:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]\n** about the ''x'' axis:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n** about the ''y'' axis:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] by 2 in all directions:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 2\\end{pmatrix} = 2\\mathbf{I}</math>\n* [[shear mapping|horizontal shear mapping]]:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & m\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[squeeze mapping]]:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} k & 0\\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{k}\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] onto the ''y'' axis:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n== Forming new linear maps from given ones ==\nThe composition of linear maps is linear: if {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} and {{nowrap|''g'' : ''W'' \u2192 ''Z''}} are linear, then so is their [[Relation composition|composition]] {{nowrap|''g'' \u2218 ''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''Z''}}. It follows from this that the [[class (set theory)|class]] of all vector spaces over a given field ''K'', together with ''K''-linear maps as [[morphism]]s, forms a [[category (mathematics)|category]].\n\nThe [[inverse function|inverse]] of a linear map, when defined, is again a linear map.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f''<sub>1</sub> : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} and {{nowrap|''f''<sub>2</sub> : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} are linear, then so is their [[pointwise]] sum {{nowrap|''f''<sub>1</sub> + ''f''<sub>2</sub>}} (which is defined by {{nowrap|1=(''f''<sub>1</sub> + ''f''<sub>2</sub>)('''x''') = (''f''<sub>1</sub>('''x''') + ''f''<sub>2</sub>('''x'''))}}.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is linear and ''a'' is an element of the ground field ''K'', then the map ''af'', defined by {{nowrap|1=(''af'')('''x''') = ''a''(''f''('''x'''))}}, is also linear.\n\nThus the set {{nowrap|''L''(''V'', ''W'')}} of linear maps from ''V'' to ''W'' itself forms a vector space over ''K'', sometimes denoted {{nowrap|Hom(''V'', ''W'')}}.  Furthermore, in the case that {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W''}}, this vector space (denoted End(''V'')) is an [[associative algebra]] under [[composition of maps]], since the composition of two linear maps  is again a linear map, and the composition of maps is always associative.  This case is discussed in more detail below.\n\nGiven again the finite-dimensional case, if bases have been chosen, then the composition of linear maps corresponds to the [[matrix multiplication]], the addition of linear maps corresponds to the [[matrix addition]], and the multiplication of linear maps with scalars corresponds to the multiplication of matrices with scalars.\n\n== Endomorphisms and automorphisms ==\n{{main|Endomorphism|Automorphism}}\nA linear transformation ''f'': ''V'' \u2192 ''V'' is an [[endomorphism]] of ''V''; the set of all such endomorphisms End(''V'')  together with addition, composition and scalar multiplication as defined above forms an [[associative algebra]] with identity element over the field ''K'' (and in particular a [[ring (algebra)|ring]]). The multiplicative identity element of this algebra is the [[identity function|identity map]] id: ''V'' \u2192 ''V''.\n\nAn endomorphism of ''V'' that is also an [[isomorphism]] is called an [[automorphism]] of ''V''. The composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism, and the set of all automorphisms of ''V'' forms a [[group (math)|group]], the [[automorphism group]] of ''V'' which is denoted by Aut(''V'') or GL(''V''). Since the automorphisms are precisely those [[endomorphisms]] which possess inverses under composition, Aut(''V'') is the group of [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] in the ring End(''V'').\n\nIf ''V'' has finite dimension ''n'', then End(''V'') is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[associative algebra]] of all ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' matrices with entries in ''K''. The automorphism group of ''V'' is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the  [[general linear group]] GL(''n'', ''K'') of all ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' invertible matrices with entries in ''K''.\n\n== Kernel, image and the rank\u2013nullity theorem ==\n{{main|Kernel (linear operator)|Image (mathematics)|Rank of a matrix}}\nIf ''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' is linear, we define the [[kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] and the [[image (mathematics)|image]] or [[Range of a function|range]] of ''f'' by\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n    \\ker(f) &= \\{\\,x \\in V: f(x) = 0\\,\\} \\\\\n    \\operatorname{im}(f) &= \\{\\,w \\in W: w = f(x), x \\in V\\,\\}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nker(''f'') is a [[Linear subspace|subspace]] of ''V'' and im(''f'') is a subspace of ''W''.  The following [[dimension]] formula is known as the [[rank\u2013nullity theorem]]:\n\n: <math>\\dim(\\ker( f )) + \\dim(\\operatorname{im}( f )) = \\dim( V ).</math><ref>{{harvnb|Horn|Johnson|2013|loc=0.2.3 Vector spaces associated with a matrix or linear transformation, p. 6}}</ref>\n\nThe number dim(im(''f'')) is also called the ''rank of f'' and written as rank(''f''), or sometimes, \u03c1(''f''); the number dim(ker(''f'')) is called the ''nullity of f'' and written as null(''f'') or \u03bd(''f''). If ''V'' and ''W'' are finite-dimensional, bases have been chosen and ''f'' is represented by the matrix ''A'', then the rank and nullity of ''f'' are equal to the [[rank of a matrix|rank]] and [[Kernel (matrix)#Subspace properties|nullity]] of the matrix ''A'', respectively.\n\n== Cokernel ==\n{{main|Cokernel}}\n\nA subtler invariant of a linear transformation <math display=\"inline\">f: V \\to W</math> is the [[cokernel|''co''kernel]], which is defined as\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{coker}(f) := W/f(V) = W/\\operatorname{im}(f).</math>\n\nThis is the ''dual'' notion to the kernel: just as the kernel is a ''sub''space of the ''domain,'' the co-kernel is a [[quotient space (linear algebra)|''quotient'' space]] of the ''target.''\nFormally, one has the [[exact sequence]]\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\ker(f) \\to V \\to W \\to \\operatorname{coker}(f) \\to 0.</math>\n\nThese can be interpreted thus: given a linear equation ''f''('''v''') = '''w''' to solve,\n\n* the kernel is the space of ''solutions'' to the ''homogeneous'' equation ''f''('''v''') = 0, and its dimension is the number of ''degrees of freedom'' in a solution, if it exists;\n* the co-kernel is the space of ''constraints'' that must be satisfied if the equation is to have a solution, and its dimension is the number of constraints that must be satisfied for the equation to have a solution.\n\nThe dimension of the co-kernel and the dimension of the image (the rank) add up to the dimension of the target space. For finite dimensions, this means that the dimension of the quotient space ''W''/''f''(''V'') is the dimension of the target space minus the dimension of the image.\n\nAs a simple example, consider the map ''f'': '''R'''<sup>2</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, given by ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = (0, ''y''). Then for an equation ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = (''a'', ''b'') to have a solution, we must have ''a'' = 0 (one constraint), and in that case the solution space is (''x'', ''b'')  or equivalently stated, (0, ''b'') + (''x'', 0), (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace (''x'', 0) < ''V'': the value of ''x'' is the freedom in a solution \u2013 while the cokernel may be expressed via the map ''W'' \u2192 '''R''', <math display=\"inline\"> (a, b) \\mapsto (a):</math> given a vector (''a'', ''b''), the value of ''a'' is the ''obstruction'' to there being a solution.\n\nAn example illustrating the infinite-dimensional case is afforded by the map ''f'': '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup>, <math display=\"inline\">\\left\\{a_n\\right\\} \\mapsto \\left\\{b_n\\right\\}</math> with ''b''<sub>1</sub> = 0 and ''b''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub> = ''a<sub>n</sub>'' for ''n'' > 0. Its image consists of all sequences with first element 0, and thus its cokernel consists of the classes of sequences with identical first element. Thus, whereas its kernel has dimension 0 (it maps only the zero sequence to the zero sequence), its co-kernel has dimension 1. Since the domain and the target space are the same, the rank and the dimension of the kernel add up to the same [[cardinal number#Cardinal addition|sum]] as the rank and the dimension of the co-kernel ( <math display=\"inline\">\\aleph_0 + 0 = \\aleph_0 + 1</math> ), but in the infinite-dimensional case it cannot be inferred that the kernel and the co-kernel of an [[endomorphism]] have the same dimension (0 \u2260 1). The reverse situation obtains for the map ''h'': '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup>, <math display=\"inline\">\\left\\{a_n\\right\\} \\mapsto \\left\\{c_n\\right\\}</math> with ''c<sub>n</sub>'' = ''a''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>. Its image is the entire target space, and hence its co-kernel has dimension 0, but since it maps all sequences in which only the first element is non-zero to the zero sequence, its kernel has dimension 1.\n\n=== Index ===\nFor a linear operator with finite-dimensional kernel and co-kernel, one may define  ''index'' as:\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{ind}(f) := \\dim(\\ker(f)) - \\dim(\\operatorname{coker}(f)),</math>\n\nnamely the degrees of freedom minus the number of constraints.\n\nFor a transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces, this is just the difference dim(''V'') \u2212 dim(''W''), by rank\u2013nullity. This gives an indication of how many solutions or how many constraints one has: if mapping from a larger space to a smaller one, the map may be onto, and thus will have degrees of freedom even without constraints. Conversely, if mapping from a smaller space to a larger one, the map cannot be onto, and thus one will have constraints even without degrees of freedom.\n\nThe index of an operator is precisely the [[Euler characteristic]] of the 2-term complex 0 \u2192 ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' \u2192 0. In [[operator theory]], the index of [[Fredholm operator]]s is an object of study, with a major result being the [[Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem]].<ref>{{SpringerEOM|title=Index theory|id=Index_theory&oldid=23864|first=Victor|last=Nistor}}: \"The main question in index theory is to provide index formulas for classes of Fredholm operators ... Index theory has become a subject on its own only after M. F. Atiyah and I. Singer published their index theorems\"</ref>\n\n== Algebraic classifications of linear transformations ==\nNo classification of linear maps could hope to be exhaustive. The following incomplete list enumerates some important classifications that do not require any additional structure on the vector space.\n\nLet ''V'' and ''W'' denote vector spaces over a field, ''F''. Let ''T'': ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' be a linear map.\n\n* ''T'' is said to be ''[[injective]]'' or a ''[[monomorphism]]'' if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\n** ''T'' is [[injective|one-to-one]] as a map of [[set (mathematics)|sets]].\n** ker''T'' = {0<sub>''V''</sub>}\n** dim(ker''T'') = 0\n** ''T'' is [[monic morphism|monic]] or left-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space ''U'' and any pair of linear maps ''R'': ''U'' \u2192 ''V'' and ''S'': ''U'' \u2192 ''V'', the equation ''TR'' = ''TS'' implies ''R'' = ''S''.\n** ''T'' is [[inverse (ring theory)|left-invertible]], which is to say there exists a linear map ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''V'' such that ''ST'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''V''.\n* ''T'' is said to be ''[[surjective]]'' or an ''[[epimorphism]]'' if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\n** ''T'' is [[surjective|onto]] as a map of sets.\n** [[cokernel|coker]] ''T'' = {0<sub>''W''</sub>}\n** ''T'' is [[epimorphism|epic]] or right-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space ''U'' and any pair of linear maps ''R'': ''W'' \u2192 ''U'' and ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''U'', the equation ''RT'' = ''ST'' implies ''R'' = ''S''.\n** ''T'' is [[inverse (ring theory)|right-invertible]], which is to say there exists a linear map ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''V'' such that ''TS'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''W''.\n* ''T'' is said to be an ''[[isomorphism]]'' if it is both left- and right-invertible. This is equivalent to ''T'' being both one-to-one and onto (a [[bijection]] of sets) or also to ''T'' being both epic and monic, and so being a [[bimorphism]].\n* If ''T'': ''V'' \u2192 ''V'' is an endomorphism, then:\n** If, for some positive integer ''n'', the ''n''-th iterate of ''T'', ''T<sup>n</sup>'', is identically zero, then ''T'' is said to be [[nilpotent]].\n** If ''T''<sup>2</sup> = ''T'', then ''T'' is said to be [[idempotent]]\n** If ''T'' = ''kI'', where ''k'' is some scalar, then ''T'' is said to be a scaling transformation or scalar multiplication map; see [[scalar matrix]].\n\n== Change of basis ==\n{{main|Basis (linear algebra)|Change of basis}}\nGiven a linear map which is an [[endomorphism]] whose matrix is ''A'', in the basis ''B'' of the space it transforms vector coordinates [u] as [v] = ''A''[u]. As vectors change with the inverse of ''B'' (vectors are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]]) its inverse transformation is [v] = ''B''[v'].\n\nSubstituting this in the first expression\n:<math>B\\left[v'\\right] = AB\\left[u'\\right]</math>\n\nhence\n:<math>\\left[v'\\right] = B^{-1}AB\\left[u'\\right] = A'\\left[u'\\right].</math>\n\nTherefore, the matrix in the new basis is ''A\u2032'' = ''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>''AB'', being ''B'' the matrix of the given basis.\n\nTherefore, linear maps are said to be 1-co- 1-contra-[[covariance and contravariance of vectors|variant]] objects, or type (1, 1) [[tensor]]s.\n\n== Continuity ==\n{{main|Discontinuous linear map}}\n\nA ''linear transformation'' between [[topological vector space]]s, for example [[normed space]]s, may be [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].  If its domain and codomain are the same, it will then be a [[continuous linear operator]].  A linear operator on a normed linear space is continuous if and only if it is [[bounded operator|bounded]], for example, when the domain is finite-dimensional.<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=15}}\n\n'''1.18 Theorem''' ''Let <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> be a linear functional on a topological vector space {{mvar|X}}. Assume <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda x \\neq 0</math> for some <math display=\"inline\">x \\in X</math>. Then each of the following four properties implies the other three:''\n{{ordered list\n | list-style-type=lower-alpha\n | <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> is continuous\n | The null space <math display=\"inline\">N(\\Lambda)</math> is closed.\n | <math display=\"inline\">N(\\Lambda)</math> is not dense in {{mvar|X}}.\n | <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> is bounded in some neighbourhood {{mvar|V}} of 0.\n}}</ref>  An infinite-dimensional domain may have [[discontinuous linear operator]]s.\n\nAn example of an unbounded, hence discontinuous, linear transformation is differentiation on the space of smooth functions equipped with the supremum norm (a function with small values can have a derivative with large values, while the derivative of 0 is 0).  For a specific example, sin(''nx'')/''n'' converges to 0, but its derivative cos(''nx'') does not, so differentiation is not continuous at 0 (and by a variation of this argument, it is not continuous anywhere).\n\n== Applications ==\nA specific application of linear maps is for geometric transformations, such as those performed in [[computer graphics]], where the translation, rotation and scaling of 2D or 3D objects is performed by the use of a [[transformation matrix]]. Linear mappings also are used as a mechanism for describing change: for example in calculus correspond to derivatives; or in relativity, used as a device to keep track of the local transformations of reference frames.\n\nAnother application of these transformations is in [[compiler optimizations]] of nested-loop code, and in [[parallelizing compiler]] techniques.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikibooks|Linear Algebra/Linear Transformations}}\n* [[Antilinear map]]\n* [[Bent function]]\n* [[Bounded operator]]\n\n== Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Cite book | last1=Halmos | first1=Paul R. | author1-link=Paul R.

In the language of [[category theory]], it is a [[morphism]] in the [[category of modules]] over a given [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]].\n\n== Definition and first consequences ==\nLet <math display=\"inline\">V</math> and <math display=\"inline\">W</math> be vector spaces over the same [[field (mathematics)|field]] <math display=\"inline\">K.</math> A function <math display=\"inline\">f : V \\to W</math> is said to be a ''linear map'' if for any two vectors <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\in V</math> and any scalar <math display=\"inline\">c \\in K</math> the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 20pt\"|<math>f(\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}) = f(\\mathbf{u})+f(\\mathbf{v})</math>\n| [[Additive map|additivity]] / operation of addition\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 20pt\"|<math>f(c \\mathbf{u}) = c f(\\mathbf{u})</math>\n| [[Homogeneous function|homogeneity]] of degree 1 / operation of scalar multiplication\n|}\n\nThus, a linear map is said to be ''operation preserving''.  In other words, it does not matter whether the linear map is applied before (the right hand sides of the above examples) or after (the left hand sides of the examples) the operations of addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nBy [[Addition#Associativity|the associativity of the addition operation]] denoted as +, for any vectors <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{u}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{u}_n \\in V</math> and scalars <math display=\"inline\">c_1, \\ldots, c_n \\in K,</math> the following equality holds:<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=14}}.

It is then necessary to specify which of these ground fields is being used in the definition of \"linear\". If <math display=\"inline\">V</math> and <math display=\"inline\">W</math> are spaces over the same field <math display=\"inline\">K</math> as above, then we talk about <math display=\"inline\">K</math>-linear maps. For example, the [[complex conjugate|conjugation]] of [[complex numbers]] is an <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{R}</math>-linear map <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{C} \\to \\mathbf{C}</math>, but it is not <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{C}</math>-linear, where <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{R}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{C}</math> are symbols representing the sets of real numbers and complex numbers, respectively.\n\nA linear map <math display=\"inline\">V \\to K</math> with <math display=\"inline\">K</math> viewed as a one-dimensional vector space over itself is called a [[linear functional]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=14}}. Linear mappings of {{mvar|X}} onto its scalar field are called ''linear functionals''.</ref>\n\nThese statements generalize to any left-module <math display=\"inline\">{}_R M</math> over a ring <math display=\"inline\">R</math> without modification, and to any right-module upon reversing of the scalar multiplication.\n\n== Examples ==\n* The prototypical example that gives linear maps their name is the function {{nowrap|1=''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R''' : ''x'' \u21a6 ''cx''}}, of which the graph is a line through the origin.<ref>https://math.stackexchange.com/a/62791/401895</ref>\n* More generally, any [[homothecy]] centered in the origin of a vector space, <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{v} \\mapsto c\\mathbf{v}</math> where ''c'' is a scalar, is a linear operator.  This does not hold in general for modules, where such a map might only be [[semilinear map|semilinear]].\n* The zero map {{nowrap|''x'' \u21a6 0}} between two left-modules (or two right-modules) over the same ring is always linear.\n* The [[identity function|identity map]] on any module is a linear operator.\n* For real numbers, the map {{nowrap|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is not linear.\n* For real numbers, the map {{nowrap|''x'' \u21a6 ''x'' + 1}} is not linear (but is an [[affine transformation]]; {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x'' + 1}} is a [[linear equation]], as the term is used in [[analytic geometry]].)\n* If ''A'' is a real {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], then ''A'' defines a linear map from  '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> by sending the [[column vector]] {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} to the column vector {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}}. Conversely, any linear map between [[finite-dimensional]] vector spaces can be represented in this manner; see the [[#Matrices|following section]].\n* [[Derivative|Differentiation]] defines a linear map from the space of all differentiable functions to the space of all functions. It also defines a linear operator on the space of all [[smooth function]]s (a linear operator is a linear '''[[endomorphism]]''', that is a linear map where the [[Domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] of it is the same). An example is <math>\\frac{d}{dx}\\left( {{c}_{1}}{{f}_{1}}\\left( x \\right)+{{c}_{2}}{{f}_{2}}\\left( x \\right)+\\cdots +{{c}_{n}}{{f}_{n}}\\left( x \\right) \\right)={{c}_{1}}\\frac{d{{f}_{1}}\\left( x \\right)}{dx}+{{c}_{2}}\\frac{d{{f}_{2}}\\left( x \\right)}{dx}+\\cdots +{{c}_{n}}\\frac{d{{f}_{n}}\\left( x \\right)}{dx}</math>.\n* A definite [[integral]] over some [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] ''I'' is a linear map from the space of all real-valued integrable functions on ''I'' to '''R'''. For example,<math>\\int_{a}^{b}{[{{c}_{1}}{{f}_{1}}(x)+{{c}_{2}}{{f}_{2}}(x)+\\ldots +{{c}_{n}}{{f}_{n}}(x)]dx}={{c}_{1}}\\int_{a}^{b}{{{f}_{1}}(x)dx}+{{c}_{2}}\\int_{a}^{b}{{{f}_{2}}(x)dx}+\\ldots +{{c}_{n}}\\int_{a}^{b}{{{f}_{n}}(x)dx}</math>.\n* An indefinite [[integral]] (or [[antiderivative]]) with a fixed integration starting point defines a linear map from the space of all real-valued integrable functions on '''R''' to the space of all real-valued, differentiable functions on '''R'''. Without a fixed starting point, an exercise in group theory will show that the antiderivative maps to the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] of the differentiables over the [[equivalence relation]] \"differ by a constant\", which yields an identity class of the constant valued functions <math display=\"inline\">\\left(\\,\\int\\!:\\  I(\\Re) \\ \\to\\  D(\\Re)/\\Re\\,\\right)</math>.\n* If ''V'' and ''W'' are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field ''F'', then functions that send linear maps {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} to {{nowrap|dim<sub>''F''</sub>(''W'') \u00d7 dim<sub>''F''</sub>(''V'')}} matrices in the way described in the sequel are themselves linear maps (indeed [[linear isomorphism]]s).\n* The [[expected value]] of a [[Random variable#Definition|random variable]] (which is in fact a function, and as such a member of a vector space) is linear, as for random variables ''X'' and ''Y'' we have {{nowrap|1=E[''X'' + ''Y''] = E[''X''] + E[''Y'']}} and {{nowrap|1=E[''aX''] = ''a''E[''X'']}}, but the [[variance]] of a random variable is not linear.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Streckung eines Vektors.gif|The function <math display=\"inline\">f:\\R^2 \\to \\R^2</math> with <math display=\"inline\">f(x, y) = (2x, y)</math> is a linear map.

Then every <math display=\"inline\">A \\in L(X, Y)</math> determines a set of numbers <math display=\"inline\">a_{i,j}</math> such that\n\n:<math>A\\bf{x}_j = \\sum_{i=1}^m a_{i,j}\\bf{y}_i\\quad (1 \\leq j \\leq n).</math>\n\nIt is convenient to represent these numbers in a rectangular array of {{mvar|m}} rows and {{mvar|n}} columns, called an {{mvar|m}} ''by'' {{mvar|n}} ''matrix'':\n\n:<math>[A] = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \\ldots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \\ldots & a_{2,n} \\\\ \n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \\ldots & a_{m,n}\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nObserve that the coordinates <math display=\"inline\">a_{i,j}</math> of the vector <math display=\"inline\">A{\\bf x}_j</math> (with respect to the basis <math display=\"inline\">\\{\\bf{y}_1, \\ldots, \\bf{y}_m\\}</math>) appear in the ''j''<sup>th</sup> column of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>. The vectors <math display=\"inline\">A{\\bf x}_j</math> are therefore sometimes called the ''column vectors'' of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>. With this terminology, the ''range'' of {{mvar|A}} ''is spanned by the column vectors of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>''.\n</ref> This is useful because it allows concrete calculations. Matrices yield examples of linear maps: if ''A'' is a real {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, then {{nowrap|1=''f''('''x''') = ''A'''''x'''}} describes a linear map {{nowrap|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} (see [[Euclidean space]]).\n\nLet {'''v'''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, '''v'''<sub>''n''</sub>} be a basis for ''V''.  Then every vector '''v''' in ''V'' is uniquely determined by the coefficients ''c''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> in the field '''R''':\n\n: <math>c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathbf{v}_n.</math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is a linear map,\n\n: <math>f\\left(c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathbf{v}_n\\right) = c_1 f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1\\right) + \\cdots + c_n f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_n\\right),</math>\n\nwhich implies that the function ''f'' is entirely determined by the vectors ''f''('''v'''<sub>1</sub>), \u2026, ''f''('''v'''<sub>''n''</sub>). Now let {{nowrap|{'''w'''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, '''w'''<sub>''m''</sub>} }} be a basis for ''W''.  Then we can represent each vector ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) as\n\n: <math>f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_j\\right) = a_{1j} \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\cdots + a_{mj} \\mathbf{w}_m.</math>\n\nThus, the function ''f'' is entirely determined by the values of ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>. If we put these values into an {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''M'', then we can conveniently use it to compute the vector output of ''f'' for any vector in ''V''.  To get ''M'', every column ''j'' of ''M'' is a vector\n\n: <math>\\begin{pmatrix} a_{1j} & \\cdots & a_{mj} \\end{pmatrix}^\\textsf{T}</math>\n\ncorresponding to ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) as defined above. To define it more clearly, for some column ''j'' that corresponds to the mapping ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>),\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\ \\cdots & a_{1j} & \\cdots\\  \\\\\n           & \\vdots &          \\\\\n           & a_{mj} &\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere '''M''' is the matrix of ''f''. In other words, every column {{nowrap|1=''j'' = 1, \u2026, ''n''}} has a corresponding vector ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) whose coordinates ''a''<sub>1''j''</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''mj''</sub> are the elements of column ''j''. A single linear map may be represented by many matrices. This is because the values of the elements of a matrix depend on the bases chosen.\n\nThe matrices of a linear transformation can be represented visually:\n\n# Matrix for <math display=\"inline\">T</math> relative to <math display=\"inline\">B</math>: <math display=\"inline\">A</math>\n# Matrix for <math display=\"inline\">T</math> relative to <math display=\"inline\">B'</math>: <math display=\"inline\">A'</math>\n# Transition matrix from <math display=\"inline\">B'</math> to <math display=\"inline\">B</math>: <math display=\"inline\">P</math>\n# Transition matrix from <math display=\"inline\">B</math> to <math display=\"inline\">B'</math>: <math display=\"inline\">P^{-1}</math>\n\n[[File:Linear_transformation_visualization.svg|The relationship between matrices in a linear transformation]]\n\nSuch that starting in the bottom left corner <math display=\"inline\">\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'}</math> and looking for the bottom right corner <math display=\"inline\">\\left[T\\left(\\vec{v}\\right)\\right]_{B'}</math>, one would left-multiply\u2014that is, <math display=\"inline\">A'\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'} = \\left[T\\left(\\vec{v}\\right)\\right]_{B'}</math>.

These are some examples:\n\n* [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]\n** by 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1\\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n** by an angle ''\u03b8'' counterclockwise:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]\n** about the ''x'' axis:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n** about the ''y'' axis:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] by 2 in all directions:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 2\\end{pmatrix} = 2\\mathbf{I}</math>\n* [[shear mapping|horizontal shear mapping]]:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & m\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[squeeze mapping]]:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} k & 0\\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{k}\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] onto the ''y'' axis:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n== Forming new linear maps from given ones ==\nThe composition of linear maps is linear: if {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} and {{nowrap|''g'' : ''W'' \u2192 ''Z''}} are linear, then so is their [[Relation composition|composition]] {{nowrap|''g'' \u2218 ''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''Z''}}. It follows from this that the [[class (set theory)|class]] of all vector spaces over a given field ''K'', together with ''K''-linear maps as [[morphism]]s, forms a [[category (mathematics)|category]].\n\nThe [[inverse function|inverse]] of a linear map, when defined, is again a linear map.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f''<sub>1</sub> : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} and {{nowrap|''f''<sub>2</sub> : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} are linear, then so is their [[pointwise]] sum {{nowrap|''f''<sub>1</sub> + ''f''<sub>2</sub>}} (which is defined by {{nowrap|1=(''f''<sub>1</sub> + ''f''<sub>2</sub>)('''x''') = (''f''<sub>1</sub>('''x''') + ''f''<sub>2</sub>('''x'''))}}.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is linear and ''a'' is an element of the ground field ''K'', then the map ''af'', defined by {{nowrap|1=(''af'')('''x''') = ''a''(''f''('''x'''))}}, is also linear.\n\nThus the set {{nowrap|''L''(''V'', ''W'')}} of linear maps from ''V'' to ''W'' itself forms a vector space over ''K'', sometimes denoted {{nowrap|Hom(''V'', ''W'')}}.  Furthermore, in the case that {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W''}}, this vector space (denoted End(''V'')) is an [[associative algebra]] under [[composition of maps]], since the composition of two linear maps  is again a linear map, and the composition of maps is always associative.  This case is discussed in more detail below.\n\nGiven again the finite-dimensional case, if bases have been chosen, then the composition of linear maps corresponds to the [[matrix multiplication]], the addition of linear maps corresponds to the [[matrix addition]], and the multiplication of linear maps with scalars corresponds to the multiplication of matrices with scalars.\n\n== Endomorphisms and automorphisms ==\n{{main|Endomorphism|Automorphism}}\nA linear transformation ''f'': ''V'' \u2192 ''V'' is an [[endomorphism]] of ''V''; the set of all such endomorphisms End(''V'')  together with addition, composition and scalar multiplication as defined above forms an [[associative algebra]] with identity element over the field ''K'' (and in particular a [[ring (algebra)|ring]]). The multiplicative identity element of this algebra is the [[identity function|identity map]] id: ''V'' \u2192 ''V''.\n\nAn endomorphism of ''V'' that is also an [[isomorphism]] is called an [[automorphism]] of ''V''. The composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism, and the set of all automorphisms of ''V'' forms a [[group (math)|group]], the [[automorphism group]] of ''V'' which is denoted by Aut(''V'') or GL(''V''). Since the automorphisms are precisely those [[endomorphisms]] which possess inverses under composition, Aut(''V'') is the group of [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] in the ring End(''V'').\n\nIf ''V'' has finite dimension ''n'', then End(''V'') is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[associative algebra]] of all ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' matrices with entries in ''K''. The automorphism group of ''V'' is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the  [[general linear group]] GL(''n'', ''K'') of all ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' invertible matrices with entries in ''K''.\n\n== Kernel, image and the rank\u2013nullity theorem ==\n{{main|Kernel (linear operator)|Image (mathematics)|Rank of a matrix}}\nIf ''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' is linear, we define the [[kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] and the [[image (mathematics)|image]] or [[range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f'' by\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n    \\ker(f) &= \\{\\,x \\in V: f(x) = 0\\,\\} \\\\\n    \\operatorname{im}(f) &= \\{\\,w \\in W: w = f(x), x \\in V\\,\\}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nker(''f'') is a [[Linear subspace|subspace]] of ''V'' and im(''f'') is a subspace of ''W''.  The following [[dimension]] formula is known as the [[rank\u2013nullity theorem]]:\n\n: <math>\\dim(\\ker( f )) + \\dim(\\operatorname{im}( f )) = \\dim( V ).</math><ref>{{harvnb|Horn|Johnson|2013|loc=0.2.3 Vector spaces associated with a matrix or linear transformation, p. 6}}</ref>\n\nThe number dim(im(''f'')) is also called the ''rank of f'' and written as rank(''f''), or sometimes, \u03c1(''f''); the number dim(ker(''f'')) is called the ''nullity of f'' and written as null(''f'') or \u03bd(''f''). If ''V'' and ''W'' are finite-dimensional, bases have been chosen and ''f'' is represented by the matrix ''A'', then the rank and nullity of ''f'' are equal to the [[rank of a matrix|rank]] and [[Kernel (matrix)#Subspace properties|nullity]] of the matrix ''A'', respectively.\n\n== Cokernel ==\n{{main|Cokernel}}\n\nA subtler invariant of a linear transformation <math display=\"inline\">f: V \\to W</math> is the [[cokernel|''co''kernel]], which is defined as\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{coker}(f) := W/f(V) = W/\\operatorname{im}(f).</math>\n\nThis is the ''dual'' notion to the kernel: just as the kernel is a ''sub''space of the ''domain,'' the co-kernel is a [[quotient space (linear algebra)|''quotient'' space]] of the ''target.''\nFormally, one has the [[exact sequence]]\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\ker(f) \\to V \\to W \\to \\operatorname{coker}(f) \\to 0.</math>\n\nThese can be interpreted thus: given a linear equation ''f''('''v''') = '''w''' to solve,\n\n* the kernel is the space of ''solutions'' to the ''homogeneous'' equation ''f''('''v''') = 0, and its dimension is the number of ''degrees of freedom'' in a solution, if it exists;\n* the co-kernel is the space of ''constraints'' that must be satisfied if the equation is to have a solution, and its dimension is the number of constraints that must be satisfied for the equation to have a solution.\n\nThe dimension of the co-kernel and the dimension of the image (the rank) add up to the dimension of the target space. For finite dimensions, this means that the dimension of the quotient space ''W''/''f''(''V'') is the dimension of the target space minus the dimension of the image.\n\nAs a simple example, consider the map ''f'': '''R'''<sup>2</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, given by ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = (0, ''y''). Then for an equation ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = (''a'', ''b'') to have a solution, we must have ''a'' = 0 (one constraint), and in that case the solution space is (''x'', ''b'')  or equivalently stated, (0, ''b'') + (''x'', 0), (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace (''x'', 0) < ''V'': the value of ''x'' is the freedom in a solution \u2013 while the cokernel may be expressed via the map ''W'' \u2192 '''R''', <math display=\"inline\"> (a, b) \\mapsto (a):</math> given a vector (''a'', ''b''), the value of ''a'' is the ''obstruction'' to there being a solution.\n\nAn example illustrating the infinite-dimensional case is afforded by the map ''f'': '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup>, <math display=\"inline\">\\left\\{a_n\\right\\} \\mapsto \\left\\{b_n\\right\\}</math> with ''b''<sub>1</sub> = 0 and ''b''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub> = ''a<sub>n</sub>'' for ''n'' > 0. Its image consists of all sequences with first element 0, and thus its cokernel consists of the classes of sequences with identical first element. Thus, whereas its kernel has dimension 0 (it maps only the zero sequence to the zero sequence), its co-kernel has dimension 1. Since the domain and the target space are the same, the rank and the dimension of the kernel add up to the same [[cardinal number#Cardinal addition|sum]] as the rank and the dimension of the co-kernel ( <math display=\"inline\">\\aleph_0 + 0 = \\aleph_0 + 1</math> ), but in the infinite-dimensional case it cannot be inferred that the kernel and the co-kernel of an [[endomorphism]] have the same dimension (0 \u2260 1). The reverse situation obtains for the map ''h'': '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup>, <math display=\"inline\">\\left\\{a_n\\right\\} \\mapsto \\left\\{c_n\\right\\}</math> with ''c<sub>n</sub>'' = ''a''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>. Its image is the entire target space, and hence its co-kernel has dimension 0, but since it maps all sequences in which only the first element is non-zero to the zero sequence, its kernel has dimension 1.\n\n=== Index ===\nFor a linear operator with finite-dimensional kernel and co-kernel, one may define  ''index'' as:\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{ind}(f) := \\dim(\\ker(f)) - \\dim(\\operatorname{coker}(f)),</math>\n\nnamely the degrees of freedom minus the number of constraints.\n\nFor a transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces, this is just the difference dim(''V'') \u2212 dim(''W''), by rank\u2013nullity. This gives an indication of how many solutions or how many constraints one has: if mapping from a larger space to a smaller one, the map may be onto, and thus will have degrees of freedom even without constraints. Conversely, if mapping from a smaller space to a larger one, the map cannot be onto, and thus one will have constraints even without degrees of freedom.\n\nThe index of an operator is precisely the [[Euler characteristic]] of the 2-term complex 0 \u2192 ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' \u2192 0. In [[operator theory]], the index of [[Fredholm operator]]s is an object of study, with a major result being the [[Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem]].<ref>{{SpringerEOM|title=Index theory|id=Index_theory&oldid=23864|first=Victor|last=Nistor}}: \"The main question in index theory is to provide index formulas for classes of Fredholm operators ... Index theory has become a subject on its own only after M. F. Atiyah and I. Singer published their index theorems\"</ref>\n\n== Algebraic classifications of linear transformations ==\nNo classification of linear maps could hope to be exhaustive. The following incomplete list enumerates some important classifications that do not require any additional structure on the vector space.\n\nLet ''V'' and ''W'' denote vector spaces over a field, ''F''. Let ''T'': ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' be a linear map.\n\n* ''T'' is said to be ''[[injective]]'' or a ''[[monomorphism]]'' if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\n** ''T'' is [[injective|one-to-one]] as a map of [[set (mathematics)|sets]].\n** ker''T'' = {0<sub>''V''</sub>}\n** dim(ker''T'') = 0\n** ''T'' is [[monic morphism|monic]] or left-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space ''U'' and any pair of linear maps ''R'': ''U'' \u2192 ''V'' and ''S'': ''U'' \u2192 ''V'', the equation ''TR'' = ''TS'' implies ''R'' = ''S''.\n** ''T'' is [[inverse (ring theory)|left-invertible]], which is to say there exists a linear map ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''V'' such that ''ST'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''V''.\n* ''T'' is said to be ''[[surjective]]'' or an ''[[epimorphism]]'' if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\n** ''T'' is [[surjective|onto]] as a map of sets.\n** [[cokernel|coker]] ''T'' = {0<sub>''W''</sub>}\n** ''T'' is [[epimorphism|epic]] or right-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space ''U'' and any pair of linear maps ''R'': ''W'' \u2192 ''U'' and ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''U'', the equation ''RT'' = ''ST'' implies ''R'' = ''S''.\n** ''T'' is [[inverse (ring theory)|right-invertible]], which is to say there exists a linear map ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''V'' such that ''TS'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''W''.\n* ''T'' is said to be an ''[[isomorphism]]'' if it is both left- and right-invertible. This is equivalent to ''T'' being both one-to-one and onto (a [[bijection]] of sets) or also to ''T'' being both epic and monic, and so being a [[bimorphism]].\n* If ''T'': ''V'' \u2192 ''V'' is an endomorphism, then:\n** If, for some positive integer ''n'', the ''n''-th iterate of ''T'', ''T<sup>n</sup>'', is identically zero, then ''T'' is said to be [[nilpotent]].\n** If ''T''<sup>2</sup> = ''T'', then ''T'' is said to be [[idempotent]]\n** If ''T'' = ''kI'', where ''k'' is some scalar, then ''T'' is said to be a scaling transformation or scalar multiplication map; see [[scalar matrix]].\n\n== Change of basis ==\n{{main|Basis (linear algebra)|Change of basis}}\nGiven a linear map which is an [[endomorphism]] whose matrix is ''A'', in the basis ''B'' of the space it transforms vector coordinates [u] as [v] = ''A''[u]. As vectors change with the inverse of ''B'' (vectors are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]]) its inverse transformation is [v] = ''B''[v'].\n\nSubstituting this in the first expression\n:<math>B\\left[v'\\right] = AB\\left[u'\\right]</math>\n\nhence\n:<math>\\left[v'\\right] = B^{-1}AB\\left[u'\\right] = A'\\left[u'\\right].</math>\n\nTherefore, the matrix in the new basis is ''A\u2032'' = ''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>''AB'', being ''B'' the matrix of the given basis.\n\nTherefore, linear maps are said to be 1-co- 1-contra-[[covariance and contravariance of vectors|variant]] objects, or type (1, 1) [[tensor]]s.\n\n== Continuity ==\n{{main|Discontinuous linear map}}\n\nA ''linear transformation'' between [[topological vector space]]s, for example [[normed space]]s, may be [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].  If its domain and codomain are the same, it will then be a [[continuous linear operator]].  A linear operator on a normed linear space is continuous if and only if it is [[bounded operator|bounded]], for example, when the domain is finite-dimensional.<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=15}}\n\n'''1.18 Theorem''' ''Let <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> be a linear functional on a topological vector space {{mvar|X}}. Assume <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda x \\neq 0</math> for some <math display=\"inline\">x \\in X</math>. Then each of the following four properties implies the other three:''\n{{ordered list\n | list-style-type=lower-alpha\n | <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> is continuous\n | The null space <math display=\"inline\">N(\\Lambda)</math> is closed.\n | <math display=\"inline\">N(\\Lambda)</math> is not dense in {{mvar|X}}.\n | <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> is bounded in some neighbourhood {{mvar|V}} of 0.\n}}</ref>  An infinite-dimensional domain may have [[discontinuous linear operator]]s.\n\nAn example of an unbounded, hence discontinuous, linear transformation is differentiation on the space of smooth functions equipped with the supremum norm (a function with small values can have a derivative with large values, while the derivative of 0 is 0).  For a specific example, sin(''nx'')/''n'' converges to 0, but its derivative cos(''nx'') does not, so differentiation is not continuous at 0 (and by a variation of this argument, it is not continuous anywhere).\n\n== Applications ==\nA specific application of linear maps is for geometric transformations, such as those performed in [[computer graphics]], where the translation, rotation and scaling of 2D or 3D objects is performed by the use of a [[transformation matrix]].

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. This incident was documented in Joseph Wambaugh's bestseller, \"[[The Onion Field]].\"The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parry |first1=Brian |title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service |journal=www.ncjrs.gov |date=October 2001 |volume=63 |issue=6 |page=120-123 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=191541 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe. Special agents come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have worked their way up through the Department of Corrections. An internal hire must hold the rank of lieutenant or above in order to apply to SSU. Law enforcement officers also apply from outside agencies, such as local police departments and other state police services. Those individuals ordinarily come with an investigative and/or tactical background, usually having served on their agencies detective unit and special weapons team (SWAT).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ryan |first1=Richard |title=GANGLAND\u2019S FINEST |url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/ganglands-finest/ |website=Tactical Life Gun Magazine: Gun News and Gun Reviews |date=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n[[File:Final 1.jpg|thumb|CDCR Special Service Unit agents making an arrest]]\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the [[Patricia Hearst]] kidnapping by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of [[Charles Manson|Charles Manson's]] cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident [[Diane Whipple]] was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, [[Phillip Garrido]] was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Garridos deny involvement in \u201988 Hayward abduction |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/garridos-deny-involvement-in-88-hayward-abduction/ |work=www.tahoedailytribune.com}}</ref> \n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" An arrest sweep of 29 suspects took place on February 14, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. This incident was documented in Joseph Wambaugh's bestseller, \"[[The Onion Field]].\"The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parry |first1=Brian |title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service |journal=www.ncjrs.gov |date=October 2001 |volume=63 |issue=6 |page=120-123 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=191541 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe. Special agents come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have worked their way up through the Department of Corrections. An internal hire must hold the rank of lieutenant or above in order to apply to SSU. Law enforcement officers also apply from outside agencies, such as local police departments and other state police services. Those individuals ordinarily come with an investigative and/or tactical background, usually having served on their agencies detective unit and special weapons team (SWAT).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ryan |first1=Richard |title=GANGLAND\u2019S FINEST |url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/ganglands-finest/ |website=Tactical Life Gun Magazine: Gun News and Gun Reviews |date=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the [[Patricia Hearst]] kidnapping by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of [[Charles Manson|Charles Manson's]] cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident [[Diane Whipple]] was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, [[Phillip Garrido]] was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Garridos deny involvement in \u201988 Hayward abduction |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/garridos-deny-involvement-in-88-hayward-abduction/ |work=www.tahoedailytribune.com}}</ref> \n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" An arrest sweep of 29 suspects took place on February 14, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v. Brown|Coleman v. Brown}}\n\nThere are at multiple ongoing lawsuits over medical care in the California prison system. ''[[Plata v. Brown]]'' is a federal [[class action]] [[civil rights]] lawsuit alleging unconstitutionally inadequate medical services, and as a result of a [[stipulation]] between the plaintiffs and the state, the court issued an [[injunction]] requiring defendants to provide \"only the minimum level of medical care required under the Eighth Amendment.\" However, three years after approving the stipulation as an order of the court, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing that revealed the continued existence of appalling conditions arising from defendants\u2019 failure to provide adequate medical care to California inmates.

Inmate [[Glen Godwin]] was able to escape the then maximum security prison. He reportedly escaped through a storm drain and into the American River.

The company is completed by Cyrus' dog \"Top\".{{Ref|orig-names|a}}\n\nAfter flying in a great storm for several days, the group crash-lands on a cliff-bound, volcanic, [[Ernest Legouve Reef|unknown island]], described as being located at {{coord|34|57|S|150|30|W}}, about {{convert|2500|km|mi}} east of New Zealand. They name it \"Lincoln Island\" in honor of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. With the knowledge of the brilliant engineer Smith, the five are able to sustain themselves on the island, producing fire, pottery, bricks, [[nitroglycerin]], iron, a simple [[electric telegraph]], a cave home inside a stony cliff called \"Granite House\", and even a seaworthy ship, which they name the \"Bonadventure\".\n[[File: Ile Mysterieuse 03.jpg|left|thumb|Map of \"Lincoln Island\"]]\n\nDuring their stay on the island, the group endures bad weather and domesticates an [[orangutan]], Jupiter, abbreviated to Jup (or Joop, in Jordan Stump's translation). There is a mystery on the island in the form of an unseen ''[[deus ex machina]]'', responsible for Cyrus' survival after falling from the balloon, the mysterious rescue of Top from a [[dugong]], the appearance of a box of equipment (guns and ammunition, tools, etc.), and other seemingly inexplicable occurrences.\n\nThe group finds a [[message in a bottle]] directing them to rescue a [[castaway]] on nearby [[Maria Theresa Reef|Tabor Island]], who is none other than [[Tom Ayrton]] (from ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''). On the return voyage to Lincoln Island, they lose their way in a tempest but are guided back to their course by a mysterious fire beacon.\n\nAyrton's former companions arrive by chance on Lincoln Island and try to make it into their lair. After some fighting with the protagonists, the pirate ship is mysteriously destroyed by an explosion. Six of the pirates survive and kidnap Ayrton. When the colonists go to look for him, the pirates shoot Harbert, seriously injuring him. Harbert survives, narrowly cheating death. The colonists at first assume Ayrton has been killed, but later they find evidence that he was not instantly killed, leaving his fate uncertain. When the colonists rashly attempt to return to Granite House before Harbert fully recovers, Harbert contracts [[malaria]] but is saved by a box of [[quinine]] sulfate, which mysteriously appears on the table in Granite House. After Harbert recovers, they attempt to rescue Ayrton and destroy the pirates. They discover Ayrton at the sheepfold, and the pirates dead, without any visible wounds.\n\nThe secret of the island is revealed to be [[Captain Nemo]]'s hideout, and home port of the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]''. Having escaped the [[Moskstraumen|Maelstrom]] at the end of ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', the ''Nautilus'' sailed the oceans of the world until all its crew except Nemo had died. Now an old man, Nemo returned the ''Nautilus'' to its secret port within Lincoln Island. Nemo had been the mysterious benefactor of the settlers, providing them with the box of equipment, sending the message revealing Ayrton, planting the torpedo that destroyed the pirate ship, and killing the pirates with an \"electric gun\". On his death bed, Captain Nemo reveals his true identity as the lost Indian Prince Dakkar, son of a [[raja]] of the then-independent territory of [[Bundelkhand|Bundelkund]] and a nephew of the Indian hero [[Tipu Sultan|Tippu-Sahib]]. After taking part in the failed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Prince Dakkar escaped to a [[desert island]] with twenty of his compatriots and commenced the building of the ''Nautilus'' and adopted the new name of \"Captain Nemo\". Before he dies, Nemo gives them a box of diamonds and pearls as a keepsake. Nemo's final words are \"God and my country!\" (\"Independence!\", in Verne's original manuscript). The ''Nautilus'' is scuttled and serves as Captain Nemo's tomb.{{Ref|nemo-time-paradox|b}}\n\nAfterward, the island's central volcano erupts, destroying the island.

Although this novel was written in 1874, its events take place from 1865 to 1869. The events of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' take place between 1867 and 1868. For example, the Captain Nemo appearing in this novel dies at a time when the Captain Nemo in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' was still alive. There is usually a note in most editions of the book admitting date discrepancies. There are also similar discrepancies with ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]'', although, these are not as often pointed out. Another error is that Neb is depicted as Smith's former slave. But since Smith is identified as being from Massachusetts, where slavery was abolished in the 1780s, Neb would never have been a slave.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|The Mysterious Island}}\n{{wikisourcelang|fr|L\u2019\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse}}\n{{wikisource}}\n* {{Gutenberg|no=8993|name=The Mysterious Island}}\u2014Stephen W.

The company is completed by Cyrus' dog \"Top\".{{Ref|orig-names|a}}\n\nAfter flying in a great storm for several days, the group crash-lands on a cliff-bound, volcanic, [[Ernest Legouve Reef|unknown island]], described as being located at {{coord|34|57|S|150|30|W}}, about {{convert|2500|km|mi}} east of New Zealand. They name it \"Lincoln Island\" in honor of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. With the knowledge of the brilliant engineer Smith, the five are able to sustain themselves on the island, producing fire, pottery, bricks, [[nitroglycerin]], iron, a simple [[electric telegraph]], a cave home inside a stony cliff called \"Granite House\", and even a seaworthy ship, which they name the \"Bonadventure\".\n[[File: Ile Mysterieuse 03.jpg|left|thumb|Map of \"Lincoln Island\"]]\n\nDuring their stay on the island, the group endures bad weather and domesticates an [[orangutan]], Jupiter, abbreviated to Jup (or Joop, in Jordan Stump's translation). There is a mystery on the island in the form of an unseen ''[[deus ex machina]]'', responsible for Cyrus' survival after falling from the balloon, the mysterious rescue of Top from a [[dugong]], the appearance of a box of equipment (guns and ammunition, tools, etc.), and other seemingly inexplicable occurrences.\n\nThe group finds a [[message in a bottle]] directing them to rescue a [[castaway]] on nearby [[Maria Theresa Reef|Tabor Island]], who is none other than [[Tom Ayrton]] (from ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''). On the return voyage to Lincoln Island, they lose their way in a tempest but are guided back to their course by a mysterious fire beacon.\n\nAyrton's former companions arrive by chance on Lincoln Island and try to make it into their lair. After some fighting with the protagonists, the pirate ship is mysteriously destroyed by an explosion. Six of the pirates survive and kidnap Ayrton. When the colonists go to look for him, the pirates shoot Harbert, seriously injuring him. Harbert survives, narrowly cheating death. The colonists at first assume Ayrton has been killed, but later they find evidence that he was not instantly killed, leaving his fate uncertain. When the colonists rashly attempt to return to Granite House before Harbert fully recovers, Harbert contracts [[malaria]] but is saved by a box of [[quinine]] sulfate, which mysteriously appears on the table in Granite House. After Harbert recovers, they attempt to rescue Ayrton and destroy the pirates. They discover Ayrton at the sheepfold, and the pirates dead, without any visible wounds.\n\nThe secret of the island is revealed to be [[Captain Nemo]]'s hideout, and home port of the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]''. Having escaped the [[Moskstraumen|Maelstrom]] at the end of ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', the ''Nautilus'' sailed the oceans of the world until all its crew except Nemo had died. Now an old man, Nemo returned the ''Nautilus'' to its secret port within Lincoln Island. Nemo had been the mysterious benefactor of the settlers, providing them with the box of equipment, sending the message revealing Ayrton, planting the torpedo that destroyed the pirate ship, and killing the pirates with an \"electric gun\". On his death bed, Captain Nemo reveals his true identity as the lost Indian Prince Dakkar, son of a [[raja]] of the then-independent territory of [[Bundelkhand|Bundelkund]] and a nephew of the Indian hero [[Tipu Sultan|Tippu-Sahib]]. After taking part in the failed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Prince Dakkar escaped to a [[desert island]] with twenty of his compatriots and commenced the building of the ''Nautilus'' and adopted the new name of \"Captain Nemo\". Before he dies, Nemo gives them a box of diamonds and pearls as a keepsake. Nemo's final words are \"God and my country!\" (\"Independence!\", in Verne's original manuscript). The ''Nautilus'' is scuttled and serves as Captain Nemo's tomb.{{Ref|nemo-time-paradox|b}}\n\nAfterward, the island's central volcano erupts, destroying the island. Jup the orangutan falls into a crack in the ground and dies. The colonists, forewarned of the eruption by Nemo, find shelter on the last remaining piece of the island above sea level. They are rescued by the ship ''Duncan'', which had come to rescue Ayrton, but was redirected by a message Nemo had previously left on Tabor Island. After they return to the United States they form a new colony in Iowa, financed with Nemo's gifts.\n\n==Publication history in English==\nIn the United States the first English printing began in ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', April 1874, as a serial.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Jules |last=Verne |title=The Mysterious Island |magazine=Scribner's Monthly |volume=7 |number=6 |pages=722\u2013734 |date=April 1874 |url=https://archive.org/stream/centuryillustrat07newyuoft#page/722/mode/2up}}</ref> In September 1875 Sampson Low, Marston, Low, and Searle published the first British edition of ''Mysterious Island'' in three volumes entitled ''Dropped from the Clouds'', ''The Abandoned'', and ''The Secret of the Island'' (195,000 words).

In the Kingston translation, the engineer is named Cyrus Harding, and the sailor is named Pencroft.\n*{{note|nemo-time-paradox|b}} There are discrepancies in [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] between this novel and ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''. Although this novel was written in 1874, its events take place from 1865 to 1869. The events of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' take place between 1867 and 1868. For example, the Captain Nemo appearing in this novel dies at a time when the Captain Nemo in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' was still alive. There is usually a note in most editions of the book admitting date discrepancies. There are also similar discrepancies with ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]'', although, these are not as often pointed out. Another error is that Neb is depicted as Smith's former slave. But since Smith is identified as being from Massachusetts, where slavery was abolished in the 1780s, Neb would never have been a slave.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|The Mysterious Island}}\n{{wikisourcelang|fr|L\u2019\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse}}\n{{wikisource}}\n* {{Gutenberg|no=8993|name=The Mysterious Island}}\u2014Stephen W.

Wreck-It Ralph, the antagonist of the video game ''Fix-It Felix Jr.'', is ostracized by its other characters for being the video game's villain, while the titular hero Felix is praised and awarded medals. After the game's inhabitants exclude Ralph from the game's thirtieth-anniversary party, he sets out to earn a medal for himself to gain his neighbors' respect. Felix worries that Ralph has \"gone Turbo\"\u2014a term coined when notorious [[Racing video game|racing videogame]] character Turbo attempted to take over ''[[RoadBlasters]]'' out of jealousy, which resulted in both of their videogames being unplugged.\n\nRalph learns that he can obtain a medal from the [[first-person shooter]], ''Hero's Duty''. After disrupting a videogame session, Ralph scales the game's central beacon and obtains a medal, only to hatch a Cy-Bug, a dangerous robot insect. Ralph and the Cy-Bug stumble into an [[escape pod]], which is launched out of the game, and crash lands in ''Sugar Rush'', a confectionery-themed [[kart racing video game]]. With Ralph missing, his game is labeled as malfunctioning and faces being unplugged. Felix ventures to ''Hero's Duty'' and allies with the videogame's heroine, Sergeant Calhoun, to find Ralph and the Cy-Bug.\n\nA young girl named Vanellope von Schweetz steals Ralph's medal to buy her way into the nightly race that determines which characters are playable the next day, but King Candy, the ruler of ''Sugar Rush'', forbids her from racing because she has [[Glitch#Video game glitches|glitches]] that cause her to [[Teleportation|teleport]] erratically. Ralph reluctantly agrees to work with Vanellope to retrieve his medal and help her win a race. They build a kart and hide out at Diet Cola Mountain, an unfinished race track, where Ralph teaches her to drive. King Candy [[Hacker culture|hacks]] the game's code to obtain Ralph's medal and offers it to Ralph in exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He explains that if Vanellope wins she will become playable and her glitches will lead to ''Sugar Rush'' being unplugged. Unable to leave the game because of her glitch, Vanellope will be left to disappear while King Candy and his subjects become homeless in the arcade. Ralph reluctantly agrees and destroys Vanellope's kart. Heartbroken, she declares he \"really is a bad guy\" and runs off distraught. Upon returning to his videogame, which has been evacuated in anticipation of it being unplugged the next morning, Ralph notices Vanellope's image on the side of the ''Sugar Rush'' cabinet and realizes she was meant to be a playable character. He returns to ''Sugar Rush'' and learns that King Candy had deleted her code to render her a glitch, and locked up all of the other characters' memories of her, resulting in her becoming a hated outcast.\n\nMeanwhile, Felix and Calhoun search ''Sugar Rush'' for Ralph. Felix falls in love with Calhoun, but she abandons him when he inadvertently reminds her of her late fianc\u00e9 who was killed by a Cy-Bug on their wedding day. Felix is later imprisoned in King Candy's castle, but Ralph frees him and Vanellope, and Felix repairs the kart. Calhoun discovers a swarm of Cy-Bug eggs underground, which hatch and start attacking the videogame.\n\nVanellope participates in the race but is attacked by King Candy. Vanellope's glitch causes him to be unmasked as Turbo, who took over ''Sugar Rush'' and displaced Vanellope as the main character. Vanellope glitches to escape Turbo, who is then eaten by a Cy-Bug. Ralph, Felix, and Calhoun evacuate the game, but Vanellope is trapped due to her glitches. When Calhoun points out that the Cy-Bugs can be attracted and destroyed by a beacon of light as in ''Hero's Duty'', Ralph decides to make Diet Cola Mountain [[Diet Coke and Mentos eruption|erupt]], replicating the beacon. Ralph is confronted by Turbo, now fused with the Cy-Bug that devoured him. Ralph makes the mountain erupt and falls into its depths to sacrifice himself, but Vanellope saves him using her glitching ability. The eruption lures and permanently destroys the Cy-Bugs and Turbo too.\n\nVanellope crosses the finish line, rebooting ''Sugar Rush'' and restoring her status and memory as Princess Vanellope, the main character of the videogame, but she chooses to keep her glitching ability. Ralph and Felix return home and their video game is restored. Felix and Calhoun marry. Vanellope's glitches make her a popular playable character, and a content Ralph gains respect from his fellow characters.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Sarah Silverman John C.

Wreck-It Ralph, the antagonist of the video game ''Fix-It Felix Jr.'', is ostracized by its other characters for being the video game's villain, while the titular hero Felix is praised and awarded medals. After the game's inhabitants exclude Ralph from the game's thirtieth-anniversary party, he sets out to earn a medal for himself to gain his neighbors' respect. Felix worries that Ralph has \"gone Turbo\"\u2014a term coined when notorious [[Racing video game|racing videogame]] character Turbo attempted to take over ''[[RoadBlasters]]'' out of jealousy, which resulted in both of their videogames being unplugged.\n\nRalph learns that he can obtain a medal from the [[first-person shooter]], ''Hero's Duty''. After disrupting a videogame session, Ralph scales the game's central beacon and obtains a medal, only to hatch a Cy-Bug, a dangerous robot insect. Ralph and the Cy-Bug stumble into an [[escape pod]], which is launched out of the game, and crash lands in ''Sugar Rush'', a confectionery-themed [[kart racing video game]]. With Ralph missing, his game is labeled as malfunctioning and faces being unplugged. Felix ventures to ''Hero's Duty'' and allies with the videogame's heroine, Sergeant Calhoun, to find Ralph and the Cy-Bug.\n\nA young girl named Vanellope von Schweetz steals Ralph's medal to buy her way into the nightly race that determines which characters are playable the next day, but King Candy, the ruler of ''Sugar Rush'', forbids her from racing because she has [[Glitch#Video game glitches|glitches]] that cause her to [[Teleportation|teleport]] erratically. Ralph reluctantly agrees to work with Vanellope to retrieve his medal and help her win a race. They build a kart and hide out at Diet Cola Mountain, an unfinished race track, where Ralph teaches her to drive. King Candy [[Hacker culture|hacks]] the game's code to obtain Ralph's medal and offers it to Ralph in exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He explains that if Vanellope wins she will become playable and her glitches will lead to ''Sugar Rush'' being unplugged. Unable to leave the game because of her glitch, Vanellope will be left to disappear while King Candy and his subjects become homeless in the arcade. Ralph reluctantly agrees and destroys Vanellope's kart. Heartbroken, she declares he \"really is a bad guy\" and runs off distraught. Upon returning to his videogame, which has been evacuated in anticipation of it being unplugged the next morning, Ralph notices Vanellope's image on the side of the ''Sugar Rush'' cabinet and realizes she was meant to be a playable character. He returns to ''Sugar Rush'' and learns that King Candy had deleted her code to render her a glitch, and locked up all of the other characters' memories of her, resulting in her becoming a hated outcast.\n\nMeanwhile, Felix and Calhoun search ''Sugar Rush'' for Ralph. Felix falls in love with Calhoun, but she abandons him when he inadvertently reminds her of her late fianc\u00e9 who was killed by a Cy-Bug on their wedding day. Felix is later imprisoned in King Candy's castle, but Ralph frees him and Vanellope, and Felix repairs the kart. Calhoun discovers a swarm of Cy-Bug eggs underground, which hatch and start attacking the videogame.\n\nVanellope participates in the race but is attacked by King Candy. Vanellope's glitch causes him to be unmasked as Turbo, who took over ''Sugar Rush'' and displaced Vanellope as the main character. Vanellope glitches to escape Turbo, who is then eaten by a Cy-Bug. Ralph, Felix, and Calhoun evacuate the game, but Vanellope is trapped due to her glitches. When Calhoun points out that the Cy-Bugs can be attracted and destroyed by a beacon of light as in ''Hero's Duty'', Ralph decides to make Diet Cola Mountain [[Diet Coke and Mentos eruption|erupt]], replicating the beacon. Ralph is confronted by Turbo, now fused with the Cy-Bug that devoured him. Ralph makes the mountain erupt and falls into its depths to sacrifice himself, but Vanellope saves him using her glitching ability. The eruption lures and permanently destroys the Cy-Bugs and Turbo too.\n\nVanellope crosses the finish line, rebooting ''Sugar Rush'' and restoring her status and memory as Princess Vanellope, the main character of the videogame, but she chooses to keep her glitching ability. Ralph and Felix return home and their video game is restored. Felix and Calhoun marry. Vanellope's glitches make her a popular playable character, and a content Ralph gains respect from his fellow characters.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Sarah Silverman John C.

A tendency away from the [[narrative]], which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward [[abstraction]] is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called [[contemporary art]] or [[postmodern art]].\n\nModern art begins with the heritage of painters like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] all of whom were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the [[Proto-Cubism|pre-cubists]] [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Matisse's two versions of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.<ref>Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.</ref> It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]].\n\nInitially influenced by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Gauguin]] and other late-19th-century innovators, [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on C\u00e9zanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]] was jointly developed by Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris,'' from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and several other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier coll\u00e9]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe notion of modern art is closely related to [[modernism]].<ref>\"One way of understanding the relation of the terms 'modern,' 'modernity,' and 'modernism' is that aesthetic modernism is a form of art characteristic of high or actualized late modernity, that is, of that period in which social, economic, and cultural life in the widest sense [was] revolutionized by modernity ... [this means] that modernist art is scarcely thinkable outside the context of the modernized society of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Social modernity is the home of modernist art, even where that art rebels against it.\" Cahoone 1996, p. 13.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[\u00c9douard Manet]], ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], [[Paris]]]]\n\n=== Roots in the 19th century ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Van Gogh - la courtisane.jpg\n| width1    = 94\n| caption1  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Courtesan (after [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt1      = Multi-colored portrait of a far eastern cortesan with elaborate hair ornamentation, colorful robelike garment, and a border depicting marshland waters and reeds.\n| image2    = Vincent van Gogh - Bloeiende pruimenboomgaard- naar Hiroshige - Google Art Project.jpg\n| width2    = 133\n| caption2  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''The Blooming Plumtree (after [[Hiroshige]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt2      = Portrait of a tree with blossoms and with far eastern alphabet letters both in the portrait and along the left and right borders.\n| image3    = Van Gogh - Portrait of Pere Tanguy 1887-8.JPG\n| width3    = 126\n| caption3  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''[[Portrait of P\u00e8re Tanguy]]'' (1887), [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]]\n| alt3      = Portrait of a man of a bearded man facing forward, holding his own hands in his lap; wearing a hat, blue coat, beige collared shirt and brown pants; sitting in front of a background with various tiles of far eastern and nature themed art.\n}}\n\nAlthough modern [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]] are reckoned to have emerged at the end of the 19th century, the beginnings of modern [[painting]] can be located earlier.<ref>Arnason 1998, p. 10.</ref> The date perhaps most commonly identified as marking the birth of modern art is 1863,<ref name=\"Arn13\">Arnason 1998, p. 17.</ref> the year that [[\u00c9douard Manet]] showed his painting ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' in the ''[[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]]'' in Paris. Earlier dates have also been proposed, among them 1855 (the year [[Gustave Courbet]] exhibited ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'') and 1784 (the year [[Jacques-Louis David]] completed his painting ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]'').<ref name=\"Arn13\" /> In the words of art historian [[H. Harvard Arnason]]: \"Each of these dates has significance for the development of modern art, but none categorically marks a completely new beginning ....  A gradual metamorphosis took place in the course of a hundred years.\"<ref name=\"Arn13\" />\n\nThe strands of thought that eventually led to modern art can be traced back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref>\"In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries momentum began to gather behind a new ''view'' of the world, which would eventually create a new ''world'', the modern world\". Cahoone 1996, p. 27.</ref> The important modern art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], for instance, called [[Immanuel Kant]] \"the first real Modernist\" but also drew a distinction: \"The Enlightenment criticized from the outside ... . Modernism criticizes from the inside.\"<ref>Frascina and Harrison 1982, p. 5.</ref> The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 uprooted assumptions and institutions that had for centuries been accepted with little question and accustomed the public to vigorous political and social debate. This gave rise to what art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a \"self-consciousness that made people select the style of their building as one selects the pattern of a wallpaper.\"<ref>Gombrich 1958, pp. 358\u2013359.</ref>\n\nThe pioneers of modern art were [[Romanticism|Romantics]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].<ref>Arnason 1998, p. 22.</ref> By the late 19th century, additional movements which were to be influential in modern art had begun to emerge: [[post-Impressionism]] as well as [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].\n\nInfluences upon these movements were varied: from exposure to Eastern decorative arts, particularly [[Japonism|Japanese printmaking]], to the coloristic innovations of [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], to a search for more [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the depiction of common life, as found in the work of painters such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]]. The advocates of realism stood against the [[idealism]] of the tradition-bound [[academic art]] that enjoyed public and official favor.<ref>Corinth, Schuster, Brauner, Vitali, and Butts 1996, p.25.</ref> The most successful painters of the day worked either through commissions or through large public exhibitions of their own work. There were official, government-sponsored painters' unions, while governments regularly held public exhibitions of new fine and decorative arts.\n\nThe Impressionists argued that people do not see objects but only the light which they reflect, and therefore painters should paint in natural light ([[en plein air]]) rather than in studios and should capture the effects of light in their work.<ref>Cogniat 1975, p. 61.</ref> Impressionist artists formed a group, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Coop\u00e9rative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' (\"Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\") which, despite internal tensions, mounted a series of independent exhibitions.<ref>Cogniat 1975, pp. 43\u201349.</ref> The style was adopted by artists in different nations, in preference to a \"national\" style. These factors established the view that it was a [[Art movement|\"movement\"]]. These traits\u2014establishment of a working method integral to the art, establishment of a movement or visible active core of support, and international adoption\u2014would be repeated by artistic movements in the Modern period in art.\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]] ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' 1907, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\n[[File:La danse (I) by Matisse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Dance (Matisse)|The Dance I]]'', 1909, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\nAmong the movements which flowered in the first decade of the 20th century were [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Expressionism]], and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]].\n\nDuring the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the [[Salon d'Automne]] where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] and Salon d\u2019Automne, and his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. ''[[The Song of Love (Giorgio de Chirico)|Song of Love]]'' (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was \"founded\" by [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] in 1924.\n\nWorld War I brought an end to this phase but indicated the beginning of a number of [[anti-art]] movements, such as [[Dada]], including the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], and of [[Surrealism]]. Artist groups like [[de Stijl]] and [[Bauhaus]] developed new ideas about the interrelation of the arts, architecture, design, and art education.\n\nModern art was introduced to the United States with the [[Armory Show]] in 1913 and through European artists who moved to the U.S. during World War I.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nIt was only after World War II, however, that the U.S. became the focal point of new artistic movements.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010</ref> The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Color field painting]], [[Conceptual art]]ists of [[Art & Language]], [[Pop art]], [[Op art]], [[Hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Photorealism]] and various other movements.

A tendency away from the [[narrative]], which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward [[abstraction]] is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called [[contemporary art]] or [[postmodern art]].\n\nModern art begins with the heritage of painters like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] all of whom were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the [[Proto-Cubism|pre-cubists]] [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Matisse's two versions of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.<ref>Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.</ref> It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]].\n\nInitially influenced by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Gauguin]] and other late-19th-century innovators, [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on C\u00e9zanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]] was jointly developed by Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris,'' from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and several other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier coll\u00e9]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe notion of modern art is closely related to [[modernism]].<ref>\"One way of understanding the relation of the terms 'modern,' 'modernity,' and 'modernism' is that aesthetic modernism is a form of art characteristic of high or actualized late modernity, that is, of that period in which social, economic, and cultural life in the widest sense [was] revolutionized by modernity ... [this means] that modernist art is scarcely thinkable outside the context of the modernized society of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Social modernity is the home of modernist art, even where that art rebels against it.\" Cahoone 1996, p. 13.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[\u00c9douard Manet]], ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], [[Paris]]]]\n\n=== Roots in the 19th century ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Van Gogh - la courtisane.jpg\n| width1    = 94\n| caption1  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Courtesan (after [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt1      = Multi-colored portrait of a far eastern cortesan with elaborate hair ornamentation, colorful robelike garment, and a border depicting marshland waters and reeds.\n| image2    = Vincent van Gogh - Bloeiende pruimenboomgaard- naar Hiroshige - Google Art Project.jpg\n| width2    = 133\n| caption2  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''The Blooming Plumtree (after [[Hiroshige]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt2      = Portrait of a tree with blossoms and with far eastern alphabet letters both in the portrait and along the left and right borders.\n| image3    = Van Gogh - Portrait of Pere Tanguy 1887-8.JPG\n| width3    = 126\n| caption3  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''[[Portrait of P\u00e8re Tanguy]]'' (1887), [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]]\n| alt3      = Portrait of a man of a bearded man facing forward, holding his own hands in his lap; wearing a hat, blue coat, beige collared shirt and brown pants; sitting in front of a background with various tiles of far eastern and nature themed art.\n}}\n\nAlthough modern [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]] are reckoned to have emerged at the end of the 19th century, the beginnings of modern [[painting]] can be located earlier.<ref>Arnason 1998, p. 10.</ref> The date perhaps most commonly identified as marking the birth of modern art is 1863,<ref name=\"Arn13\">Arnason 1998, p. 17.</ref> the year that [[\u00c9douard Manet]] showed his painting ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' in the ''[[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]]'' in Paris.

M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], to a search for more [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the depiction of common life, as found in the work of painters such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]]. The advocates of realism stood against the [[idealism]] of the tradition-bound [[academic art]] that enjoyed public and official favor.<ref>Corinth, Schuster, Brauner, Vitali, and Butts 1996, p.25.</ref> The most successful painters of the day worked either through commissions or through large public exhibitions of their own work. There were official, government-sponsored painters' unions, while governments regularly held public exhibitions of new fine and decorative arts.\n\nThe Impressionists argued that people do not see objects but only the light which they reflect, and therefore painters should paint in natural light ([[en plein air]]) rather than in studios and should capture the effects of light in their work.<ref>Cogniat 1975, p. 61.</ref> Impressionist artists formed a group, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Coop\u00e9rative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' (\"Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\") which, despite internal tensions, mounted a series of independent exhibitions.<ref>Cogniat 1975, pp. 43\u201349.</ref> The style was adopted by artists in different nations, in preference to a \"national\" style. These factors established the view that it was a [[Art movement|\"movement\"]]. These traits\u2014establishment of a working method integral to the art, establishment of a movement or visible active core of support, and international adoption\u2014would be repeated by artistic movements in the Modern period in art.\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]] ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' 1907, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\n[[File:La danse (I) by Matisse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Dance (Matisse)|The Dance I]]'', 1909, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\nAmong the movements which flowered in the first decade of the 20th century were [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Expressionism]], and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]].\n\nDuring the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the [[Salon d'Automne]] where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] and Salon d\u2019Automne, and his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. ''[[The Song of Love (Giorgio de Chirico)|Song of Love]]'' (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was \"founded\" by [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] in 1924.\n\nWorld War I brought an end to this phase but indicated the beginning of a number of [[anti-art]] movements, such as [[Dada]], including the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], and of [[Surrealism]]. Artist groups like [[de Stijl]] and [[Bauhaus]] developed new ideas about the interrelation of the arts, architecture, design, and art education.\n\nModern art was introduced to the United States with the [[Armory Show]] in 1913 and through European artists who moved to the U.S. during World War I.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nIt was only after World War II, however, that the U.S. became the focal point of new artistic movements.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010</ref> The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Color field painting]], [[Conceptual art]]ists of [[Art & Language]], [[Pop art]], [[Op art]], [[Hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Photorealism]] and various other movements.
