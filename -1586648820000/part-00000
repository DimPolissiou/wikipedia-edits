When the retroviral DNA is integrated into the host genome they evolve into endogenous retroviruses that influence eukaryotic genomes. So many endogenous retroviruses have inserted themselves into eukaryotic genomes that they allow insight into biology between viral-host interactions and the role of retrotransposons in evolution and disease.\nMany retrotransposons share features with endogenous retroviruses, the property of recognising and fusing with the host genome. However, there is a key difference between retroviruses and retrotransposons, which is indicated by the env gene. Although similar to the gene carrying out the same function in retroviruses, the env gene is used to determine whether the gene is retroviral or retrotransposon. If the gene is retroviral it can evolve from a retrotransposon into a retrovirus. They differ by the order of sequences in pol genes. Env genes are found in LTR retrotransposon types Ty1-copia ([[Pseudoviridae]]), Ty3-gypsy ([[Metaviridae]]) and BEL/Pao. <ref name=\"Copland\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Copeland CS, Mann VH, Morales ME, Kalinna BH, Brindley PJ | title = The Sinbad retrotransposon from the genome of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, and the distribution of related Pao-like elements | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15725362 | pmc = 554778 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-5-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"wicker\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicker T, Sabot F, Hua-Van A, Bennetzen JL, Capy P, Chalhoub B, Flavell A, Leroy P, Morgante M, Panaud O, Paux E, SanMiguel P, Schulman AH | title = A unified classification system for eukaryotic transposable elements | journal = Nature Reviews.

Those two key components of the retrotransposon are still necessary but the way they are incorporated into the chemical reactions is different. This is because unlike LTR retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons do not contain sequences that bind tRNA. \n\nThey mostly fall into two types - LINEs and SINEs. SVA elements are the exception between the two as they share similarities with both LINEs and SINEs, containing Alu elements and different numbers of the same repeat. SVAs are shorter than LINEs but longer than SINEs. \n\nWhile historically viewed as \"junk DNA\", research suggests in some cases, both LINEs and SINEs were incorporated into novel genes so as to evolve new functionality.<ref name=\"Santangelo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santangelo AM, de Souza FS, Franchini LF, Bumaschny VF, Low MJ, Rubinstein M | title = Ancient exaptation of a CORE-SINE retroposon into a highly conserved mammalian neuronal enhancer of the proopiomelanocortin gene | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 1813\u201326 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17922573 | pmc = 2000970 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030166 }}</ref>\n\n===LINEs===\n{{Main article | Long interspersed nuclear element}}\n\nWhen a LINE is transcribed, the transcript contains an RNA polymerase II promoter that ensures LINEs can be copied into whichever location it decides to insert itself into.

This transcript is the RNA transposition intermediate.  \n\nThe RNA transposition intermediate moves from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation. This gives the two coding regions of a LINE that in turn binds back to the RNA it is transcribed from. The LINE RNA then moves back into the nucleus to insert into the eukaryotic genome. \n\nLINEs insert themselves into regions of the eukaryotic genome that are rich in bases AT. At AT regions LINE uses its nuclease to cut one strand of the eukaryotic double-stranded DNA. The adenine-rich sequence in LINE transcript base pairs with the cut strand to flag where the LINE will be inserted with hydroxyl groups. Reverse transcriptase recognises these hydroxyl groups to synthesise LINE retrotransposon where the DNA is cut. Like with LTR retrotransposons, this new inserted LINE contains eukaryotic genome information so it can be copied and pasted into other genomic regions easily. The information sequences are longer and more variable than those in LTR retrotransposons. \n\nMost LINE copies have variable length at the start because reverse transcription usually stops before DNA synthesis is complete.

SINEs cannot transpose by themselves because they cannot encode SINE transcripts. They usually consist of parts derived from tRNA and LINEs. The tRNA portion contains an RNA polymerase III promoter which the same kind of enzyme as RNA polymerase II. This makes sure the LINE copies would be transcriped into RNA for further transposition. The LINE component remains so LINE-binding proteins can recognise the LINE part of the SINE.\n\n====Alu elements====\n{{Main article |Alu element}}\nThe most common SINE in primates is [[Alu element|''Alu'']]. Alu elements are approximately 350 base pairs long, do not contain any coding sequences, and can be recognized by the [[restriction enzyme]] [[List of restriction enzyme cutting sites: A#Whole list navigation|AluI]] (hence the name). The distribution of these elements has been implicated in some genetic diseases and cancers. Copy and pasting Alu RNA requires the Alu\u2019s adenine-rich end and the rest of the sequence bound to a signal. The signal-bound Alu region can then associate with ribosomes. LINE RNA associates on the same ribosomes as the Alu elements. Binding to the same ribosome allows Alu elements of SINEs to interact with LINE. This simultaneous translation of Alu element and LINE allows SINE copy and pasting.\n\n==SVA elements==\nSVA elements are present at lower levels than SINES and LINEs in humans. The starts of SVA and Alu elements are similar, followed by repeats and an end similar to endogenous retrovirus. LINEs bind to sites flanking SVA elements to transpose them. SVA are one of the youngest transposable element in great apes genome and among the most active and polymorphic in the human population.\n\nA recent study developed a network method that reveals SVA retroelement (RE) proliferation dynamics in\nhominid genomes <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy OR, Knisbacher BA, Levanon EY, Havlin SH | title = Integrating networks and comparative genomics reveals retroelement proliferation dynamics in hominid genomes | journal = Science Advances | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | date = 2017 | pages = e1701256 | pmid = 29043294| pmc = 5640379 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1701256 }}</ref>The method enable to track the course of SVA proliferation, identify yet unknown active communities, and detect tentative \u201cmaster REs\u201d that play key roles in SVA propagation. Thus, providing  support for the fundamental \u201cmaster gene\u201d model of RE proliferation.\n\n==Role in human disease==\nRetrotransposons ensure they are not lost by chance by occurring only in cell genetics that can be passed on from one generation to the next from parent gametes. However, LINEs can transpose into the human embryo cells that eventually develop into the nervous system, raising the question whether this LINE retrotransposition affects brain function. LINE retrotransposition is also a feature of several cancers, but it is unclear whether retrotransposition itself causes cancer instead of just a symptom.\nUncontrolled retrotransposition is bad for both the host organism and retrotransposons themselves so they have to be regulated. Retrotransposons are regulated by [[RNA interference]]. RNA interference is carried out by a bunch of short [[Non-coding_RNA|non-coding RNAs]]. The short non-coding RNA interacts with protein Argonaute to degrade retrotransposon transcripts and change their DNA histone structure to reduce their transcription.\n\n==Role in evolution==\nLTR retrotransposons came about later than non-LTR retrotransposons, possibly from an ancestral non-LTR retrotransposon acquiring an integrase from a DNA transposon. Retroviruses gained additional properties to their virus envelopes by taking the relevant genes from other viruses using the power of LTR retrotransposon.\n\nDue to their retrotransposition mechanism, retrotransposons amplify in number quickly, composing 40% of the human genome. The insertion rates for LINE1, Alu and SVA elements are 1/200 - 1/20, 1/20 and 1/900 respectively. The LINE1 insertion rates have varied a lot over the past 35 million years, so they indicate points in genome evolution. \n\nNotably a large number of 100 kilobases in the maize genome show variety due to the presence or absence of retrotransposons. However since maize is unusually genetically compared to other plants it cannot be used to predict retrotransposition in other plants.\n\nMutations caused by retrotransposons include:\n* Gene inactivation\n* Changing gene regulation\n* Changing gene products\n* Acting as DNA repair sites\n==Role in biotechnology==\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transposon]]\n* [[Paleogenetics]]\n* [[Paleovirology]]\n* [[Insertion sequences]]\n* [[Copy-number variation]]\n* [[Genomic organization]]\n* [[Interspersed repeat]]\n* [[Retrotransposon marker]]s, a powerful method of reconstructing phylogenies.\n* [[RetrOryza]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Repeated sequence}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile genetic elements]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Retrotransposons.png|right|Simplified representation of the life cycle of a retrotransposon|440px]]\n\n'''Retrotransposons''' (also called '''Class I transposable elements''' or '''transposons via RNA intermediates''') are a type of [[Gene|genetic]] component that copy and paste themselves into different genomic locations ([[transposon]]) by converting RNA back into DNA through the process [[reverse transcription]] using an RNA transposition intermediate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dombroski BA, Feng Q, Mathias SL, Sassaman DM, Scott AF, Kazazian HH, Boeke JD | title = An in vivo assay for the reverse transcriptase of human retrotransposon L1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 4485\u201392 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 7516468 | pmc = 358820 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.14.7.4485 }}</ref> \n\nThrough reverse transcription retrotransposons amplify themselves quickly to become abundant in eukaryotic genomes such as [[maize]] (49-78%) <ref name=\"SanMiguelandBennetzen\">{{cite journal |vauthors=SanMiguel P, Bennetzen JL |title=Evidence that a recent increase in maize genome size was caused by the massive amplification of intergene retrotranposons |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=82 |issue=Suppl A |pages=37\u201344 |year=1998 |url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/82/suppl_1/37.pdf |doi=10.1006/anbo.1998.0746}}</ref>and humans (42%).<ref name=\"Landeretal\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lander ES, Linton LM, Birren B, Nusbaum C, Zody MC, Baldwin J, etal | title = Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 860\u2013921 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11237011 | doi = 10.1038/35057062 }}</ref> They are only present in eukaryotes but share features with [[retrovirus|retroviruses]] such as [[HIV]].\n\nThere are two main types of retrotransposon, LTR and non-LTRs.

When the retroviral DNA is integrated into the host genome they evolve into endogenous retroviruses that influence eukaryotic genomes. So many endogenous retroviruses have inserted themselves into eukaryotic genomes that they allow insight into biology between viral-host interactions and the role of retrotransposons in evolution and disease.\nMany retrotransposons share features with endogenous retroviruses, the property of recognising and fusing with the host genome. However, there is a key difference between retroviruses and retrotransposons, which is indicated by the env gene. Although similar to the gene carrying out the same function in retroviruses, the env gene is used to determine whether the gene is retroviral or retrotransposon. If the gene is retroviral it can evolve from a retrotransposon into a retrovirus. They differ by the order of sequences in pol genes. Env genes are found in LTR retrotransposon types Ty1-copia ([[Pseudoviridae]]), Ty3-gypsy ([[Metaviridae]]) and BEL/Pao. <ref name=\"Copland\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Copeland CS, Mann VH, Morales ME, Kalinna BH, Brindley PJ | title = The Sinbad retrotransposon from the genome of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, and the distribution of related Pao-like elements | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15725362 | pmc = 554778 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-5-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"wicker\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicker T, Sabot F, Hua-Van A, Bennetzen JL, Capy P, Chalhoub B, Flavell A, Leroy P, Morgante M, Panaud O, Paux E, SanMiguel P, Schulman AH | title = A unified classification system for eukaryotic transposable elements | journal = Nature Reviews.

RNA-binding protein binds RNA-transposition intermediate. Nucleases are enzymes that break phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides in nucleic acids. Instead they have short repeats thats can have an inverted order of bases next to each other aside from [[Direct repeat|direct repeats]] found in LTR retrotransposons that is just one sequence of bases repeating itself. \n\nAlthough they are retrotransposons, they cannot carry out reverse transcription using an RNA transposition intermediate in the same way as LTR retrotransposons. Those two key components of the retrotransposon are still necessary but the way they are incorporated into the chemical reactions is different. This is because unlike LTR retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons do not contain sequences that bind tRNA. \n\nThey mostly fall into two types - LINEs and SINEs. SVA elements are the exception between the two as they share similarities with both LINEs and SINEs, containing Alu elements and different numbers of the same repeat. SVAs are shorter than LINEs but longer than SINEs. \n\nWhile historically viewed as \"junk DNA\", research suggests in some cases, both LINEs and SINEs were incorporated into novel genes so as to evolve new functionality.<ref name=\"Santangelo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santangelo AM, de Souza FS, Franchini LF, Bumaschny VF, Low MJ, Rubinstein M | title = Ancient exaptation of a CORE-SINE retroposon into a highly conserved mammalian neuronal enhancer of the proopiomelanocortin gene | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 1813\u201326 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17922573 | pmc = 2000970 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030166 }}</ref>\n\n===LINEs===\n{{Main article | Long interspersed nuclear element}}\n\nWhen a LINE is transcribed, the transcript contains an RNA polymerase II promoter that ensures LINEs can be copied into whichever location it decides to insert itself into.

This transcript is the RNA transposition intermediate.  \n\nThe RNA transposition intermediate moves from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation. This gives the two coding regions of a LINE that in turn binds back to the RNA it is transcribed from. The LINE RNA then moves back into the nucleus to insert into the eukaryotic genome. \n\nLINEs insert themselves into regions of the eukaryotic genome that are rich in bases AT. At AT regions LINE uses its nuclease to cut one strand of the eukaryotic double-stranded DNA. The adenine-rich sequence in LINE transcript base pairs with the cut strand to flag where the LINE will be inserted with hydroxyl groups. Reverse transcriptase recognises these hydroxyl groups to synthesise LINE retrotransposon where the DNA is cut. Like with LTR retrotransposons, this new inserted LINE contains eukaryotic genome information so it can be copied and pasted into other genomic regions easily. The information sequences are longer and more variable than those in LTR retrotransposons. \n\nMost LINE copies have variable length at the start because reverse transcription usually stops before DNA synthesis is complete. In some cases this causes RNA polymerase II promoter to be lost so LINEs cannot transpose further.<ref name=Singer>{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer MF | title = SINEs and LINEs: highly repeated short and long interspersed sequences in mammalian genomes | journal = Cell | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 433\u20134 | date = March 1982 | pmid = 6280868 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(82)90194-5 }}</ref>\n\n====Human L1====\n{{Main article | LINE1}}\n\nAmong the LINE, there are several subgroups, such as L1, L2 and L3.

SINEs cannot transpose by themselves because they cannot encode SINE transcripts. They usually consist of parts derived from tRNA and LINEs. The tRNA portion contains an RNA polymerase III promoter which the same kind of enzyme as RNA polymerase II. This makes sure the LINE copies would be transcriped into RNA for further transposition. The LINE component remains so LINE-binding proteins can recognise the LINE part of the SINE.\n\n====Alu elements====\n{{Main article |Alu element}}\nThe most common SINE in primates is [[Alu element|''Alu'']]. Alu elements are approximately 350 base pairs long, do not contain any coding sequences, and can be recognized by the [[restriction enzyme]] [[List of restriction enzyme cutting sites: A#Whole list navigation|AluI]] (hence the name). The distribution of these elements has been implicated in some genetic diseases and cancers. Copy and pasting Alu RNA requires the Alu\u2019s adenine-rich end and the rest of the sequence bound to a signal. The signal-bound Alu region can then associate with ribosomes. LINE RNA associates on the same ribosomes as the Alu elements. Binding to the same ribosome allows Alu elements of SINEs to interact with LINE. This simultaneous translation of Alu element and LINE allows SINE copy and pasting.\n\n==SVA elements==\nSVA elements are present at lower levels than SINES and LINEs in humans. The starts of SVA and Alu elements are similar, followed by repeats and an end similar to endogenous retrovirus. LINEs bind to sites flanking SVA elements to transpose them. SVA are one of the youngest transposable element in great apes genome and among the most active and polymorphic in the human population.\n\nA recent study developed a network method that reveals SVA retroelement (RE) proliferation dynamics in\nhominid genomes <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy OR, Knisbacher BA, Levanon EY, Havlin SH | title = Integrating networks and comparative genomics reveals retroelement proliferation dynamics in hominid genomes | journal = Science Advances | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | date = 2017 | pages = e1701256 | pmid = 29043294| pmc = 5640379 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1701256 }}</ref>The method enable to track the course of SVA proliferation, identify yet unknown active communities, and detect tentative \u201cmaster REs\u201d that play key roles in SVA propagation. Thus, providing  support for the fundamental \u201cmaster gene\u201d model of RE proliferation.\n\n==Role in human disease==\nRetrotransposons ensure they are not lost by chance by occurring only in cell genetics that can be passed on from one generation to the next from parent gametes. However, LINEs can transpose into the human embryo cells that eventually develop into the nervous system, raising the question whether this LINE retrotransposition affects brain function. LINE retrotransposition is also a feature of several cancers, but it is unclear whether retrotransposition itself causes cancer instead of just a symptom.\nUncontrolled retrotransposition is bad for both the host organism and retrotransposons themselves so they have to be regulated. Retrotransposons are regulated by [[RNA interference]]. RNA interference is carried out by a bunch of short [[Non-coding_RNA|non-coding RNAs]]. The short non-coding RNA interacts with protein Argonaute to degrade retrotransposon transcripts and change their DNA histone structure to reduce their transcription.\n\n==Role in evolution==\nLTR retrotransposons came about later than non-LTR retrotransposons, possibly from an ancestral non-LTR retrotransposon acquiring an integrase from a DNA transposon. Retroviruses gained additional properties to their virus envelopes by taking the relevant genes from other viruses using the power of LTR retrotransposon.\n\nDue to their retrotransposition mechanism, retrotransposons amplify in number quickly, composing 40% of the human genome. The insertion rates for LINE1, Alu and SVA elements are 1/200 - 1/20, 1/20 and 1/900 respectively. The LINE1 insertion rates have varied a lot over the past 35 million years, so they indicate points in genome evolution. \n\nNotably a large number of 100 kilobases in the maize genome show variety due to the presence or absence of retrotransposons. However since maize is unusually genetically compared to other plants it cannot be used to predict retrotransposition in other plants.\n\nMutations caused by retrotransposons include:\n* Gene inactivation\n* Changing gene regulation\n* Changing gene products\n* Acting as DNA repair sites\n==Role in biotechnology==\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transposon]]\n* [[Paleogenetics]]\n* [[Paleovirology]]\n* [[Insertion sequences]]\n* [[Copy-number variation]]\n* [[Genomic organization]]\n* [[Interspersed repeat]]\n* [[Retrotransposon marker]]s, a powerful method of reconstructing phylogenies.\n* [[RetrOryza]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Repeated sequence}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile genetic elements]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n", "name_user": "Pizzanotsinkships", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEndogenous retrovirus", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon"}

The midfield led by the inspired trio of [[Fabio Pecchia]], [[Matteo Brighi]] and [[Lamberto Zauli]] performed brilliantly all season, but Bologna's economy was not enough to keep those players at the club, and Pecchia signed for newcomers [[Calcio Como|Como]], while Zauli went to [[Serie B]] club [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. That Bologna could not retain players who could get a better pay at smaller but ambitious clubs was a worrying sign in spite of the spectacular season. It also had to sell defender [[Salvatore Fresi]] to champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], and looked set for a tougher season in [[2002-03 Serie A|2002-03]]. Fresi's 2001-02 season was included an incredible eight league goals, despite being a centre-half.\n\n==Squad==\n\n===Goalkeepers===\n* {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Gianluca Pagliuca]]\n* {{flagicon|ITA}}

1909|Bologna Football Club 1909]]''' came as close as ever to reach the [[UEFA Champions League]], when only a couple of mishaps at the end of the season stopped the dream season to come true. The midfield led by the inspired trio of [[Fabio Pecchia]], [[Matteo Brighi]] and [[Lamberto Zauli]] performed brilliantly all season, but Bologna's economy was not enough to keep those players at the club, and Pecchia signed for newcomers [[Calcio Como|Como]], while Zauli went to [[Serie B]] club [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. That Bologna could not retain players who could get a better pay at smaller but ambitious clubs was a worrying sign in spite of the spectacular season. It also had to sell defender [[Salvatore Fresi]] to champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], and looked set for a tougher season in [[2002-03 Serie A|2002-03]]. Fresi's 2001-02 season was included an incredible eight league goals, despite being a centre-half.\n\n==Squad==\n\n===Goalkeepers===\n* {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Gianluca Pagliuca]]\n* {{flagicon|ITA}}

When the retroviral DNA is integrated into the host genome they evolve into endogenous retroviruses that influence eukaryotic genomes. So many endogenous retroviruses have inserted themselves into eukaryotic genomes that they allow insight into biology between viral-host interactions and the role of retrotransposons in evolution and disease.\nMany retrotransposons share features with endogenous retroviruses, the property of recognising and fusing with the host genome. However, there is a key difference between retroviruses and retrotransposons, which is indicated by the env gene. Although similar to the gene carrying out the same function in retroviruses, the env gene is used to determine whether the gene is retroviral or retrotransposon. If the gene is retroviral it can evolve from a retrotransposon into a retrovirus. They differ by the order of sequences in pol genes. Env genes are found in LTR retrotransposon types Ty1-copia ([[Pseudoviridae]]), Ty3-gypsy ([[Metaviridae]]) and BEL/Pao. <ref name=\"Copland\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Copeland CS, Mann VH, Morales ME, Kalinna BH, Brindley PJ | title = The Sinbad retrotransposon from the genome of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, and the distribution of related Pao-like elements | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15725362 | pmc = 554778 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-5-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"wicker\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicker T, Sabot F, Hua-Van A, Bennetzen JL, Capy P, Chalhoub B, Flavell A, Leroy P, Morgante M, Panaud O, Paux E, SanMiguel P, Schulman AH | title = A unified classification system for eukaryotic transposable elements | journal = Nature Reviews.

Those two key components of the retrotransposon are still necessary but the way they are incorporated into the chemical reactions is different. This is because unlike LTR retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons do not contain sequences that bind tRNA. \n\nThey mostly fall into two types - LINEs and SINEs. SVA elements are the exception between the two as they share similarities with both LINEs and SINEs, containing Alu elements and different numbers of the same repeat. SVAs are shorter than LINEs but longer than SINEs. \n\nWhile historically viewed as \"junk DNA\", research suggests in some cases, both LINEs and SINEs were incorporated into novel genes so as to evolve new functionality.<ref name=\"Santangelo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santangelo AM, de Souza FS, Franchini LF, Bumaschny VF, Low MJ, Rubinstein M | title = Ancient exaptation of a CORE-SINE retroposon into a highly conserved mammalian neuronal enhancer of the proopiomelanocortin gene | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 1813\u201326 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17922573 | pmc = 2000970 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030166 }}</ref>\n\n===LINEs===\n{{Main article | Long interspersed nuclear element}}\n\nWhen a LINE is transcribed, the transcript contains an RNA polymerase II promoter that ensures LINEs can be copied into whichever location it decides to insert itself into.

This transcript is the RNA transposition intermediate.  \n\nThe RNA transposition intermediate moves from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation. This gives the two coding regions of a LINE that in turn binds back to the RNA it is transcribed from. The LINE RNA then moves back into the nucleus to insert into the eukaryotic genome. \n\nLINEs insert themselves into regions of the eukaryotic genome that are rich in bases AT. At AT regions LINE uses its nuclease to cut one strand of the eukaryotic double-stranded DNA. The adenine-rich sequence in LINE transcript base pairs with the cut strand to flag where the LINE will be inserted with hydroxyl groups. Reverse transcriptase recognises these hydroxyl groups to synthesise LINE retrotransposon where the DNA is cut. Like with LTR retrotransposons, this new inserted LINE contains eukaryotic genome information so it can be copied and pasted into other genomic regions easily. The information sequences are longer and more variable than those in LTR retrotransposons. \n\nMost LINE copies have variable length at the start because reverse transcription usually stops before DNA synthesis is complete.

SINEs cannot transpose by themselves because they cannot encode SINE transcripts. They usually consist of parts derived from tRNA and LINEs. The tRNA portion contains an RNA polymerase III promoter which the same kind of enzyme as RNA polymerase II. This makes sure the LINE copies would be transcriped into RNA for further transposition. The LINE component remains so LINE-binding proteins can recognise the LINE part of the SINE.\n\n====Alu elements====\n{{Main article |Alu element}}\nThe most common SINE in primates is [[Alu element|''Alu'']]. Alu elements are approximately 350 base pairs long, do not contain any coding sequences, and can be recognized by the [[restriction enzyme]] [[List of restriction enzyme cutting sites: A#Whole list navigation|AluI]] (hence the name). The distribution of these elements has been implicated in some genetic diseases and cancers. Copy and pasting Alu RNA requires the Alu\u2019s adenine-rich end and the rest of the sequence bound to a signal. The signal-bound Alu region can then associate with ribosomes. LINE RNA associates on the same ribosomes as the Alu elements. Binding to the same ribosome allows Alu elements of SINEs to interact with LINE. This simultaneous translation of Alu element and LINE allows SINE copy and pasting.\n\n==SVA elements==\nSVA elements are present at lower levels than SINES and LINEs in humans. The starts of SVA and Alu elements are similar, followed by repeats and an end similar to endogenous retrovirus. LINEs bind to sites flanking SVA elements to transpose them. SVA are one of the youngest transposable element in great apes genome and among the most active and polymorphic in the human population.\n\nA recent study developed a network method that reveals SVA retroelement (RE) proliferation dynamics in\nhominid genomes <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy OR, Knisbacher BA, Levanon EY, Havlin SH | title = Integrating networks and comparative genomics reveals retroelement proliferation dynamics in hominid genomes | journal = Science Advances | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | date = 2017 | pages = e1701256 | pmid = 29043294| pmc = 5640379 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1701256 }}</ref>The method enable to track the course of SVA proliferation, identify yet unknown active communities, and detect tentative \u201cmaster REs\u201d that play key roles in SVA propagation. Thus, providing  support for the fundamental \u201cmaster gene\u201d model of RE proliferation.\n\n==Role in human disease==\nRetrotransposons ensure they are not lost by chance by occurring only in cell genetics that can be passed on from one generation to the next from parent gametes. However, LINEs can transpose into the human embryo cells that eventually develop into the nervous system, raising the question whether this LINE retrotransposition affects brain function. LINE retrotransposition is also a feature of several cancers, but it is unclear whether retrotransposition itself causes cancer instead of just a symptom.\nUncontrolled retrotransposition is bad for both the host organism and retrotransposons themselves so they have to be regulated. Retrotransposons are regulated by [[RNA interference]]. RNA interference is carried out by a bunch of short [[Non-coding_RNA|non-coding RNAs]]. The short non-coding RNA interacts with protein Argonaute to degrade retrotransposon transcripts and change their DNA histone structure to reduce their transcription.\n\n==Role in evolution==\nLTR retrotransposons came about later than non-LTR retrotransposons, possibly from an ancestral non-LTR retrotransposon acquiring an integrase from a DNA transposon. Retroviruses gained additional properties to their virus envelopes by taking the relevant genes from other viruses using the power of LTR retrotransposon.\n\nDue to their retrotransposition mechanism, retrotransposons amplify in number quickly, composing 40% of the human genome. The insertion rates for LINE1, Alu and SVA elements are 1/200 - 1/20, 1/20 and 1/900 respectively. The LINE1 insertion rates have varied a lot over the past 35 million years, so they indicate points in genome evolution. \n\nNotably a large number of 100 kilobases in the maize genome show variety due to the presence or absence of retrotransposons. However since maize is unusually genetically compared to other plants it cannot be used to predict retrotransposition in other plants.\n\nMutations caused by retrotransposons include:\n* Gene inactivation\n* Changing gene regulation\n* Changing gene products\n* Acting as DNA repair sites\n==Role in biotechnology==\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transposon]]\n* [[Tn3_transposon]]\n* [[Paleogenetics]]\n* [[Paleovirology]]\n* [[Insertion sequences]]\n* [[Copy-number variation]]\n* [[Genomic organization]]\n* [[Interspersed repeat]]\n* [[Retrotransposon marker]]s, a powerful method of reconstructing phylogenies.\n* [[RetrOryza]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Repeated sequence}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile genetic elements]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Retrotransposons.png|right|Simplified representation of the life cycle of a retrotransposon|440px]]\n\n'''Retrotransposons''' (also called '''Class I transposable elements''' or '''transposons via RNA intermediates''') are a type of [[Gene|genetic]] component that copy and paste themselves into different genomic locations ([[transposon]]) by converting RNA back into DNA through the process [[reverse transcription]] using an RNA transposition intermediate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dombroski BA, Feng Q, Mathias SL, Sassaman DM, Scott AF, Kazazian HH, Boeke JD | title = An in vivo assay for the reverse transcriptase of human retrotransposon L1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 4485\u201392 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 7516468 | pmc = 358820 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.14.7.4485 }}</ref> \n\nThrough reverse transcription retrotransposons amplify themselves quickly to become abundant in eukaryotic genomes such as [[maize]] (49-78%) <ref name=\"SanMiguelandBennetzen\">{{cite journal |vauthors=SanMiguel P, Bennetzen JL |title=Evidence that a recent increase in maize genome size was caused by the massive amplification of intergene retrotranposons |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=82 |issue=Suppl A |pages=37\u201344 |year=1998 |url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/82/suppl_1/37.pdf |doi=10.1006/anbo.1998.0746}}</ref>and humans (42%).<ref name=\"Landeretal\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lander ES, Linton LM, Birren B, Nusbaum C, Zody MC, Baldwin J, etal | title = Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 860\u2013921 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11237011 | doi = 10.1038/35057062 }}</ref> They are only present in eukaryotes but share features with [[retrovirus|retroviruses]] such as [[HIV]].\n\nThere are two main types of retrotransposon, LTR and non-LTRs.

When the retroviral DNA is integrated into the host genome they evolve into endogenous retroviruses that influence eukaryotic genomes. So many endogenous retroviruses have inserted themselves into eukaryotic genomes that they allow insight into biology between viral-host interactions and the role of retrotransposons in evolution and disease.\nMany retrotransposons share features with endogenous retroviruses, the property of recognising and fusing with the host genome. However, there is a key difference between retroviruses and retrotransposons, which is indicated by the env gene. Although similar to the gene carrying out the same function in retroviruses, the env gene is used to determine whether the gene is retroviral or retrotransposon. If the gene is retroviral it can evolve from a retrotransposon into a retrovirus. They differ by the order of sequences in pol genes. Env genes are found in LTR retrotransposon types Ty1-copia ([[Pseudoviridae]]), Ty3-gypsy ([[Metaviridae]]) and BEL/Pao. <ref name=\"Copland\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Copeland CS, Mann VH, Morales ME, Kalinna BH, Brindley PJ | title = The Sinbad retrotransposon from the genome of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, and the distribution of related Pao-like elements | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15725362 | pmc = 554778 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-5-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"wicker\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicker T, Sabot F, Hua-Van A, Bennetzen JL, Capy P, Chalhoub B, Flavell A, Leroy P, Morgante M, Panaud O, Paux E, SanMiguel P, Schulman AH | title = A unified classification system for eukaryotic transposable elements | journal = Nature Reviews.

RNA-binding protein binds RNA-transposition intermediate. Nucleases are enzymes that break phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides in nucleic acids. Instead they have short repeats thats can have an inverted order of bases next to each other aside from [[Direct repeat|direct repeats]] found in LTR retrotransposons that is just one sequence of bases repeating itself. \n\nAlthough they are retrotransposons, they cannot carry out reverse transcription using an RNA transposition intermediate in the same way as LTR retrotransposons. Those two key components of the retrotransposon are still necessary but the way they are incorporated into the chemical reactions is different. This is because unlike LTR retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons do not contain sequences that bind tRNA. \n\nThey mostly fall into two types - LINEs and SINEs. SVA elements are the exception between the two as they share similarities with both LINEs and SINEs, containing Alu elements and different numbers of the same repeat. SVAs are shorter than LINEs but longer than SINEs. \n\nWhile historically viewed as \"junk DNA\", research suggests in some cases, both LINEs and SINEs were incorporated into novel genes so as to evolve new functionality.<ref name=\"Santangelo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santangelo AM, de Souza FS, Franchini LF, Bumaschny VF, Low MJ, Rubinstein M | title = Ancient exaptation of a CORE-SINE retroposon into a highly conserved mammalian neuronal enhancer of the proopiomelanocortin gene | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 1813\u201326 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17922573 | pmc = 2000970 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030166 }}</ref>\n\n===LINEs===\n{{Main article | Long interspersed nuclear element}}\n\nWhen a LINE is transcribed, the transcript contains an RNA polymerase II promoter that ensures LINEs can be copied into whichever location it decides to insert itself into.

This transcript is the RNA transposition intermediate.  \n\nThe RNA transposition intermediate moves from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation. This gives the two coding regions of a LINE that in turn binds back to the RNA it is transcribed from. The LINE RNA then moves back into the nucleus to insert into the eukaryotic genome. \n\nLINEs insert themselves into regions of the eukaryotic genome that are rich in bases AT. At AT regions LINE uses its nuclease to cut one strand of the eukaryotic double-stranded DNA. The adenine-rich sequence in LINE transcript base pairs with the cut strand to flag where the LINE will be inserted with hydroxyl groups. Reverse transcriptase recognises these hydroxyl groups to synthesise LINE retrotransposon where the DNA is cut. Like with LTR retrotransposons, this new inserted LINE contains eukaryotic genome information so it can be copied and pasted into other genomic regions easily. The information sequences are longer and more variable than those in LTR retrotransposons. \n\nMost LINE copies have variable length at the start because reverse transcription usually stops before DNA synthesis is complete. In some cases this causes RNA polymerase II promoter to be lost so LINEs cannot transpose further.<ref name=Singer>{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer MF | title = SINEs and LINEs: highly repeated short and long interspersed sequences in mammalian genomes | journal = Cell | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 433\u20134 | date = March 1982 | pmid = 6280868 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(82)90194-5 }}</ref>\n\n====Human L1====\n{{Main article | LINE1}}\n\nAmong the LINE, there are several subgroups, such as L1, L2 and L3.

SINEs cannot transpose by themselves because they cannot encode SINE transcripts. They usually consist of parts derived from tRNA and LINEs. The tRNA portion contains an RNA polymerase III promoter which the same kind of enzyme as RNA polymerase II. This makes sure the LINE copies would be transcriped into RNA for further transposition. The LINE component remains so LINE-binding proteins can recognise the LINE part of the SINE.\n\n====Alu elements====\n{{Main article |Alu element}}\nThe most common SINE in primates is [[Alu element|''Alu'']]. Alu elements are approximately 350 base pairs long, do not contain any coding sequences, and can be recognized by the [[restriction enzyme]] [[List of restriction enzyme cutting sites: A#Whole list navigation|AluI]] (hence the name). The distribution of these elements has been implicated in some genetic diseases and cancers. Copy and pasting Alu RNA requires the Alu\u2019s adenine-rich end and the rest of the sequence bound to a signal. The signal-bound Alu region can then associate with ribosomes. LINE RNA associates on the same ribosomes as the Alu elements. Binding to the same ribosome allows Alu elements of SINEs to interact with LINE. This simultaneous translation of Alu element and LINE allows SINE copy and pasting.\n\n==SVA elements==\nSVA elements are present at lower levels than SINES and LINEs in humans. The starts of SVA and Alu elements are similar, followed by repeats and an end similar to endogenous retrovirus. LINEs bind to sites flanking SVA elements to transpose them. SVA are one of the youngest transposable element in great apes genome and among the most active and polymorphic in the human population.\n\nA recent study developed a network method that reveals SVA retroelement (RE) proliferation dynamics in\nhominid genomes <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy OR, Knisbacher BA, Levanon EY, Havlin SH | title = Integrating networks and comparative genomics reveals retroelement proliferation dynamics in hominid genomes | journal = Science Advances | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | date = 2017 | pages = e1701256 | pmid = 29043294| pmc = 5640379 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1701256 }}</ref>The method enable to track the course of SVA proliferation, identify yet unknown active communities, and detect tentative \u201cmaster REs\u201d that play key roles in SVA propagation. Thus, providing  support for the fundamental \u201cmaster gene\u201d model of RE proliferation.\n\n==Role in human disease==\nRetrotransposons ensure they are not lost by chance by occurring only in cell genetics that can be passed on from one generation to the next from parent gametes. However, LINEs can transpose into the human embryo cells that eventually develop into the nervous system, raising the question whether this LINE retrotransposition affects brain function. LINE retrotransposition is also a feature of several cancers, but it is unclear whether retrotransposition itself causes cancer instead of just a symptom.\nUncontrolled retrotransposition is bad for both the host organism and retrotransposons themselves so they have to be regulated. Retrotransposons are regulated by [[RNA interference]]. RNA interference is carried out by a bunch of short [[Non-coding_RNA|non-coding RNAs]]. The short non-coding RNA interacts with protein Argonaute to degrade retrotransposon transcripts and change their DNA histone structure to reduce their transcription.\n\n==Role in evolution==\nLTR retrotransposons came about later than non-LTR retrotransposons, possibly from an ancestral non-LTR retrotransposon acquiring an integrase from a DNA transposon. Retroviruses gained additional properties to their virus envelopes by taking the relevant genes from other viruses using the power of LTR retrotransposon.\n\nDue to their retrotransposition mechanism, retrotransposons amplify in number quickly, composing 40% of the human genome. The insertion rates for LINE1, Alu and SVA elements are 1/200 - 1/20, 1/20 and 1/900 respectively. The LINE1 insertion rates have varied a lot over the past 35 million years, so they indicate points in genome evolution. \n\nNotably a large number of 100 kilobases in the maize genome show variety due to the presence or absence of retrotransposons. However since maize is unusually genetically compared to other plants it cannot be used to predict retrotransposition in other plants.\n\nMutations caused by retrotransposons include:\n* Gene inactivation\n* Changing gene regulation\n* Changing gene products\n* Acting as DNA repair sites\n==Role in biotechnology==\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transposon]]\n* [[Paleogenetics]]\n* [[Paleovirology]]\n* [[Insertion sequences]]\n* [[Copy-number variation]]\n* [[Genomic organization]]\n* [[Interspersed repeat]]\n* [[Retrotransposon marker]]s, a powerful method of reconstructing phylogenies.\n* [[RetrOryza]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Repeated sequence}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile genetic elements]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n", "name_user": "Pizzanotsinkships", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon"}
