The stops and affricate (aside from the marginally contrastive [[glottal stop]]) are in three series, plain, aspirated, and [[laryngealized]] or [[glottalized]]. The [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] series is contrastive only syllable-initially and probably derives historically from the voiceless-released first member of a consonant cluster, as in the neighboring and possibly related [[Yana language]]. This is seen morphophonemically in e.g. ''it'' \"I, me\", ''it\u02b0\u02d1\u00fa'' \"my, mine\".<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\">{{Cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |chapter= |title=Aspects of Pit River Phonology |url=http://roa.rutgers.edu/files/316-0599/roa-316-nevin-4.pdf |last=Nevin  |first=Bruce  |year=1998 |publisher=The University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= |docket= |oclc= }}</ref>\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n![[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n![[Palato-alveolar_consonant|Palato-Alveolar]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n![[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n![[Epiglottal consonant|Epiglottal]]\n![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-align=center\n! rowspan=\"3\" | [[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n| p\n| t\n| t\u0283\n| k\n| q\n|\n| \u0294\n|-align=center\n!<small>[[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n| p\u02b0\n| t\u02b0\n| t\u0283\u02b0\n| k\u02b0\n| q\u02b0<!--the proposal that there is no /qh/ and substiting /x/ is not supported in the literature.

Syllable-initial plain stops are voiceless (without voiceless release) after long vowel or when geminate (long), and voiced elsewhere. The laryngealized stops are similar in articulation to the [[ejective consonant|ejective]] [[glottalization|glottalized]] stops of neighboring languages, but more [[lenis]], that is, not \"popped\" unless an unusual effort is made at articulating the distinction.<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\"/>\n\nThe language has a 5-vowel system /i e a o u/. Two degrees of length are contrastive for both vowels and consonants. Long vowels are typically more peripheral and short vowels more centralized, phonetically [\u026a \u025b \u028c \u0259 \u028a]. The mid vowels /e o/ are probably of secondary origin historically, as in [[Yana language|Yana]] and [[Atsugewi language|Atsugewi]]. A short centralized vowel [\u0259 \u0268] appears epenthetically between the consonants of certain prefixes, as in ''lh\u00fapta'' \"let's go!\". Vowel length assimilates the next successive laryngeal state, that is, the second [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] of a long vowel is devoiced before a plain or aspirated consonant ([[preaspiration]]) and word finally before silence, and is [[Creaky_voice|laryngealized]] before a laryngealized consonant. In upriver dialects vowels and plain stops are more fully voiced. In downriver dialects, utterance-final syllables may be devoiced or whispered, especially under interrogative intonation.<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\"/> A light syllable consists of a consonant and vowel (CV), and a heavy syllable either contains a long vowel (CV\u02d1) or is closed with a second consonant (CVC).\n\nUnlike the neighboring and related language [[Atsugewi]], Achumawi has contrastive high and low tones.<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\"/><ref name=\"mithun2001\">{{cite book | last = Mithun | first = Marianne | title = The Languages of Native North America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | page = 24 | isbn = 978-0-521-29875-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Morphology ==\n\nThe Achumawi language does not have gender but it has two forms of the copula (\"to be\") distinguishing animate and inanimate. The verb stem comprises one or more verb roots plus optional adverbial affixes. Inflectional affixes on verbs distinguish singular, dual, and plural number, and suffixes may optionally express severality and plurality of nouns. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from verb stems or participles, and some verb stems are formed by noun incorporation. The language has independent adjectives and numerals.<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\"/><ref name=\"Angulo 1930\">{{Cite journal|last=de Angulo|first=Jaime|last2=Freeland|first2=L.

The term Achumawi is an anglicization of the name of the Fall River band, ''aj\u00famm\u00e1\u00e1w\u00ed'', from ''aj\u00famm\u00e1'' \"river\". nine bands, with [[dialect]] differences primarily between upriver and downriver dialects, demarcated by the [[Big Valley mountains]] east of the Fall River valley.\n\n==Genetic relationships==\n\nTogether, Achumawi and [[Atsugewi language|Atsugewi]] are said to comprise the [[Palaihnihan languages|Palaihnihan]] [[Language families and languages|language family]] separate from the adjacent and related [[Shastan_languages|Shastan]] family. The basis of this grouping is weakened by poor quality of data.

The stops and affricate (aside from the marginally contrastive [[glottal stop]]) are in three series, plain, aspirated, and [[laryngealized]] or [[glottalized]]. The [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] series is contrastive only syllable-initially and probably derives historically from the voiceless-released first member of a consonant cluster, as in the neighboring and possibly related [[Yana language]]. This is seen morphophonemically in e.g. ''it'' \"I, me\", ''it\u02b0\u02d1\u00fa'' \"my, mine\".<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\">{{Cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |chapter= |title=Aspects of Pit River Phonology |url=http://roa.rutgers.edu/files/316-0599/roa-316-nevin-4.pdf |last=Nevin  |first=Bruce  |year=1998 |publisher=The University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= |docket= |oclc= }}</ref>\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n![[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n![[Palato-alveolar_consonant|Palato-Alveolar]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n![[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n![[Epiglottal consonant|Epiglottal]]\n![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-align=center\n! rowspan=\"3\" | [[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n| p\n| t\n| t\u0283\n| k\n| q\n|\n| \u0294\n|-align=center\n!<small>[[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n| p\u02b0\n| t\u02b0\n| t\u0283\u02b0\n| k\u02b0\n| q\u02b0<!--the proposal that there is no /qh/ and substiting /x/ is not supported in the literature.

Syllable-initial plain stops are voiceless (without voiceless release) after long vowel or when geminate (long), and voiced elsewhere. The laryngealized stops are similar in articulation to the [[ejective consonant|ejective]] [[glottalization|glottalized]] stops of neighboring languages, but more [[lenis]], that is, not \"popped\" unless an unusual effort is made at articulating the distinction.<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\"/>\n\nThe language has a 5-vowel system /i e a o u/. Two degrees of length are contrastive for both vowels and consonants. Long vowels are typically more peripheral and short vowels more centralized, phonetically [\u026a \u025b \u028c \u0259 \u028a]. The mid vowels /e o/ are probably of secondary origin historically, as in [[Yana language|Yana]] and [[Atsugewi language|Atsugewi]]. A short centralized vowel [\u0259 \u0268] appears epenthetically between the consonants of certain prefixes, as in ''lh\u00fapta'' \"let's go!\". Vowel length assimilates the next successive laryngeal state, that is, the second [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] of a long vowel is devoiced before a plain or aspirated consonant ([[preaspiration]]) and word finally before silence, and is [[Creaky_voice|laryngealized]] before a laryngealized consonant. In upriver dialects vowels and plain stops are more fully voiced. In downriver dialects, utterance-final syllables may be devoiced or whispered, especially under interrogative intonation.<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\"/> A light syllable consists of a consonant and vowel (CV), and a heavy syllable either contains a long vowel (CV\u02d1) or is closed with a second consonant (CVC).\n\nUnlike the neighboring and related language [[Atsugewi]], Achumawi has contrastive high and low tones.<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\"/><ref name=\"mithun2001\">{{cite book | last = Mithun | first = Marianne | title = The Languages of Native North America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | page = 24 | isbn = 978-0-521-29875-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Morphology ==\n\nThe Achumawi language does not have gender but it has two forms of the copula (\"to be\") distinguishing animate and inanimate. The verb stem comprises one or more verb roots plus optional adverbial affixes. Inflectional affixes on verbs distinguish singular, dual, and plural number, and suffixes may optionally express severality and plurality of nouns. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from verb stems or participles, and some verb stems are formed by noun incorporation. The language has independent adjectives and numerals.<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\"/><ref name=\"Angulo 1930\">{{Cite journal|last=de Angulo|first=Jaime|last2=Freeland|first2=L.

The story follows a hapless florist shop worker who raises a plant that feeds on human blood and flesh.  The musical is based on the low-budget 1960 [[black comedy]] film ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]''.  The music, composed by Menken in the style of early 1960s [[rock and roll]], [[doo-wop]] and early [[Motown Records|Motown]], includes several well-known tunes, including the title song, \"Skid Row (Downtown)\", \"Somewhere That's Green\", and \"Suddenly, Seymour\".\n\nThe musical premiered [[Off-Off-Broadway]] in 1982 before moving to the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] [[Off-Broadway]], where it had a five-year run.  It later received numerous productions in the U.S. and abroad, and a subsequent [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Because of its small cast, it has become popular with [[community theatre]], school and other amateur groups.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]'' reported in its May 26, 2008 issue, p. 51, that this musical ranked as the most frequently produced musical by U.S. high schools in 2007.</ref>  The musical was also made into a 1986 [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Frank Oz]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nAn offstage voice recalls a time when the human race \"suddenly encountered a deadly threat to its very existence\". A trio of 1960s street urchins named Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon set the scene (\"Little Shop of Horrors\") and comment on the action throughout the show. Seymour Krelborn is a poor young man, an orphan living in an urban [[skid row]]. Audrey is a pretty blonde with a fashion sense that leans towards the tacky. They lament their stations in life and the urban blight in their neighborhood (\"Skid Row (Downtown)\"). They are co-workers at Mushnik's Skid Row Florists, a run-down flower shop owned and operated by the cranky Mr. Mushnik. Seymour has recently obtained a mysterious plant that looks like a large [[venus flytrap]]. While he was browsing the wholesale flower district, a sudden eclipse of the sun occurred, and when the light returned, the weird plant had appeared (\"Da-Doo\"). Seymour, who is secretly in love with Audrey, names the plant Audrey II in her honor.\n\nThe plant does not thrive in its new environment and appears to be dying. Seymour questions why it should be doing poorly, since he takes such good care of it. He accidentally pricks his finger on a rose thorn, which draws blood, and Audrey II's pod opens thirstily. Seymour realizes that Audrey II requires blood to survive and allows the plant to suckle from his finger (\"Grow For Me\"). As Audrey II grows, it becomes an attraction and starts generating brisk business for Mushnik. As the caretaker of the plant, the timid Seymour is suddenly regarded as a hero (\"Ya Never Know\"), while Audrey secretly longs to leave her abusive boyfriend. Her dream is to lead an ideal suburban life with Seymour, complete with a tract home, frozen dinners, and plastic on the furniture (\"Somewhere That's Green\").\n\nMeanwhile, the employees at Mushnik's are sprucing up the flower shop because of the popularity of the rapidly growing Audrey II and the revenue that it is bringing in (\"Closed for Renovation\"). Orin Scrivello, a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Dentistry|dentist]], is Audrey's abusive boyfriend. Modeled after the \"Leader of the pack\" characters of the 1950s, Orin drives a motorcycle, wears leather, and enjoys bringing other people pain (\"Dentist!\"). Orin encourages Seymour to take the plant and get out of Skid Row. Realizing that his store's sudden profitability is completely dependent on the plant (and therefore on Seymour), Mushnik takes advantage of Seymour's innocence by offering to adopt him and make him a full partner in the business. Having always wanted a family, Seymour accepts, even though Mushnik has always yelled at him and treated him poorly (\"Mushnik and Son\"). However, Seymour is having difficulty providing enough blood to keep Audrey II healthy. When Seymour stops feeding the plant, Audrey II reveals that it can speak. It demands blood and promises that, if fed, it will make sure that all of Seymour's dreams come true. Seymour initially refuses, but he then witnesses Orin abusing Audrey. The plant presents this as a justification for killing Orin. Not realizing that he is being manipulated again, Seymour gives in to his baser instincts and agrees (\"Feed Me (Git It)\"). \n\nHe sets up a late-night appointment with Orin, intending to kill him. However, Seymour loses his nerve and decides not to commit the crime. Unfortunately for Orin, who is getting high on [[nitrous oxide]], the gas device is stuck in the \"on\" position, and he suffocates while asking Seymour to save him. Seymour cannot bring himself to shoot Orin but lets him die of asphyxiation (\"Now (It's Just The Gas)\"). Seymour feeds Orin's body to the now huge Audrey II, and the plant consumes it with ravenous glee (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n===Act II===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Suddenly, Seymour - 2003 revival.ogg\n|title=\"Suddenly, Seymour\"\n|description=The beginning of the last chorus of \"Suddenly, Seymour\", performed by Kerry Butler and Hunter Foster on the 2003 Broadway revival cast recording.}}\n\nThe flower shop is much busier, and Seymour and Audrey have trouble keeping up with the onslaught of orders (\"Call Back in the Morning\"). Audrey confides to Seymour that she feels guilty about Orin's disappearance, because she secretly wished it. The two admit their feelings for one another, and Seymour promises that he will protect and care for Audrey from now on (\"Suddenly, Seymour\"). The two plan to leave together and start a new life, although Seymour mistakenly attributes Audrey's feelings to his newfound fame, not realizing that she loved him even before he found the plant.\n\nBefore they can go, Mushnik confronts Seymour about Orin's death. Mushnik has put two and two together: the bloody dentist's uniform, the drops of blood on the floor, and he has seen Seymour and Audrey kissing. Seymour denies killing Orin, but Mushnik wants him to give a statement to the police, who have begun investigating. Audrey II tells Seymour that he has to be rid of Mushnik or he will lose everything, including Audrey (\"Suppertime\"). Seymour tells Mushnik that he put the days' receipts inside Audrey II for safekeeping. Mushnik climbs inside the plant's gaping maw to search for the money, realizing the deception too late, and screams as he is devoured. Seymour now runs the flower shop, and reporters, salesmen, lawyers and agents approach him, promising him fame and fortune. Although tempted by the trappings of his success, Seymour realizes that it is only a matter of time before Audrey II will kill again and that he is morally responsible. He considers destroying the plant but believing that his fame is the only thing that is earning him Audrey's love, he is unable to do so (\"The Meek Shall Inherit\").\n\nAs Seymour works on his speech for a lecture tour, Audrey II again squalls for blood.  Seymour threatens to kill it just as Audrey walks in asking when Mushnik will return from visiting his \"sick sister\". Seymour learns that Audrey would still love him without the fame and decides that Audrey II must die after the scheduled [[LIFE magazine|''LIFE'' magazine]] interview at the shop. Audrey is confused and frightened by Seymour's ramblings, but she runs home by his order.  That night, unable to sleep and distressed by Seymour's strange behavior, Audrey goes to the flower shop to talk with him.  He is not there, and Audrey II begs her to water him. Not sensing the mortal danger, she approaches to water it, and a vine wraps around her and pulls her into the plant's gaping maw (\"[[Sominex]]/Suppertime II\"). Seymour arrives and attacks the plant in an attempt to save Audrey. He pulls her out, but Audrey is mortally wounded.  Her dying wish is for Seymour to feed her to the plant after she dies so that they can always be together. She dies in his arms, and he reluctantly honors her request (\"Somewhere That's Green\" (reprise)). Seymour falls asleep as Audrey II grows small red flower buds.\n\nThe next day, Patrick Martin from the World Botanical Enterprises tells Seymour that his company wishes to take leaf [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of Audrey II and sell them across America. Seymour realizes the plant's evil plan: during the [[solar eclipse]], Audrey II came from an unknown planet to conquer Earth. He tries shooting, cutting, and poisoning the plant, but it has grown too hardy to kill.  Seymour, in desperation, runs into its open jaws with a [[machete]] planning to kill it from the inside, but he is quickly eaten. Patrick, Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon search for Seymour. Not finding him, Patrick tells the girls to take the cuttings.\n\nCrystal, Ronette, and Chiffon relate that, following these events, other plants appeared across America, tricking innocent people into feeding them blood in exchange for fame and fortune. Out of the fog, Audrey II, bigger than ever, appears with opened new flowers revealing the faces of Seymour, Audrey, Mushnik and Orin, who beg that, no matter how persuasive the plants may be, they must not be fed (\"Finale Ultimo: Don't Feed the Plants\"). Audrey II slithers towards the audience threateningly (In the original Off-Broadway production, plant tendrils fell all over the audience, as if each audience member were to be pulled into the plant, while in the Broadway production, a monstrously huge Audrey II was projected out over the fifth row and the balcony seats, as if it would eat the audience members).\n\n==Original production==\n===Off-Broadway===\nThe [[musical theater|musical]] had its world premiere [[Off-Off-Broadway]] on May 6, 1982 at the Workshop of the Players Art Foundation (WPA\u00a0Theatre), playing there until June 6, 1982.<ref>[http://howardashman.com/theatre.html \"Theater: ''Little Shop of Horrors''\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209054052/http://howardashman.com/theatre.html |date=2015-02-09 }}, Howard Ashman website, accessed April 21, 2014</ref>  It opened [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on July 27, 1982.

The setting is moved from [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]] to Skid Row in New York. Seymour's [[hypochondriac]]al [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]] is omitted in the musical, and Seymour becomes an orphan in the care of Mushnik. Also dropped is the subplot involving the two investigating police officers.  The characters of Mrs. Siddie Shiva and Burson Fouch are also omitted, although Mrs. Shiva is mentioned as being the shop's biggest funeral account. The gleefully [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] dental patient, originally played by [[Jack Nicholson]], is not in the musical but is in the 1986 film, played by [[Bill Murray]].<!-- MURRAY PLAYED THE MASOCHIST.  STEVE MARTIN WAS THE DENTIST.  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS! -->\n\nIn the musical, the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello, is killed by suffocation from [[laughing gas]] instead of being stabbed with a dental instrument as in the film.  His abusive relationship with Audrey is added to the musical to give Seymour a motive to kill him.  In the film, Seymour murders several innocent bystanders, and Mushnik tricks a thief into looking for money inside the plant, which eats the thief.  In the musical, Seymour tricks Mushnik in the same way when Mushnik plans to turn Seymour over to the police.  The two neighborhood girls in the film are replaced in the musical by a chorus of three street urchins: [[The Crystals|Crystal]], [[The Chiffons|Chiffon]] and [[The Ronettes|Ronette]], named after (and reminiscent of) [[girl group]]s of the 1960s.  The plant is named \"Audrey II\" in the musical, rather than the film's \"Audrey Junior\", and instead of being a crossbreed of a [[butterwort]] and a [[Venus Flytrap]], in the musical it is a creature from [[outer space]] intent on taking over the world.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference is the ending.  The musical ends with Orin, Mushnik, Audrey and Seymour all eaten by the plant, and the three girls report that Audrey II's progeny continues to consume people.  In the 1960 film, Mushnik and Audrey survive,  and the plant's carnivorous activities are discovered when its flowers bloom with the faces of its victims, including Seymour, imprinted on them.  The musical references this ending in its finale, in which the Plant's four victims' faces are seen in its blooming flowers. \n\nThe change in ending of the musical contributes to its portrayal of class struggles and moral values. While the 1986 film shows Seymour and Audrey escaping to the dream suburban house, encapsulating ideals of the 1950s [[American Dream]], the musical hints to a metaphorical portrayal of Seymour's greed as the plant.<ref>Jensen, Marc. \"Feed me!: Power struggles and the portrayal of race in ''Little Shop of Horrors''\", ''Cinema Journal'' 48, no. 1 (2008): 51\u201367</ref> Seymour's greed gradually consumes himself and Audrey. The musical engages with ideas relating to human values in the face of capitalist culture, disempowering those who are enveloped with motivations of personal monetary gain and overlook moral values. It serves as a social commentary of commodity fetishism.<ref>Leigh, Mary K., and Kevin K. Durand, eds. Marxism and the Movies: Critical Essays on Class Struggle in the Cinema.

A pre-Broadway production debuted at the Miracle Theatre in [[Coral Gables, Florida]] on May 16, 2003. Lee Wilkof, who originated the role of Seymour in 1982, was cast as Mr. Mushnik. The production was directed by Wilkof's wife, Connie Grappo, who was the assistant to [[Howard Ashman]] during the original production.<ref name=NYTimes1020/> Muppeteer [[Martin P.

The second puppet is slightly larger than the first and is operated by Seymour during the song \"You Never Know\".  A fake arm in a sleeve matching Seymour's jacket is attached to the plant's pot, while the actor's real arm operates the plant.  The third puppet sits on the floor and is large enough to hide a person inside, who moves the plant's mouth in sync with Audrey II's voice, which is supplied by an offstage actor on a microphone.  The puppeteer's legs are clad in green tights with \"leaf\" shoes that serve as part of the plant's tendrils.  In Act II, the largest puppet again hides an actor inside, who manipulates the puppet's mouth and often some of its branches.  By this point, the head is at least six feet long and capable of \"swallowing\" characters.  For the finale, additions can be made to make the plant appear taller and even bigger.<ref name=MTI/> Actors and stage hands are often used to move larger branches and roots, which, in the original off-Broadway production, spilled off the stage and into the audience. In some productions, dangling vines over the house enhance the effect of Audrey II menacing the audience.\n\nAmateur productions of ''Little Shop of Horrors'' receive designs for building the puppets from [[Music Theatre International|MTI]], as part of the rental scripts and scores, based on the original Martin P. Robinson designs.  Some companies who have produced the show in the past and built their own puppets rent them out to other companies to recoup some of their construction costs.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.prattsburgh.wnyric.org/audrey_ii_rental.htm \"Prattsburgh Central School, Audrey II Rental\"]</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===1986 feature film===\n{{main|Little Shop of Horrors (film)}}\nA [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film version]] of the musical was made in 1986.  Directed by [[Frank Oz]] and noted as the only film written by [[Howard Ashman]], it starred [[Rick Moranis]] as Seymour, [[Ellen Greene]] as Audrey, [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Mr. Mushnik, [[Steve Martin]] as Orin Scrivello, DDS, and the voice of [[Levi Stubbs]] as Audrey II. [[Bill Murray]] played the small comic role of the masochist, Arthur Denton.  The 1986 film follows the plot of the musical closely but omits the songs \"Ya Never Know\" (rewritten as \"Some Fun Now,\" a trio for Crystal, Ronette and Chiffon), \"Mushnik and Son\", \"Now (It's Just the Gas)\", \"Sudden Changes,\" \"Closed for Renovation\" and \"Call Back in the Morning\"; the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]] ending also omits \"Finale Ultimo (Don't Feed The Plants)\".  Other changes include the removal of Mr. Mushnik's adoption proposition and a new ending, in which Seymour is able to save Audrey from Audrey II and then electrocutes the plant after it has destroyed the shop. Seymour and Audrey marry and move to the tract home of her dreams, but a small Audrey II-type bud is seen in their garden, which portends a possible spread of the alien plants.  An ending more faithful to the stage version was filmed, in which the plant eats Audrey and Seymour and then, having grown to massive size and reproduced, goes on a [[King Kong]]-style rampage through New York City.  It was received poorly by test audiences, and the upbeat alternate ending was used for the theatrical cut. In October 2012, the original ending was restored and released with the film as \"The Director's Cut\" on DVD and Blu-ray. A new song for Audrey II, \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\", was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Original Song.\n\n===Planned feature film===\nA remake of the musical for feature film is planned by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], with [[Greg Berlanti]] directing.

The story follows a hapless florist shop worker who raises a plant that feeds on human blood and flesh.  The musical is based on the low-budget 1960 [[black comedy]] film ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]''.  The music, composed by Menken in the style of early 1960s [[rock and roll]], [[doo-wop]] and early [[Motown Records|Motown]], includes several well-known tunes, including the title song, \"Skid Row (Downtown)\", \"Somewhere That's Green\", and \"Suddenly, Seymour\".\n\nThe musical premiered [[Off-Off-Broadway]] in 1982 before moving to the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] [[Off-Broadway]], where it had a five-year run.  It later received numerous productions in the U.S. and abroad, and a subsequent [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Because of its small cast, it has become popular with [[community theatre]], school and other amateur groups.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]'' reported in its May 26, 2008 issue, p. 51, that this musical ranked as the most frequently produced musical by U.S. high schools in 2007.</ref>  The musical was also made into a 1986 [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Frank Oz]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nAn offstage voice recalls a time when the human race \"suddenly encountered a deadly threat to its very existence\". A trio of 1960s street urchins named Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon set the scene (\"Little Shop of Horrors\") and comment on the action throughout the show. Seymour Krelborn is a poor young man, an orphan living in an urban [[skid row]]. Audrey is a pretty blonde with a fashion sense that leans towards the tacky. They lament their stations in life and the urban blight in their neighborhood (\"Skid Row (Downtown)\"). They are co-workers at Mushnik's Skid Row Florists, a run-down flower shop owned and operated by the cranky Mr. Mushnik. Seymour has recently obtained a mysterious plant that looks like a large [[venus flytrap]]. While he was browsing the wholesale flower district, a sudden eclipse of the sun occurred, and when the light returned, the weird plant had appeared (\"Da-Doo\"). Seymour, who is secretly in love with Audrey, names the plant Audrey II in her honor.\n\nThe plant does not thrive in its new environment and appears to be dying. Seymour questions why it should be doing poorly, since he takes such good care of it. He accidentally pricks his finger on a rose thorn, which draws blood, and Audrey II's pod opens thirstily. Seymour realizes that Audrey II requires blood to survive and allows the plant to suckle from his finger (\"Grow For Me\"). As Audrey II grows, it becomes an attraction and starts generating brisk business for Mushnik. As the caretaker of the plant, the timid Seymour is suddenly regarded as a hero (\"Ya Never Know\"), while Audrey secretly longs to leave her abusive boyfriend. Her dream is to lead an ideal suburban life with Seymour, complete with a tract home, frozen dinners, and plastic on the furniture (\"Somewhere That's Green\").\n\nMeanwhile, the employees at Mushnik's are sprucing up the flower shop because of the popularity of the rapidly growing Audrey II and the revenue that it is bringing in (\"Closed for Renovation\"). Orin Scrivello, a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Dentistry|dentist]], is Audrey's abusive boyfriend. Modeled after the \"Leader of the pack\" characters of the 1950s, Orin drives a motorcycle, wears leather, and enjoys bringing other people pain (\"Dentist!\"). Orin encourages Seymour to take the plant and get out of Skid Row. Realizing that his store's sudden profitability is completely dependent on the plant (and therefore on Seymour), Mushnik takes advantage of Seymour's innocence by offering to adopt him and make him a full partner in the business. Having always wanted a family, Seymour accepts, even though Mushnik has always yelled at him and treated him poorly (\"Mushnik and Son\"). However, Seymour is having difficulty providing enough blood to keep Audrey II healthy. When Seymour stops feeding the plant, Audrey II reveals that it can speak. It demands blood and promises that, if fed, it will make sure that all of Seymour's dreams come true. Seymour initially refuses, but he then witnesses Orin abusing Audrey. The plant presents this as a justification for killing Orin. Not realizing that he is being manipulated again, Seymour gives in to his baser instincts and agrees (\"Feed Me (Git It)\"). \n\nHe sets up a late-night appointment with Orin, intending to kill him. However, Seymour loses his nerve and decides not to commit the crime. Unfortunately for Orin, who is getting high on [[nitrous oxide]], the gas device is stuck in the \"on\" position, and he suffocates while asking Seymour to save him. Seymour cannot bring himself to shoot Orin but lets him die of asphyxiation (\"Now (It's Just The Gas)\"). Seymour feeds Orin's body to the now huge Audrey II, and the plant consumes it with ravenous glee (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n===Act II===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Suddenly, Seymour - 2003 revival.ogg\n|title=\"Suddenly, Seymour\"\n|description=The beginning of the last chorus of \"Suddenly, Seymour\", performed by Kerry Butler and Hunter Foster on the 2003 Broadway revival cast recording.}}\n\nThe flower shop is much busier, and Seymour and Audrey have trouble keeping up with the onslaught of orders (\"Call Back in the Morning\"). Audrey confides to Seymour that she feels guilty about Orin's disappearance, because she secretly wished it. The two admit their feelings for one another, and Seymour promises that he will protect and care for Audrey from now on (\"Suddenly, Seymour\"). The two plan to leave together and start a new life, although Seymour mistakenly attributes Audrey's feelings to his newfound fame, not realizing that she loved him even before he found the plant.\n\nBefore they can go, Mushnik confronts Seymour about Orin's death. Mushnik has put two and two together: the bloody dentist's uniform, the drops of blood on the floor, and he has seen Seymour and Audrey kissing. Seymour denies killing Orin, but Mushnik wants him to give a statement to the police, who have begun investigating. Audrey II tells Seymour that he has to be rid of Mushnik or he will lose everything, including Audrey (\"Suppertime\"). Seymour tells Mushnik that he put the days' receipts inside Audrey II for safekeeping. Mushnik climbs inside the plant's gaping maw to search for the money, realizing the deception too late, and screams as he is devoured. Seymour now runs the flower shop, and reporters, salesmen, lawyers and agents approach him, promising him fame and fortune. Although tempted by the trappings of his success, Seymour realizes that it is only a matter of time before Audrey II will kill again and that he is morally responsible. He considers destroying the plant but believing that his fame is the only thing that is earning him Audrey's love, he is unable to do so (\"The Meek Shall Inherit\").\n\nAs Seymour works on his speech for a lecture tour, Audrey II again squalls for blood.  Seymour threatens to kill it just as Audrey walks in asking when Mushnik will return from visiting his \"sick sister\". Seymour learns that Audrey would still love him without the fame and decides that Audrey II must die after the scheduled [[LIFE magazine|''LIFE'' magazine]] interview at the shop. Audrey is confused and frightened by Seymour's ramblings, but she runs home by his order.  That night, unable to sleep and distressed by Seymour's strange behavior, Audrey goes to the flower shop to talk with him.  He is not there, and Audrey II begs her to water him. Not sensing the mortal danger, she approaches to water it, and a vine wraps around her and pulls her into the plant's gaping maw (\"[[Sominex]]/Suppertime II\"). Seymour arrives and attacks the plant in an attempt to save Audrey. He pulls her out, but Audrey is mortally wounded.  Her dying wish is for Seymour to feed her to the plant after she dies so that they can always be together. She dies in his arms, and he reluctantly honors her request (\"Somewhere That's Green\" (reprise)). Seymour falls asleep as Audrey II grows small red flower buds.\n\nThe next day, Patrick Martin from the World Botanical Enterprises tells Seymour that his company wishes to take leaf [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of Audrey II and sell them across America. Seymour realizes the plant's evil plan: during the [[solar eclipse]], Audrey II came from an unknown planet to conquer Earth. He tries shooting, cutting, and poisoning the plant, but it has grown too hardy to kill.  Seymour, in desperation, runs into its open jaws with a [[machete]] planning to kill it from the inside, but he is quickly eaten. Patrick, Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon search for Seymour. Not finding him, Patrick tells the girls to take the cuttings.\n\nCrystal, Ronette, and Chiffon relate that, following these events, other plants appeared across America, tricking innocent people into feeding them blood in exchange for fame and fortune. Out of the fog, Audrey II, bigger than ever, appears with opened new flowers revealing the faces of Seymour, Audrey, Mushnik and Orin, who beg that, no matter how persuasive the plants may be, they must not be fed (\"Finale Ultimo: Don't Feed the Plants\"). Audrey II slithers towards the audience threateningly (In the original Off-Broadway production, plant tendrils fell all over the audience, as if each audience member were to be pulled into the plant, while in the Broadway production, a monstrously huge Audrey II was projected out over the fifth row and the balcony seats, as if it would eat the audience members).\n\n==Original production==\n===Off-Broadway===\nThe [[musical theater|musical]] had its world premiere [[Off-Off-Broadway]] on May 6, 1982 at the Workshop of the Players Art Foundation (WPA\u00a0Theatre), playing there until June 6, 1982.<ref>[http://howardashman.com/theatre.html \"Theater: ''Little Shop of Horrors''\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209054052/http://howardashman.com/theatre.html |date=2015-02-09 }}, Howard Ashman website, accessed April 21, 2014</ref>  It opened [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on July 27, 1982.

The setting is moved from [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]] to Skid Row in New York. Seymour's [[hypochondriac]]al [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]] is omitted in the musical, and Seymour becomes an orphan in the care of Mushnik. Also dropped is the subplot involving the two investigating police officers.  The characters of Mrs. Siddie Shiva and Burson Fouch are also omitted, although Mrs. Shiva is mentioned as being the shop's biggest funeral account. The gleefully [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] dental patient, originally played by [[Jack Nicholson]], is not in the musical but is in the 1986 film, played by [[Bill Murray]].<!-- MURRAY PLAYED THE MASOCHIST.  STEVE MARTIN WAS THE DENTIST.  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS! -->\n\nIn the musical, the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello, is killed by suffocation from [[laughing gas]] instead of being stabbed with a dental instrument as in the film.  His abusive relationship with Audrey is added to the musical to give Seymour a motive to kill him.  In the film, Seymour murders several innocent bystanders, and Mushnik tricks a thief into looking for money inside the plant, which eats the thief.  In the musical, Seymour tricks Mushnik in the same way when Mushnik plans to turn Seymour over to the police.  The two neighborhood girls in the film are replaced in the musical by a chorus of three street urchins: [[The Crystals|Crystal]], [[The Chiffons|Chiffon]] and [[The Ronettes|Ronette]], named after (and reminiscent of) [[girl group]]s of the 1960s.  The plant is named \"Audrey II\" in the musical, rather than the film's \"Audrey Junior\", and instead of being a crossbreed of a [[butterwort]] and a [[Venus Flytrap]], in the musical it is a creature from [[outer space]] intent on taking over the world.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference is the ending.  The musical ends with Orin, Mushnik, Audrey and Seymour all eaten by the plant, and the three girls report that Audrey II's progeny continues to consume people.  In the 1960 film, Mushnik and Audrey survive,  and the plant's carnivorous activities are discovered when its flowers bloom with the faces of its victims, including Seymour, imprinted on them.  The musical references this ending in its finale, in which the Plant's four victims' faces are seen in its blooming flowers. \n\nThe change in ending of the musical contributes to its portrayal of class struggles and moral values. While the 1986 film shows Seymour and Audrey escaping to the dream suburban house, encapsulating ideals of the 1950s [[American Dream]], the musical hints to a metaphorical portrayal of Seymour's greed as the plant.<ref>Jensen, Marc. \"Feed me!: Power struggles and the portrayal of race in ''Little Shop of Horrors''\", ''Cinema Journal'' 48, no. 1 (2008): 51\u201367</ref> Seymour's greed gradually consumes himself and Audrey. The musical engages with ideas relating to human values in the face of capitalist culture, disempowering those who are enveloped with motivations of personal monetary gain and overlook moral values. It serves as a social commentary of commodity fetishism.<ref>Leigh, Mary K., and Kevin K. Durand, eds. Marxism and the Movies: Critical Essays on Class Struggle in the Cinema.

It has a huge, nasty-looking pod that gains a shark-like aspect when open and snapping at food. The creature is played by a series of increasing[ly] large puppets\".<ref name=MTI>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtishows.com/show_detail.asp?showid=000188|title=\"Little Shop of Horrors\", Casting \u2013 Character Breakdown|accessdate=25 December 2008|author=Music Theatre International}}</ref>\n\nIn productions, the first puppet is a small potted plant \"less than one foot tall\" held by the actor portraying Seymour.<ref name=MTI/>  He manipulates the plant himself with his hand and then sets it down, where it is moved by an unseen hand from beneath a shelf.  The second puppet is slightly larger than the first and is operated by Seymour during the song \"You Never Know\".  A fake arm in a sleeve matching Seymour's jacket is attached to the plant's pot, while the actor's real arm operates the plant.  The third puppet sits on the floor and is large enough to hide a person inside, who moves the plant's mouth in sync with Audrey II's voice, which is supplied by an offstage actor on a microphone.  The puppeteer's legs are clad in green tights with \"leaf\" shoes that serve as part of the plant's tendrils.  In Act II, the largest puppet again hides an actor inside, who manipulates the puppet's mouth and often some of its branches.  By this point, the head is at least six feet long and capable of \"swallowing\" characters.  For the finale, additions can be made to make the plant appear taller and even bigger.<ref name=MTI/> Actors and stage hands are often used to move larger branches and roots, which, in the original off-Broadway production, spilled off the stage and into the audience. In some productions, dangling vines over the house enhance the effect of Audrey II menacing the audience.\n\nAmateur productions of ''Little Shop of Horrors'' receive designs for building the puppets from [[Music Theatre International|MTI]], as part of the rental scripts and scores, based on the original Martin P. Robinson designs.  Some companies who have produced the show in the past and built their own puppets rent them out to other companies to recoup some of their construction costs.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.prattsburgh.wnyric.org/audrey_ii_rental.htm \"Prattsburgh Central School, Audrey II Rental\"]</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===1986 feature film===\n{{main|Little Shop of Horrors (film)}}\nA [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film version]] of the musical was made in 1986.  Directed by [[Frank Oz]] and noted as the only film written by [[Howard Ashman]], it starred [[Rick Moranis]] as Seymour, [[Ellen Greene]] as Audrey, [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Mr. Mushnik, [[Steve Martin]] as Orin Scrivello, DDS, and the voice of [[Levi Stubbs]] as Audrey II. [[Bill Murray]] played the small comic role of the masochist, Arthur Denton.  The 1986 film follows the plot of the musical closely but omits the songs \"Ya Never Know\" (rewritten as \"Some Fun Now,\" a trio for Crystal, Ronette and Chiffon), \"Mushnik and Son\", \"Now (It's Just the Gas)\", \"Sudden Changes,\" \"Closed for Renovation\" and \"Call Back in the Morning\"; the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]] ending also omits \"Finale Ultimo (Don't Feed The Plants)\".  Other changes include the removal of Mr. Mushnik's adoption proposition and a new ending, in which Seymour is able to save Audrey from Audrey II and then electrocutes the plant after it has destroyed the shop. Seymour and Audrey marry and move to the tract home of her dreams, but a small Audrey II-type bud is seen in their garden, which portends a possible spread of the alien plants.  An ending more faithful to the stage version was filmed, in which the plant eats Audrey and Seymour and then, having grown to massive size and reproduced, goes on a [[King Kong]]-style rampage through New York City.  It was received poorly by test audiences, and the upbeat alternate ending was used for the theatrical cut. In October 2012, the original ending was restored and released with the film as \"The Director's Cut\" on DVD and Blu-ray. A new song for Audrey II, \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\", was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Original Song.\n\n===Planned feature film===\nA remake of the musical for feature film is planned by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], with [[Greg Berlanti]] directing. [[Billy Porter (entertainer)|Billy Porter]] has been cast as the voice of Audrey II.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/chris-evans-talks-star-little-shop-horrors-1280781 | title = Chris Evans in Talks to Star in Greg Berlanti's 'Little Shop of Horrors' | first = Borys | last = Kit | date = February 24, 2020 | accessdate = February 24, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Ganzl, Kurt.
