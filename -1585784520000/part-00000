Founded in 1974 by Bob Reese, the company produces [[rifle]]s such as the [[Springfield Armory M1A|M1A]] and [[handgun]]s such as the [[Springfield Armory XD|XD]] series and [[Springfield Armory Hellcat|Hellcat]]. The company is unrelated to the like-named former manufacturer of US military firearms in Massachusetts, [[Springfield Armory]].\n\n==Formation==\nElmer C. Ballance began using the name \"Springfield Armory\" through his company (LH Manufacturing) dedicated to the first civilian production of the [[M14 rifle]], calling it the [[Springfield Armory M1A|M1A]].  Ballance began in [[San Antonio, Texas]], and soon after moved to [[Devine, Texas]], where the company gained momentum and popularity. In 1974, Ballance sold the company to the Reese family, who had a well-established production shop in [[Illinois]] and experience base. The company then expanded its market into other firearms, including the [[M1911]].  After further success, the company began to branch into even more types of firearms. The company, now run by Dennis Reese (formerly along with his brother Tom Reese), manufactures and imports dozens of different firearms in many styles and models. The company has previously (as late as 2017) used a motto, ''\"The First Name in American Firearms\"'', in reference to the original and operationally unrelated [[Springfield Armory]] of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], which was founded in 1777 and closed in 1968.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.springfield-armory.com/press-releases/springfield-armory-names-steve-mckelvain-president/ |title=Springfield Armory Names Steve McKelvain as President |website=springfield-armory.com |date=March 9, 2017 |accessdate=March 23, 2020}}</ref> Those two dates are included in a timeline on the company's website, which notes that in 1974 \"a passionate family by the name of Reese rescued\" the Springfield Armory name.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.springfield-armory.com/about/ |title=About |website=springfield-armory.com |accessdate=March 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Products==\n\n===Rifles===\n[[File:SA M1A NM.jpg|thumb|right|An [[M1A rifle]] made by Springfield Armory, Inc.]]\nThe company's rifle offerings include the M1A and the [[Springfield Armory SAINT|SAINT]] line of [[AR-15 style rifle]]s and [[short-barreled rifle]]s.\n\nThe M1A line includes offerings such as standard, loaded, [[Springfield Armory SOCOM|SOCOM 16]], national match, and tanker models.

Founded in 1974 by Bob Reese, the company produces [[rifle]]s such as the [[Springfield Armory M1A|M1A]] and [[handgun]]s such as the [[Springfield Armory XD|XD]] series and [[Springfield Armory Hellcat|Hellcat]]. The company is unrelated to the like-named former manufacturer of US military firearms in Massachusetts, [[Springfield Armory]].\n\n==Formation==\nElmer C. Ballance began using the name \"Springfield Armory\" through his company (LH Manufacturing) dedicated to the first civilian production of the [[M14 rifle]], calling it the [[Springfield Armory M1A|M1A]].  Ballance began in [[San Antonio, Texas]], and soon after moved to [[Devine, Texas]], where the company gained momentum and popularity. In 1974, Ballance sold the company to the Reese family, who had a well-established production shop in [[Illinois]] and experience base. The company then expanded its market into other firearms, including the [[M1911]].  After further success, the company began to branch into even more types of firearms. The company, now run by Dennis Reese (formerly along with his brother Tom Reese), manufactures and imports dozens of different firearms in many styles and models. The company has previously (as late as 2017) used a motto, ''\"The First Name in American Firearms\"'', in reference to the original and operationally unrelated [[Springfield Armory]] of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], which was founded in 1777 and closed in 1968.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.springfield-armory.com/press-releases/springfield-armory-names-steve-mckelvain-president/ |title=Springfield Armory Names Steve McKelvain as President |website=springfield-armory.com |date=March 9, 2017 |accessdate=March 23, 2020}}</ref> Those two dates are included in a timeline on the company's website, which notes that in 1974 \"a passionate family by the name of Reese rescued\" the Springfield Armory name.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.springfield-armory.com/about/ |title=About |website=springfield-armory.com |accessdate=March 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Products==\n\n===Rifles===\n[[File:SA M1A NM.jpg|thumb|right|An [[M1A rifle]] made by Springfield Armory, Inc.]]\nThe company's rifle offerings include the M1A and the [[Springfield Armory SAINT|SAINT]] line of [[AR-15 style rifle]]s and [[short-barreled rifle]]s.\n\nThe M1A line includes offerings such as standard, loaded, [[Springfield Armory SOCOM|SOCOM 16]], national match, and tanker models.

It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

Queen's University purchased the property with the intention of renovating it to house the Queen's Archives, but the interior of the building was awarded a heritage designation; therefore, Queen's lost the ability to renovate the interior and is considering its options.\n\nIn September 2013, after almost 180 years of housing prisoners, Kingston Penitentiary closed. The maximum security prison was named a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in February 1990 due to its history and reputation.

Support for this is found in a journal entry of a British Army officer in Kingston in 1843. He wrote ''\"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.\"''<ref name=\"queens\">{{cite web|title=Hockey night in Kingston |url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol133/issue11/features/lead1 |accessdate=June 21, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Kingston is also home to the oldest continuing hockey rivalry in the world by virtue of a game played in 1886 on the frozen Kingston harbour between Queen's University and the Royal Military College of Canada. To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]], is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ \u201cAbout the Hall\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053203/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref> The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role in the history of hockey in Canada.

The first winner of the [[Canadian Amateur Championship]] that same year was Kingstonian Thomas Harley, a Scottish immigrant carpenter. Richard H. (Dick) Green, who immigrated to the area from England in the late 1920s, was the longtime club professional for nearly 40 years at [[Cataraqui Golf and Country Club]] (founded in 1917 and redesigned by [[Stanley Thompson]] in 1930). Green also helped design several courses in eastern Ontario, including Smiths Falls (1949), Glen Lawrence (1955), Rideau Lakes (1961), Amherstview (1971), Garrison (1971), Evergreen (1972), Belle Park Fairways (1975), Rivendell (1979), and Colonnade (1984). [[Matt McQuillan]], a professional player on the [[PGA Tour]] for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, was born and raised in Kingston, and developed his game at the [[Garrison Golf and Curling Club]]. McQuillan won the 2005 Telus [[Edmonton]] Open on the [[Canadian Professional Golf Tour]].\n\n===Curling===\nThree curling clubs are in the Kingston area: the Cataraqui Golf & Country Club, Garrison Golf & Curling Club, and the [[Royal Kingston Curling Club]].<ref>[http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston CurlingRink.ca \u2013 Kingston Curling Clubs and Rinks \u2013 Kingston, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174549/http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston |date=July 6, 2011 }} Retrieved March 2, 2011</ref> The Royal Kingston Curling Club (RKCC) was founded in 1820, and was granted Royal patronage in 1993.

The Kingston Panthers R.F.C, recently celebrated their fortieth anniversary with an EORU championship in the Division 1 championship game at [[Twin Elm Rugby Park]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]].\n\n===Football===\nThe earliest known incarnation of an organized football team in Kingston is the [[Kingston Granites]] which played in the predecessor league to the [[Canadian Football League]], the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]], (ORFU). The team played for four seasons between 1898 and 1901 winning 1 ORFU title in 1899 defeating the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 8\u20130. Kingston also hosted the [[10th Grey Cup]] on December 2, 1922. The Limestone Grenadiers now represent Kingston and the surrounding area in the OVFL. The Club franchise catchment area draws players from Frontenac, Hastings, Lanark, Leeds, Lennox and Prince Edward counties. League play runs from late May through August. The Junior and Varsity teams' main schedule pits the Grenadiers against eastern Ontario opponents and cross-over games with western Ontario teams leading to a provincial title championship game.\nMany notable football people, CFL, NFL players, coaches and personalities have been associated with Kingston including:\n\n===Volleyball===\n\nThe Kingston Volleyball Club (KVC) was founded in 2015.

It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

The resulting explosion spread the fire throughout the city's downtown area, destroying a large number of buildings, including the old city hall. To prevent similar incidents from occurring in future, the city began building with limestone or brick. This rebuilding phase was referred to as \"the Limestone Revolution\" and earned the city the nickname \"The Limestone City\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thewhig.com/2010/02/11/fire-and-gunpowder-explosions-demolished-kingstons-waterfront |title=Fire and gunpowder explosions demolished Kingston's waterfront |newspaper=Kingston Whig-Standard |date=February 8, 2010 |archive-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072604/http://www.thewhig.com/2010/02/11/fire-and-gunpowder-explosions-demolished-kingstons-waterfront|accessdate=December 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kingstonpublicmarket.ca/about/history Kingston Public Market History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619042910/http://www.kingstonpublicmarket.ca/about/history |date=June 19, 2015 }} Retrieved October 8, 2015</ref><ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;99</ref>\n\n===More recent developments===\n\nThe [[Canadian Locomotive Company]] was at one time the largest locomotive works in the British Empire and the Davis [[Tanning (leather)|Tannery]] was at one time the largest tannery in the British Empire.

Queen's University grew from about 2,000 students in the 1940s to its present size of over 28,000 students, more than 90 per cent of whom are from outside the Kingston area. The Kingston campus of [[St. Lawrence College, Ontario|St. Lawrence College]] was established in 1969, and the college has 6,700 full-time students. The Royal Military College of Canada was founded in 1876, and has about 1,000 students. Kingston is a regional health care centre, anchored by Kingston General Hospital and the medical school at Queen's. The city's economy is also dominated by post-secondary education, military institutions, and prison installations.\n\nMunicipal governance had been a topic of discussion since the mid-1970s due to financial imbalance between the city and the surrounding [[Township (Canada)|townships]], which now had large residential areas and a population approaching that of the city proper. On January 1, 1998, the City was amalgamated with Kingston Township and [[Pittsburgh, Kingston|Pittsburgh Township]] to form the new City of Kingston.

To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre.

Pollonnaruwa was the second administrative center of [[Rajarata]].\n\n==Founding==\nThe city is situated on the left bank of River [[Mahaweli]]. Archeological evidence and accounts in chronicles{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} suggests that the city is as old as [[Anuradhapura]]. The Vijithagama settlement made by Vijitha in 400 BCE is thought to be situated near the town.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==History==\nAfter ruling the country for over 1,400 years, the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura]] fell in 1017 to the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] [[Raja Raja Chola I|King RajaRaja]] and his son Rajendra, who took King Mahinda V as a captive to India where he died in 1029. The Cholas shifted the capital to [[Polonnaruwa]] and ruled Sri Lanka for 53 years. Polonnaruwa was named as Jananathapuram by the Cholas. King [[Vijayabahu I]] eventually defeated the Cholas and re-established the Sinhalese lineage. Polonnaruwa had previously been an important settlement in the country, as it commanded the crossings of the [[Mahaweli Ganga]] towards Anuradhapura.\n\nSome of the rulers of Polonnaruwa include [[Vijayabahu I]] and [[Parakramabahu I]] (Parakramabahu the Great). Most of Polonnaruwa that remains today dates from after the 1150s, as the extensive civil wars that preceded Parakramabahu's accession to the throne devastated the city. [[Parakrama Pandyan II]] from [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyan Kingdom]] invaded the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa in the thirteenth century and ruled from 1212 to 1215 CE. He was succeeded by [[Kalinga Magha]] the founder of the [[Jaffna kingdom]]. Kalinga Magha ruled 21 years until he was expelled from Polonnaruwa in 1236.\n\n===Demise===\nThe Kingdom of Polonnaruwa was abandoned in the 14th century, and the seat of government for the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] kings was moved to [[Kingdom of Dambadeniya|Dambadeniya]]. Although many factors contributed to this, the leading cause of the abandonment of Polonnaruwa was its susceptibility to invasions from south [[India]].\n\n==Trade==\nThe kings who ruled in Polonnaruwa engaged in foreign trade. During the period of king Parakramabahu I, Sri Lanka was self-sufficient in paddy and also had exported to many Southeast Asian countries as well as to India.\nThe people of Polonnaruwa had many of their requirements fulfilled except salt, which they had to bring from the coastal area.\n\n==Religion==\n[[Buddhism]] continued to be the main religion in Polonnaruwa era. Before the Sinhala kings' rule, there was a strong influence of [[Hinduism]] caused by Cholas. It is evident from the removal of cow shape in Polonnaruwa moonstone and also by the presence of Shiva temples in Polonnaruwa. After Chola rule a lot of vihars were renovated by Vijayabahu I and Parakramabahu I. Various divisions or Nikayas in Buddhism were united by Parakramabahu I.\n\n==Education==\nThe kings who ruled during this period built Buddhist schools for monks which were known as the Pirivena.\nAnd also the Brahmins were the only group which had the rights to have education.\nPali and the Sanskrit were the official languages.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Galvihara-sunny2.jpg|Buddha statues in Gal Vihara\nImage:Satmahal Prasada.jpg|seven storeyed [[Satmahal Prasada]]\nImage:Polonnaruwa-temple19.jpg|Moonstone of Polonnaruwa\nImage:Polonnaruwa-panta.jpg|Parakrama Samudra built by king Parakramabahu I\nImage:Giritale tank.JPG|[[Giritale Tank]] was the deepest tank in Sri Lanka during Polonnaruwa era.\nImage:Polonnaruwa 0305.jpg| Shiva Devalaya in Polonnaruwa, dating back to the early years of [[Chola rule in Sri Lanka]].\nFile:Polonnaruwa Velaikkara Slab Inscription.jpg|Polonnaruwa velaikkara ([[Tamil script|Tamil]]) inscription of [[Vijayabahu I]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sri Lanka]]\n*[[History of Sri Lanka]]\n*[[List of Sri Lankan monarchs]]\n\n==Notes==\n*{{cite book | last =Paranavitana | first =Senarat |author2=Nicholas, Cyril Wace  | title =A Concise History of Ceylon | publisher =Ceylon University Press | year =1961 | location =Colombo | oclc = 465385  }}\n*von Schroeder, Ulrich.

Voter turnout was 72.2%.<ref>Nohlen, p248</ref>\n\n==Presidential candidates==\nThe incumbent [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]] was standing down after a four-year term. Although he was constitutionally allowed to run for a second term, his [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]] had a strict anti-re-election ideology.\n\n===Dominican Revolutionary Party===\nSince the PRD had a strict anti-re-election stance, it was assumed that [[Jacobo Majluta Azar|Jacobo Majluta]] was next in line for his party's nomination. Majluta was Vice President under [[Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez]] and had served as President for 43 days after Guzm\u00e1n committed suicide. After having been defeated by [[Salvador Jorge Blanco|Jorge Blanco]] for the nomination in [[1982 Dominican Republic general election|1982]], he was given the candidacy for [[Santo Domingo]] Senator and President of the Senate (a similar deal had been done by Blanco and Guzm\u00e1n in 1978) which he won. From this position he engaged a fierce battle with the faction of the party led by Blanco and so the latter tried putting Secretary of State Hatuey Decamps against Majluta for the nomination but someone so close to the unpopular government could not stop Majluta who had become the most vocal critic of the administration. Blanco supporters then turned to party leader and Mayor of Santo Domingo, the popular [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez]]. At first he did not accept it (neither declined it) but after surviving a heart attack he believed it was his destiny to become President and so he decided to run against his once closest party colleague. The race was extremely close and divisive, even causing a shoot out at the Concorde Hotel but when results came in, Majluta was declared the winner.\n\nThe post-convention process was traumatizing and many PRD members refused to endorse Majluta. Some Gomez supporters even went as far as to endorse [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]]. [[Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez]]\n[[President of Venezuela]] and strong activist of [[Socialist International]] campaigned for Gomez to be included on the ticket as Vice President but Majluta said he preferred to lose than to win alongside Pe\u00f1a Gomez who he felt had betrayed him by competing against him. A deal similar to the one Guzm\u00e1n had made with Blanco and the latter with Majluta was offered to Gomez but he declined calling it a \"cursed gift\". Ultimately [[Nicolas Vargas]] of Santiago was chosen as running mate.\n\n===PRSC===\nEver since the foundation of the Reformist Party, Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer had been its candidate in the presidential elections, a position which continued after the merger with the Christian Social Revolutionary Party to create the Christian Social Reformist Party. This caused some disgust among young reformers like Victor Gomez Berges and Fernando Alvarez Bogaert who claimed that Balaguer was too old (80) to run for the presidency, but he ultimately achieved the nomination with only token opposition from Julio Cesar Casta\u00f1os Espaillat who only received one vote (his own). Balaguer chose [[Carlos Morales Troncoso]], a successful businessman as his running mate.\n\n===PLD===\n[[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] received no opposition for the nomination of the [[Dominican Liberation Party]], which he had founded after splitting from the PRD in 1973. His running mate was former rector of the [[University of Santo Domingo]], Jose Joaquin Bido Medina.\n\n===Minor parties===\nNarciso Isa Conde was candidate for [[Dominican Communist Party]] and famous lawyer [[Marino Vinicio Castillo|Vincho Castillo]] was the candidate of his [[National Progressive Force]].\n\n==Campaign==\nAfter eight years of PRD governments, the once great popularity of the white party was becoming mild while former President Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer was surging as an alternative among the new voters and Juan Bosch was attracting dissatisfied PRD voters.\n\nBosch campaigned hard against alleged corruption in the Guzm\u00e1n and Jorge Blanco administration even publishing what his party called the \"corruption album\" which consisted of pictures that were claimed to be proof of illicit enrichment of his former party mates. Attacks were also directed towards Balaguer bringing up the deaths of \"the 12 years\". A popular slogan during the PLD campaign was \"Juan Bosch ni robo ni mato!\" a reference to the lack of corruption or political murders during Juan Bosch's Presidency in 1963.\n\nThe PRD was quick to answer with \"Juan Bosch ni robo ni mato...porque tiempo no le dio\" poking fun at the fact that Bosch was only in government for 7 months and therefore lacked the time to do the things he accused his opponents of.<ref>Campillo Perez, Julio Genaro ''Historia Electoral Dominicana 1848-1986''</ref>\n\nDue to the unpopularity of the Jorge Blanco administration and therefore the PRD party itself, Majluta created the [[Liberal Party of the Dominican Republic]] which would form an alliance with the PRD so that he could try to get voters who detested the incumbent party.<ref>[http://www.809rd.net/adios/majluta_jacobo_02.htm Jacobo Majluta Biography (Spanish)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225135501/http://www.809rd.net/adios/majluta_jacobo_02.htm |date=February 25, 2009 }}</ref> His candidacy was also supported by Constitutional Action Party and Nationalist Democratic Party. Negotiations were also held with [[El\u00edas Wessin y Wessin]] leader of the Democratic Quisqueya Party but these fell apart and Wessin ultimately supported Balaguer, whom he had tried to overthrow in 1971 and was exiled for it.\n\nBalaguer conducted a vigorous campaign which attracted many young voters and old foes. Besides Wessin, he was now also supported by [[Donald Reid Cabral]] ex-President of the triumvirate that ruled the country while Balaguer was in exile, [[Mario Read Vittini]], and many communists who had fought him in the past, including [[Tacito Perdomo]].<ref>[http://www.ahora.com.do/Edicion1238/SECCIONES/politica.html Leftist politicians in Dominican Governments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719133228/http://www.ahora.com.do/Edicion1238/SECCIONES/politica.html |date=July 19, 2011 }} Ahora {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nAfter a bloody riot in 1984 which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, the PRD could no longer attack Balaguer for the dark past of his previous governments which enabled him to get much of the youth vote.\n\nBalaguer supporters chanted \"vuelve y vuelve!\" at the political rallies as their victory chant referring to his possible return to the Presidency. The 80-year-old [[caudillo]] was attacked due to his blindness during the campaign to which he responded ''As President I will not be asked to thread needles''.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/magazine/the-dominican-republic-in-the-land-of-the-blind-caudillo.html?pagewanted=all Kurlansky, Mike In the Land of the Blind Caudillo] New York Times</ref>\n\nSince Majluta's picture would be on four different party's ballots he feared that the less enlightened voters who made up the PRD's core would cast votes for him in all four and thus spoiling the vote. He spent precious time campaigning to educate voters to only cast a vote for him on one ballot.\n\n==Results==\n\n===President===\nWhat Majluta so greatly feared came to be when vote counts showed a great number of invalid votes. Balaguer had a lead over him but the number of invalid votes was bigger than that of the margin of victory. Jacobo tried to get the ballots counted since the great majority of these were ballots that had his face marked multiple times on the PRD and Liberal Party tickets and therefore were undeniable cast for him. On 19 May, with 92% of the votes counted, the vote count was halted and guards were placed outside the Central Elections Board and Majluta declared himself the winner despite being behind Balaguer in the tally.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7DC163BF933A15756C0A960948260&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FB%2FBalaguer%2C%20Joaquin&scp=15&sq=joaquin%20balaguer%201986&st=cse Vote Count Halted] New York Times</ref> After appeals from [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]], the vote counting was resumed on May 21<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/21/world/around-the-world-vote-count-resumes-in-dominican-republic.html?sq=joaquin+balaguer+1986&st=cse&scp=18&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes+Topics%2FPeople%2FB%2FBalaguer%2C+Joaquin Vote count resumes in the Dominican Republic] New York Times</ref> only to be stopped again on the 22nd.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3DF123EF931A15756C0A960948260&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FB%2FBalaguer%2C%20Joaquin&scp=14&sq=joaquin%20balaguer%201986&st=cse Dominican vote count stopped again] New York Times</ref>\n\nA month passed and there was still uncertainty over who had really won the election but Balaguer's margin had grown and ended up surpassing the number of invalid votes.

p247 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}</ref> [[Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer]] of the [[Social Christian Reformist Party]] won the presidential election, whilst the PRSC-led alliance won the Congressional elections. Voter turnout was 72.2%.<ref>Nohlen, p248</ref>\n\n==Presidential candidates==\nThe incumbent [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]] was standing down after a four-year term. Although he was constitutionally allowed to run for a second term, his [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]] had a strict anti-re-election ideology.\n\n===Dominican Revolutionary Party===\nSince the PRD had a strict anti-re-election stance, it was assumed that [[Jacobo Majluta Azar|Jacobo Majluta]] was next in line for his party's nomination. Majluta was Vice President under [[Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez]] and had served as President for 43 days after Guzm\u00e1n committed suicide. After having been defeated by [[Salvador Jorge Blanco|Jorge Blanco]] for the nomination in [[1982 Dominican Republic general election|1982]], he was given the candidacy for [[Santo Domingo]] Senator and President of the Senate (a similar deal had been done by Blanco and Guzm\u00e1n in 1978) which he won. From this position he engaged a fierce battle with the faction of the party led by Blanco and so the latter tried putting Secretary of State Hatuey Decamps against Majluta for the nomination but someone so close to the unpopular government could not stop Majluta who had become the most vocal critic of the administration. Blanco supporters then turned to party leader and Mayor of Santo Domingo, the popular [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez]]. At first he did not accept it (neither declined it) but after surviving a heart attack he believed it was his destiny to become President and so he decided to run against his once closest party colleague. The race was extremely close and divisive, even causing a shoot out at the Concorde Hotel but when results came in, Majluta was declared the winner.\n\nThe post-convention process was traumatizing and many PRD members refused to endorse Majluta. Some Gomez supporters even went as far as to endorse [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]]. [[Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez]]\n[[President of Venezuela]] and strong activist of [[Socialist International]] campaigned for Gomez to be included on the ticket as Vice President but Majluta said he preferred to lose than to win alongside Pe\u00f1a Gomez who he felt had betrayed him by competing against him. A deal similar to the one Guzm\u00e1n had made with Blanco and the latter with Majluta was offered to Gomez but he declined calling it a \"cursed gift\". Ultimately [[Nicolas Vargas]] of Santiago was chosen as running mate.\n\n===PRSC===\nEver since the foundation of the Reformist Party, Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer had been its candidate in the presidential elections, a position which continued after the merger with the Christian Social Revolutionary Party to create the Christian Social Reformist Party. This caused some disgust among young reformers like Victor Gomez Berges and Fernando Alvarez Bogaert who claimed that Balaguer was too old (80) to run for the presidency, but he ultimately achieved the nomination with only token opposition from Julio Cesar Casta\u00f1os Espaillat who only received one vote (his own). Balaguer chose [[Carlos Morales Troncoso]], a successful businessman as his running mate.\n\n===PLD===\n[[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] received no opposition for the nomination of the [[Dominican Liberation Party]], which he had founded after splitting from the PRD in 1973. His running mate was former rector of the [[University of Santo Domingo]], Jose Joaquin Bido Medina.\n\n===Minor parties===\nNarciso Isa Conde was candidate for [[Dominican Communist Party]] and famous lawyer [[Marino Vinicio Castillo|Vincho Castillo]] was the candidate of his [[National Progressive Force]].\n\n==Campaign==\nAfter eight years of PRD governments, the once great popularity of the white party was becoming mild while former President Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer was surging as an alternative among the new voters and Juan Bosch was attracting dissatisfied PRD voters.\n\nBosch campaigned hard against alleged corruption in the Guzm\u00e1n and Jorge Blanco administration even publishing what his party called the \"corruption album\" which consisted of pictures that were claimed to be proof of illicit enrichment of his former party mates. Attacks were also directed towards Balaguer bringing up the deaths of \"the 12 years\". A popular slogan during the PLD campaign was \"Juan Bosch ni robo ni mato!\" a reference to the lack of corruption or political murders during Juan Bosch's Presidency in 1963.\n\nThe PRD was quick to answer with \"Juan Bosch ni robo ni mato...porque tiempo no le dio\" poking fun at the fact that Bosch was only in government for 7 months and therefore lacked the time to do the things he accused his opponents of.<ref>Campillo Perez, Julio Genaro ''Historia Electoral Dominicana 1848-1986''</ref>\n\nDue to the unpopularity of the Jorge Blanco administration and therefore the PRD party itself, Majluta created the [[Liberal Party of the Dominican Republic]] which would form an alliance with the PRD so that he could try to get voters who detested the incumbent party.<ref>[http://www.809rd.net/adios/majluta_jacobo_02.htm Jacobo Majluta Biography (Spanish)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225135501/http://www.809rd.net/adios/majluta_jacobo_02.htm |date=February 25, 2009 }}</ref> His candidacy was also supported by Constitutional Action Party and Nationalist Democratic Party. Negotiations were also held with [[El\u00edas Wessin y Wessin]] leader of the Democratic Quisqueya Party but these fell apart and Wessin ultimately supported Balaguer, whom he had tried to overthrow in 1971 and was exiled for it.\n\nBalaguer conducted a vigorous campaign which attracted many young voters and old foes. Besides Wessin, he was now also supported by [[Donald Reid Cabral]] ex-President of the triumvirate that ruled the country while Balaguer was in exile, [[Mario Read Vittini]], and many communists who had fought him in the past, including [[Tacito Perdomo]].<ref>[http://www.ahora.com.do/Edicion1238/SECCIONES/politica.html Leftist politicians in Dominican Governments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719133228/http://www.ahora.com.do/Edicion1238/SECCIONES/politica.html |date=July 19, 2011 }} Ahora {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nAfter a bloody riot in 1984 which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, the PRD could no longer attack Balaguer for the dark past of his previous governments which enabled him to get much of the youth vote.\n\nBalaguer supporters chanted \"vuelve y vuelve!\" at the political rallies as their victory chant referring to his possible return to the Presidency. The 80-year-old [[caudillo]] was attacked due to his blindness during the campaign to which he responded ''As President I will not be asked to thread needles''.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/magazine/the-dominican-republic-in-the-land-of-the-blind-caudillo.html?pagewanted=all Kurlansky, Mike In the Land of the Blind Caudillo] New York Times</ref>\n\nSince Majluta's picture would be on four different party's ballots he feared that the less enlightened voters who made up the PRD's core would cast votes for him in all four and thus spoiling the vote. He spent precious time campaigning to educate voters to only cast a vote for him on one ballot.\n\n==Results==\n\n===President===\nWhat Majluta so greatly feared came to be when vote counts showed a great number of invalid votes. Balaguer had a lead over him but the number of invalid votes was bigger than that of the margin of victory. Jacobo tried to get the ballots counted since the great majority of these were ballots that had his face marked multiple times on the PRD and Liberal Party tickets and therefore were undeniable cast for him.
