Until July 2004 it was officially known as ''Wojska Lotnicze i Obrony Powietrznej'' (literally: ''Flight-and-Air Defence Forces''). In 2014 it consisted of roughly 16,425 military personnel and about 475 aircraft, distributed among ten bases throughout Poland.\n\nThe Polish Air Force can trace its origins to the months following the end of [[World War I]] in 1918. During the [[invasion of Poland]] by Nazi Germany in 1939, 70% of its aircraft were destroyed. Most pilots, after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on September 17, escaped via Romania and Hungary to continue fighting throughout [[World War II]] in allied air forces, first in France, then in Britain, and later also the Soviet Union.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Polish Air Force}}\n\n===1918\u20131930===\n[[File:The people's war book; history, cyclopaedia and chronology of the great world war (1919) (14779758884).jpg|thumb|left|Polish Air Force fighters]]\nMilitary aviation in free Poland started even before the officially recognised date of regaining independence (11 November 1918). Poland was under German and Austro-Hungarian occupation until [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the armistice]], but the Poles started to take control as the [[Central Powers]] collapsed.  Initially, the Polish air force consisted of mostly German and Austrian aircraft, left by former occupants or captured from them, mostly during the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u201319)|Greater Poland Uprising]]. These planes were first used by the Polish Air Force in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] in late 1918, during combat operations centered around the city of [[Lw\u00f3w]] (now [[Lviv]]).<ref name=\"sp.mil.pl\">[http://www.sp.mil.pl/en/history-of-the-polish-air-force History of the Polish Air Force.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025235752/http://sp.mil.pl/en/history-of-the-polish-air-force |date=2011-10-25 }} ''Polish Air Force Public Affairs Office.'' Retrieved November 1, 2011.</ref> On 2 November 1918 pilot [[Stefan Bastyr]] performed the first combat flight of Polish aircraft from Lviv.<ref>Morga\u0142a (1997), p.97</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Polish-Soviet War]] broke out in February 1920, the Polish Air Force used a variety of former German and Austro-Hungarian, as well as newly acquired western-made [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] aircraft. Most common at that time were light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, among most numerous were French [[Breguet 14]] bombers, German [[LVG C.V]] reconnaissance aircraft, British [[Bristol F2B]] scouts and Italian [[Ansaldo Balilla]] fighters.<ref name=morg242/>\n\nAfter the Polish-Soviet War ended in 1921, most of the worn out World War I aircraft were gradually withdrawn and from 1924 the air force started to be equipped with new French aircraft. In total in 1918-1924 there were 2160 aircraft in the Polish Air Force and naval aviation (not all in operable condition), in which there were 1384 reconnaissance aircraft and 410 fighters.<ref name=morg242>Morga\u0142a (1997), p.242-244</ref> From 1924 to 1930 the primary fighter of the Polish Air Force was the [[SPAD 61]] and its main bombers were the French produced [[Potez 15]] and the [[Potez 25]], which was eventually manufactured in Poland under license from A\u00e9roplanes Henry Potez.\n\nThe first Polish-designed and mass-produced aircraft to serve in the country's air force was a high wing fighter, the [[PWS-10]], first manufactured in 1930 by the Podlasie Aircraft Factory.\n\n===1933\u20131938===\n[[File:Cooper Fauntleroy.jpg|thumb|American volunteers, [[Merian C. Cooper]] and [[Cedric Fauntleroy]], fighting in the Polish Air Force as part of the [[Polish 7th Air Escadrille]], known as the \"Ko\u015bciuszko Squadron\"]]\nIn 1933,  Zygmunt Pulawski's first high wing, all-metal aircraft, the [[PZL P.7]]a, was designed and produced, with 150 entering service. The design was followed by 30 improved [[PZL P.11]]a aircraft and a final design, the [[PZL P.11]]c, was delivered in 1935 and was a respectable fighter for its time; 175 entered service and it remained the only Polish fighter until 1939, by which time foreign aircraft design had overtaken it. Its final version, the [[PZL P.24]], was built for export only and was bought by four countries. A new fighter prototype, the [[PZL.50 Jastrz\u0105b]] (Hawk), similar to the [[Seversky P-35]] in layout, was curtailed by the Nazi invasion and two twin-engine heavy fighters, the [[PZL.38 Wilk]] and the [[PZL.48 Lampart]], remained prototypes.<ref name=\"sp.mil.pl\" />\n\nAs far as bombers are concerned, the Potez 25 and [[Breguet 19]] were replaced by an all-metal monoplane, the [[PZL.23 Kara\u015b]], with 250 built from 1936 onwards, but by 1939 the Karas was outdated. In 1938 the Polish factory PZL designed a modern twin-engine medium bomber, the [[PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b]] (Elk). The \u0141o\u015b had a bomb payload of 2580&nbsp;kg and a top speed of 439&nbsp;km/h. Unfortunately, only about 30 \u0141o\u015b A bombers (single tailfin) and 70 \u0141o\u015b B (twin tailfin) bombers had been delivered before the Nazi invasion.\n\nAs an observation and close reconnaissance plane, Polish [[Squadron (aviation)|''escadres'']] used the slow and easily damaged [[Lublin R-XIII]], and later the [[RWD-14 Czapla]]. Polish naval aviation used the Lublin R-XIII on floats. Just before the war, some Italian torpedo planes, the [[CANT Z.506]], were ordered, but only one was delivered, and it was without armament. The principal aircraft used to train pilots were the Polish-built high-wing [[RWD-8]] and the [[PWS-26]] biplane. In 1939, Poland ordered 160 [[MS-406]]s and 10 [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters from abroad, but they were not delivered before the outbreak of war.\n\n===1939===\n[[File:PZL.43.jpg|thumb|left|A [[PZL.43]] tactical bomber]]\n{{see also|Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign#Polish Air Force{{!}}Polish September Campaign}}\nOn 1 September 1939, at the beginning of the [[invasion of Poland]], all the Polish combat aircraft had been dispersed to secondary airfields, contrary to a commonly-held belief, based on German propaganda, that they had all been destroyed by bombing at their air bases. The aircraft destroyed by German bombers on the airfields were mostly [[trainer (aircraft)|trainers]]. The fighters were grouped into 15 escadres; five of them constituted the [[Pursuit Brigade]], deployed in the [[Warsaw]] area. Despite being obsolete, Polish PZL-11 fighters shot down over 170 German aircraft. The bombers, grouped in nine escadres of the [[Bomber Brigade]], attacked armoured ground columns but suffered heavy losses. Seven reconnaissance- and 12 observation escadres, deployed to particular armies, were used primarily for reconnaissance. Part of the Polish Air Force was destroyed in the campaign; {{citation needed span|the surviving aircraft were either captured or withdrawn to Romania, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia or Sweden, whose air forces subsequently employed these aircraft for their own use (in the case of Romania until 1956)|date=December 2017}}. A great number of pilots and aircrew managed to escape to France and then to Britain, where they played a significant part in the defence of the United Kingdom against Nazi invasion, during the [[Battle of Britain]].\n\n===Strength of Polish Air Force on 1 September 1939===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\"|Aircraft<ref>{{cite book | author=Wac\u0142aw Stachiewicz | title=Wierno\u015bci dochowa\u0107 \u017co\u0142nierskiej | publisher=OW RYTM | year=1998 | isbn=978-83-86678-71-6}}</ref>\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:l center; background:#acc;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left; background:#acc;\"|Variant\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\"|In service\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"|Notes\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\"| [[Military aircraft#Combat aircraft|Combat Aircraft]]\n|-\n|[[PZL P.11]]\n|[[Poland]]\n|Fighter\n|\n|175\n|Combat formations consisted of 140\n|-\n|[[PZL P.7]]\n|Poland\n|Fighter\n|\n|105\n|Combat formations consisted of 30\n|-\n|[[PZL.23 Kara\u015b|PZL.23A]]\n|Poland\n|[[Light bomber]]\n|\n| 35\n| \n|-\n|[[PZL.23 Kara\u015b|PZL.23B]]\n|Poland\n|Light bomber\n|\n|170\n|Combat formations consisted of 120\n|-\n|[[PZL.43]]\n|Poland\n|Light bomber\n|\n|6\n|Combat formations consisted of 6\n|-\n|[[PZL.46 Sum]]\n|Poland\n|Light bomber\n|\n|2\n|Combat formations consisted of 1\n|-\n|[[PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b]]\n|Poland\n|[[Medium bomber]]\n|\n|86\n|Combat formations consisted of 36\n|-\n|[[LWS-6 \u017bubr]]\n|Poland\n|Medium bomber\n|\n|15\n| \n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\"| [[Surveillance aircraft|Surveillance]]\n|-\n|[[Lublin R XIII]]\n|Poland\n|[[Army cooperation aircraft|Spotter]]\n|\n|150\n|Combat formations consisted of 55\n|-\n|[[RWD-14 Czapla]]\n|Poland\n|[[Reconnaissance aircraft|Reconnaissance]]\n|\n|60\n|Combat formations consisted of 40\n|-\n|[[RWD 8]]\n|Poland\n|Reconnaissance\n|\n|550\n|Combat formations consisted of 20\n|-\n|[[PWS-16]]\n|Poland\n|Reconnaissance/trainer\n|\n|15\n|Combat formations consisted of 15\n|}\n\n===1940 (France)===\n{{main|Polish Air Forces in France}}\n[[File:PSP Dywizjon 302.svg|thumb|right|100px|The emblem of the [[No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron]] featuring the designation of the GC I/145, from where most of its initial crew came]]\nAfter the fall of Poland, the Polish Air Force started to regroup in France. The only complete unit created before the German attack on France was the [[I/145 Polish Fighter Squadron|GC I/145 fighter squadron]], flying [[Caudron C.714]] light fighters. It was the only unit operating the C.714 at the time. The Polish pilots were also deployed to various French squadrons, flying on all types of French fighters, but mostly on the [[MS-406]]. After the surrender of France, many of these pilots managed to escape to Britain to continue the fight against the Luftwaffe.\n\n===1940\u20131947 (United Kingdom)===\n{{see also|Polish Air Force in Great Britain}}\n[[File:Polish airforce memorial, St Clements.jpg|thumb|Polish Air Force of France and Great Britain memorial at St. Clements Church in London]]\nFollowing the [[fall of France]] in 1940, Polish units were formed in the United Kingdom, as a part of the [[Royal Air Force]] and known as the Polish Air Force (PAF). Four Polish squadrons were formed: [[Polish 300th Bomber Command|300 Squadron]] and [[No. 301 Polish Bomber Squadron|301 Squadron]] flew bombers, [[No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron|302 Squadron]] and [[Polish 303 Fighter Squadron|303 Squadron]] flew [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters. The two Polish fighter squadrons first saw action in the third phase of the [[Battle of Britain]] in August 1940, with much success; the pilots were battle-hardened and Polish flying skills had been well learned from the [[invasion of Poland]]. The pilots were regarded as fearless, sometimes bordering on reckless. Nevertheless, success rates were very high in comparison to UK and Empire pilots. 303 Squadron became the most efficient RAF fighter squadron at that time. Many Polish pilots also flew individually in other RAF squadrons.\n\nAs [[World War II]] progressed, further Polish squadrons were created in the United Kingdom: [[No. 304 Polish Bomber Squadron]] (bomber, then [[Coastal Command]]), 305 Squadron (bomber), 306 Squadron (fighter), 307 Squadron (night fighter), 308 Squadron (fighter), 309 Squadron (reconnaissance, then fighter), 315 Squadron (fighter), 316 Squadron (fighter), 317 Squadron (fighter), 318 Squadron (fighter-reconnaissance), 663 Squadron (air observation/artillery spotting) and the [[Polish Fighting Team]] also known as the \"Skalski Circus\", attached to [[No. 145 Squadron RAF|145 Squadron RAF]]. The fighter squadrons initially flew Hurricanes, then switched to [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]], and eventually to [[P-51 Mustang|North American Mustang]]s. 307 Squadron, like other [[night fighter]] squadrons (such as [[No. 410 Squadron RCAF|410 Squadron]] Royal Canadian Air Force), flew [[Boulton-Paul Defiant]]s, [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and finally [[de Havilland Mosquito]]es. The bomber squadrons were initially equipped with [[Fairey Battle]]s and [[Vickers Wellington]]s. 300 Squadron was later assigned [[Avro Lancaster]]s, 301 Squadron [[Handley Page Halifax]]es and [[B-24 Liberator|Consolidated Liberators]] and 305 Squadron, [[de Havilland Mosquito]]es and [[B-25 Mitchell|North American Mitchells]]. 663 Squadron (air observation/artillery spotting) flew [[Taylorcraft Auster|Auster]] AOP IIIs and Vs. After the war, all equipment was returned to the British, but only some of the pilots and crews actually returned to Poland, with many settling in the United Kingdom, some of whom returned to Poland in 1989 after the fall of communism.\n\n===1943\u20131945 (Soviet Union)===\n{{see also|Air Force of the Polish Army}}\nAlong with the Polish People's Army (''Ludowe Wojsko Polskie'') in the [[USSR]], the ''Ludowe Lotnictwo Polskie''&nbsp;\u2013 Polish People's Air Force&nbsp;\u2013 was created, in defence of the Soviet Union against Nazi invasion. In late 1943, the 1st Fighter Regiment \"Warszawa\", (equipped with [[Yak-1]] and [[Yak-9]] aircraft), the 2nd Night Bomber Regiment \"Krak\u00f3w\" (flying [[Polikarpov Po-2]] aircraft \u2013 produced in Poland as the [[CSS-13]] from 1949 onwards), and the 3rd Assault Regiment (flying [[Ilyushin Il-2]] aircraft) were formed. During 1944\u20135, further regiments were created, coming together to form the 1st Mixed Air Corps, consisting of a bomber division, an assault division, a fighter division and a mixed division.  After the war, these returned to Poland and gave birth to the air force of the [[People's Republic of Poland]].\n\n===1949\u20131989===\n[[File:Duxford Air Festival 2017 - mig1 (34842016051).jpg|thumb|left|[[MiG-15]] fighter]]\nIn 1949, the [[Li-2]]sb transport aircraft was adapted into a bomber and in 1950, Poland received [[Petlyakov Pe-2]] and [[Tupolev Tu-2]] bombers from the Soviet Union along with [[Tupolev SB-1|USB-1]] and [[Tupolev SB-2|USB-2]] training bombers. In 1950 also, the [[Yak-17]] fighter came into service, as did the [[Ilyushin Il-12]] transport and the [[Yak-18]] trainer. From 1951 onwards, the Polish Air Force was equipped with [[Yak-23]] jet fighters and [[MiG-15]] jets, along with a training version, the [[MiG-15|MiG-15 UTI]], and later, in 1961, the [[MiG-17]].\n\nAs well as Soviet-produced aircraft, from 1952 onwards Soviet MiG-15 and later MiG-17 fighters were produced under licence in Poland as the Lim-1, Lim-2 and later the Lim-5. A domestic ground attack variant of the Lim-5M was developed as the Lim-6bis in 1964. The only jet bomber used by the Polish Air Force during this period was the [[Ilyushin Il-28]], from 1952 onwards. Poland used only a small number of [[MiG-19]]s from 1959, in favour of the [[MiG-21]] from 1963 onwards, which became its main supersonic fighter. This aircraft was used in numerous variants from MiG-21F-13, through MiG-21PF and MF to MiG-21bis. Later, the Polish Air Force received 37 [[MiG-23]]s (1979) and 12 [[MiG-29]]s (1989).\n\nThe main fighter-bomber and ground attack aircraft after 1949 was the [[Ilyushin Il-10|Il-10]] (a training version, the [[Ilyushin Il-10|UIl-10]], entering service in 1951). From 1965 onwards, Poland also used a substantial number of [[Sukhoi Su-7|Su-7Bs]] for bombing and ground attack, replaced with 27 [[Sukhoi Su-20]]s in 1974 and 110 [[Sukhoi Su-22]]s in 1984.\n\nPropeller-driven training aircraft, the [[LWD Junak|Junak-2]] (in service since 1952), the [[LWD Junak|TS-9 Junak-3]] (in service since 1954) and the [[PZL TS-8 Bies]] (since 1958) were later replaced by a jet trainer, the domestically built [[TS-11 Iskra]]. Another Polish jet trainer, the [[PZL I-22 Iryda]], was used for some time but, because of continuing problems, all machines were returned to [[PZL]] for modification and did not resume service. The [[Yak-12]] was used as a multirole aircraft from 1951, the [[An-2]] from 1955 and subsequently the [[PZL-104 Wilga|Wilga-35 P]].\n\nTransport aircraft used by the Polish Air Force during this period included: the [[Ilyushin Il-14|Il-14]] (first in service in 1955), the [[Ilyushin Il-18|Il-18]] (first in service in 1961), the [[An-12]]B (first in service in 1966), the [[An-26]] (first in service in 1972), the [[Yak-40]] (first in service in 1973) and the [[Tupolev Tu-154]]. A number of helicopters were used by the Polish Army: the [[SM-1]] (a [[Mil Mi-1]] manufactured under licence), which was a multirole helicopter, in operation since 1956; the [[Mil Mi-4]], multirole, since 1958; the [[PLZ SM-2]], multirole, since 1960; the [[Mil Mi-2]] and [[Mil Mi-8]] (later also [[Mil Mi-17]]), multirole, since 1968 and the [[Mil Mi-24]], a combat helicopter, since 1976. Also the [[Mil Mi-14]], an amphibious helicopter, and the [[Mil Mi-6]], both used as transports.\n\nIn 1954, the Polish Air Force was merged with the Air Defence Force, creating the Air and Country Air Defence Forces (''Wojska Lotnicze i Obrony Przeciwlotniczej Obszaru Kraju''&nbsp; \u2013 WLiOPL OK), a military organisation composed of both flying and anti-aircraft units. In 1962, the WLiOPL OK were separated back again into their two original component bodies: the Air Force (''Wojska Lotnicze'') and the Country Air Defence Force (''Wojska Obrony Powietrznej Kraju'').\n\n===Since 1990===\n[[File:105 Polish Air Force MiG-29A Fulcrum ILA Berlin 2016 10.jpg|thumb|Polish Air Force [[Mikoyan MiG-29]] at the [[ILA Berlin Air Show]], 2016]]\nAfter political upheaval and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and a consequent reduction in the state of military anxiety in the whole of Europe, the Polish Air Force saw reductions in size. On July 1, 1990, the Polish Air Force and the Air Defence Force were merged again (''Wojska Lotnicze i Obrony Powietrznej''&nbsp;\u2013 WLiOP or WLOP). The attack capability of this force consisted primarily of [[MiG-21]]s, [[MiG-23]]s, [[MiG-29]]s, [[Su-20]]s and [[Su-22]]s. The remaining Lim-6bis were withdrawn in the early 1990s, followed soon afterwards by the withdrawal of the remaining Su-20 aircraft. The small number of remaining MiG-23s were withdrawn by 1999. Throughout the 1990s, Poland had not purchased any new combat aircraft and only managed to acquire further MiG-29s from the Czech Republic in 1995 and from Germany in 2004. MiG-21s were finally withdrawn from service in 2003. In 2004, the only remaining combat aircraft flown by the WLiOP were the [[MiG-29]] and the [[Su-22]]. As of 2010, the fleet of Su-22s is in need of modernization to retain any value as a combat aircraft and its future is unclear.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rtl.put.poznan.pl/sites/files/WZLnr2Bydgoszcz.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019154220/http://www.rtl.put.poznan.pl/sites/files/WZLnr2Bydgoszcz.pdf |archive-date=2013-10-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C/D]] Block 52+ from the American company Lockheed Martin was chosen as a new multirole fighter for the WLiOP, the first deliveries taking place in November 2006 and continued until 2008 under [[F-16 Fighting Falcon operators#Poland|Peace Sky]] program. As of 2011 the Polish Air Force has three squadrons of F-16s: two stationed at the [[31st Tactical Air Base]] near [[Pozna\u0144]] and the [[10th Tactical Squadron]] at the [[32nd Air Base]] near [[\u0141ask]]. The acquisition of the US F-16 was not without fierce competition from European aerospace companies; the sale was hotly pursued by the French company Dassault, with their [[Mirage 2000]] and by the Swedish company Saab, with the [[JAS 39 Gripen]]. The Polish Block 52+ F-16s are equipped with the latest Pratt and Whitney F-100-229 afterburning turbofan engines, and the avionics suite includes the [[APG-68]](V)9 terrain mapping radar system and the [[ALQ-211]](V)4 electronic warfare suite.  All Polish F-16s can carry modern US precision ordnance, ranging from the JDAM/JSOW to the latest in export-certificate-authorized air-to-air weaponry (including the [[AIM-120C|AIM-120C-5]] and [[AIM-9X]]).\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|presidential Tu-154 crash]] in 2010 and later Polish-led investigation, the [[36th Special Aviation Regiment]], responsible for transporting the President and the Polish Government, was disbanded, while the defense minister resigned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/08/04/polish-air-force-unit-disbanded-due-to-2010-crash/|title=Polish Air Force Unit Disbanded Due to 2010 Crash|work=Fox News|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125142551/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/08/04/polish-air-force-unit-disbanded-due-to-2010-crash/|archive-date=25 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.key.aero/view_article.asp?ID=4631&thisSection=military Polish Air Force VIP Unit Formally Disbanded.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810165209/http://www.key.aero/view_article.asp?ID=4631&thisSection=military |date=2016-08-10 }} 4-Jan-2012.</ref> A new unit, the 1st Air Base, replaced the 36th regiment.

The badge is called [[Parachutist badge#Poland|''gapa'']] and represents silver [[eagle]] in flight with gold laurel wreath in the bill. Navigator/Observer badge (below) represents the same eagle, but in gold with added lightning bolts.  It is unlike any other in the other air forces in the world. The gapa was worn in the usual place on the upper left breast above the pocket, but with a chain.  It proudly adorned the uniform of Polish Air Force officers in the RAF during World War II along with their RAF wings. In combat badges (for at least 7 flights in combat conditions) the laurel wreath is green.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0;\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!Badge||Pilot||Observer||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''[[File:POL Wojska Lotnicze.svg|50px]]<br />Air Forces'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Odznaka pilota.jpg|150px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Odznaka nawigatora.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Aviator|Pilot]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Air observer|Observer]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Abbreviation||pil.||obs.||\n|-\n|colspan = 8|\n|}\n\n==Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash, 2010==\n{{main|2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash}}\nOn 10 April 2010, a Polish Air Force [[Tupolev Tu-154M]] aircraft crashed near [[Smolensk]], Russia.

In 2014 it consisted of roughly 16,425 military personnel and about 475 aircraft, distributed among ten bases throughout Poland.\n\nThe Polish Air Force can trace its origins to the months following the end of [[World War I]] in 1918. During the [[invasion of Poland]] by Nazi Germany in 1939, 70% of its aircraft were destroyed. Most pilots, after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on September 17, escaped via Romania and Hungary to continue fighting throughout [[World War II]] in allied air forces, first in France, then in Britain, and later also the Soviet Union.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Polish Air Force}}\n\n===1918\u20131930===\n[[File:The people's war book; history, cyclopaedia and chronology of the great world war (1919) (14779758884).jpg|thumb|left|Polish Air Force fighters]]\nMilitary aviation in free Poland started even before the officially recognised date of regaining independence (11 November 1918). Poland was under German and Austro-Hungarian occupation until [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the armistice]], but the Poles started to take control as the [[Central Powers]] collapsed.  Initially, the Polish air force consisted of mostly German and Austrian aircraft, left by former occupants or captured from them, mostly during the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u201319)|Greater Poland Uprising]]. These planes were first used by the Polish Air Force in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] in late 1918, during combat operations centered around the city of [[Lw\u00f3w]] (now [[Lviv]]).<ref name=\"sp.mil.pl\">[http://www.sp.mil.pl/en/history-of-the-polish-air-force History of the Polish Air Force.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025235752/http://sp.mil.pl/en/history-of-the-polish-air-force |date=2011-10-25 }} ''Polish Air Force Public Affairs Office.''

Most common at that time were light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, among most numerous were French [[Breguet 14]] bombers, German [[LVG C.V]] reconnaissance aircraft, British [[Bristol F2B]] scouts and Italian [[Ansaldo Balilla]] fighters.<ref name=morg242/>\n\nAfter the Polish-Soviet War ended in 1921, most of the worn out World War I aircraft were gradually withdrawn and from 1924 the air force started to be equipped with new French aircraft. In total in 1918-1924 there were 2160 aircraft in the Polish Air Force and naval aviation (not all in operable condition), in which there were 1384 reconnaissance aircraft and 410 fighters.<ref name=morg242>Morga\u0142a (1997), p.242-244</ref> From 1924 to 1930 the primary fighter of the Polish Air Force was the [[SPAD 61]] and its main bombers were the French produced [[Potez 15]] and the [[Potez 25]], which was eventually manufactured in Poland under license from A\u00e9roplanes Henry Potez.\n\nThe first Polish-designed and mass-produced aircraft to serve in the country's air force was a high wing fighter, the [[PWS-10]], first manufactured in 1930 by the Podlasie Aircraft Factory.\n\n===1933\u20131938===\n[[File:Cooper Fauntleroy.jpg|thumb|American volunteers, [[Merian C. Cooper]] and [[Cedric Fauntleroy]], fighting in the Polish Air Force as part of the [[Polish 7th Air Escadrille]], known as the \"Ko\u015bciuszko Squadron\"]]\nIn 1933,  Zygmunt Pulawski's first high wing, all-metal aircraft, the [[PZL P.7]]a, was designed and produced, with 150 entering service. The design was followed by 30 improved [[PZL P.11]]a aircraft and a final design, the [[PZL P.11]]c, was delivered in 1935 and was a respectable fighter for its time; 175 entered service and it remained the only Polish fighter until 1939, by which time foreign aircraft design had overtaken it. Its final version, the [[PZL P.24]], was built for export only and was bought by four countries. A new fighter prototype, the [[PZL.50 Jastrz\u0105b]] (Hawk), similar to the [[Seversky P-35]] in layout, was curtailed by the Nazi invasion and two twin-engine heavy fighters, the [[PZL.38 Wilk]] and the [[PZL.48 Lampart]], remained prototypes.<ref name=\"sp.mil.pl\" />\n\nAs far as bombers are concerned, the Potez 25 and [[Breguet 19]] were replaced by an all-metal monoplane, the [[PZL.23 Kara\u015b]], with 250 built from 1936 onwards, but by 1939 the Karas was outdated. In 1938 the Polish factory PZL designed a modern twin-engine medium bomber, the [[PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b]] (Elk). The \u0141o\u015b had a bomb payload of 2580&nbsp;kg and a top speed of 439&nbsp;km/h. Unfortunately, only about 30 \u0141o\u015b A bombers (single tailfin) and 70 \u0141o\u015b B (twin tailfin) bombers had been delivered before the Nazi invasion.\n\nAs an observation and close reconnaissance plane, Polish [[Squadron (aviation)|''escadres'']] used the slow and easily damaged [[Lublin R-XIII]], and later the [[RWD-14 Czapla]]. Polish naval aviation used the Lublin R-XIII on floats. Just before the war, some Italian torpedo planes, the [[CANT Z.506]], were ordered, but only one was delivered, and it was without armament. The principal aircraft used to train pilots were the Polish-built high-wing [[RWD-8]] and the [[PWS-26]] biplane. In 1939, Poland ordered 160 [[MS-406]]s and 10 [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters from abroad, but they were not delivered before the outbreak of war.\n\n===1939===\n[[File:PZL.43.jpg|thumb|left|A [[PZL.43]] tactical bomber]]\n{{see also|Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign#Polish Air Force{{!}}Polish September Campaign}}\nOn 1 September 1939, at the beginning of the [[invasion of Poland]], all the Polish combat aircraft had been dispersed to secondary airfields, contrary to a commonly-held belief, based on German propaganda, that they had all been destroyed by bombing at their air bases. The aircraft destroyed by German bombers on the airfields were mostly [[trainer (aircraft)|trainers]]. The fighters were grouped into 15 escadres; five of them constituted the [[Pursuit Brigade]], deployed in the [[Warsaw]] area. Despite being obsolete, Polish PZL-11 fighters shot down over 170 German aircraft. The bombers, grouped in nine escadres of the [[Bomber Brigade]], attacked armoured ground columns but suffered heavy losses. Seven reconnaissance- and 12 observation escadres, deployed to particular armies, were used primarily for reconnaissance. Part of the Polish Air Force was destroyed in the campaign; {{citation needed span|the surviving aircraft were either captured or withdrawn to Romania, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia or Sweden, whose air forces subsequently employed these aircraft for their own use (in the case of Romania until 1956)|date=December 2017}}. A great number of pilots and aircrew managed to escape to France and then to Britain, where they played a significant part in the defence of the United Kingdom against Nazi invasion, during the [[Battle of Britain]].\n\n===Strength of Polish Air Force on 1 September 1939===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\"|Aircraft<ref>{{cite book | author=Wac\u0142aw Stachiewicz | title=Wierno\u015bci dochowa\u0107 \u017co\u0142nierskiej | publisher=OW RYTM | year=1998 | isbn=978-83-86678-71-6}}</ref>\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:l center; background:#acc;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left; background:#acc;\"|Variant\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\"|In service\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"|Notes\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\"| [[Military aircraft#Combat aircraft|Combat Aircraft]]\n|-\n|[[PZL P.11]]\n|[[Poland]]\n|Fighter\n|\n|175\n|Combat formations consisted of 140\n|-\n|[[PZL P.7]]\n|Poland\n|Fighter\n|\n|105\n|Combat formations consisted of 30\n|-\n|[[PZL.23 Kara\u015b|PZL.23A]]\n|Poland\n|[[Light bomber]]\n|\n| 35\n| \n|-\n|[[PZL.23 Kara\u015b|PZL.23B]]\n|Poland\n|Light bomber\n|\n|170\n|Combat formations consisted of 120\n|-\n|[[PZL.43]]\n|Poland\n|Light bomber\n|\n|6\n|Combat formations consisted of 6\n|-\n|[[PZL.46 Sum]]\n|Poland\n|Light bomber\n|\n|2\n|Combat formations consisted of 1\n|-\n|[[PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b]]\n|Poland\n|[[Medium bomber]]\n|\n|86\n|Combat formations consisted of 36\n|-\n|[[LWS-6 \u017bubr]]\n|Poland\n|Medium bomber\n|\n|15\n| \n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\"| [[Surveillance aircraft|Surveillance]]\n|-\n|[[Lublin R XIII]]\n|Poland\n|[[Army cooperation aircraft|Spotter]]\n|\n|150\n|Combat formations consisted of 55\n|-\n|[[RWD-14 Czapla]]\n|Poland\n|[[Reconnaissance aircraft|Reconnaissance]]\n|\n|60\n|Combat formations consisted of 40\n|-\n|[[RWD 8]]\n|Poland\n|Reconnaissance\n|\n|550\n|Combat formations consisted of 20\n|-\n|[[PWS-16]]\n|Poland\n|Reconnaissance/trainer\n|\n|15\n|Combat formations consisted of 15\n|}\n\n===1940 (France)===\n{{main|Polish Air Forces in France}}\n[[File:PSP Dywizjon 302.svg|thumb|right|100px|The emblem of the [[No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron]] featuring the designation of the GC I/145, from where most of its initial crew came]]\nAfter the fall of Poland, the Polish Air Force started to regroup in France. The only complete unit created before the German attack on France was the [[I/145 Polish Fighter Squadron|GC I/145 fighter squadron]], flying [[Caudron C.714]] light fighters. It was the only unit operating the C.714 at the time. The Polish pilots were also deployed to various French squadrons, flying on all types of French fighters, but mostly on the [[MS-406]]. After the surrender of France, many of these pilots managed to escape to Britain to continue the fight against the Luftwaffe.\n\n===1940\u20131947 (United Kingdom)===\n{{see also|Polish Air Force in Great Britain}}\n[[File:Polish airforce memorial, St Clements.jpg|thumb|Polish Air Force of France and Great Britain memorial at St. Clements Church in London]]\nFollowing the [[fall of France]] in 1940, Polish units were formed in the United Kingdom, as a part of the [[Royal Air Force]] and known as the Polish Air Force (PAF). Four Polish squadrons were formed: [[Polish 300th Bomber Command|300 Squadron]] and [[No. 301 Polish Bomber Squadron|301 Squadron]] flew bombers, [[No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron|302 Squadron]] and [[Polish 303 Fighter Squadron|303 Squadron]] flew [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters. The two Polish fighter squadrons first saw action in the third phase of the [[Battle of Britain]] in August 1940, with much success; the pilots were battle-hardened and Polish flying skills had been well learned from the [[invasion of Poland]]. The pilots were regarded as fearless, sometimes bordering on reckless. Nevertheless, success rates were very high in comparison to UK and Empire pilots. 303 Squadron became the most efficient RAF fighter squadron at that time. Many Polish pilots also flew individually in other RAF squadrons.\n\nAs [[World War II]] progressed, further Polish squadrons were created in the United Kingdom: [[No. 304 Polish Bomber Squadron]] (bomber, then [[Coastal Command]]), 305 Squadron (bomber), 306 Squadron (fighter), 307 Squadron (night fighter), 308 Squadron (fighter), 309 Squadron (reconnaissance, then fighter), 315 Squadron (fighter), 316 Squadron (fighter), 317 Squadron (fighter), 318 Squadron (fighter-reconnaissance), 663 Squadron (air observation/artillery spotting) and the [[Polish Fighting Team]] also known as the \"Skalski Circus\", attached to [[No. 145 Squadron RAF|145 Squadron RAF]]. The fighter squadrons initially flew Hurricanes, then switched to [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]], and eventually to [[P-51 Mustang|North American Mustang]]s. 307 Squadron, like other [[night fighter]] squadrons (such as [[No. 410 Squadron RCAF|410 Squadron]] Royal Canadian Air Force), flew [[Boulton-Paul Defiant]]s, [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and finally [[de Havilland Mosquito]]es. The bomber squadrons were initially equipped with [[Fairey Battle]]s and [[Vickers Wellington]]s. 300 Squadron was later assigned [[Avro Lancaster]]s, 301 Squadron [[Handley Page Halifax]]es and [[B-24 Liberator|Consolidated Liberators]] and 305 Squadron, [[de Havilland Mosquito]]es and [[B-25 Mitchell|North American Mitchells]]. 663 Squadron (air observation/artillery spotting) flew [[Taylorcraft Auster|Auster]] AOP IIIs and Vs. After the war, all equipment was returned to the British, but only some of the pilots and crews actually returned to Poland, with many settling in the United Kingdom, some of whom returned to Poland in 1989 after the fall of communism.\n\n===1943\u20131945 (Soviet Union)===\n{{see also|Air Force of the Polish Army}}\nAlong with the Polish People's Army (''Ludowe Wojsko Polskie'') in the [[USSR]], the ''Ludowe Lotnictwo Polskie''&nbsp;\u2013 Polish People's Air Force&nbsp;\u2013 was created, in defence of the Soviet Union against Nazi invasion. In late 1943, the 1st Fighter Regiment \"Warszawa\", (equipped with [[Yak-1]] and [[Yak-9]] aircraft), the 2nd Night Bomber Regiment \"Krak\u00f3w\" (flying [[Polikarpov Po-2]] aircraft \u2013 produced in Poland as the [[CSS-13]] from 1949 onwards), and the 3rd Assault Regiment (flying [[Ilyushin Il-2]] aircraft) were formed. During 1944\u20135, further regiments were created, coming together to form the 1st Mixed Air Corps, consisting of a bomber division, an assault division, a fighter division and a mixed division.  After the war, these returned to Poland and gave birth to the air force of the [[People's Republic of Poland]].\n\n===1949\u20131989===\n[[File:Duxford Air Festival 2017 - mig1 (34842016051).jpg|thumb|left|[[MiG-15]] fighter]]\nIn 1949, the [[Li-2]]sb transport aircraft was adapted into a bomber and in 1950, Poland received [[Petlyakov Pe-2]] and [[Tupolev Tu-2]] bombers from the Soviet Union along with [[Tupolev SB-1|USB-1]] and [[Tupolev SB-2|USB-2]] training bombers. In 1950 also, the [[Yak-17]] fighter came into service, as did the [[Ilyushin Il-12]] transport and the [[Yak-18]] trainer. From 1951 onwards, the Polish Air Force was equipped with [[Yak-23]] jet fighters and [[MiG-15]] jets, along with a training version, the [[MiG-15|MiG-15 UTI]], and later, in 1961, the [[MiG-17]].\n\nAs well as Soviet-produced aircraft, from 1952 onwards Soviet MiG-15 and later MiG-17 fighters were produced under licence in Poland as the Lim-1, Lim-2 and later the Lim-5. A domestic ground attack variant of the Lim-5M was developed as the Lim-6bis in 1964. The only jet bomber used by the Polish Air Force during this period was the [[Ilyushin Il-28]], from 1952 onwards. Poland used only a small number of [[MiG-19]]s from 1959, in favour of the [[MiG-21]] from 1963 onwards, which became its main supersonic fighter. This aircraft was used in numerous variants from MiG-21F-13, through MiG-21PF and MF to MiG-21bis. Later, the Polish Air Force received 37 [[MiG-23]]s (1979) and 12 [[MiG-29]]s (1989).\n\nThe main fighter-bomber and ground attack aircraft after 1949 was the [[Ilyushin Il-10|Il-10]] (a training version, the [[Ilyushin Il-10|UIl-10]], entering service in 1951). From 1965 onwards, Poland also used a substantial number of [[Sukhoi Su-7|Su-7Bs]] for bombing and ground attack, replaced with 27 [[Sukhoi Su-20]]s in 1974 and 110 [[Sukhoi Su-22]]s in 1984.\n\nPropeller-driven training aircraft, the [[LWD Junak|Junak-2]] (in service since 1952), the [[LWD Junak|TS-9 Junak-3]] (in service since 1954) and the [[PZL TS-8 Bies]] (since 1958) were later replaced by a jet trainer, the domestically built [[TS-11 Iskra]]. Another Polish jet trainer, the [[PZL I-22 Iryda]], was used for some time but, because of continuing problems, all machines were returned to [[PZL]] for modification and did not resume service. The [[Yak-12]] was used as a multirole aircraft from 1951, the [[An-2]] from 1955 and subsequently the [[PZL-104 Wilga|Wilga-35 P]].\n\nTransport aircraft used by the Polish Air Force during this period included: the [[Ilyushin Il-14|Il-14]] (first in service in 1955), the [[Ilyushin Il-18|Il-18]] (first in service in 1961), the [[An-12]]B (first in service in 1966), the [[An-26]] (first in service in 1972), the [[Yak-40]] (first in service in 1973) and the [[Tupolev Tu-154]]. A number of helicopters were used by the Polish Army: the [[SM-1]] (a [[Mil Mi-1]] manufactured under licence), which was a multirole helicopter, in operation since 1956; the [[Mil Mi-4]], multirole, since 1958; the [[PLZ SM-2]], multirole, since 1960; the [[Mil Mi-2]] and [[Mil Mi-8]] (later also [[Mil Mi-17]]), multirole, since 1968 and the [[Mil Mi-24]], a combat helicopter, since 1976. Also the [[Mil Mi-14]], an amphibious helicopter, and the [[Mil Mi-6]], both used as transports.\n\nIn 1954, the Polish Air Force was merged with the Air Defence Force, creating the Air and Country Air Defence Forces (''Wojska Lotnicze i Obrony Przeciwlotniczej Obszaru Kraju''&nbsp; \u2013 WLiOPL OK), a military organisation composed of both flying and anti-aircraft units. In 1962, the WLiOPL OK were separated back again into their two original component bodies: the Air Force (''Wojska Lotnicze'') and the Country Air Defence Force (''Wojska Obrony Powietrznej Kraju'').\n\n===Since 1990===\n[[File:105 Polish Air Force MiG-29A Fulcrum ILA Berlin 2016 10.jpg|thumb|Polish Air Force [[Mikoyan MiG-29]] at the [[ILA Berlin Air Show]], 2016]]\nAfter political upheaval and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and a consequent reduction in the state of military anxiety in the whole of Europe, the Polish Air Force saw reductions in size. On July 1, 1990, the Polish Air Force and the Air Defence Force were merged again (''Wojska Lotnicze i Obrony Powietrznej''&nbsp;\u2013 WLiOP or WLOP). The attack capability of this force consisted primarily of [[MiG-21]]s, [[MiG-23]]s, [[MiG-29]]s, [[Su-20]]s and [[Su-22]]s. The remaining Lim-6bis were withdrawn in the early 1990s, followed soon afterwards by the withdrawal of the remaining Su-20 aircraft. The small number of remaining MiG-23s were withdrawn by 1999. Throughout the 1990s, Poland had not purchased any new combat aircraft and only managed to acquire further MiG-29s from the Czech Republic in 1995 and from Germany in 2004. MiG-21s were finally withdrawn from service in 2003. In 2004, the only remaining combat aircraft flown by the WLiOP were the [[MiG-29]] and the [[Su-22]]. As of 2010, the fleet of Su-22s is in need of modernization to retain any value as a combat aircraft and its future is unclear.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rtl.put.poznan.pl/sites/files/WZLnr2Bydgoszcz.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019154220/http://www.rtl.put.poznan.pl/sites/files/WZLnr2Bydgoszcz.pdf |archive-date=2013-10-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C/D]] Block 52+ from the American company Lockheed Martin was chosen as a new multirole fighter for the WLiOP, the first deliveries taking place in November 2006 and continued until 2008 under [[F-16 Fighting Falcon operators#Poland|Peace Sky]] program. As of 2011 the Polish Air Force has three squadrons of F-16s: two stationed at the [[31st Tactical Air Base]] near [[Pozna\u0144]] and the [[10th Tactical Squadron]] at the [[32nd Air Base]] near [[\u0141ask]]. The acquisition of the US F-16 was not without fierce competition from European aerospace companies; the sale was hotly pursued by the French company Dassault, with their [[Mirage 2000]] and by the Swedish company Saab, with the [[JAS 39 Gripen]].

All Polish F-16s can carry modern US precision ordnance, ranging from the JDAM/JSOW to the latest in export-certificate-authorized air-to-air weaponry (including the [[AIM-120C|AIM-120C-5]] and [[AIM-9X]]).\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|presidential Tu-154 crash]] in 2010 and later Polish-led investigation, the [[36th Special Aviation Regiment]], responsible for transporting the President and the Polish Government, was disbanded, while the defense minister resigned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/08/04/polish-air-force-unit-disbanded-due-to-2010-crash/|title=Polish Air Force Unit Disbanded Due to 2010 Crash|work=Fox News|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125142551/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/08/04/polish-air-force-unit-disbanded-due-to-2010-crash/|archive-date=25 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.key.aero/view_article.asp?ID=4631&thisSection=military Polish Air Force VIP Unit Formally Disbanded.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810165209/http://www.key.aero/view_article.asp?ID=4631&thisSection=military |date=2016-08-10 }} 4-Jan-2012.</ref> A new unit, the 1st Air Base, replaced the 36th regiment.

Roman. M\u00f6ller, Karl von: 6480BB}}</ref> was an officer, journalist, author and politician from [[Banat]]. He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialism]], and in 1932 he published the antisemitic newspaper \"[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]\" in [[Timi\u0219oara]], an imitation of the German [[Nazi]] publication. He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children.\n\n==Life and early work==\nThe von M\u00f6ller family's origins point to the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania). von M\u00f6ller's grandfather is also allegedly an early developer of the [[Camera]] but didn't submit the patent in time. His father came to Vienna from [[Sibiu]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he moved as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first to the Serbian and then to the Galician front. Von M\u00f6ller led from 1916 as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the [[Order of Leopold]].\n\n== Politician ==\nAfter the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, he left the army as a colonel and went to Timi\u0219oara, where he campaigned for political and cultural equality for Romanian Germans in the field of national politics. von M\u00f6ller was May 9, 1919, co-founded the German-Swabian Cultural Association, whose chairman Johann Junker was. The executive chairman was Michael Kausch. In 1919 M\u00f6ller was elected the second mayor of Timi\u0219oara. From 1919 to 1926 he was a senator in the Romanian upper house in [[Bucharest]], representing Banat Swabia. Karl von M\u00f6ller joined the \"[[Volksgemeinschaft]]\" together with Josef Gabriel in 1920.\n\nFrom 1920 he made trips to Germany, gave lectures in Saxony, Westphalia, Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Thuringia, Berlin and Munich. In 1923 he had contacts with National Socialist circles; he is considered an early supporter of [[Adolf Hitler]]. After his return, he became chief editor of the \"Banat German newspaper\". He was one of the members of the \"German People's Council\".\n\nvon M\u00f6ller is considered one of the pioneers of fascism in the Banat. In 1931 he founded the first Banat local group of the \"National Socialist Self-Help Movement of the Germans in Romania\" (NSDR) in Jimbolia (German: Hatzfeld), which was supported by the ideas of the innovators. Shortly afterwards, M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat in 1932 and founded the National Socialist newspaper \u201cDer St\u00fcrmer\u201d in Timi\u0219oara in the same year. In the spring of 1933, he was deposed again as Gauleiter. In the same year, he served as \"cultural office manager\" in Sibiu the \"job for ideological education and cultural policy\". After his application for admission to the [[Wehrmacht]] had been rejected because he had exceeded the entry age limit, he wrote to [https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schworm Karl Schworm] on September 7, 1939: \"What would I be happy if fate put me at the front, regardless of whether in west or east! I can't think of a better way to end my fighting life than to end up for the leader and the empire. \u201d In 1941 he was appointed the\u201c cultural council \u201dof the German ethnic group in Romania.\n\n== Author ==\nAccording to his biography on the \"Kulturportal West-Ost\", in addition to his political \"von M\u00f6ller\" developed a lively writing activity, which was based on the great novels of [[Adam M\u00fcller-Guttenbrunn]] (1852-1923) and the intellectual and political development of Southeastern Germany, but especially the Banat Swabia, from the settlement until their ethnic awakening at the turn of the 20th century. As editor-in-chief of the 'Banater Deutsche Zeitung', he served the 'Banater Schw\u00e4bische Volksgemeinschaft'.\u201d\n\nvon M\u00f6ller's novels try to give a concrete picture of the respective events from the perspective of their time. He is one of the most popular authors of historical novels of his time, but with a nationalist and anti-Semitic touch. von M\u00f6ller began in the early 1920s with the publication ultranationalist writings. As \"advocate of folk anti-Semitism\" he wrote in his Gazette \"The Striker\". In his two-volume work \"How the Swabian communities came into being\" (Timi\u0219oara 1923\u201324), M\u00f6ller 1924 \"openly expressed his chauvinistic ideas and ideas by incorporating the 'Germanic racial element' (Vol. 2, p. 22) of the German superman into The foreground of his historical statements moved. \n\nIn the novel \u201cDie Werschetzer Tat\u201d (1936) he glorified the defence of Werschetz on the westernmost slope of the Banat Mountains at the time of the last great invasion of the Banat in 1788 by the Turks. Based on historical events, the author illustrates the rural life of German settlers of the first generation in the midst of a colourful mix of people and people. He takes on Nazi ideologies back such. B. The glorification of struggle, peasantry and leader personality, the superiority of the \" Aryan race\", inferiority, moral and physical degradation of the \"foreign people\": The Germans \"must be protected from the teeth of the strange army wolf, who runs up and down the Danube with hanging blood tongues.\"\n\nIn the novel \"Borders Wander: A Banat Roman\" (1937) von M\u00f6ller describes his life and customs of the Banat Swabians from the turn of the century about the First World War and the resulting tripartite division of the Banat in 1920 using the example of the predominantly German-inhabited place Jimbolia. The place fell to Yugoslavia after 1918 and to Romania in 1924 in exchange for Ja\u0161a Tomi\u0107. As in \"The Werschetzer act\" must also in this novel the \"Aryan\" hero \"against their racial opponent\" claim.\n\nIn the novel \"Die Salpeterer: A Freedom Struggle by German Peasants\" (1938) M\u00f6ller describes the struggle for freedom of the Hotzenwald Salpeterer in the Black Forest against the Prince-Bishop of St. Blasien and their eventual banishment to the Banat. He describes their homesickness and defiance against the injustice suffered from their point of view and only allows them to become \"real Banat farmers\" after generations. \n\nvon M\u00f6ller was very active as a writer in his last years. Above all, he published in the [[Eher-Verlag]] of the [[NSDAP]].\n\nOn October 11, 1941, the author's 65th birthday, [[Hitler_cabinet|Reich Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] expressed his thanks to the nation.\n\n==Military career==\n\nAfter graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in [[Vienna]], he was appointed as a senior state officer{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and served in several garrisons. In 1913 he was transferred to [[Timi\u0219oara]] where he served in the 34th Infantry Division during the 1914 campaigns in Serbia and Galicia. He was then transferred to the headquarters in Vienna. In 1916, he was promoted from [[Oberstleutnant|Lieutenant Colonel]] to Commander of the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary. Under his command, the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary fought on the eastern front, and M\u00f6ller was subsequently promoted to [[Oberst|Colonel]]. At the end of the war, the regiment suppressed the uprising of the Republicans in [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]) after which it was put in reserve by the K\u00e1rolyi government.<ref>[http://hatzfeld-banat.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id = 9 & Itemid = 19 Hatzfelder Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten-Schrifsteller]</ref>\n\n==Political career in Romania==\n\nPost [[World War I]], M\u00f6ller decided to stay back in Timi\u0219oara, where he joined the German Popular Movement of Banat (''Bewegung des Banater Deutschtums''), bolstering its struggle for self-affirmation. He forayed into the cultural field as a journalist{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and later became active in politics.

He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialism]], and in 1932 he published the antisemitic newspaper \"[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]\" in [[Timi\u0219oara]], an imitation of the German [[Nazi]] publication. He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children.\n\n==Life and early work==\nThe von M\u00f6ller family's origins point to the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania). von M\u00f6ller's grandfather is also allegedly an early developer of the [[Camera]] but didn't submit the patent in time. His father came to Vienna from [[Sibiu]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he moved as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first to the Serbian and then to the Galician front. Von M\u00f6ller led from 1916 as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the [[Order of Leopold]].\n\n== Politician ==\nAfter the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, he left the army as a colonel and went to Timi\u0219oara, where he campaigned for political and cultural equality for Romanian Germans in the field of national politics. von M\u00f6ller was May 9, 1919, co-founded the German-Swabian Cultural Association, whose chairman Johann Junker was. The executive chairman was Michael Kausch. In 1919 M\u00f6ller was elected the second mayor of Timi\u0219oara. From 1919 to 1926 he was a senator in the Romanian upper house in [[Bucharest]], representing Banat Swabia. Karl von M\u00f6ller joined the \"[[Volksgemeinschaft]]\" together with Josef Gabriel in 1920.\n\nFrom 1920 he made trips to Germany, gave lectures in Saxony, Westphalia, Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Thuringia, Berlin and Munich. In 1923 he had contacts with National Socialist circles; he is considered an early supporter of [[Adolf Hitler]]. After his return, he became chief editor of the \"Banat German newspaper\". He was one of the members of the \"German People's Council\".\n\nvon M\u00f6ller is considered one of the pioneers of fascism in the Banat. In 1931 he founded the first Banat local group of the \"National Socialist Self-Help Movement of the Germans in Romania\" (NSDR) in Jimbolia (German: Hatzfeld), which was supported by the ideas of the innovators. Shortly afterwards, M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat in 1932 and founded the National Socialist newspaper \u201cDer St\u00fcrmer\u201d in Timi\u0219oara in the same year. In the spring of 1933, he was deposed again as Gauleiter. In the same year, he served as \"cultural office manager\" in Sibiu the \"job for ideological education and cultural policy\". After his application for admission to the [[Wehrmacht]] had been rejected because he had exceeded the entry age limit, he wrote to [https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schworm Karl Schworm] on September 7, 1939: \"What would I be happy if fate put me at the front, regardless of whether in west or east! I can't think of a better way to end my fighting life than to end up for the leader and the empire. \u201d In 1941 he was appointed the\u201c cultural council \u201dof the German ethnic group in Romania.\n\n== Author ==\nAccording to his biography on the \"Kulturportal West-Ost\", in addition to his political \"von M\u00f6ller\" developed a lively writing activity, which was based on the great novels of [[Adam M\u00fcller-Guttenbrunn]] (1852-1923) and the intellectual and political development of Southeastern Germany, but especially the Banat Swabia, from the settlement until their ethnic awakening at the turn of the 20th century. As editor-in-chief of the 'Banater Deutsche Zeitung', he served the 'Banater Schw\u00e4bische Volksgemeinschaft'.\u201d\n\nvon M\u00f6ller's novels try to give a concrete picture of the respective events from the perspective of their time. He is one of the most popular authors of historical novels of his time, but with a nationalist and anti-Semitic touch. von M\u00f6ller began in the early 1920s with the publication ultranationalist writings. As \"advocate of folk anti-Semitism\" he wrote in his Gazette \"The Striker\". In his two-volume work \"How the Swabian communities came into being\" (Timi\u0219oara 1923\u201324), M\u00f6ller 1924 \"openly expressed his chauvinistic ideas and ideas by incorporating the 'Germanic racial element' (Vol. 2, p. 22) of the German superman into The foreground of his historical statements moved. \n\nIn the novel \u201cDie Werschetzer Tat\u201d (1936) he glorified the defence of Werschetz on the westernmost slope of the Banat Mountains at the time of the last great invasion of the Banat in 1788 by the Turks. Based on historical events, the author illustrates the rural life of German settlers of the first generation in the midst of a colourful mix of people and people. He takes on Nazi ideologies back such. B. The glorification of struggle, peasantry and leader personality, the superiority of the \" Aryan race\", inferiority, moral and physical degradation of the \"foreign people\": The Germans \"must be protected from the teeth of the strange army wolf, who runs up and down the Danube with hanging blood tongues.\"\n\nIn the novel \"Borders Wander: A Banat Roman\" (1937) von M\u00f6ller describes his life and customs of the Banat Swabians from the turn of the century about the First World War and the resulting tripartite division of the Banat in 1920 using the example of the predominantly German-inhabited place Jimbolia. The place fell to Yugoslavia after 1918 and to Romania in 1924 in exchange for Ja\u0161a Tomi\u0107. As in \"The Werschetzer act\" must also in this novel the \"Aryan\" hero \"against their racial opponent\" claim.\n\nIn the novel \"Die Salpeterer: A Freedom Struggle by German Peasants\" (1938) M\u00f6ller describes the struggle for freedom of the Hotzenwald Salpeterer in the Black Forest against the Prince-Bishop of St. Blasien and their eventual banishment to the Banat. He describes their homesickness and defiance against the injustice suffered from their point of view and only allows them to become \"real Banat farmers\" after generations. \n\nvon M\u00f6ller was very active as a writer in his last years. Above all, he published in the [[Eher-Verlag]] of the [[NSDAP]].\n\nOn October 11, 1941, the author's 65th birthday, [[Hitler_cabinet|Reich Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] expressed his thanks to the nation.\n\n==Military career==\n\nAfter graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in [[Vienna]], he was appointed as a senior state officer{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and served in several garrisons. In 1913 he was transferred to [[Timi\u0219oara]] where he served in the 34th Infantry Division during the 1914 campaigns in Serbia and Galicia. He was then transferred to the headquarters in Vienna. In 1916, he was promoted from [[Oberstleutnant|Lieutenant Colonel]] to Commander of the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary. Under his command, the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary fought on the eastern front, and M\u00f6ller was subsequently promoted to [[Oberst|Colonel]]. At the end of the war, the regiment suppressed the uprising of the Republicans in [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]) after which it was put in reserve by the K\u00e1rolyi government.<ref>[http://hatzfeld-banat.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id = 9 & Itemid = 19 Hatzfelder Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten-Schrifsteller]</ref>\n\n==Political career in Romania==\n\nPost [[World War I]], M\u00f6ller decided to stay back in Timi\u0219oara, where he joined the German Popular Movement of Banat (''Bewegung des Banater Deutschtums''), bolstering its struggle for self-affirmation.

The contest started in 1996 with 19 schools and increased to 74 schools in 1999. The number of participating students also increased from 278 to 1,200 in the same period. The National Maths Contest has gained fame as a competitive and challenging mathematics exam that prepares students for the [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcCQZBH3vIo | title=National Math contest | publisher=[[NTV (Kenya)|NTV Kenya]]| accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> The school also hosts a Science Congress and Aviation Symposium annually.\n\n===Admission===\nThe school is highly selective, with only the top performing students in the [[Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]] offered admission. Once offered admission, students must submit a letter of introduction from either the chief of their area, the pastor or father in charge of their parish/mission and a letter from their primary school headmaster. This is to ensure only disciplined students are admitted to maintain the standards of the school.\n\nThere has been controversy in the past where powerful politicians secure a place for their children though they did not perform well. In 2001, the students went on strike to protest the forced transfer of Principal Paul Agali Otula after he refused to admit the son of a government official.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The school admits students from both public and private schools in a quota system to ensure that top students from every county are admitted. The school applies an affirmative action policy to ensure marginalized students from hardship semi-arid areas are given a chance.\n\n===Departments===\nThe Heads of Departments (H.O.D) are appointed by the Teachers Service Commission. \nThe ten departments are as follows: \n*Science Department\n*Humanities Department\n*Geography Department\n*Department of Technical Subjects\n*Mathematics Department\n*Business Education Department\n*Languages Department\n*Clubs Department\n*Boarding\n*Guidance and Counselling Department\n\n==Aviation==\nMang'u High School is the first school in Kenya to introduce Aviation Technology as an examination subject. In 1961, Michael Stimac started the Amateur Radio Club, Electronics Club and Air Program.\n\nThe Aviation Technology program is focused on technical skills such as propulsion, thermodynamics, meteorology. The Aviation students undertake most of their studies at [[Wilson Airport (Kenya)|Wilson Airport]] and Moi Air Force Base in Embakasi. The original [[Schweizer Aircraft]] glider N3909A used by the Marianist Brothers for Aviation training crashed. It is moved to the workshop as a memorial and is used for educational purposes only. The school acquired a [[Beechcraft Queen Air]] 5Y-MHS twin engined light aircraft. The [[Kenya Air Force]] assists with repairs of the aircraft and training. The school received a lot of materials, tools and teaching aids from various airlines such as [[Kenya Airways]], [[Airkenya Express]], [[CMC Aviation]], Aviation Luxeken and [[British Airways]]. Kenya School of Flying used to give scholarships during the last two years of High School to the students. Some students have proceeded to join the [[Kenya Air Force]] while others have studied [[aeronautical engineering]] at American, British and Russian universities.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nPossessing an athletic program over 50 years old, Mangu offers its students the opportunity to play in several sports and possesses teams that compete in tournaments of the following sports:\n\n*[[Basketball]] ('Panthers')\n*[[Soccer]] ('Bisons')\n*[[Handball]](Buccaneers)\n*[[Rugby football|Rugby]] ('Wazimba')\n*[[Tennis]](Sonics)\n*[[Volleyball]]\n*[[Hockey]]('Vipers')\n*[[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]]('Pirranhas')\n*[[Two tennis courts]]('sonics')\n\n==Clubs and Societies==\nMang'u high provides a wide array of clubs to develop individual student interest and abilities. The clubs invite and visit other schools for various functions pertaining to their societies. The school administration has given the clubs full support in their endeavors. For every club, there is a patron who acts as a consultant. The school has many clubs including Law,Debate, Drama, Music, Scouts, Christian Union, Seventh Day Adventist, Engineering, Science, Aviation, French, German and Computer clubs. Students appoint their own officials and raise their own funds which are held in the Bursar office (not any more).\n\nRecently the Journalism and Chess Clubs were suspended. The school also has a German exchange program.\n\n==School Anthem==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Kiswahili\n!English Translation\n|-\n|<poem>\nMungu Ibariki Mang'u High\nIbariki viongozi wake\nKatika michezo masomo\nMang'u High tuwe washindi\nMang'u High na watu wake\n\nIbariki, Mang'u High (Hai)\nIbariki, Mang'u High (Hai)\n\nIbariki, Mang'u High (Hai)\nMang'u High na watu wake\nMang'u High tuwe washindi\n</poem>\n\n|<poem>All-Mighty God, bless Mangu (High School)\nBless her leaders\nIn sports and in education\nMangu High (School), so that we will always be the winners / leaders\nMangu High (School) together with her people\n\nBless Mangu High / Life (School) \nBless Mangu High / Life (School)\n\nBless Mangu High / Life (School) \nMangu High (School) together with her people\nMangu High (School), so that we will always be the winners / leaders\n</poem>\n|}\n\nThe melody is adopted from [[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]] (meaning 'God bless Africa') which is also used in the national anthem of Tanzania [[Mungu Ibariki Afrika]]. The words ''Mungu'' and ''ibariki'' are taken directly from the Kiswahili translation of [[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]] which is the Tanzanian national anthem. The original [[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika#Lyrics|lyrics]] in the [[Xhosa language]] have the words ''rise high up'' and ''descend oh [[Holy Spirit]]'' which reflect the spirit and [[Mang'u High School#School Emblem|emblem]] of Mangu High School.\n\n==School Emblem==\nThe school emblem features a dove with wide spread wing to symbolize the [[Holy Spirit]] descending on [[Pentecost]]. The emblem traces the history of the Roman Catholic order of priests known as the [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] or [[Spiritans]]. The shield demonstrates the readiness to defend one's principles. The emblem also contains the school's motto ''Jishinde Ushinde''.\n\n==School Motto==\n''Jishinde Ushinde'' is a Kiswahili phrase meaning ''conquer yourself so that you may conquer the world around you''. The motto reminds the students that the greatest competition that should be waged is against one's own self (laziness, greed and selfishness) and not against other persons.\n\n==School Name==\nThe name ''Mang'u'' is a [[Maasai language|Maasai]] word that was adopted into the [[Kikuyu language]] when the [[A-Gikuyu]] people settled in [[Mang'u]] village between [[Thika]] and [[Gatundu]] in Kenya where the school was located before 1972. The actual Kikuyu pronunciation extends the 'a' sound to be closer to ''maang'u''.\n\nAccording to Brother Ken Thompson who taught English for 15 years at Mang'u High School, ''mang'u'' is a [[Maasai language|Maasai]] word meaning ''that's not me you smell''. Bro. Ken is reported to have said that when the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] hunted lions in the tall grass, they would shout \"''mang'u, mang'u''\" to inform their fellow hunters of the situation.\n\nThe difference in the spellings ''Mangu'' and ''Mang'u'' arises from the use of the apostrophe ''ng''' in the written forms of Kenyan languages to differentiate between ''ng'' as in ''bang'', ''hang'' and ''sing'' from ''ng'' as used in ''mango'', ''anger'' and ''hunger''.\n\nIn most formal documents and newspapers, the headlines and headings use the full name as [[Mangu High School]] without the apostrophe. Within the text of most sports articles and websites, the single name [[Mang'u]] appears with an apostrophe. Some confusion occurs whenever the word ''Mangu'' is presented without either the apostrophe or the phrase ''High School''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mang'ulogo.jpg|Logo\nFile:Mang'uhigh.jpg|Mang'u High School\nFile:Mang'u students.jpeg|New Students\nFile:Mang'uplane.jpg|Beechcraft Queen Air 5Y-MHS\nFile:Mang'uchapel.jpg|Chapel\nFile:Kenyaschoolrugby.jpg|[[Rift Valley Academy]] take on Mang'u High School's [[Wazimba]] in a Prescott Cup game\nFile:Mang'u Swimming Pool.jpg|Swimming Pool\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Maurice Michael Otunga|Servant of God Maurice Michael Otunga]] (1923 - 2003), Cardinal and [[Archbishop]] emeritus of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi|Nairobi]] and Military Ordinary emeritus for Kenya.\n*[[Mwai Kibaki|His Excellency Emilio Mwai Kibaki]] (born 1931), 3rd [[Heads of State of Kenya|President of Kenya]]\n*[[Moody Awori|Hon.

Mang'u High School is ranked among the top schools nationwide in [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/541954/-/u32byw/-/index.html | title=Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) results | publisher=Daily Nation | date=4 March 2009 | accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> and has many eminent alumni including one [[Heads of State of Kenya|Kenyan president]], several [[Vice-President of Kenya|vice presidents]], [[Patrick Ngugi Njoroge|Central Bank of Kenya governor]] and a former [[Maurice Michael Otunga|Cardinal]].\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Campus==\nThe school admits bright students from financially challenged backgrounds which led to a shortfall of available funds for development. However, the school has obtained additional funding from the government.\n\nIn June 2011, the school was hit by a storm that damaged the kitchen and dining hall, knocking out the power supply for some time.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDBWVtzqZZE | title=Mangu High hit by storm | publisher=[[NTV (Kenya)|NTV Kenya]] | accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Kenya Airways]] offered to pay the full amount for 40 computers to set up two computer labs: one for all students and one specifically for the Aviation Technology program.\n\nOn 16 May 2011, The French ambassador to Kenya, Etienne de Poncins and the Ministry of Education, launched a French Language Resource Centre at [[Mang\u2019u High School]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ambafrance-ke.org/spip.php?article2169 | title=Launch of French Language Resource Centre at Mang'u High School | publisher=French Embassy in Nairobi | date=16 May 2011 | accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe School is also leading in the effort to go green by using [[Biogas|Biogas energy]]. Effluent from the institutions are collected in three different digester tanks and then piped over 3&nbsp;km to the gas chamber where the gas is collected. It is then used to power a generator that is used in the school.\n\nFacilities include\n*one volleyball court\n*two rugby pitches\n*three basketball courts\n*one football pitch\n*one hockey pitch\n*no athletics track \n*one swimming pool\n*one table tennis \n*one handball field\n*sixteen dormitories (Ronald Ngala, Schneider, Kimathi, Kenyatta, Tom Mboya, FR.Edwards, Old Boys, Cardinal Otunga, Arch.

The contest started in 1996 with 19 schools and increased to 74 schools in 1999. The number of participating students also increased from 278 to 1,200 in the same period. The National Maths Contest has gained fame as a competitive and challenging mathematics exam that prepares students for the [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcCQZBH3vIo | title=National Math contest | publisher=[[NTV (Kenya)|NTV Kenya]]| accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> The school also hosts a Science Congress and Aviation Symposium annually.\n\n===Admission===\nThe school is highly selective, with only the top performing students in the [[Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]] offered admission. Once offered admission, students must submit a letter of introduction from either the chief of their area, the pastor or father in charge of their parish/mission and a letter from their primary school headmaster. This is to ensure only disciplined students are admitted to maintain the standards of the school.\n\nThere has been controversy in the past where powerful politicians secure a place for their children though they did not perform well. In 2001, the students went on strike to protest the forced transfer of Principal Paul Agali Otula after he refused to admit the son of a government official.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The school admits students from both public and private schools in a quota system to ensure that top students from every county are admitted. The school applies an affirmative action policy to ensure marginalized students from hardship semi-arid areas are given a chance.\n\n===Departments===\nThe Heads of Departments (H.O.D) are appointed by the Teachers Service Commission. \nThe ten departments are as follows: \n*Science Department\n*Humanities Department\n*Geography Department\n*Department of Technical Subjects\n*Mathematics Department\n*Business Education Department\n*Languages Department\n*Clubs Department\n*Boarding\n*Guidance and Counselling Department\n\n==Aviation==\nMang'u High School is the first school in Kenya to introduce Aviation Technology as an examination subject. In 1961, Michael Stimac started the Amateur Radio Club, Electronics Club and Air Program.\n\nThe Aviation Technology program is focused on technical skills such as propulsion, thermodynamics, meteorology. The Aviation students undertake most of their studies at [[Wilson Airport (Kenya)|Wilson Airport]] and Moi Air Force Base in Embakasi. The original [[Schweizer Aircraft]] glider N3909A used by the Marianist Brothers for Aviation training crashed. It is moved to the workshop as a memorial and is used for educational purposes only. The school acquired a [[Beechcraft Queen Air]] 5Y-MHS twin engined light aircraft. The [[Kenya Air Force]] assists with repairs of the aircraft and training. The school received a lot of materials, tools and teaching aids from various airlines such as [[Kenya Airways]], [[Airkenya Express]], [[CMC Aviation]], Aviation Luxeken and [[British Airways]]. Kenya School of Flying used to give scholarships during the last two years of High School to the students. Some students have proceeded to join the [[Kenya Air Force]] while others have studied [[aeronautical engineering]] at American, British and Russian universities.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nPossessing an athletic program over 50 years old, Mangu offers its students the opportunity to play in several sports and possesses teams that compete in tournaments of the following sports:\n\n*[[Basketball]] ('Panthers')\n*[[Soccer]] ('Bisons')\n*[[Handball]](Buccaneers)\n*[[Rugby football|Rugby]] ('Wazimba')\n*[[Tennis]](Sonics)\n*[[Volleyball]]\n*[[Hockey]]('Vipers')\n*[[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]]('Pirranhas')\n*[[Two tennis courts]]('sonics')\n\n==Clubs and Societies==\nMang'u high provides a wide array of clubs to develop individual student interest and abilities. The clubs invite and visit other schools for various functions pertaining to their societies. The school administration has given the clubs full support in their endeavors. For every club, there is a patron who acts as a consultant. The school has many clubs including Law,Debate, Drama, Music, Scouts, Christian Union, Seventh Day Adventist, Engineering, Science, Aviation, French, German and Computer clubs. Students appoint their own officials and raise their own funds which are held in the Bursar office (not any more).\n\nRecently the Journalism and Chess Clubs were suspended. The school also has a German exchange program.\n\n==School Anthem==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Kiswahili\n!English Translation\n|-\n|<poem>\nMungu Ibariki Mang'u High\nIbariki viongozi wake\nKatika michezo masomo\nMang'u High tuwe washindi\nMang'u High na watu wake\n\nIbariki, Mang'u High (Hai)\nIbariki, Mang'u High (Hai)\n\nIbariki, Mang'u High (Hai)\nMang'u High na watu wake\nMang'u High tuwe washindi\n</poem>\n\n|<poem>All-Mighty God, bless Mangu (High School)\nBless her leaders\nIn sports and in education\nMangu High (School), so that we will always be the winners / leaders\nMangu High (School) together with her people\n\nBless Mangu High / Life (School) \nBless Mangu High / Life (School)\n\nBless Mangu High / Life (School) \nMangu High (School) together with her people\nMangu High (School), so that we will always be the winners / leaders\n</poem>\n|}\n\nThe melody is adopted from [[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]] (meaning 'God bless Africa') which is also used in the national anthem of Tanzania [[Mungu Ibariki Afrika]]. The words ''Mungu'' and ''ibariki'' are taken directly from the Kiswahili translation of [[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]] which is the Tanzanian national anthem. The original [[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika#Lyrics|lyrics]] in the [[Xhosa language]] have the words ''rise high up'' and ''descend oh [[Holy Spirit]]'' which reflect the spirit and [[Mang'u High School#School Emblem|emblem]] of Mangu High School.\n\n==School Emblem==\nThe school emblem features a dove with wide spread wing to symbolize the [[Holy Spirit]] descending on [[Pentecost]]. The emblem traces the history of the Roman Catholic order of priests known as the [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] or [[Spiritans]]. The shield demonstrates the readiness to defend one's principles. The emblem also contains the school's motto ''Jishinde Ushinde''.\n\n==School Motto==\n''Jishinde Ushinde'' is a Kiswahili phrase meaning ''conquer yourself so that you may conquer the world around you''. The motto reminds the students that the greatest competition that should be waged is against one's own self (laziness, greed and selfishness) and not against other persons.\n\n==School Name==\nThe name ''Mang'u'' is a [[Maasai language|Maasai]] word that was adopted into the [[Kikuyu language]] when the [[A-Gikuyu]] people settled in [[Mang'u]] village between [[Thika]] and [[Gatundu]] in Kenya where the school was located before 1972. The actual Kikuyu pronunciation extends the 'a' sound to be closer to ''maang'u''.\n\nAccording to Brother Ken Thompson who taught English for 15 years at Mang'u High School, ''mang'u'' is a [[Maasai language|Maasai]] word meaning ''that's not me you smell''. Bro. Ken is reported to have said that when the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] hunted lions in the tall grass, they would shout \"''mang'u, mang'u''\" to inform their fellow hunters of the situation.\n\nThe difference in the spellings ''Mangu'' and ''Mang'u'' arises from the use of the apostrophe ''ng''' in the written forms of Kenyan languages to differentiate between ''ng'' as in ''bang'', ''hang'' and ''sing'' from ''ng'' as used in ''mango'', ''anger'' and ''hunger''.\n\nIn most formal documents and newspapers, the headlines and headings use the full name as [[Mangu High School]] without the apostrophe. Within the text of most sports articles and websites, the single name [[Mang'u]] appears with an apostrophe. Some confusion occurs whenever the word ''Mangu'' is presented without either the apostrophe or the phrase ''High School''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mang'ulogo.jpg|Logo\nFile:Mang'uhigh.jpg|Mang'u High School\nFile:Mang'u students.jpeg|New Students\nFile:Mang'uplane.jpg|Beechcraft Queen Air 5Y-MHS\nFile:Mang'uchapel.jpg|Chapel\nFile:Kenyaschoolrugby.jpg|[[Rift Valley Academy]] take on Mang'u High School's [[Wazimba]] in a Prescott Cup game\nFile:Mang'u Swimming Pool.jpg|Swimming Pool\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Maurice Michael Otunga|Servant of God Maurice Michael Otunga]] (1923 - 2003), Cardinal and [[Archbishop]] emeritus of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi|Nairobi]] and Military Ordinary emeritus for Kenya.\n*[[Mwai Kibaki|His Excellency Emilio Mwai Kibaki]] (born 1931), 3rd [[Heads of State of Kenya|President of Kenya]]\n*[[Moody Awori|Hon.
