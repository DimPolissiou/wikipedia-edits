It served in [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|West Virginia]] before being transferred to the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]].\n\n==Initial Infantry Service==\nThe 17th Indiana was organized at [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], and mustered in June 12, 1861. It left the state for [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]], on July 1, 1861, and was subsequently attached to the District of the Kanawha until September, 1861. Cheat Mountain District, W. Va., to November, 1861. Governor Oliver P. Morton appointed [[John T. Wilder]] as the lieutenant colonel of the 17th Indiana Infantry Regiment three months after the regiment was organized. On March 2, 1862, Wilder became the regiment's colonel, replacing [[Milo Hascall]], who became a general.\n\n==Conversion to Mounted Infantry ==\n\nIn December 1862, the regiments colonel, [[John T. Wilder]] was promoted to command of the 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, Center, [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], [[Army of the Cumberland]]. After fruitless attempts to chase down rebel cavalry raiders on foot, the brigade was converted to mounted infantry. At the same time, Wilder proposed to the regiments in the brigade the private purchase of repeating rifles. The regiment voted to go ahead with the conversion to mounted infantry and the purchase of the rifles. Along with the other regiments in the brigade, the 17th chose  [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], as their weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 17th was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\nAfter intense training and development of new tactics, the \"Lightning Brigade\" was ready for service.

The 17th drove the enemy before it along the seven mile length of the gap until they were halted by four brigades of infantry and four batteries of guns at the southeastern exit. The massive superiority of firepower the 17th and its brethren had with the Spencers allowed them to entrench and hold the southern entrance against numerous assaults by numerically superior rebel infantry and artillery through the rainy day until the sodden remainder of the XIV Corps slogged to join them at their position.\n\nWith the Lightning Brigade, the 17th found itself detached from the XIV Corps to serve as a mobile reserve for all three of the Corps within the Cumberland. After playing a key role in the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|feint]] that forced Bragg from Chattanooga, the regiment raided, skirmished, and scouted through the summer into the [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. The brigade distinguished itself with its performance at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]. During the battle, it maintained integrity and discipline exacting high casualties on its attackers. After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. \n\nThe performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended. During the reorganization after Grant took command in the city, the brigade was broken up and the regiments were transferred to the Cavalry Corps. The 17th and the [[98th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|98th Illinois Mounted Infantry]] were assigned to 2nd Brigade under Colonel [[Eli Long]] of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps under Major General [[George Crook]].\n\nOn 1 October, the 17th joined the rest of the Cavalry Corps operating against [[Joseph Wheeler|Wheeler]]'s rebel cavalry, then in the [[Sequatchie Valley]]. On 3 October in a night attack at Thompson's Cove, the regiment routed the 2nd Brigade of Kelly's Division, capturing a number of arms and the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry's colors The next day it drove more elements of Wheeler's horsemen out of McMinnville. Regaining contact with the enemy on 7 October beyond Shelbyville, the 17th drove the enemy from the field and into Parmington. When the rebels attempted to make a stand, the regiment charged and took three of Wheeler's guns, a great number of small arms, and 300 prisoners. \nThe regiment regrouped with the 998th Illinois in Huntsville, AL until 13 October, when it started in pursuit of enemy cavalry again.\n\n==Service History==\n\nIts assignments are as follows:\n* 15th Brigade, Army of the Ohio, to January, 1862. \n* 15th Brigade, 4th Division, [[Army of the Ohio]], January, 1862. \n* 15th Brigade, 6th Division, Army of the Ohio, to September, 1862. \n* 15th Brigade, 6th Division, 2nd Corps, Army of the Ohio, to November, 1862. \n* 1st Brigade, 1st Division, Left Wing 14th Army Corps, Army of the Cumberland, to December, 1862. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division (Center), 14th Army Corps, to January, 1863. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, 14th Army Corps, to June, 1863. \n* 1st Brigade, 4th Division, 14th Army Corps, to October, 1863. \n* Wilder's Mounted Brigade, [[Army of the Cumberland]], to November, 1863. \n* 2nd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, November, 1863. \n* 3rd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to October, 1864. \n* 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, Wilson's Cavalry Corps, Military Division Mississippi, to August, 1865.<ref>[http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unininf2.htm Civil War Archive]</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n{{reflist}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

VVN Music found Patton possesses the widest vocal range of any known singer in popular music, with a range of six octaves.<ref name=\"VVN\"/> He has worked as a producer or co-producer with artists such as [[John Zorn]], [[Sepultura]], [[Melvins]], [[Melt-Banana]], and [[Kool Keith]].

VVN Music found Patton possesses the widest vocal range of any known singer in popular music, with a range of six octaves.<ref name=\"VVN\"/> He has worked as a producer or co-producer with artists such as [[John Zorn]], [[Sepultura]], [[Melvins]], [[Melt-Banana]], and [[Kool Keith]]. He co-founded [[Ipecac Recordings]] with [[Greg Werckman]] in 1999, and has run the label since.

Records]] release.\n\nAccording to Steffan Chirazi's 1993 book ''The Real Story'', Patton first met [[Faith No More]] during 1986. In the book, Patton was quoted as saying:\n{{quote|Faith No More played Eureka in a pizza parlour place Mr. Bungle played dozens of times. There were 6 people there and 3 of them were my friends.

In employment, employers (principal) may use [[piece rates]]/[[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]], [[profit sharing]], [[efficiency wages]], [[performance measurement]] (including [[financial statements]]), the agent posting a bond, or the threat of termination of employment to align worker interests with their own.\n\n==Overview==\nThe principal and agent theory emerged in the 1970s from the combined disciplines of economics and institutional theory. There is some contention as to who originated the theory, with theorists Stephen Ross and Barry Mitnick claiming its authorship.<ref>{{cite web|last = Mitnick|first = Barry M.|date = January 2006 |title = Origin of the Theory of Agency|url =  http://www.pitt.edu/~mitnick/agencytheory/agencytheoryoriginrev11806r.htm}}</ref> Ross is said to have originally described the dilemma in terms of a person choosing a flavor of ice-cream for someone whose tastes he does not know (''Ibid''). The most cited reference to the theory, however, comes from [[Michael C. Jensen]] and William Meckling.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1= Michael C.|first2= William H. |last2=Meckling|date = October 1976|title = Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure|journal= Journal of Financial Economics |volume= 3|issue = 4 |pages = 305\u2013360|url = https://www.sfu.ca/~wainwrig/Econ400/jensen-meckling.pdf|doi= 10.1016/0304-405X(76)90026-X}}</ref> The theory has come to extend well beyond economics or institutional studies to all contexts of [[information asymmetry]], [[uncertainty]] and [[risk]].\n\nIn the context of law, principals do not know enough about whether (or to what extent) a contract has been satisfied, and they end up with [[agency cost]]s. The solution to this information problem\u2014closely related to the [[moral hazard]] problem\u2014is to ensure the provision of appropriate [[incentive]]s so agents act in the way principals wish.\n\nIn terms of [[game theory]], it involves changing the rules of the game so that the self-interested rational choices of the agent coincide with what the principal desires. Even in the limited arena of employment contracts, the difficulty of doing this in practice is reflected in a multitude of compensation mechanisms and supervisory schemes, as well as in critique of such mechanisms as e.g., [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] (1986) expresses in his [[W. Edwards Deming#Seven Deadly Diseases|Seven Deadly Diseases]] of management.\n\n==Employment contract==\nIn the context of the employment contract, individual contracts form a major method of restructuring incentives, by connecting as closely as optimal the information available about employee performance, and the compensation for that performance. Because of differences in the quantity and quality of information available about the performance of individual employees, the ability of employees to bear risk, and the ability of employees to manipulate evaluation methods, the structural details of individual contracts vary widely, including such mechanisms as \"piece rates, [share] options, discretionary bonuses, promotions, profit sharing, efficiency wages, deferred compensation, and so on.\"<ref>\n{{cite journal\n  | last = Pendergast\n  | first = Canice\n  | title = The Provision of Incentives in Firms\n  | journal = Journal of Economic Literature\n  | volume = 37\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 7\u201363\n  | year = 1999\n  | jstor = 2564725\n  | doi=10.1257/jel.37.1.7| citeseerx = 10.1.1.558.6657\n  }}</ref> Typically, these mechanisms are used in the context of different types of employment: salesmen often receive some or all of their remuneration as commission, production workers are usually paid an hourly wage, while office workers are typically paid monthly or semimonthly (and if paid overtime, typically at a higher rate than the hourly rate implied by the salary).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The way in which these mechanisms are used is different in the two parts of the economy which Doeringer and Piore called the \"primary\" and \"secondary\" sectors (see also  [[dual labour market]]).\n\nThe secondary sector is characterised by short-term employment relationships, little or no prospect of internal promotion, and the determination of wages primarily by market forces. In terms of occupations, it consists primarily of low or unskilled jobs, whether they are blue-collar (manual-labour), white-collar (e.g., filing clerks), or service jobs (e.g., waiters). These jobs are linked by the fact that they are characterized by \"low skill levels, low earnings, easy entry, job impermanence, and low returns to education or experience.\" In a number of service jobs, such as food service, golf caddying, and valet parking jobs, workers in some countries are paid mostly or entirely with [[gratuity|tips]].\n\nThe use of tipping is a strategy on the part of the owners or managers to align the interests of the service workers with those of the owners or managers; the service workers have an incentive to provide good customer service (thus benefiting the company's business), because this makes it more likely that they will get a good tip.\n\nThe issue of tipping is sometimes discussed in connection with the principal\u2013agent theory. \"Examples of principals and agents include bosses and employees ... [and] diners and waiters.\" \"The \"principal\u2013agent problem\", as it is known in economics, crops up any time agents aren't inclined to do what principals want them to do. To sway them [(agents)], principals have to make it worth the agents' while ... [in the restaurant context,] the better the diner's experience, the bigger the waiter's tip.\"<ref>Paula Szuchman, Jenny Anderson. ''It's Not You, It's the Dishes (originally published as Spousonomics): How to Minimize Conflict and Maximize Happiness in Your Relationship''. Random House Digital, Inc., June 12, 2012. Page 210. Accessed on May 31, 2013</ref> \"In the ... language of the economist, the tip serves as a way to reduce what is known as the classic \"principal\u2013agent\" problem.\" According to \"Videbeck, a researcher at the New Zealand Institute for the Study of Competition and Regulation[,] '[i]n theory, tipping can lead to an efficient match between workers' attitudes to service and the jobs they perform. It is a means to make people work hard. Friendly waiters will go that extra mile, earn their tip, and earn a relatively high income...[On the other hand,] if tipless wages are sufficiently low, then grumpy waiters might actually choose to leave the industry and take jobs that would better suit their personalities.'\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Only the tip, but size is important |date=December 11, 2004 |work=The Age |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/12/10/1102625528796.html |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nAs a solution to the principal\u2013agent problem, though, tipping is not perfect. In the hopes of getting a larger tip, a server, for example, may be inclined to give a customer an extra large glass of wine or a second scoop of ice cream. While these larger servings make the customer happy and increase the likelihood of the server getting a good tip, they cut into the profit margin of the restaurant. In addition, a server may dote on generous tippers while ignoring other customers, and in rare cases harangue bad tippers.\n\n===Non-financial compensation===\nPart of this variation in incentive structures and supervisory mechanisms may be attributable to variation in the level of intrinsic psychological satisfaction to be had from different types of work. Sociologists and psychologists frequently argue that individuals take a certain degree of pride in their work, and that introducing [[performance-related pay]] can destroy this \"psycho-social compensation\", because the exchange relation between employer and employee becomes much more narrowly economic, destroying most or all of the potential for social exchange. Evidence for this is inconclusive\u2014Deci (1971), and Lepper, Greene and Nisbett (1973) find support for this argument; Staw (1989) suggests other interpretations of the findings.\n\n===Team production===\nOn a related note, Drago and Garvey (1997) use Australian survey data to show that when agents are placed on individual pay-for-performance schemes, they are less likely to help their coworkers. This negative effect is particularly important in those jobs that involve strong elements of \"team production\" ([[Alchian]] and Demsetz 1972), where output reflects the contribution of many individuals, and individual contributions cannot be easily identified, and compensation is therefore based largely on the output of the team. In other words, pay-for-performance increases the incentives to free-ride, as there are large positive externalities to the efforts of an individual team member, and low returns to the individual (Holmstr\u00f6m 1982, McLaughlin 1994).\n\nThe negative incentive effects implied are confirmed by some empirical studies, (e.g., Newhouse, 1973) for shared medical practices; costs rise and doctors work fewer hours as more revenue is shared. Leibowitz and Tollison (1980) find that larger law partnerships typically result in worse cost containment. As a counter, peer pressure can potentially solve the problem (Kandel and Lazear 1992), but this depends on peer monitoring being relatively costless to the individuals doing the monitoring/censuring in any particular instance (unless one brings in social considerations of norms and group identity and so on). Studies suggest that profit-sharing, for example, typically raises productivity by 3\u20135% (Jones and Kato 1995, Knez and Simester 2001), although there are some selection issues (Prendergast).\n\n===Empirical evidence===\nThere is however considerable [[empirical evidence]] of a positive effect of compensation on performance (although the studies usually involve \"simple\" jobs where aggregate measures of performance are available, which is where piece rates should be most effective). In one study, Lazear (1996) saw productivity rising by 44% (and wages by 10%) in a change from salary to piece rates, with a half of the productivity gain due to worker selection effects. Research shows that pay for performance increases performance when the task at hand is more repetitive, and reduces performance when the task at hand requires more creative thinking.<ref>{{cite book |title=Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us |first=Daniel H. |last=Pink |year=2009 |location=New York |publisher=Riverhead Books |isbn=9781594488849 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/drivesurprisingt00pink_0 }}</ref>\n\n* Paarsch and Shearer (1996) also find evidence supportive of incentive and productivity effects from piece rates, as do Banker, Lee, and Potter (1996), although the latter do not distinguish between incentive and worker selection effects.\n* Rutherford, Springer and Yavas (2005) find evidence of agency problems in residential real estate by showing that real estate agents sell their own houses at a price premium of approximately 4.5% compared to their clients' houses.\n* Fernie and Metcalf (1996) find that top British jockeys perform significantly better when offered percentage of prize money for winning races compared to being on fixed retainers.\n* McMillan, Whalley and Zhu (1989) and Groves et al. (1994) look at Chinese agricultural and industrial data respectively and find significant incentive effects.\n* Kahn and Sherer (1990)find that better evaluations of white-collar office workers were achieved by those employees who had a steeper relation between evaluations and pay.\n* Nikkinen and Sahlstr\u00f6m (2004) find empirical evidence that agency theory can be used, at least to some extent, to explain [[financial audit]] fees internationally.\n* There is very little correlation between performance pay of CEOs and the success of the companies they manage.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Performance Pay and Top-Management Incentives |last=Jensen |first=M. C. |last2=Murphy |first2=K. J. |year= }}</ref>\n\n==Contract design==\nMilgrom and Roberts (1992) identify four principles of contract design: When perfect information is not available, Holmstr\u00f6m (1979) developed the '''Informativeness Principle''' to solve this problem. This essentially states that any measure of performance that (on the margin) reveals information about the effort level chosen by the agent should be included in the compensation contract. This includes, for example, Relative Performance Evaluation\u2014measurement relative to other, similar agents, so as to filter out some common background noise factors, such as fluctuations in demand. By removing some exogenous sources of randomness in the agent's income, a greater proportion of the fluctuation in the agent's income falls under his control, increasing his ability to bear risk. If taken advantage of, by greater use of piece rates, this should improve incentives. (In terms of the simple linear model below, this means that increasing ''x'' produces an increase in ''b''.)\n\nHowever, setting incentives as intense as possible is not necessarily optimal from the point of view of the employer. The '''Incentive-Intensity Principle''' states that the optimal intensity of incentives depends on four factors: the incremental profits created by additional effort, the precision with which the desired activities are assessed, the agent's risk tolerance, and the agent's responsiveness to incentives. According to Prendergast (1999, 8), \"the primary constraint on [performance-related pay] is that [its] provision imposes additional risk on workers ...\" A typical result of the early principal\u2013agent literature was that piece rates tend to 100% (of the compensation package) as the worker becomes more able to handle risk, as this ensures that workers fully internalize the consequences of their costly actions. In incentive terms, where we conceive of workers as self-interested rational individuals who provide costly effort (in the most general sense of the worker's input to the firm's production function), the more compensation varies with effort, the better the incentives for the worker to produce.\n\nThe third principle\u2014the '''Monitoring Intensity Principle\u2014'''is complementary to the second, in that situations in which the optimal intensity of incentives is high corresponds highly to situations in which the optimal level of monitoring is also high. Thus employers effectively choose from a \"menu\" of monitoring/incentive intensities. This is because monitoring is a costly means of reducing the variance of employee performance, which makes more difference to profits in the kinds of situations where it is also optimal to make incentives intense.\n\nThe fourth principle is the '''Equal Compensation Principle''', which essentially states that activities equally valued by the employer should be equally valuable (in terms of compensation, including non-financial aspects such as pleasantness of the workplace) to the employee. This relates to the problem that employees may be engaged in several activities, and if some of these are not monitored or are monitored less heavily, these will be neglected, as activities with higher marginal returns to the employee are favoured. This can be thought of as a kind of \"[[disintermediation]]\"\u2014targeting certain measurable variables may cause others to suffer. For example, teachers being rewarded by test scores of their students are likely to tend more towards teaching 'for the test', and de-emphasise less relevant but perhaps equally or more important aspects of education; while [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]'s practice at one time of paying programmers by the number of lines of code written resulted in programs that were longer than necessary\u2014i.e., program efficiency suffering (Prendergast 1999, 21). Following Holmstr\u00f6m and Milgrom (1990) and Baker (1992), this has become known as \"multi-tasking\" (where a subset of relevant tasks is rewarded, non-rewarded tasks suffer relative neglect). Because of this, the more difficult it is to completely specify and measure the variables on which reward is to be conditioned, the less likely that performance-related pay will be used: \"in essence, complex jobs will typically not be evaluated through explicit contracts.\" (Prendergast 1999, 9).\n\nWhere explicit measures are used, they are more likely to be some kind of aggregate measure, for example, baseball and [[American Football]] players are rarely rewarded on the many specific measures available (e.g., number of home runs), but frequently receive bonuses for aggregate performance measures such as Most Valuable Player. The alternative to objective measures is subjective performance evaluation, typically by supervisors. However, there is here a similar effect to \"multi-tasking\", as workers shift effort from that subset of tasks which they consider useful and constructive, to that subset which they think gives the greatest appearance of being useful and constructive, and more generally to try to curry personal favour with supervisors. (One can interpret this as a destruction of organizational [[social capital]]\u2014workers identifying with, and actively working for the benefit of, the firm \u2013 in favour of the creation of personal social capital\u2014the individual-level social relations which enable workers to get ahead (\"networking\").)\n\n===Linear model===\nThe four principles can be summarized in terms of the simplest (linear) model of incentive compensation:\n\n<math display=\"block\">\nw = a + b(e + x + gy) \\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''w'' (wage) is equal to ''a'' (the base salary) plus ''b'' (the intensity of incentives provided to the employee) times the sum of three terms: ''e'' (unobserved employee effort) plus ''x'' (unobserved exogenous effects on outcomes) plus the product of  ''g'' (the weight given to observed exogenous effects on outcomes) and ''y'' (observed exogenous effects on outcomes). ''b'' is the slope of the relationship between compensation and outcomes.\n\n<math display=\"block\">\n\\text{wage} = (\\text{base salary}) \n+ (\\text{incentives})\n\\cdot (\\text{(unobserved) effort} + (\\text{(unobserved) effects}) \n+ (\\text{weight }Y)(\\text{observed exogenous effects}))\n</math>\n\nThe above discussion on explicit measures assumed that contracts would create the linear incentive structures summarised in the model above. But while the combination of normal errors and the absence of income effects yields linear contracts, many observed contracts are nonlinear. To some extent this is due to income effects as workers rise up a tournament/hierarchy: \"Quite simply, it may take more money to induce effort from the rich than from the less well off.\" (Prendergast 1999, 50).  Similarly, the threat of being fired creates a nonlinearity in wages earned versus performance. Moreover, many empirical studies illustrate inefficient behaviour arising from nonlinear objective performance measures, or measures over the course of a long period (e.g., a year), which create nonlinearities in time due to discounting behaviour. This inefficient behaviour arises because incentive structures are varying: for example, when a worker has already exceeded a quota or has no hope of reaching it, versus being close to reaching it\u2014e.g., Healy (1985), Oyer (1997), Leventis (1997). Leventis shows that New York surgeons, penalised for exceeding a certain mortality rate, take less risky cases as they approach the threshold. Courty and Marshke (1997) provide evidence on incentive contracts offered to agencies, which receive bonuses on reaching a quota of graduated trainees within a year. This causes them to 'rush-graduate' trainees in order to make the quota.\n\n===Options framework===\nIn certain cases agency problems may be analysed by applying the techniques developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], as applied via a [[real options]] framework.<ref>[[Aswath Damodaran]]:  [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/lectures/opt.html Applications Of Option Pricing Theory To Equity Valuation] and [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/optequity.pdf Option Pricing Applications in Valuation].</ref><ref>D.

[http://realoptions.org/papers2006/Siller-Pagaza_RO2.pdf  The Impact of Real Options in Agency Problems]</ref> [[Stockholders]] and [[bondholders]] have different objective\u2014for instance, stockholders have an incentive to take riskier projects than bondholders do, and to pay more out in [[dividends]] than bondholders would like. At the same time, since equity may be seen as a [[call option]] on the value of the firm, an increase in the [[variance]] in the firm value, other things remaining equal, will lead to an increase in the value of equity, and stockholders may therefore take risky projects with negative net present values, which while making them better off, may make the bondholders worse off. See [[Business valuation#Option pricing approaches|Option pricing approaches]] under [[Business valuation]] for further discussion. Nagel and Purnanandam (2017) notice that since bank assets are risky debt claims, bank equity resembles a subordinated debt and therefore the stock's payoff is truncated by the difference between the face values of the corporation debt and of the bank deposits.<ref>[S.

One method of setting an absolute objective performance standard\u2014rarely used because it is costly and only appropriate for simple repetitive tasks\u2014is [[time-and-motion studies]], which study in detail how fast it is possible to do a certain task. These have been used constructively in the past, particularly in manufacturing. More generally, however, even within the field of objective performance evaluation, some form of relative performance evaluation must be used. Typically this takes the form of comparing the performance of a worker to that of his peers in the firm or industry, perhaps taking account of different exogenous circumstances affecting that.\n\nThe reason that employees are often paid according to hours of work rather than by direct measurement of results is that it is often more efficient to use indirect systems of controlling the quantity and quality of effort, due to a variety of informational and other issues (e.g., turnover costs, which determine the optimal minimum length of relationship between firm and employee). This means that methods such as deferred compensation and structures such as tournaments are often more suitable to create the incentives for employees to contribute what they can to output over longer periods (years rather than hours). These represent \"pay-for-performance\" systems in a looser, more extended sense, as workers who consistently work harder and better are more likely to be promoted (and usually paid more), compared to the narrow definition of \"pay-for-performance\", such as piece rates. This discussion has been conducted almost entirely for self-interested rational individuals. In practice, however, the incentive mechanisms which successful firms use take account of the socio-cultural context they are embedded in ([[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama]] 1995, Granovetter 1985), in order not to destroy the [[social capital]] they might more constructively mobilise towards building an organic, social organization, with the attendant benefits from such things as \"worker loyalty and pride (...) [which] can be critical to a firm's success ...\" (Sappington 1991,63)\n\n===Subjective performance evaluation===\nSubjectivity is related to judgement based on a supervisor's subjective impressions and opinions, which can be expressed through the use of subjective performance measures, ''ex post'' flexibility in the weighting of objective performance measures, or ''ex post'' discretional adjustment, all of which are based on factors other than performance measures specified ''ex ante''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bicudo de Castro|first=Vincent|date=November 2017|title=Unpacking the notion of subjectivity: Performance evaluation and supervisor discretion|journal=The British Accounting Review|volume=49|issue=6|pages=532\u2013544|doi=10.1016/j.bar.2017.08.003|issn=0890-8389}}</ref> Subjective performance evaluation allows the use of a subtler, more balanced assessment of employee performance, and is typically used for more complex jobs where comprehensive objective measures are difficult to specify and/or measure. Whilst often the only feasible method, the attendant problems with subjective performance evaluation have resulted in a variety of incentive structures and supervisory schemes. One problem, for example, is that supervisors may under-report performance in order to save on wages, if they are in some way residual claimants, or perhaps rewarded on the basis of cost savings. This tendency is of course to some extent offset by the danger of retaliation and/or demotivation of the employee, if the supervisor is responsible for that employee's output.\n\nAnother problem relates to what is known as the \"compression of ratings\". Two related influences\u2014centrality bias, and leniency bias\u2014have been documented (Landy and Farr 1980, Murphy and Cleveland 1991). The former results from supervisors being reluctant to distinguish critically between workers (perhaps for fear of destroying team spirit), while the latter derives from supervisors being averse to offering poor ratings to subordinates, especially where these ratings are used to determine pay, not least because bad evaluations may be demotivating rather than motivating. However, these biases introduce noise into the relationship between pay and effort, reducing the incentive effect of performance-related pay. Milkovich and Wigdor (1991) suggest that this is the reason for the common separation of evaluations and pay, with evaluations primarily used to allocate training.\n\nFinally, while the problem of compression of ratings originates on the supervisor-side, related effects occur when workers actively attempt to influence the appraisals supervisors give, either by influencing the performance information going to the supervisor: multitasking (focussing on the more visibly productive activities\u2014Paul 1992), or by working \"too hard\" to signal worker quality or create a good impression (Holmstr\u00f6m 1982); or by influencing the evaluation of it, e.g., by \"currying influence\" (Milgrom and Roberts 1988) or by outright bribery (Tirole 1992).\n\n==Incentive structures==\n\n===Tournaments===\nMuch of the discussion here has been in terms of individual pay-for-performance contracts; but many large firms use internal labour markets (Doeringer and Piore 1971, Rosen 1982) as a solution to some of the problems outlined. Here, there is \"pay-for-performance\" in a looser sense over a longer time period. There is little variation in pay within grades, and pay increases come with changes in job or job title (Gibbs and Hendricks 1996). The incentive effects of this structure are dealt with in what is known as \"[[tournament theory]]\" (Lazear and Rosen 1981, Green and Stokey (1983), see Rosen (1986) for multi-stage tournaments in hierarchies where it is explained why CEOs are paid many times more than other workers in the firm). See the [[superstar]] article for more information on the tournament theory.\n\nWorkers are motivated to supply effort by the wage increase they would earn if they win a promotion. Some of the extended tournament models predict that relatively weaker agents, be they competing in a sports tournaments (Becker and Huselid 1992, in [[NASCAR]] racing) or in the broiler chicken industry (Knoeber and Thurman 1994), would take risky actions instead of increasing their effort supply as a cheap way to improve the prospects of winning. These actions are inefficient as they increase risk taking without increasing the average effort supplied.\n\nA major problem with tournaments is that individuals are rewarded based on how well they do relative to others. Co-workers might become reluctant to help out others and might even sabotage others' effort instead of increasing their own effort (Lazear 1989, Rob and Zemsky 1997). This is supported empirically by Drago and Garvey (1997). Why then are tournaments so popular? Firstly, because\u2014especially given compression rating problems\u2014it is difficult to determine absolutely differences in worker performance. Tournaments merely require rank order evaluation. Secondly, it reduces the danger of [[rent-seeking]], because bonuses paid to favourite workers are tied to increased responsibilities in new jobs, and supervisors will suffer if they do not promote the most qualified person. Thirdly, where prize structures are (relatively) fixed, it reduces the possibility of the firm reneging on paying wages. As Carmichael (1983) notes, a prize structure represents a degree of commitment, both to absolute and to relative wage levels.  Lastly when the measurement of workers' productivity is difficult, e.g., say monitoring is costly, or when the tasks the workers have to perform for the job is varied in nature, making it hard to measure effort and/or performance, then running tournaments in a firm would encourage the workers to supply effort whereas workers would have shirked if there are no promotions.\n\nTournaments also promote [[risk seeking]] behavior.  In essence, the compensation scheme becomes more\nlike a [[call option]] on performance (which increases in value with increased [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] (cf. [[options pricing]]).\nIf you are one of ten players competing for the asymmetrically large top prize, you may benefit from reducing the expected\nvalue of your overall performance to the firm in order to increase your chance that you have an outstanding performance\n(and win the prize). In moderation this can offset the greater risk aversion of agents vs principals because their social capital is concentrated in their employer while in the case of public companies the principal typically owns his stake as part of a diversified portfolio. Successful innovation is particularly dependent on employees' willingness to take risks.  In cases with extreme incentive intensity, this sort of behavior can create catastrophic organizational failure. If the principal owns the firm as part of a diversified portfolio this may be a price worth paying for the greater chance of success through innovation elsewhere in the portfolio. If however the risks taken are systematic and cannot be diversified e.g., exposure to general housing prices, then such failures will damage the interests of principals and even the economy as a whole.\n(cf. [[Kidder Peabody]], [[Barings]], [[Enron]], [[AIG]] to name a few). Ongoing periodic catastrophic organizational failure\nis directly incentivized by [[tournament]] and other [[superstar]]/winner-take-all compensation systems (Holt 1995).\n\n===Deferred compensation===\nTournaments represent one way of implementing the general principle of \"deferred compensation\", which is essentially an agreement between worker and firm to commit to each other. Under schemes of deferred compensation, workers are overpaid when old, at the cost of being underpaid when young. Salop and Salop (1976) argue that this derives from the need to attract workers more likely to stay at the firm for longer periods, since turnover is costly. Alternatively, delays in evaluating the performance of workers may lead to compensation being weighted to later periods, when better and poorer workers have to a greater extent been distinguished. (Workers may even prefer to have wages increasing over time, perhaps as a method of forced saving, or as an indicator of personal development. e.g., Loewenstein and Sicherman 1991, Frank and Hutchens 1993.) For example, Akerlof and Katz 1989: if older workers receive efficiency wages, younger workers may be prepared to work for less in order to receive those later. Overall, the evidence suggests the use of deferred compensation (e.g., Freeman and Medoff 1984, and Spilerman 1986\u2014seniority provisions are often included in pay, promotion and retention decisions, irrespective of productivity.)\n\n==Other applications==\n===Energy consumption===\nThe \"principal\u2013agent problem\" has also been discussed in the context of energy consumption by Jaffe and Stavins in 1994. They were attempting to catalog market and non-market barriers to energy efficiency adoption.  In efficiency terms, a [[market failure]] arises when a technology which is both cost-effective and saves energy is not implemented. Jaffe and Stavins describe the common case of the landlord-tenant problem with energy issues as a principal\u2013agent problem. \"[I]f the potential adopter is not the party that pays the energy bill, then good information in the hands of the potential adopter may not be sufficient for optimal diffusion; adoption will only occur if the adopter can recover the investment from the party that enjoys the energy savings. Thus, if it is difficult for the possessor of information to convey it credibly to the party that benefits from reduced energy use, a principal/agent problem arises.\"<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Jaffe|first1= Adam B|last2 = Stavins |first2 = Robert N| title = The energy efficiency gap: What does it mean? |journal = Energy Policy |date = 1994|volume =22|issue = 10|page = 805|url = https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stavins/files/the_energy_efficiency_gap.pdf |doi = 10.1016/0301-4215(94)90138-4}}</ref>\n\nThe energy efficiency use of the principal agent terminology is in fact distinct from the usual one in several ways. In landlord/tenant or more generally equipment-purchaser/energy-bill-payer situations, it is often difficult to describe who would be the principal and who the agent. Is the agent the landlord and the principal the tenant, because the landlord is \"hired\" by the tenant through the payment of rent? As Murtishaw and Sathaye, 2006 point out, \"In the residential sector, the conceptual definition of principal and agent must be stretched beyond a strictly literal definition.\"\n\nAnother distinction is that the principal agent problem in energy efficiency does not require any information asymmetry: both the landlord and the tenant may be aware of the overall costs and benefits of energy-efficient investments, but as long as the landlord pays for the equipment and the tenant pays the energy bills, the investment in new, energy-efficient appliances will not be made. In this case, there is also little incentive for the tenant to make a capital efficiency investment with a usual payback time of several years, and which in the end will revert to the landlord as property. Since energy consumption is determined both by technology and by behavior, an opposite principal agent problem arises when the energy bills are paid by the landlord, leaving the tenant with no incentive to moderate her energy use. This is often the case for leased office space, for example.\n\nThe energy efficiency principal agent problem applies in many cases to rented buildings and apartments, but arises in other circumstances, most often involving relatively high up-front costs for energy-efficient technology. Though it is challenging to assess exactly, the principal agent problem is considered to be a major barrier to the diffusion of efficient technologies. This can be addressed in part by promoting shared-savings performance-based contracts, where both parties benefit from the efficiency savings. The issues of market barriers to energy efficiency, and the principal agent problem in particular, are receiving renewed attention because of the importance of global [[climate change]] and rising prices of the finite supply of [[fossil fuels]].  The principal\u2013agent problem in energy efficiency is the topic of an [[International Energy Agency]] report:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://webstore.iea.org/mind-the-gap |title=Mind the Gap|url-access= registration|publisher= IEA}}</ref> \"Mind the Gap\u2014Quantifying Principal\u2013Agent Problems in Energy Efficiency\" (2007).\n\n===Personnel management===\nThe problem manifests itself in the ways middle managers discriminate against employees who they deem to be \"[[overqualified]]\" in hiring, assignment, and promotion, and repress or terminate \"[[whistleblower]]s\" who want to make senior management aware of fraud or illegal activity. This may be done for the benefit of the middle manager and against the best interest of the shareholders (or members of a non-profit organization).{{Citation needed |date=April 2019}}\n\n===Public officials===\n[[Public official]]s are agents, and people adopt constitutions and laws to try to manage the relationship, but officials may betray their trust and allow themselves to be unduly influenced by [[lobby groups]] or they may abuse their authority and managerial discretion by showing personal favoritism or bad faith by hiring an unqualified friend or by engaging in corruption or [[patronage]], such as selecting the firm of a friend or family member for a [[no-bid contract]].{{Citation needed |date=April 2019}}\n\n===Trust relationships===\nThe problem arises in client\u2013attorney, [[probate]] executor, bankruptcy trustee, and other such relationships.  In some rare cases, attorneys who were entrusted with estate accounts with sizeable balances acted against the interests of the person who hired them to act as their agent by embezzling the funds or \"playing the market\" with the client's money (with the goal of pocketing any proceeds).{{Citation needed |date=April 2019}}\n\n== Economic theory ==\nIn economic theory, the principal-agent approach (also called agency theory) is part of the field ''[[contract theory]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The theory of incentives: The principal-agent model|last = Laffont|first = Jean-Jacques|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Martimort|first2 = David}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Contract theory|last = Bolton|first = Patrick|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Dewatripont|first2 = Matthias}}</ref> In agency theory, it is typically assumed that complete contracts can be written, an assumption also made in [[mechanism design]] theory. Hence, there are no restrictions on the class of feasible contractual arrangements between principal and agent. Agency theory can be subdivided in two categories: (1) In [[adverse selection]] models, the agent has private information about his type (say, his costs of exerting effort or his valuation of a good) ''before'' the contract is written. (2) In [[moral hazard]] models, the agent becomes privately informed ''after'' the contract is written. Hart and Holmstr\u00f6m (1987) divide moral hazard models in the categories \"hidden action\" (e.g., the agent chooses an unobservable effort level) and \"hidden information\" (e.g., the agent learns his valuation of a good, which is modelled as a random draw by nature).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Advances in Economics and Econometrics|last = Hart|first = Oliver|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = 71\u2013155|last2 = Holmstr\u00f6m|first2 = Bengt|editor-last = Bewley, T.|chapter = The theory of contracts}}</ref> In hidden action models, there is a stochastic relationship between the unobservable effort and the verifiable outcome (say, the principal's revenue), because otherwise the unobservability of the effort would be meaningless. Typically, the principal makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the agent; i.e., the principal has all bargaining power. In principal\u2013agent models, the agent often gets a strictly positive rent (i.e. his payoff is larger than his reservation utility, which he would get if no contract were written), which means that the principal faces agency costs. For example, in adverse selection models the agent gets an information rent, while in hidden action models with a wealth-constrained agent the principal must leave a limited-liability rent to the agent.<ref name=\":0\" /> In order to reduce the agency costs, the principal typically induces a second-best solution that differs from the socially optimal first-best solution (which would be attained if there were complete information). If the agent had all bargaining power, the first-best solution would be achieved in adverse selection models with one-sided private information as well as in hidden action models where the agent is wealth-constrained.

In employment, employers (principal) may use [[piece rates]]/[[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]], [[profit sharing]], [[efficiency wages]], [[performance measurement]] (including [[financial statements]]), the agent posting a bond, or the threat of termination of employment to align worker interests with their own.\n\n==Overview==\nThe principal and agent theory emerged in the 1970s from the combined disciplines of economics and institutional theory. There is some contention as to who originated the theory, with theorists Stephen Ross and Barry Mitnick claiming its authorship.<ref>{{cite web|last = Mitnick|first = Barry M.|date = January 2006 |title = Origin of the Theory of Agency|url =  http://www.pitt.edu/~mitnick/agencytheory/agencytheoryoriginrev11806r.htm}}</ref> Ross is said to have originally described the dilemma in terms of a person choosing a flavor of ice-cream for someone whose tastes he does not know (''Ibid''). The most cited reference to the theory, however, comes from [[Michael C. Jensen]] and William Meckling.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1= Michael C.|first2= William H. |last2=Meckling|date = October 1976|title = Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure|journal= Journal of Financial Economics |volume= 3|issue = 4 |pages = 305\u2013360|url = https://www.sfu.ca/~wainwrig/Econ400/jensen-meckling.pdf|doi= 10.1016/0304-405X(76)90026-X}}</ref> The theory has come to extend well beyond economics or institutional studies to all contexts of [[information asymmetry]], [[uncertainty]] and [[risk]].\n\nIn the context of law, principals do not know enough about whether (or to what extent) a contract has been satisfied, and they end up with [[agency cost]]s. The solution to this information problem\u2014closely related to the [[moral hazard]] problem\u2014is to ensure the provision of appropriate [[incentive]]s so agents act in the way principals wish.\n\nIn terms of [[game theory]], it involves changing the rules of the game so that the self-interested rational choices of the agent coincide with what the principal desires. Even in the limited arena of employment contracts, the difficulty of doing this in practice is reflected in a multitude of compensation mechanisms and supervisory schemes, as well as in critique of such mechanisms as e.g., [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] (1986) expresses in his [[W. Edwards Deming#Seven Deadly Diseases|Seven Deadly Diseases]] of management.\n\n==Employment contract==\nIn the context of the employment contract, individual contracts form a major method of restructuring incentives, by connecting as closely as optimal the information available about employee performance, and the compensation for that performance. Because of differences in the quantity and quality of information available about the performance of individual employees, the ability of employees to bear risk, and the ability of employees to manipulate evaluation methods, the structural details of individual contracts vary widely, including such mechanisms as \"piece rates, [share] options, discretionary bonuses, promotions, profit sharing, efficiency wages, deferred compensation, and so on.\"<ref>\n{{cite journal\n  | last = Pendergast\n  | first = Canice\n  | title = The Provision of Incentives in Firms\n  | journal = Journal of Economic Literature\n  | volume = 37\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 7\u201363\n  | year = 1999\n  | jstor = 2564725\n  | doi=10.1257/jel.37.1.7| citeseerx = 10.1.1.558.6657\n  }}</ref> Typically, these mechanisms are used in the context of different types of employment: salesmen often receive some or all of their remuneration as commission, production workers are usually paid an hourly wage, while office workers are typically paid monthly or semimonthly (and if paid overtime, typically at a higher rate than the hourly rate implied by the salary).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The way in which these mechanisms are used is different in the two parts of the economy which Doeringer and Piore called the \"primary\" and \"secondary\" sectors (see also  [[dual labour market]]).\n\nThe secondary sector is characterised by short-term employment relationships, little or no prospect of internal promotion, and the determination of wages primarily by market forces. In terms of occupations, it consists primarily of low or unskilled jobs, whether they are blue-collar (manual-labour), white-collar (e.g., filing clerks), or service jobs (e.g., waiters). These jobs are linked by the fact that they are characterized by \"low skill levels, low earnings, easy entry, job impermanence, and low returns to education or experience.\" In a number of service jobs, such as food service, golf caddying, and valet parking jobs, workers in some countries are paid mostly or entirely with [[gratuity|tips]].\n\nThe use of tipping is a strategy on the part of the owners or managers to align the interests of the service workers with those of the owners or managers; the service workers have an incentive to provide good customer service (thus benefiting the company's business), because this makes it more likely that they will get a good tip.\n\nThe issue of tipping is sometimes discussed in connection with the principal\u2013agent theory. \"Examples of principals and agents include bosses and employees ... [and] diners and waiters.\" \"The \"principal\u2013agent problem\", as it is known in economics, crops up any time agents aren't inclined to do what principals want them to do. To sway them [(agents)], principals have to make it worth the agents' while ... [in the restaurant context,] the better the diner's experience, the bigger the waiter's tip.\"<ref>Paula Szuchman, Jenny Anderson. ''It's Not You, It's the Dishes (originally published as Spousonomics): How to Minimize Conflict and Maximize Happiness in Your Relationship''. Random House Digital, Inc., June 12, 2012. Page 210. Accessed on May 31, 2013</ref> \"In the ... language of the economist, the tip serves as a way to reduce what is known as the classic \"principal\u2013agent\" problem.\" According to \"Videbeck, a researcher at the New Zealand Institute for the Study of Competition and Regulation[,] '[i]n theory, tipping can lead to an efficient match between workers' attitudes to service and the jobs they perform. It is a means to make people work hard. Friendly waiters will go that extra mile, earn their tip, and earn a relatively high income...[On the other hand,] if tipless wages are sufficiently low, then grumpy waiters might actually choose to leave the industry and take jobs that would better suit their personalities.'\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Only the tip, but size is important |date=December 11, 2004 |work=The Age |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/12/10/1102625528796.html |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nAs a solution to the principal\u2013agent problem, though, tipping is not perfect. In the hopes of getting a larger tip, a server, for example, may be inclined to give a customer an extra large glass of wine or a second scoop of ice cream. While these larger servings make the customer happy and increase the likelihood of the server getting a good tip, they cut into the profit margin of the restaurant. In addition, a server may dote on generous tippers while ignoring other customers, and in rare cases harangue bad tippers.\n\n===Non-financial compensation===\nPart of this variation in incentive structures and supervisory mechanisms may be attributable to variation in the level of intrinsic psychological satisfaction to be had from different types of work. Sociologists and psychologists frequently argue that individuals take a certain degree of pride in their work, and that introducing [[performance-related pay]] can destroy this \"psycho-social compensation\", because the exchange relation between employer and employee becomes much more narrowly economic, destroying most or all of the potential for social exchange. Evidence for this is inconclusive\u2014Deci (1971), and Lepper, Greene and Nisbett (1973) find support for this argument; Staw (1989) suggests other interpretations of the findings.\n\n===Team production===\nOn a related note, Drago and Garvey (1997) use Australian survey data to show that when agents are placed on individual pay-for-performance schemes, they are less likely to help their coworkers. This negative effect is particularly important in those jobs that involve strong elements of \"team production\" ([[Alchian]] and Demsetz 1972), where output reflects the contribution of many individuals, and individual contributions cannot be easily identified, and compensation is therefore based largely on the output of the team. In other words, pay-for-performance increases the incentives to free-ride, as there are large positive externalities to the efforts of an individual team member, and low returns to the individual (Holmstr\u00f6m 1982, McLaughlin 1994).\n\nThe negative incentive effects implied are confirmed by some empirical studies, (e.g., Newhouse, 1973) for shared medical practices; costs rise and doctors work fewer hours as more revenue is shared. Leibowitz and Tollison (1980) find that larger law partnerships typically result in worse cost containment. As a counter, peer pressure can potentially solve the problem (Kandel and Lazear 1992), but this depends on peer monitoring being relatively costless to the individuals doing the monitoring/censuring in any particular instance (unless one brings in social considerations of norms and group identity and so on). Studies suggest that profit-sharing, for example, typically raises productivity by 3\u20135% (Jones and Kato 1995, Knez and Simester 2001), although there are some selection issues (Prendergast).\n\n===Empirical evidence===\nThere is however considerable [[empirical evidence]] of a positive effect of compensation on performance (although the studies usually involve \"simple\" jobs where aggregate measures of performance are available, which is where piece rates should be most effective). In one study, Lazear (1996) saw productivity rising by 44% (and wages by 10%) in a change from salary to piece rates, with a half of the productivity gain due to worker selection effects. Research shows that pay for performance increases performance when the task at hand is more repetitive, and reduces performance when the task at hand requires more creative thinking.<ref>{{cite book |title=Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us |first=Daniel H. |last=Pink |year=2009 |location=New York |publisher=Riverhead Books |isbn=9781594488849 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/drivesurprisingt00pink_0 }}</ref>\n\n* Paarsch and Shearer (1996) also find evidence supportive of incentive and productivity effects from piece rates, as do Banker, Lee, and Potter (1996), although the latter do not distinguish between incentive and worker selection effects.\n* Rutherford, Springer and Yavas (2005) find evidence of agency problems in residential real estate by showing that real estate agents sell their own houses at a price premium of approximately 4.5% compared to their clients' houses.\n* Fernie and Metcalf (1996) find that top British jockeys perform significantly better when offered percentage of prize money for winning races compared to being on fixed retainers.\n* McMillan, Whalley and Zhu (1989) and Groves et al.

C. |last2=Murphy |first2=K. J. |year= }}</ref>\n\n==Contract design==\nMilgrom and Roberts (1992) identify four principles of contract design: When perfect information is not available, Holmstr\u00f6m (1979) developed the '''Informativeness Principle''' to solve this problem. This essentially states that any measure of performance that (on the margin) reveals information about the effort level chosen by the agent should be included in the compensation contract. This includes, for example, Relative Performance Evaluation\u2014measurement relative to other, similar agents, so as to filter out some common background noise factors, such as fluctuations in demand. By removing some exogenous sources of randomness in the agent's income, a greater proportion of the fluctuation in the agent's income falls under his control, increasing his ability to bear risk. If taken advantage of, by greater use of piece rates, this should improve incentives. (In terms of the simple linear model below, this means that increasing ''x'' produces an increase in ''b''.)\n\nHowever, setting incentives as intense as possible is not necessarily optimal from the point of view of the employer. The '''Incentive-Intensity Principle''' states that the optimal intensity of incentives depends on four factors: the incremental profits created by additional effort, the precision with which the desired activities are assessed, the agent's risk tolerance, and the agent's responsiveness to incentives. According to Prendergast (1999, 8), \"the primary constraint on [performance-related pay] is that [its] provision imposes additional risk on workers ...\" A typical result of the early principal\u2013agent literature was that piece rates tend to 100% (of the compensation package) as the worker becomes more able to handle risk, as this ensures that workers fully internalize the consequences of their costly actions. In incentive terms, where we conceive of workers as self-interested rational individuals who provide costly effort (in the most general sense of the worker's input to the firm's production function), the more compensation varies with effort, the better the incentives for the worker to produce.\n\nThe third principle\u2014the '''Monitoring Intensity Principle\u2014'''is complementary to the second, in that situations in which the optimal intensity of incentives is high corresponds highly to situations in which the optimal level of monitoring is also high. Thus employers effectively choose from a \"menu\" of monitoring/incentive intensities. This is because monitoring is a costly means of reducing the variance of employee performance, which makes more difference to profits in the kinds of situations where it is also optimal to make incentives intense.\n\nThe fourth principle is the '''Equal Compensation Principle''', which essentially states that activities equally valued by the employer should be equally valuable (in terms of compensation, including non-financial aspects such as pleasantness of the workplace) to the employee. This relates to the problem that employees may be engaged in several activities, and if some of these are not monitored or are monitored less heavily, these will be neglected, as activities with higher marginal returns to the employee are favoured. This can be thought of as a kind of \"[[disintermediation]]\"\u2014targeting certain measurable variables may cause others to suffer. For example, teachers being rewarded by test scores of their students are likely to tend more towards teaching 'for the test', and de-emphasise less relevant but perhaps equally or more important aspects of education; while [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]'s practice at one time of paying programmers by the number of lines of code written resulted in programs that were longer than necessary\u2014i.e., program efficiency suffering (Prendergast 1999, 21). Following Holmstr\u00f6m and Milgrom (1990) and Baker (1992), this has become known as \"multi-tasking\" (where a subset of relevant tasks is rewarded, non-rewarded tasks suffer relative neglect). Because of this, the more difficult it is to completely specify and measure the variables on which reward is to be conditioned, the less likely that performance-related pay will be used: \"in essence, complex jobs will typically not be evaluated through explicit contracts.\" (Prendergast 1999, 9).\n\nWhere explicit measures are used, they are more likely to be some kind of aggregate measure, for example, baseball and [[American Football]] players are rarely rewarded on the many specific measures available (e.g., number of home runs), but frequently receive bonuses for aggregate performance measures such as Most Valuable Player. The alternative to objective measures is subjective performance evaluation, typically by supervisors. However, there is here a similar effect to \"multi-tasking\", as workers shift effort from that subset of tasks which they consider useful and constructive, to that subset which they think gives the greatest appearance of being useful and constructive, and more generally to try to curry personal favour with supervisors. (One can interpret this as a destruction of organizational [[social capital]]\u2014workers identifying with, and actively working for the benefit of, the firm \u2013 in favour of the creation of personal social capital\u2014the individual-level social relations which enable workers to get ahead (\"networking\").)\n\n===Linear model===\nThe four principles can be summarized in terms of the simplest (linear) model of incentive compensation:\n\n<math display=\"block\">\nw = a + b(e + x + gy) \\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''w'' (wage) is equal to ''a'' (the base salary) plus ''b'' (the intensity of incentives provided to the employee) times the sum of three terms: ''e'' (unobserved employee effort) plus ''x'' (unobserved exogenous effects on outcomes) plus the product of  ''g'' (the weight given to observed exogenous effects on outcomes) and ''y'' (observed exogenous effects on outcomes). ''b'' is the slope of the relationship between compensation and outcomes.\n\n<math display=\"block\">\n\\text{wage} = (\\text{base salary}) \n+ (\\text{incentives})\n\\cdot (\\text{(unobserved) effort} + (\\text{(unobserved) effects}) \n+ (\\text{weight }Y)(\\text{observed exogenous effects}))\n</math>\n\nThe above discussion on explicit measures assumed that contracts would create the linear incentive structures summarised in the model above. But while the combination of normal errors and the absence of income effects yields linear contracts, many observed contracts are nonlinear. To some extent this is due to income effects as workers rise up a tournament/hierarchy: \"Quite simply, it may take more money to induce effort from the rich than from the less well off.\" (Prendergast 1999, 50).  Similarly, the threat of being fired creates a nonlinearity in wages earned versus performance. Moreover, many empirical studies illustrate inefficient behaviour arising from nonlinear objective performance measures, or measures over the course of a long period (e.g., a year), which create nonlinearities in time due to discounting behaviour. This inefficient behaviour arises because incentive structures are varying: for example, when a worker has already exceeded a quota or has no hope of reaching it, versus being close to reaching it\u2014e.g., Healy (1985), Oyer (1997), Leventis (1997). Leventis shows that New York surgeons, penalised for exceeding a certain mortality rate, take less risky cases as they approach the threshold. Courty and Marshke (1997) provide evidence on incentive contracts offered to agencies, which receive bonuses on reaching a quota of graduated trainees within a year. This causes them to 'rush-graduate' trainees in order to make the quota.\n\n===Options framework===\nIn certain cases agency problems may be analysed by applying the techniques developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], as applied via a [[real options]] framework.<ref>[[Aswath Damodaran]]:  [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/lectures/opt.html Applications Of Option Pricing Theory To Equity Valuation] and [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/optequity.pdf Option Pricing Applications in Valuation].</ref><ref>D.

[http://realoptions.org/papers2006/Siller-Pagaza_RO2.pdf  The Impact of Real Options in Agency Problems]</ref> [[Stockholders]] and [[bondholders]] have different objective\u2014for instance, stockholders have an incentive to take riskier projects than bondholders do, and to pay more out in [[dividends]] than bondholders would like. At the same time, since equity may be seen as a [[call option]] on the value of the firm, an increase in the [[variance]] in the firm value, other things remaining equal, will lead to an increase in the value of equity, and stockholders may therefore take risky projects with negative net present values, which while making them better off, may make the bondholders worse off. See [[Business valuation#Option pricing approaches|Option pricing approaches]] under [[Business valuation]] for further discussion. Nagel and Purnanandam (2017) notice that since bank assets are risky debt claims, bank equity resembles a subordinated debt and therefore the stock's payoff is truncated by the difference between the face values of the corporation debt and of the bank deposits.<ref>[S. Nagel and A. Purnanandam (2017).  [https://www.dropbox.com/s/t6r9xvihh6lrntr/BankCreditRisk.pdf?dl=0 Bank Risk Dynamics and Distance to Default];</ref> Based on this observation, Peleg-Lazar and Raviv (2017) show that in contrast to the classical agent theory of Michael C. Jensen and William Meckling, an increase in variance would not lead to an increase in the value of equity if the bank's debtor is solvent.<ref>[S. Peleg-Lazar and A. Raviv (2017). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eufm.12102/abstract Bank Risk Dynamics Where Assets are Risky Debt Claims];</ref>\n\n==Performance evaluation==\n\n===Objective performance evaluation===\nThe major problem in measuring employee performance in cases where it is difficult to draw a straightforward connection between\nperformance and profitability is the setting of a standard by which to judge the performance. One method of setting an absolute objective performance standard\u2014rarely used because it is costly and only appropriate for simple repetitive tasks\u2014is [[time-and-motion studies]], which study in detail how fast it is possible to do a certain task. These have been used constructively in the past, particularly in manufacturing. More generally, however, even within the field of objective performance evaluation, some form of relative performance evaluation must be used. Typically this takes the form of comparing the performance of a worker to that of his peers in the firm or industry, perhaps taking account of different exogenous circumstances affecting that.\n\nThe reason that employees are often paid according to hours of work rather than by direct measurement of results is that it is often more efficient to use indirect systems of controlling the quantity and quality of effort, due to a variety of informational and other issues (e.g., turnover costs, which determine the optimal minimum length of relationship between firm and employee). This means that methods such as deferred compensation and structures such as tournaments are often more suitable to create the incentives for employees to contribute what they can to output over longer periods (years rather than hours). These represent \"pay-for-performance\" systems in a looser, more extended sense, as workers who consistently work harder and better are more likely to be promoted (and usually paid more), compared to the narrow definition of \"pay-for-performance\", such as piece rates. This discussion has been conducted almost entirely for self-interested rational individuals. In practice, however, the incentive mechanisms which successful firms use take account of the socio-cultural context they are embedded in ([[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama]] 1995, Granovetter 1985), in order not to destroy the [[social capital]] they might more constructively mobilise towards building an organic, social organization, with the attendant benefits from such things as \"worker loyalty and pride (...) [which] can be critical to a firm's success ...\" (Sappington 1991,63)\n\n===Subjective performance evaluation===\nSubjectivity is related to judgement based on a supervisor's subjective impressions and opinions, which can be expressed through the use of subjective performance measures, ''ex post'' flexibility in the weighting of objective performance measures, or ''ex post'' discretional adjustment, all of which are based on factors other than performance measures specified ''ex ante''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bicudo de Castro|first=Vincent|date=November 2017|title=Unpacking the notion of subjectivity: Performance evaluation and supervisor discretion|journal=The British Accounting Review|volume=49|issue=6|pages=532\u2013544|doi=10.1016/j.bar.2017.08.003|issn=0890-8389}}</ref> Subjective performance evaluation allows the use of a subtler, more balanced assessment of employee performance, and is typically used for more complex jobs where comprehensive objective measures are difficult to specify and/or measure. Whilst often the only feasible method, the attendant problems with subjective performance evaluation have resulted in a variety of incentive structures and supervisory schemes. One problem, for example, is that supervisors may under-report performance in order to save on wages, if they are in some way residual claimants, or perhaps rewarded on the basis of cost savings. This tendency is of course to some extent offset by the danger of retaliation and/or demotivation of the employee, if the supervisor is responsible for that employee's output.\n\nAnother problem relates to what is known as the \"compression of ratings\". Two related influences\u2014centrality bias, and leniency bias\u2014have been documented (Landy and Farr 1980, Murphy and Cleveland 1991). The former results from supervisors being reluctant to distinguish critically between workers (perhaps for fear of destroying team spirit), while the latter derives from supervisors being averse to offering poor ratings to subordinates, especially where these ratings are used to determine pay, not least because bad evaluations may be demotivating rather than motivating. However, these biases introduce noise into the relationship between pay and effort, reducing the incentive effect of performance-related pay. Milkovich and Wigdor (1991) suggest that this is the reason for the common separation of evaluations and pay, with evaluations primarily used to allocate training.\n\nFinally, while the problem of compression of ratings originates on the supervisor-side, related effects occur when workers actively attempt to influence the appraisals supervisors give, either by influencing the performance information going to the supervisor: multitasking (focussing on the more visibly productive activities\u2014Paul 1992), or by working \"too hard\" to signal worker quality or create a good impression (Holmstr\u00f6m 1982); or by influencing the evaluation of it, e.g., by \"currying influence\" (Milgrom and Roberts 1988) or by outright bribery (Tirole 1992).\n\n==Incentive structures==\n\n===Tournaments===\nMuch of the discussion here has been in terms of individual pay-for-performance contracts; but many large firms use internal labour markets (Doeringer and Piore 1971, Rosen 1982) as a solution to some of the problems outlined. Here, there is \"pay-for-performance\" in a looser sense over a longer time period. There is little variation in pay within grades, and pay increases come with changes in job or job title (Gibbs and Hendricks 1996). The incentive effects of this structure are dealt with in what is known as \"[[tournament theory]]\" (Lazear and Rosen 1981, Green and Stokey (1983), see Rosen (1986) for multi-stage tournaments in hierarchies where it is explained why CEOs are paid many times more than other workers in the firm). See the [[superstar]] article for more information on the tournament theory.\n\nWorkers are motivated to supply effort by the wage increase they would earn if they win a promotion. Some of the extended tournament models predict that relatively weaker agents, be they competing in a sports tournaments (Becker and Huselid 1992, in [[NASCAR]] racing) or in the broiler chicken industry (Knoeber and Thurman 1994), would take risky actions instead of increasing their effort supply as a cheap way to improve the prospects of winning. These actions are inefficient as they increase risk taking without increasing the average effort supplied.\n\nA major problem with tournaments is that individuals are rewarded based on how well they do relative to others. Co-workers might become reluctant to help out others and might even sabotage others' effort instead of increasing their own effort (Lazear 1989, Rob and Zemsky 1997). This is supported empirically by Drago and Garvey (1997). Why then are tournaments so popular? Firstly, because\u2014especially given compression rating problems\u2014it is difficult to determine absolutely differences in worker performance. Tournaments merely require rank order evaluation. Secondly, it reduces the danger of [[rent-seeking]], because bonuses paid to favourite workers are tied to increased responsibilities in new jobs, and supervisors will suffer if they do not promote the most qualified person. Thirdly, where prize structures are (relatively) fixed, it reduces the possibility of the firm reneging on paying wages. As Carmichael (1983) notes, a prize structure represents a degree of commitment, both to absolute and to relative wage levels.  Lastly when the measurement of workers' productivity is difficult, e.g., say monitoring is costly, or when the tasks the workers have to perform for the job is varied in nature, making it hard to measure effort and/or performance, then running tournaments in a firm would encourage the workers to supply effort whereas workers would have shirked if there are no promotions.\n\nTournaments also promote [[risk seeking]] behavior.  In essence, the compensation scheme becomes more\nlike a [[call option]] on performance (which increases in value with increased [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] (cf. [[options pricing]]).\nIf you are one of ten players competing for the asymmetrically large top prize, you may benefit from reducing the expected\nvalue of your overall performance to the firm in order to increase your chance that you have an outstanding performance\n(and win the prize). In moderation this can offset the greater risk aversion of agents vs principals because their social capital is concentrated in their employer while in the case of public companies the principal typically owns his stake as part of a diversified portfolio. Successful innovation is particularly dependent on employees' willingness to take risks.  In cases with extreme incentive intensity, this sort of behavior can create catastrophic organizational failure. If the principal owns the firm as part of a diversified portfolio this may be a price worth paying for the greater chance of success through innovation elsewhere in the portfolio. If however the risks taken are systematic and cannot be diversified e.g., exposure to general housing prices, then such failures will damage the interests of principals and even the economy as a whole.\n(cf. [[Kidder Peabody]], [[Barings]], [[Enron]], [[AIG]] to name a few). Ongoing periodic catastrophic organizational failure\nis directly incentivized by [[tournament]] and other [[superstar]]/winner-take-all compensation systems (Holt 1995).\n\n===Deferred compensation===\nTournaments represent one way of implementing the general principle of \"deferred compensation\", which is essentially an agreement between worker and firm to commit to each other. Under schemes of deferred compensation, workers are overpaid when old, at the cost of being underpaid when young. Salop and Salop (1976) argue that this derives from the need to attract workers more likely to stay at the firm for longer periods, since turnover is costly. Alternatively, delays in evaluating the performance of workers may lead to compensation being weighted to later periods, when better and poorer workers have to a greater extent been distinguished. (Workers may even prefer to have wages increasing over time, perhaps as a method of forced saving, or as an indicator of personal development. e.g., Loewenstein and Sicherman 1991, Frank and Hutchens 1993.) For example, Akerlof and Katz 1989: if older workers receive efficiency wages, younger workers may be prepared to work for less in order to receive those later. Overall, the evidence suggests the use of deferred compensation (e.g., Freeman and Medoff 1984, and Spilerman 1986\u2014seniority provisions are often included in pay, promotion and retention decisions, irrespective of productivity.)\n\n==Other applications==\n===Energy consumption===\nThe \"principal\u2013agent problem\" has also been discussed in the context of energy consumption by Jaffe and Stavins in 1994. They were attempting to catalog market and non-market barriers to energy efficiency adoption.  In efficiency terms, a [[market failure]] arises when a technology which is both cost-effective and saves energy is not implemented. Jaffe and Stavins describe the common case of the landlord-tenant problem with energy issues as a principal\u2013agent problem. \"[I]f the potential adopter is not the party that pays the energy bill, then good information in the hands of the potential adopter may not be sufficient for optimal diffusion; adoption will only occur if the adopter can recover the investment from the party that enjoys the energy savings. Thus, if it is difficult for the possessor of information to convey it credibly to the party that benefits from reduced energy use, a principal/agent problem arises.\"<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Jaffe|first1= Adam B|last2 = Stavins |first2 = Robert N| title = The energy efficiency gap: What does it mean? |journal = Energy Policy |date = 1994|volume =22|issue = 10|page = 805|url = https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stavins/files/the_energy_efficiency_gap.pdf |doi = 10.1016/0301-4215(94)90138-4}}</ref>\n\nThe energy efficiency use of the principal agent terminology is in fact distinct from the usual one in several ways. In landlord/tenant or more generally equipment-purchaser/energy-bill-payer situations, it is often difficult to describe who would be the principal and who the agent. Is the agent the landlord and the principal the tenant, because the landlord is \"hired\" by the tenant through the payment of rent? As Murtishaw and Sathaye, 2006 point out, \"In the residential sector, the conceptual definition of principal and agent must be stretched beyond a strictly literal definition.\"\n\nAnother distinction is that the principal agent problem in energy efficiency does not require any information asymmetry: both the landlord and the tenant may be aware of the overall costs and benefits of energy-efficient investments, but as long as the landlord pays for the equipment and the tenant pays the energy bills, the investment in new, energy-efficient appliances will not be made. In this case, there is also little incentive for the tenant to make a capital efficiency investment with a usual payback time of several years, and which in the end will revert to the landlord as property. Since energy consumption is determined both by technology and by behavior, an opposite principal agent problem arises when the energy bills are paid by the landlord, leaving the tenant with no incentive to moderate her energy use. This is often the case for leased office space, for example.\n\nThe energy efficiency principal agent problem applies in many cases to rented buildings and apartments, but arises in other circumstances, most often involving relatively high up-front costs for energy-efficient technology. Though it is challenging to assess exactly, the principal agent problem is considered to be a major barrier to the diffusion of efficient technologies. This can be addressed in part by promoting shared-savings performance-based contracts, where both parties benefit from the efficiency savings. The issues of market barriers to energy efficiency, and the principal agent problem in particular, are receiving renewed attention because of the importance of global [[climate change]] and rising prices of the finite supply of [[fossil fuels]].  The principal\u2013agent problem in energy efficiency is the topic of an [[International Energy Agency]] report:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://webstore.iea.org/mind-the-gap |title=Mind the Gap|url-access= registration|publisher= IEA}}</ref> \"Mind the Gap\u2014Quantifying Principal\u2013Agent Problems in Energy Efficiency\" (2007).\n\n===Personnel management===\nThe problem manifests itself in the ways middle managers discriminate against employees who they deem to be \"[[overqualified]]\" in hiring, assignment, and promotion, and repress or terminate \"[[whistleblower]]s\" who want to make senior management aware of fraud or illegal activity. This may be done for the benefit of the middle manager and against the best interest of the shareholders (or members of a non-profit organization).{{Citation needed |date=April 2019}}\n\n===Public officials===\n[[Public official]]s are agents, and people adopt constitutions and laws to try to manage the relationship, but officials may betray their trust and allow themselves to be unduly influenced by [[lobby groups]] or they may abuse their authority and managerial discretion by showing personal favoritism or bad faith by hiring an unqualified friend or by engaging in corruption or [[patronage]], such as selecting the firm of a friend or family member for a [[no-bid contract]].{{Citation needed |date=April 2019}}\n\n===Trust relationships===\nThe problem arises in client\u2013attorney, [[probate]] executor, bankruptcy trustee, and other such relationships.  In some rare cases, attorneys who were entrusted with estate accounts with sizeable balances acted against the interests of the person who hired them to act as their agent by embezzling the funds or \"playing the market\" with the client's money (with the goal of pocketing any proceeds).{{Citation needed |date=April 2019}}\n\n== Economic theory ==\nIn economic theory, the principal-agent approach (also called agency theory) is part of the field ''[[contract theory]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The theory of incentives: The principal-agent model|last = Laffont|first = Jean-Jacques|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Martimort|first2 = David}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Contract theory|last = Bolton|first = Patrick|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Dewatripont|first2 = Matthias}}</ref> In agency theory, it is typically assumed that complete contracts can be written, an assumption also made in [[mechanism design]] theory. Hence, there are no restrictions on the class of feasible contractual arrangements between principal and agent. Agency theory can be subdivided in two categories: (1) In [[adverse selection]] models, the agent has private information about his type (say, his costs of exerting effort or his valuation of a good) ''before'' the contract is written. (2) In [[moral hazard]] models, the agent becomes privately informed ''after'' the contract is written. Hart and Holmstr\u00f6m (1987) divide moral hazard models in the categories \"hidden action\" (e.g., the agent chooses an unobservable effort level) and \"hidden information\" (e.g., the agent learns his valuation of a good, which is modelled as a random draw by nature).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Advances in Economics and Econometrics|last = Hart|first = Oliver|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = 71\u2013155|last2 = Holmstr\u00f6m|first2 = Bengt|editor-last = Bewley, T.|chapter = The theory of contracts}}</ref> In hidden action models, there is a stochastic relationship between the unobservable effort and the verifiable outcome (say, the principal's revenue), because otherwise the unobservability of the effort would be meaningless. Typically, the principal makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the agent; i.e., the principal has all bargaining power. In principal\u2013agent models, the agent often gets a strictly positive rent (i.e. his payoff is larger than his reservation utility, which he would get if no contract were written), which means that the principal faces agency costs. For example, in adverse selection models the agent gets an information rent, while in hidden action models with a wealth-constrained agent the principal must leave a limited-liability rent to the agent.<ref name=\":0\" /> In order to reduce the agency costs, the principal typically induces a second-best solution that differs from the socially optimal first-best solution (which would be attained if there were complete information). If the agent had all bargaining power, the first-best solution would be achieved in adverse selection models with one-sided private information as well as in hidden action models where the agent is wealth-constrained.

As a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles. The choices made by these algorithms are not transparent.\n\nIt is important to distinguish the difference between echo chambers and [[filter bubble]]s. As, both concepts relate to the ways individuals are exposed to content devoid of clashing opinions, and colloquially might be used interchangeably. However, echo chamber refers to the overall phenomenon by which individuals are exposed only to information from like-minded individuals, while filter bubbles are a result of algorithms that choose content based on previous online behavior, as with search histories or online shopping activity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bakshy|first=Eytan|last2=Messing|first2=Solomon|last3=Adamic|first3=Lada A.|date=2015-06-05|title=Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook|journal=Science|language=en|volume=348|issue=6239|pages=1130\u20131132|doi=10.1126/science.aaa1160|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25953820}}</ref>\n\n== Implications of Echo Chamber's ==\nOnline social communities become fragmented by echo chambers when like-minded people group together and members hear arguments in one specific direction with no counter argument addressed. In certain online platforms, such as Twitter, echo chambers are more likely to be found when the topic is more political in nature compared to topics that are seen as more neutral.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barber\u00e1|first=Pablo|last2=Jost|first2=John T.|last3=Nagler|first3=Jonathan|last4=Tucker|first4=Joshua A.|last5=Bonneau|first5=Richard|date=2015-08-21|title=Tweeting From Left to Right|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1531\u20131542|doi=10.1177/0956797615594620|pmid=26297377}}</ref> [[Social networking]] communities are powerful reinforcement's of rumors<ref>{{cite book |last1=DiFonzo |first1=Nicholas |title=The Watercooler Effect: An Indispensable Guide to Understanding and Harnessing the Power of Rumors |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LOPMg7Bm5HgC&dq=the+watercooler+effect |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=9781440638633 |date=2008-09-11 |access-date=2017-09-24}}</ref> because people trust evidence supplied by their own social group, more than they do the news media.<ref>{{cite web |last1=DiFonzo |first1=Nicholas |title=The Echo-Chamber Effect |url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/04/21/barack-obama-and-the-psychology-of-the-birther-myth/the-echo-chamber-effect |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=2011-04-21 |access-date=2017-09-24}}</ref> This can create significant barriers to critical discourse within an online medium. Social discussion and sharing can potentially suffer when peop have a narrow information base and don't reach outside their network. The echo chambers can be detrimental to the well-being of a person. Essentially, the filter bubble can distort our very own realities that we thought could not be altered by outside sources. The Farnam Street academic blog explains that the filter bubble can have a bigger impact on us than we think. It can create echo chambers that leads us to believe that what you are seeing through ads is the only opinion or perspective that is right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|title=How Filter Bubbles Distort Reality: Everything You Need to Know|last=Parrish|first=Shane|date=2017-07-31|website=Farnam Street}}</ref> This goes back to political ads that were constantly in circulation on the internet making the user think that it is the only correct opinion out there. Put otherwise, \u201cIf we don\u2019t like facts, we don\u2019t believe them. If we DO like something presented to us as fact, even if it is false, we tend to believe it. If we see too much of our viewpoint and perspectives everyday, we believe that there are no other opinions and that ours is the correct one in all cases.\"\n\nMany offline communities are also segregated by political beliefs and cultural views. The echo chamber effect may prevent individuals from noticing changes in language and culture involving groups other than their own. Online echo chambers can sometimes influence an individual\u2019s willingness to participate in similar discussions offline. A 2016 study found that \u201cTwitter users who felt their audience on Twitter agreed with their opinion were more willing to speak out on that issue in the workplace\u201d.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n== Examples  ==\nIdeological echo chambers have existed in many forms, for centuries.

As a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles. The choices made by these algorithms are not transparent.\n\nIt is important to distinguish the difference between echo chambers and [[filter bubble]]s. As, both concepts relate to the ways individuals are exposed to content devoid of clashing opinions, and colloquially might be used interchangeably. However, echo chamber refers to the overall phenomenon by which individuals are exposed only to information from like-minded individuals, while filter bubbles are a result of algorithms that choose content based on previous online behavior, as with search histories or online shopping activity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bakshy|first=Eytan|last2=Messing|first2=Solomon|last3=Adamic|first3=Lada A.|date=2015-06-05|title=Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook|journal=Science|language=en|volume=348|issue=6239|pages=1130\u20131132|doi=10.1126/science.aaa1160|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25953820}}</ref>\n\n== Implications of Echo Chamber's ==\nOnline social communities become fragmented by echo chambers when like-minded people group together and members hear arguments in one specific direction with no counter argument addressed. In certain online platforms, such as Twitter, echo chambers are more likely to be found when the topic is more political in nature compared to topics that are seen as more neutral.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barber\u00e1|first=Pablo|last2=Jost|first2=John T.|last3=Nagler|first3=Jonathan|last4=Tucker|first4=Joshua A.|last5=Bonneau|first5=Richard|date=2015-08-21|title=Tweeting From Left to Right|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1531\u20131542|doi=10.1177/0956797615594620|pmid=26297377}}</ref> [[Social networking]] communities are powerful reinforcement's of rumors<ref>{{cite book |last1=DiFonzo |first1=Nicholas |title=The Watercooler Effect: An Indispensable Guide to Understanding and Harnessing the Power of Rumors |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LOPMg7Bm5HgC&dq=the+watercooler+effect |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=9781440638633 |date=2008-09-11 |access-date=2017-09-24}}</ref> because people trust evidence supplied by their own social group, more than they do the news media.<ref>{{cite web |last1=DiFonzo |first1=Nicholas |title=The Echo-Chamber Effect |url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/04/21/barack-obama-and-the-psychology-of-the-birther-myth/the-echo-chamber-effect |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=2011-04-21 |access-date=2017-09-24}}</ref> This can create significant barriers to critical discourse within an online medium. Social discussion and sharing can potentially suffer when peop have a narrow information base and don't reach outside their network. The echo chambers can be detrimental to the well-being of a person. Essentially, the filter bubble can distort our very own realities that we thought could not be altered by outside sources. The Farnam Street academic blog explains that the filter bubble can have a bigger impact on us than we think. It can create echo chambers that leads us to believe that what you are seeing through ads is the only opinion or perspective that is right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|title=How Filter Bubbles Distort Reality: Everything You Need to Know|last=Parrish|first=Shane|date=2017-07-31|website=Farnam Street}}</ref> This goes back to political ads that were constantly in circulation on the internet making the user think that it is the only correct opinion out there. Put otherwise, \u201cIf we don\u2019t like facts, we don\u2019t believe them. If we DO like something presented to us as fact, even if it is false, we tend to believe it. If we see too much of our viewpoint and perspectives everyday, we believe that there are no other opinions and that ours is the correct one in all cases.\"\n\nMany offline communities are also segregated by political beliefs and cultural views. The echo chamber effect may prevent individuals from noticing changes in language and culture involving groups other than their own. Online echo chambers can sometimes influence an individual\u2019s willingness to participate in similar discussions offline. A 2016 study found that \u201cTwitter users who felt their audience on Twitter agreed with their opinion were more willing to speak out on that issue in the workplace\u201d.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n== Examples  ==\nIdeological echo chambers have existed in many forms, for centuries.
