After graduation in 1906, he worked in the research department of the [[Dominion Bridge Company]] in Montreal.\n\nIn 1909, he studied at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]], in the atelier of [[Jean-Louis Pascal]]. In 1914, he was the recipient of the Henry Jarvis Scholarship, awarded by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]. Through its British ''Prix de Rome'', Cormier spent two years in [[Rome]], where he studied the ancient works. Following his return to Paris in January 1917, he was employed by the engineering firm of Consid\u00e8re, Pelnard et Caquot, specialists in concrete, and he graduated as an architect of the French Government (DPLG).\n\nHe was a professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Montreal from 1921 to 1954.

Six months later, he is awakened at 3:00 every morning by nightmares of his family's deaths. Castle passes much of his time working, taking down an old building. This angers the other workers, who are denied extra pay due to Castle's overtime. He also visits Curtis Hoyle, a veteran that Castle served alongside before his family died, and mentions that his time in Afghanistan involved some activities that he did not want to discuss. A new worker, Donny Chavez, attempts to befriend Castle, and proves himself to be eager to please the other workers. He agrees to help them steal money from a local gang, but he accidentally reveals his identity to the gangsters. The others attempt to kill Chavez at the worksite, but Castle is there and kills them first. He then kills the gangsters before they can hunt Chavez. Meanwhile, [[Homeland security]] agent Dinah Madani begins investigating Castle's Afghanistan troop, believing they killed her previous partner.\n |LineColor = 161719\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Punisher (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Two Dead Men\n |DirectedBy = Tom Shankland\n |WrittenBy = Steve Lightfoot\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary = A man calling himself \"Micro\" monitors cameras around New York City, and begins tracking Castle from the building where he murdered the gangsters. He contacts Castle and tells him to check a disk that he had left for Castle at his old family home; the disk contains footage of Castle and his unit in [[Kandahar]], torturing and murdering Madani's partner Ahmad Zubair. Madani had that video before it was stolen, and now wants to discuss Castle\u2014who is believed to be dead\u2014with his old army friend [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Billy Russo]]. Her superior Carson Wolf forbids her from this, but she convinces him to use Russo's new business Anvil for field training, and talks to Russo then. Castle's journalist friend [[Karen Page]] agrees to help him find Micro, and learns that he is former NSA analyst [[Microchip (comics)|David Lieberman]], who was caught leaking secrets and was believed to be killed. Wolf covered up the story, so Castle tortures and kills him, learning that the death of his family was just one attempt to kill him.

Soon after, Wolf hunted Lieberman down with special forces, shooting him and framing him for a crime. The shot hit Lieberman's cellphone and he was able to go underground. Lieberman gets the upper-hand on Castle, who reveals that in Kandahar he was selected for a special unit, Cerberus, alongside Russo, and they were used by a mysterious agent to hunt down and kill high value targets. Castle had not known who Zubair was when he was ordered to kill him, and had grown increasingly disillusioned with his command. When they ignored his and Russo's advice and went ahead with a mission that killed several other members of Cerberus, Castle was able to complete the mission in an intense killing spree, but he and Russo then transferred from the unit. Now, Castle agrees to work with Lieberman to hunt down those behind Cerberus.\n |LineColor = 161719\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Punisher (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = Resupply\n |DirectedBy = [[Kari Skogland]]\n |WrittenBy = Dario Scardapane\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary = Requiring weapons and ammunition, Castle gets Lieberman to search law enforcement databases for known shipments of guns. Castle follows a lead to dealer [[Turk Barrett]], but finds that the shipment was a special delivery and does not serve their needs. Barrett says that the main shipment is going to someone else, and Lieberman soon finds that Homeland security is working on an operation to buy the shipment in hopes of arresting those selling the weapons. Madani, now acting-Special Agent in Charge, wishes to investigate Wolf's murder, but is warned against pursuing the matter by another superior, and is instead told to focus on the weapons operation. She helps coordinate the operation, the plans for which Lieberman learned by hacking into Homeland security. He and Castle are able to disrupt the agents and hijack the weapons, but they are pursued by Madani. Lieberman crashes into Madani's vehicle, seriously injuring her.

Her team is interrogated regarding the failed weapons operation, but she does not reveal that Castle is alive, and instead convinces another agent, Sam Stein, to help her. She interviews Page, who later tells Castle about Madani's investigation. Meanwhile, William Rawlins\u2014the agent in charge of Cerberus\u2014receives a medal for his achievements during wartime, and is asked by the [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director of the CIA]] Marion James to serve as her deputy when she is promoted. Lieberman points out that the video of Zubair's murder must have been made by one of the other Cerberus soldiers, and Castle believes it was Gunner Henderson, who also knew what they were doing was wrong. They find Henderson living in seclusion, but Rawlins sends soldiers to kill him, discovering that Castle is alive.

Hoyle later bails Lewis Wilson, a young veteran that he had been trying to help rehabilitate, out of jail; he had been arrested protesting [[Gun politics in the United States|for the right to bear arms]], and had been abandoned by another veteran he had admired, O'Connor. Hoyle reveals that the latter had lied about serving, and Wilson finds and kills O'Connor. Madani and Russo sleep together, and he realizes that she is using him to investigate Castle. She tells him that Castle is alive, and Russo broadcasts a message that Lieberman picks up. Castle meets with Russo to explain that Cerberus was a front for a major drug operation, and that he is fighting to take down those responsible. Russo offers to give Castle a chance at a new life instead, but Castle turns him down. Madani finds Henderson's body, and deduces what happened. She also gains proof that Castle is alive from his blood being at the scene.

She realizes that Henderson was only targeted after she had started investigating him, and that her office may be bugged; Madani and Stein find the device. Castle and Lieberman plan to take their next target, Col. Morty Bennett, one of the leaders of Cerberus. Rawlins and Russo expect this, and also discuss Madani's investigation, with Rawlins comfortable that she has no leads. He also tells Russo that he should have killed Castle when he had the chance. Castle infiltrates the military base where Bennet lives, but Russo is expecting him and attacks him with a group of soldiers. Castle fights them off, not knowing who Russo is beneath a mask, while Lieberman gains remote access to Bennett's phone. Castle then escapes, being forced to injure a young soldier on his way. They track Bennett's phone to Rawlins, who has Russo kill Bennett.

He later tells Madani that he grew up in the system. Lieberman and Castle identify Rawlins. The cameras that Lieberman is using to keep watch on his family go down, and he sends Castle to investigate. Castle has been spending time with Lieberman's wife Sarah since meeting her while investigating who \"Micro\" was, and finds out that she had disconnected the internet as punishment for her son, Zach. Castle reconnects the internet, and has some drinks with Sarah. She kisses him, but they both acknowledge that this is a mistake. She then asks Castle to intervene with Zach, and he realizes that the boy needs a father figure to spend time with. Knowing that she is being watched, Madani sets up a new operation, but releases false plans to be found. When Russo arrives at a warehouse with a team of mercenaries per that latter plan, he is ambushed by Homeland security. His team are all killed, but Russo is able to kill Stein and escape without Madani seeing him.\n |LineColor = 161719 \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Punisher (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = Front Toward Enemy\n |DirectedBy = Marc Jobst\n |WrittenBy = Angela LaManna\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary = Castle agrees to contact Madani about Rawlins, but while he and Lieberman are watching her to ensure she is not corrupt, Wilson's bombs go off around New York, killing several people and injuring others. He targeted those he considered to be anti-guns, as explained in a letter he sends to Page in the hopes that she will champion him standing up against the system and publish his letter in her paper. She goes on the radio to disavow Wilson, who anonymously calls in to threaten her. Castle recognizes Wilson from the radio, having met him when visiting Hoyle once, and has Lieberman find Wilson. Meanwhile, Hoyle searches for Wilson, and when he tries to stop him, Wilson beats Hoyle with his own prosthetic leg and ties him to another bomb. Castle comes across this scene, and convinces Wilson to disarm the bomb, but not before Wilson calls the police. Castle is chased from the scene, his face caught on camera.

Wilson kills one of Russo's men and steals his uniform. Madani informs her superior Rafael Hernandez of everything she knows, and he informs her that the team from the warehouse were all ex-Anvil. Madani confronts Russo about this at the hotel where the fundraiser is to be held. Page arrives at the hotel to interview Ori before the fundraiser, during which Wilson blasts his way into the room and attempts to shoot Ori. Castle arrives to protect them, but Wilson reveals that he is wearing an [[explosive belt]] and takes Page hostage. Wilson and Page enter an elevator, while Castle is chased down the stairs by Anvil soldiers until he is confronted by Madani and Russo. Russo shoots at Castle and then refuses to let Madani arrest him; she realizes that he had killed Stein. Before the standoff escalates, police arrive and arrest Russo and Madani. Castle escapes and finds Wilson. Castle helps Page get free, and Wilson blows himself up. Castle escapes while Det. Sgt.

Madani confronts Russo about Stein's death, but he pretends to not be involved. She convinces Hernandez to take further action anyway, and they go to James, telling her about Rawlins and Cerberus. With the police searching for Castle, Zach goes against Sarah's wishes and calls the authorities. When police officers arrive with the intention of taking them away, Sarah's daughter Leo hides. Before Castle leaves Lieberman, they see footage from his house of Sarah and Zach being taken away. Castle sends Lieberman to find Leo, while he waits for Russo to trace his phone from Sarah's. A group of soldiers arrive at the base, and Castle kills them all, only stopping to question a soldier about where Russo, Sarah, and Zach are, though this is unsuccessful. James confronts Rawlins, who offers up Russo as a scapegoat to clear the name of the CIA, which she accepts on the condition that he resigns.

Castle officially confesses to his crimes for Madani, while Lieberman secretly does so only if their deal is changed: at the swap, Lieberman is apparently caught in the crossfire when Homeland agents arrive, with Castle being taken by Russo and Sarah and Zach going free. Lieberman then revealed to his family that this was a ruse so that he could be with them. While being held captive, Russo confesses to Castle that he knew of the plan to massacre Castle\u2019s family yet he did nothing to prevent it. Castle is tortured by Russo until he unlocks the computer, allowing them to destroy all of the files (not knowing that Lieberman has already given copies to Madani). Russo promises to kill Castle quickly in exchange, but Rawlins arrives to torture Castle himself, wanting revenge. Russo helps Castle get free, and Castle kills Rawlins.

Russo kills a group of agents sent after him, and then finds Hoyle and holds him hostage. Castle arrives, and Russo agrees to meet with him that night, choosing to do so at the [[carousel]] where Castle's family died. Madani tracks Castle's phone there, and decides to follow him despite being told to take no further action by Hernandez and James. Castle and Russo fight, and when Madani arrives, Russo shoots her in the head. Castle eventually gets the upper hand, but chooses not to kill Russo. He instead smashes Russo's face into a pane of glass, permanently disfiguring him. Castle is taken into custody, while Madani and Russo are taken to a hospital, where they survive. Three days later, Hernandez and James free Castle, giving him a chance at a new life at the request of Madani. Russo is officially blamed for his crimes.

The series would be centered on [[Jon Bernthal]] as [[Punisher|Frank Castle]], and was described as a stand-alone series apart from those leading up to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover event.<ref name=\"PunisherTVLine\" /><ref name=\"PunisherTHR\" /><ref name=\"SarandosJan2016\" /> That April, Netflix officially ordered a full 13 episode season of ''The Punisher'', confirmed Bernthal's involvement, and named [[Steve Lightfoot]] as executive producer and showrunner.<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /><ref name=\"PunisherEpCount\" /> Asked whether he would rather have a 10 episode season given the longer 13 episode-seasons have been criticized for other Marvel Netflix series, Lightfoot said that he wanted the season to be a \"slow burn show\" that was character-driven, and that he felt they had the right amount of story to fill the 13 episodes.<ref name=\"LightfootColliderJul2018\" />\n\n===Writing===\nLightfoot had a loose idea of what the \"journey of Season 1\" would be when he joined the series, and this was fleshed-out and altered in the writers room throughout work on the season.<ref name=\"LightfootColliderJul2018\" /> Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] said the season would ask the questions \"Who is Frank? What is Frank going to do? And who's going to try and stop Frank?\"<ref name=\"RT12Questions\" /> Lightfoot chose not to adapt any specific version of the character from the comics and instead looked to the work that was done in ''Daredevil'' defining the character. That series' depiction was what got Lightfoot interested in the character, and he wanted it to dictate this series' direction. ''The Punisher'' begins with a teaser featuring Castle killing the gang members that he believes are responsible for his family's death, which is a conclusion to the character's story in ''Daredevil''. The series then jumps ahead to the character \"stuck in the past and sort of crippled by this grief\".<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> The season also depicts some events from before the second season of ''Daredevil'', which Bernthal described as being \"loose with chronology\";<ref name=\"SFXMagazine\" /> this includes an explanation of Castle's time serving in [[Kandahar]], which had been mentioned in ''Daredevil'' and was something that Lightfoot felt this series should address.<ref name=\"Lightfoot/FilmNov2017\" />\n\nAs a fan of [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and 1970s [[Urban fiction|urban]] [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]], Lightfoot felt that the series should combine those ideas due to Castle's antihero persona being an archetype of Western films but set in the urban environment of New York City. Lightfoot looked to films from those genres as inspiration for tone and style, ideas, and themes for the series, and also looked to 1970s [[Conspiracy fiction|conspiracy thriller]] films due to Castle being a fugitive in the series and the general sense of paranoia. The series makes a reference to ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' (1976), while Lightfoot described the first episode of the series as a modern \"updating\" of ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953).<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> Lightfoot also took inspiration from the [[Bourne (film series)|''Bourne'' film series]] and the film ''[[American Sniper]]'' (2014) for the series.<ref name=\"RT12Questions\" /> Regarding his previous television series ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'', Lightfoot stated that he learned from that series' creator [[Bryan Fuller]] to make an antihero like [[Hannibal Lecter]] relatable to the audience by finding \"something in them that's universal that we can all feel\", such as Lector being lonely. Carrying this over to ''The Punisher'', Lightfoot saw in Castle the idea of \"a man whose family was taken from him at a young age\" and that a series focused on him should be an exploration of his grief and how he responds to it. Lightfoot felt that even audience members who did not agree with Castle's actions would be able to go on a \"journey\" with the character if they understood this aspect of him.<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=\"We talked a lot as we developed the show that once you take hold of the hand of violence it's impossible to let it go. That relationship to violence really interested me, not just the fact he has the ability to use it but also the cost of it.\"|source=\u2014Showrunner Steve Lightfoot on violence in ''The Punisher''<ref name=\"SFXMagazine\" />}}\nRather than show the \"beautiful\" scenes of horror that were created for ''Hannibal'', Lightfoot wanted to follow the lead of the character's fight scenes in ''Daredevil'' by not shying away from the cost of the actual actions, feeling that showing the brutal reality of Castle's actions would better convey to the audience that \"This stuff hurts, and it's not OK\" rather than glossing over the violence which he felt would have been worse.<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> He elaborated that he was unsure if the series was the most violent Marvel Netflix series, as he was simply taking the level of violence he saw depicted in ''Daredevil'' as a baseline for this series, and that it is important to remember that \"a lot of what he's doing is wrong. We have to let the audience lose him at times and let him win them back. To just wholeheartedly be behind him wouldn't be right\". Despite this, Lightfoot wanted to convey the character's feelings and thoughts to help the audience understand the character, and often used flashbacks or dreams featuring his family since Castle does not talk much and having constant flashbacks also represented how he is unable to stop thinking about them.<ref name=\"Lightfoot/FilmNov2017\" />\n\nLightfoot described Castle as a metaphor for \"the fact that we\u2019ve been sending men to war for 15 years now and then bringing them back and expecting them to just fit back in. Clearly, that isn't what happens.\" Having not served in the military himself, Lightfoot spent time with the rest of the series' writers reading first-person accounts and memoirs from real-life war veterans, and the series also had consultants from the military, the Special Forces, and the CIA including one military consultant who read every script of the series and gave notes. Noting that a vocal community of United States soldiers and veterans were fans of the Punisher character, Lightfoot and Bernthal ensured that the series was always respectful of the military and law enforcement despite Castle's actions being generally criminal; Lightfoot said it was an \"interesting thing to be respectful of the police and at the same time, the character is beyond the law.\" Feeling that it was not his place to preach about the politics of vigilantism or the [[Gun politics in the United States|United States gun control debate]], Lightfoot wanted to create a \"body of characters where you feel like all sides and issues were given a voice so the audience can decide\", from a veteran who is a \"gentle group-therapy leader\" to a \"gun nut\".<ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> When creating an original character for the series to serve as the \"tough nemesis cop\" who is hunting Castle, Lightfoot decided to \"mix the paradigm up\" by making the character female and having her be his equal. Lightfoot noted that the writer's room, which included both men and women, had \"a lot of fun\" with this idea. They also wanted the character to be of Middle Eastern descent and be as big of a patriot as Castle and an action hero in her own right. This character became Dinah Madani. Lightfoot did not want the \"spiderweb\" of supporting characters in the series to be \"sidekicks\" to Castle, and instead have \"their own narrative and their own story that was the most important thing to them\".<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher,<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /> [[Ebon Moss-Bachrach]] as [[Microchip (comics)|David Lieberman / Micro]],<ref name=\"MarvelOct2016\" /><ref name=\"MicroName\" /> [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Billy Russo]], [[Amber Rose Revah]] as Dinah Madani,<ref name=\"MarvelOct2016\" /> [[Daniel Webber (actor)|Daniel Webber]] as Lewis Wilson,<ref name=\"NewCastOct2016\" /><ref name=\"Wilson\" /> [[Paul Schulze]] as [[William Rawlins]], [[Jason R. Moore]] as [[Curtis Hoyle]], [[Michael Nathanson (actor)|Michael Nathanson]] as Sam Stein, [[Jaime Ray Newman]] as Sarah Lieberman,<ref name=\"NewCastOct2016\" /> and [[Deborah Ann Woll]] as [[Karen Page]].<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> Bernthal and Woll both reprise their roles from ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\nIn August 2017, [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]] was revealed to be portraying Farah Madani, Dinah's mother, in a recurring role for the season.<ref name=\"Aghdashloo\" /> Also recurring in the season are Jordan Mahome as Isaac Lange,<ref name=\"Mahome\" /> Kelli Barrett as [[Maria Castle]],<ref name=\"ComicBookCast\" /> Aidan Pierce Brennan as [[Frank Castle Jr.]],<ref name=\"RT12Questions\" /> [[Nicolette Pierini]] as [[Lisa Castle]],<ref name=\"CosmicBookCast\" /> Ripley Sobo as Leo Lieberman, Kobi Frumer as Zach Lieberman,<ref name=\"ComicBookCast\" /> and [[Tony Plana]] as Rafael Hernandez.<ref name=\"Plana\" /> [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]] and [[Royce Johnson]] reprise their roles from previous Marvel Netflix series as [[Turk Barrett]] and [[Brett Mahoney]], respectively.<ref name=\"Morgan\" /><ref name=\"BustleEggs\" /> [[Geoffrey Cantor (actor)|Geoffrey Cantor]] and [[Clancy Brown]] reprise their respective ''Daredevil'' roles as [[Mitchell Ellison]] and [[Ray Schoonover (comics)|Ray Schoonover]].<ref name=\"FlickeringMythCast\" />\n\nIn addition to several actors portraying war veterans, including Mahome, the series also cast real-life war veterans as extras and supporting cast for scenes such as support group meetings. Mahome, whose father served in the military, found this to be a powerful experience and helpful for his acting in the series.<ref name=\"Mahome\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky, who served as costume designer for the first seasons of ''Daredevil'', ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', and ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', had the choice between designing for ''The Defenders'' or for ''The Punisher'' due to a scheduling conflict between the two productions, and chose to work on ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"MaslanskyElite\" /> Instead, Lorraine Calvert designed the costumes for ''The Punisher'' after introducing the look of the character in the second season of ''Daredevil''; her take on the character's \"beloved\" comic-inspired costume balances the original design, Bernthal's needs as an actor and interpretation of the character, and Lightfoot's intentions for the tone of the series.<ref name=\"Calvert\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on October 3, 2016 in Brooklyn, New York,<ref name=\"PunisherFilming1\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> under the working title ''Crime''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> Locations for the production included [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]],<ref name=\"GreenpointFilming\" /> the [[Williamsburg Bridge]], [[Columbus Circle]] and [[Central Park West]], Cortlandt Alley, [[Circle Line Downtown]] cruises, the Manhattan Family Court building, [[Long Island City]], Grand Ferry Park in South [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], [[Sunnyside, Queens]], [[Pulaski Bridge]], the [[Roosevelt Island]] and its steam plant, the [[Bronx County Courthouse]], [[Newtown Creek]], [[The Roosevelt Hotel (Manhattan)|The Roosevelt Hotel]], [[Astoria Park]], [[Tudor City]], [[Hunts Point, Bronx]], the [[Forest Park Carousel]], the [[Bronx\u2013Whitestone Bridge]],<ref name=\"UntappedCities\" /> the \"[[Goodfellas|GoodFellas Diner]]\" before it was damaged in a 2018 fire and the [[Mount Zion Cemetery (New York City)|Mount Zion Cemetery]], both in [[Maspeth, Queens]],<ref name=\"GoodFellas\" /><ref name=\"UntappedCities\" /> and in [[Astoria, Queens]].<ref name=\"AstoriaFilming\" /> A car chase for the season was filmed at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] in night shoots, with Moss-Bachrach driving one of the cars.<ref name=\"Moss-BachrachRTNov2017\" /> Filming for the season [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on April 9, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingWrap\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects supervisor Greg Anderson and vendor [[FuseFX]] returned from the first season of ''Luke Cage'' to create the visual effects for ''The Punisher'', creating 855 visual effects shots across the season. Their team changed in size for each episode, but generally consisted of 15 to 20 people.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> Due to the realistic tone of the series, which does not feature any superpowers, the visual effects department had to work even harder than usual to ensure their effects were believable,<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /><ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> with a focus on creating \"gunplay, knifeplay, explosions and other real world effects.\" They preferred to augment practical effects rather than start from scratch to help with realism as well as the series' budget and schedule.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" />\n\nAs an example of the work Fuse did during fight sequences, Anderson discussed the scene where Russo and his men attack Micro's basement. Though practical prop weapons were used for the fight, Fuse had to augment the action with computer generated blood, knives, and muzzle flashes, as well as a computer generated head that is blown apart by a shotgun. The sequence was thoroughly storyboarded and pre-visualized to plan out the exact visuals required. Because the scene, like many others throughout the season, required a dark environment the visual effects team had to work with the cinematography department to decide where the low-light should be practical and where color-grading could be used to alter a more brightly-lit set given it is difficult to integrate visual effects with dark images. Conversely to this scene, a sequence such as when Russo blows up a hideout required minimal visual effects work because the explosion was shot practically, with Fuse mainly just adding some windows to the building that were removed for the explosion.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> \n\nThe most technically difficult scene of the season to create was in the first episode, where Castle shoots someone from across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. Anderson estimated that the scene was 90 percent digital, with the environment between Castle and his target created entirely by the visual effects department.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /> So that Moore could portray amputee Curtis Hoyle, Fuse had to digitally replace his leg in several shots. This involved Moore wearing a green sleeve over his leg and Fuse replacing it with a stump. The company also had to recreate the background behind Moore's actual leg which was often the most difficult part, such as when he is getting out of bed and realistic-looking digital cloth needed to match with the actual sheets that were on set.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /> Additionally, visual effects were used to augment cement in the sequence where people are thrown into it. The special effects department created a mixture to look like cement for use while filming the scene, but it ultimately did not look realistic on camera and had to be changed digitally.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn April 2017, [[Tyler Bates]] was announced as the composer for ''The Punisher'', after previously composing for Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> In order to \"get into the dark corners of the Punisher's mind,\" Bates played \"more of a broken blues\" guitar, which was augmented with talkbox effects and other \"guitar noises\", along with guitar-vol and melodica. On this style, Bates said, \"The rough edges and broken nature of [music like this] leaves a great deal of space for emotion and interesting color\u2014and a bit of an attitude. Otherwise it's not going to be an authentic expression of the idea. There's a darkness in there that I'm happy to tap into.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by [[Hollywood Records]] on November 17, 2017 in conjunction with the season's Netflix release.

Andrew Liptak of ''[[The Verge]]'' said it \"sets up ''The Punisher'' with its own distinct tone that's different from the other Marvel Netflix shows. It wades into government conspiracies and hacking, which is reminiscent of shows like [[CBS]]'s ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'' or [[USA Network|USA]]'s ''[[Mr. Robot]]'', but with more gunfire.\"<ref name=\"VergeTrailer\" /> [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]'s Kendall Ashley called the trailer \"intense, super bloody, and has [me] INCREDIBLY pumped for the show's premiere.\" She added that \"if this trailer is any indication, ''The Punisher'' is definitely going to live up to fan expectations\". Ashley felt the inclusion of \"[[One (Metallica song)|One]]\" by [[Metallica]] in the trailer \"helps paint Frank as a badass unlike any we've seen on the Marvel Netflix shows so far.\"<ref name=\"NerdistTrailer\" /> Cooper Hood, writing for [[Screen Rant]] felt the trailer would \"only increase the fever for\" the series despite it not yet having a release date, with it more closely fitting the \"mold\" of the character than the more cryptic videos previously released. He also found it \"well-cut\" to the beat of the song, which he praised as \"amplifying the intensity\".<ref name=\"ScreenRantTrailer\" />\n\nBy the end of September, Netflix had updated their viral website for the ''New York Bulletin'' to include a profile page for Karen Page. After revealing her login credentials in a post on ''Daredevil''{{'}}s Facebook page, readers who visited Page's profile found images referencing Page's research into Castle from the second season of ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"NYBulletinViralSite\" /> Bernthal and other members of the cast were scheduled to appear at New York Comic Con 2017 to promote the season,<ref name=\"NYCC2017\" /> but the panel was cancelled after the 2017 Las Vegas Strip shooting.<ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /> Two weeks later, a second trailer was released revealing the season's release date of November 17, 2017. Tom Philip at ''[[GQ]]'' was not very enthused with the trailer, saying it was \"hard to get super jazzed about another gritty, ultra-violent, gun-loving, non-superhero show right now.\" He was critical of the \"utilitarian-sounding writing\" in the trailer, but felt the chemistry between Bernthal and Woll would be a reason to watch the series. Philip also felt the addition of Moss-Bachrach was \"curious\", and said \"at least [the series is] a swing for the fences from a TV studio that tends to play it astoundingly safe.\"<ref name=\"GQTrailer2\" /> Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted that the gun violence sequences featured were mainly \"flashbacks with military men doing military things in full fatigues or scenes of bad guys shooting at not-so-bad guys with heavy gunfire\", which was a strong contrast to the first trailer. Mendelson felt this shift in the marketing strategy could have been in response to the Las Vegas shootings.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer2\" /> [[TechCrunch]]'s Darrell Etherington agreed with Mendelson, noting how the trailer \"plays up Castle's motivations and the more human side of the story\", while still looking \"gritty and dark, [and] Bernthal's portrayal looking as strong as ever.\" Etherington also criticized the soundtrack of the trailer.<ref name=\"TechCrunchTrailer2\" /> ''The Punisher'' had its red carpet premiere on November 6, 2017, in New York City at the [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] [[AMC Loews]] theatre.<ref name=\"Premiere\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe first season of ''The Punisher'' was released on November 17, 2017 on the [[streaming service]] Netflix, worldwide.<ref name=\"MarvelOct2016\" /><ref name=\"NovemberRelease\" /> In July 2016, Netflix COO [[Ted Sarandos]] had stated that ''The Punisher'' would not debut until 2018 at the earliest, following ''The Defenders''{{'}} August 18, 2017 release,<ref name=\"Sarandos2018Releases\" /><ref name=\"DefendersReleaseDate\" /> but in October 2016 Marvel confirmed the 2017 release instead.<ref name=\"MarvelOct2016\" />\n\nIn early September 2017, Dominic Patten and Denise Petski of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' commented on the lack of specific release date for the season at the time, calling it \"an unusual\" and \"rare move for Marvel and Netflix, who usually give a lot of lead-up to the launch\" of their high profile series. The pair felt with the increased marketing of the season, it would release \"sooner rather than later\".<ref name=\"DeadlineReleaseSep2017\" /> Allison Keene of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] expressed irritation at this because she and other television journalists were unable to plan content without knowing the release date, while fans anticipating the series would watch it \"whenever it appears\" regardless of when the date is announced.<ref name=\"ColliderReleaseDate\" /> ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'}}s Susana Polo felt Marvel and Netflix would announce the date at their scheduled [[New York Comic Con]] 2017 panel in October, as the convention had been used in previous years to reveal \"breaking fall Marvel/Netflix news\".<ref name=\"PolygonReleaseDate\" /> It was soon reported that this was indeed the case, with Netflix planning a surprise \"drop\" release of the season after the New York Comic Con panel,<ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /><ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /> mimicking a strategy from the music industry where an artist's album is released \"with little or no fanfare\".<ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /> However, Marvel and Netflix decided to delay the release of the season to later in 2017 following the [[Las Vegas shooting]] and subsequent cancelling of the panel.<ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /><ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /> Two weeks later, the November 17 release was announced.<ref name=\"NovemberRelease\" />\n\nRegarding the decisions made concerning the New York Comic Con panel and the season's release, Loeb said that they were made \"specifically because it was a week after a horrible, horrible incident. It hasn't changed the television series, the show is not predominantly about gun violence, and in fact it shows you the problems that occur in that world.\"<ref name=\"LoebOct2017\" /> Bernthal and Lightfoot felt delaying the release of the season \"was the right decision\" out of respect for the victims,<ref name=\"BernthalIndieWire\" /><ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> with Lightfoot saying there was no reason to go ahead with the panel if it was going to upset \"even one person involved\" with the shooting.<ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> Moore had initially felt the season would not be released at all once the panel was cancelled.<ref name=\"Collider30ThingsS2\" /> Between the Las Vegas shooting and subsequent delaying of the season, and the eventual November 17 release, the United States experienced another [[mass shooting]] with the [[Sutherland Springs church shooting]].

This extended to the repeated depictions of the death of Castle's wife, which Lightfoot did not think was in bad taste because it was about visualizing Castle's feelings, something he would not talk about; the deaths evolve through the season until they show Castle as the one killing her to signify that he blames himself for her death, which Lightfoot felt was important relationship building

Six months later, he is awakened at 3:00 every morning by nightmares of his family's deaths. Castle passes much of his time working, taking down an old building. This angers the other workers, who are denied extra pay due to Castle's overtime. He also visits Curtis Hoyle, a veteran that Castle served alongside before his family died, and mentions that his time in Afghanistan involved some activities that he did not want to discuss. A new worker, Donny Chavez, attempts to befriend Castle, and proves himself to be eager to please the other workers. He agrees to help them steal money from a local gang, but he accidentally reveals his identity to the gangsters. The others attempt to kill Chavez at the worksite, but Castle is there and kills them first. He then kills the gangsters before they can hunt Chavez. Meanwhile, [[Homeland security]] agent Dinah Madani begins investigating Castle's Afghanistan troop, believing they killed her previous partner.\n |LineColor = 161719\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Punisher (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Two Dead Men\n |DirectedBy = Tom Shankland\n |WrittenBy = Steve Lightfoot\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary = A man calling himself \"Micro\" monitors cameras around New York City, and begins tracking Castle from the building where he murdered the gangsters. He contacts Castle and tells him to check a disk that he had left for Castle at his old family home; the disk contains footage of Castle and his unit in [[Kandahar]], torturing and murdering Madani's partner Ahmad Zubair. Madani had that video before it was stolen, and now wants to discuss Castle\u2014who is believed to be dead\u2014with his old army friend [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Billy Russo]]. Her superior Carson Wolf forbids her from this, but she convinces him to use Russo's new business Anvil for field training, and talks to Russo then. Castle's journalist friend [[Karen Page]] agrees to help him find Micro, and learns that he is former NSA analyst [[Microchip (comics)|David Lieberman]], who was caught leaking secrets and was believed to be killed. Wolf covered up the story, so Castle tortures and kills him, learning that the death of his family was just one attempt to kill him.

Soon after, Wolf hunted Lieberman down with special forces, shooting him and framing him for a crime. The shot hit Lieberman's cellphone and he was able to go underground. Lieberman gets the upper-hand on Castle, who reveals that in Kandahar he was selected for a special unit, Cerberus, alongside Russo, and they were used by a mysterious agent to hunt down and kill high value targets. Castle had not known who Zubair was when he was ordered to kill him, and had grown increasingly disillusioned with his command. When they ignored his and Russo's advice and went ahead with a mission that killed several other members of Cerberus, Castle was able to complete the mission in an intense killing spree, but he and Russo then transferred from the unit. Now, Castle agrees to work with Lieberman to hunt down those behind Cerberus.\n |LineColor = 161719\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Punisher (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = Resupply\n |DirectedBy = [[Kari Skogland]]\n |WrittenBy = Dario Scardapane\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary = Requiring weapons and ammunition, Castle gets Lieberman to search law enforcement databases for known shipments of guns. Castle follows a lead to dealer [[Turk Barrett]], but finds that the shipment was a special delivery and does not serve their needs. Barrett says that the main shipment is going to someone else, and Lieberman soon finds that Homeland security is working on an operation to buy the shipment in hopes of arresting those selling the weapons. Madani, now acting-Special Agent in Charge, wishes to investigate Wolf's murder, but is warned against pursuing the matter by another superior, and is instead told to focus on the weapons operation. She helps coordinate the operation, the plans for which Lieberman learned by hacking into Homeland security. He and Castle are able to disrupt the agents and hijack the weapons, but they are pursued by Madani. Lieberman crashes into Madani's vehicle, seriously injuring her.

Her team is interrogated regarding the failed weapons operation, but she does not reveal that Castle is alive, and instead convinces another agent, Sam Stein, to help her. She interviews Page, who later tells Castle about Madani's investigation. Meanwhile, William Rawlins\u2014the agent in charge of Cerberus\u2014receives a medal for his achievements during wartime, and is asked by the [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director of the CIA]] Marion James to serve as her deputy when she is promoted. Lieberman points out that the video of Zubair's murder must have been made by one of the other Cerberus soldiers, and Castle believes it was Gunner Henderson, who also knew what they were doing was wrong. They find Henderson living in seclusion, but Rawlins sends soldiers to kill him, discovering that Castle is alive.

Hoyle later bails Lewis Wilson, a young veteran that he had been trying to help rehabilitate, out of jail; he had been arrested protesting [[Gun politics in the United States|for the right to bear arms]], and had been abandoned by another veteran he had admired, O'Connor. Hoyle reveals that the latter had lied about serving, and Wilson finds and kills O'Connor. Madani and Russo sleep together, and he realizes that she is using him to investigate Castle. She tells him that Castle is alive, and Russo broadcasts a message that Lieberman picks up. Castle meets with Russo to explain that Cerberus was a front for a major drug operation, and that he is fighting to take down those responsible. Russo offers to give Castle a chance at a new life instead, but Castle turns him down. Madani finds Henderson's body, and deduces what happened. She also gains proof that Castle is alive from his blood being at the scene.

Russo tells Madani that he does not believe Castle is alive. She realizes that Henderson was only targeted after she had started investigating him, and that her office may be bugged; Madani and Stein find the device. Castle and Lieberman plan to take their next target, Col. Morty Bennett, one of the leaders of Cerberus. Rawlins and Russo expect this, and also discuss Madani's investigation, with Rawlins comfortable that she has no leads. He also tells Russo that he should have killed Castle when he had the chance. Castle infiltrates the military base where Bennet lives, but Russo is expecting him and attacks him with a group of soldiers. Castle fights them off, not knowing who Russo is beneath a mask, while Lieberman gains remote access to Bennett's phone. Castle then escapes, being forced to injure a young soldier on his way. They track Bennett's phone to Rawlins, who has Russo kill Bennett.

He later tells Madani that he grew up in the system. Lieberman and Castle identify Rawlins. The cameras that Lieberman is using to keep watch on his family go down, and he sends Castle to investigate. Castle has been spending time with Lieberman's wife Sarah since meeting her while investigating who \"Micro\" was, and finds out that she had disconnected the internet as punishment for her son, Zach. Castle reconnects the internet, and has some drinks with Sarah. She kisses him, but they both acknowledge that this is a mistake. She then asks Castle to intervene with Zach, and he realizes that the boy needs a father figure to spend time with. Knowing that she is being watched, Madani sets up a new operation, but releases false plans to be found. When Russo arrives at a warehouse with a team of mercenaries per that latter plan, he is ambushed by Homeland security. His team are all killed, but Russo is able to kill Stein and escape without Madani seeing him.\n |LineColor = 161719 \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Punisher (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = Front Toward Enemy\n |DirectedBy = Marc Jobst\n |WrittenBy = Angela LaManna\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary = Castle agrees to contact Madani about Rawlins, but while he and Lieberman are watching her to ensure she is not corrupt, Wilson's bombs go off around New York, killing several people and injuring others. He targeted those he considered to be anti-guns, as explained in a letter he sends to Page in the hopes that she will champion him standing up against the system and publish his letter in her paper. She goes on the radio to disavow Wilson, who anonymously calls in to threaten her. Castle recognizes Wilson from the radio, having met him when visiting Hoyle once, and has Lieberman find Wilson. Meanwhile, Hoyle searches for Wilson, and when he tries to stop him, Wilson beats Hoyle with his own prosthetic leg and ties him to another bomb. Castle comes across this scene, and convinces Wilson to disarm the bomb, but not before Wilson calls the police. Castle is chased from the scene, his face caught on camera. Lieberman goes to Madani and tells her about Rawlins, as Castle is identified on television as being alive, and labelled a bomber.\n |LineColor = 161719\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Punisher (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n |Title = Virtue of the Vicious\n |DirectedBy = Jim O'Hanlon\n |WrittenBy = [[Ken Kristensen]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary = Wilson targets Senator Stan Ori, an anti-gun proponent who is planning a fundraiser for victims of the bombings, and has hired Anvil as security. Wilson kills one of Russo's men and steals his uniform. Madani informs her superior Rafael Hernandez of everything she knows, and he informs her that the team from the warehouse were all ex-Anvil. Madani confronts Russo about this at the hotel where the fundraiser is to be held. Page arrives at the hotel to interview Ori before the fundraiser, during which Wilson blasts his way into the room and attempts to shoot Ori. Castle arrives to protect them, but Wilson reveals that he is wearing an [[explosive belt]] and takes Page hostage. Wilson and Page enter an elevator, while Castle is chased down the stairs by Anvil soldiers until he is confronted by Madani and Russo. Russo shoots at Castle and then refuses to let Madani arrest him; she realizes that he had killed Stein. Before the standoff escalates, police arrive and arrest Russo and Madani. Castle escapes and finds Wilson. Castle helps Page get free, and Wilson blows himself up. Castle escapes while Det. Sgt.

Madani confronts Russo about Stein's death, but he pretends to not be involved. She convinces Hernandez to take further action anyway, and they go to James, telling her about Rawlins and Cerberus. With the police searching for Castle, Zach goes against Sarah's wishes and calls the authorities. When police officers arrive with the intention of taking them away, Sarah's daughter Leo hides. Before Castle leaves Lieberman, they see footage from his house of Sarah and Zach being taken away. Castle sends Lieberman to find Leo, while he waits for Russo to trace his phone from Sarah's. A group of soldiers arrive at the base, and Castle kills them all, only stopping to question a soldier about where Russo, Sarah, and Zach are, though this is unsuccessful. James confronts Rawlins, who offers up Russo as a scapegoat to clear the name of the CIA, which she accepts on the condition that he resigns.

Castle officially confesses to his crimes for Madani, while Lieberman secretly does so only if their deal is changed: at the swap, Lieberman is apparently caught in the crossfire when Homeland agents arrive, with Castle being taken by Russo and Sarah and Zach going free. Lieberman then revealed to his family that this was a ruse so that he could be with them. While being held captive, Russo confesses to Castle that he knew of the plan to massacre Castle\u2019s family yet he did nothing to prevent it. Castle is tortured by Russo until he unlocks the computer, allowing them to destroy all of the files (not knowing that Lieberman has already given copies to Madani). Russo promises to kill Castle quickly in exchange, but Rawlins arrives to torture Castle himself, wanting revenge. Russo helps Castle get free, and Castle kills Rawlins.

Madani tracks Castle's phone there, and decides to follow him despite being told to take no further action by Hernandez and James. Castle and Russo fight, and when Madani arrives, Russo shoots her in the head. Castle eventually gets the upper hand, but chooses not to kill Russo. He instead smashes Russo's face into a pane of glass, permanently disfiguring him. Castle is taken into custody, while Madani and Russo are taken to a hospital, where they survive. Three days later, Hernandez and James free Castle, giving him a chance at a new life at the request of Madani. Russo is officially blamed for his crimes. After several hearings and debriefs, Lieberman is released and returns to his family.

The series would be centered on [[Jon Bernthal]] as [[Punisher|Frank Castle]], and was described as a stand-alone series apart from those leading up to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover event.<ref name=\"PunisherTVLine\" /><ref name=\"PunisherTHR\" /><ref name=\"SarandosJan2016\" /> That April, Netflix officially ordered a full 13 episode season of ''The Punisher'', confirmed Bernthal's involvement, and named [[Steve Lightfoot]] as executive producer and showrunner.<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /><ref name=\"PunisherEpCount\" /> Asked whether he would rather have a 10 episode season given the longer 13 episode-seasons have been criticized for other Marvel Netflix series, Lightfoot said that he wanted the season to be a \"slow burn show\" that was character-driven, and that he felt they had the right amount of story to fill the 13 episodes.<ref name=\"LightfootColliderJul2018\" />\n\n===Writing===\nLightfoot had a loose idea of what the \"journey of Season 1\" would be when he joined the series, and this was fleshed-out and altered in the writers room throughout work on the season.<ref name=\"LightfootColliderJul2018\" /> Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] said the season would ask the questions \"Who is Frank? What is Frank going to do? And who's going to try and stop Frank?\"<ref name=\"RT12Questions\" /> Lightfoot chose not to adapt any specific version of the character from the comics and instead looked to the work that was done in ''Daredevil'' defining the character. That series' depiction was what got Lightfoot interested in the character, and he wanted it to dictate this series' direction. ''The Punisher'' begins with a teaser featuring Castle killing the gang members that he believes are responsible for his family's death, which is a conclusion to the character's story in ''Daredevil''. The series then jumps ahead to the character \"stuck in the past and sort of crippled by this grief\".<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> The season also depicts some events from before the second season of ''Daredevil'', which Bernthal described as being \"loose with chronology\";<ref name=\"SFXMagazine\" /> this includes an explanation of Castle's time serving in [[Kandahar]], which had been mentioned in ''Daredevil'' and was something that Lightfoot felt this series should address.<ref name=\"Lightfoot/FilmNov2017\" />\n\nAs a fan of [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and 1970s [[Urban fiction|urban]] [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]], Lightfoot felt that the series should combine those ideas due to Castle's antihero persona being an archetype of Western films but set in the urban environment of New York City. Lightfoot looked to films from those genres as inspiration for tone and style, ideas, and themes for the series, and also looked to 1970s [[Conspiracy fiction|conspiracy thriller]] films due to Castle being a fugitive in the series and the general sense of paranoia. The series makes a reference to ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' (1976), while Lightfoot described the first episode of the series as a modern \"updating\" of ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953).<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> Lightfoot also took inspiration from the [[Bourne (film series)|''Bourne'' film series]] and the film ''[[American Sniper]]'' (2014) for the series.<ref name=\"RT12Questions\" /> Regarding his previous television series ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'', Lightfoot stated that he learned from that series' creator [[Bryan Fuller]] to make an antihero like [[Hannibal Lecter]] relatable to the audience by finding \"something in them that's universal that we can all feel\", such as Lector being lonely. Carrying this over to ''The Punisher'', Lightfoot saw in Castle the idea of \"a man whose family was taken from him at a young age\" and that a series focused on him should be an exploration of his grief and how he responds to it. Lightfoot felt that even audience members who did not agree with Castle's actions would be able to go on a \"journey\" with the character if they understood this aspect of him.<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=\"We talked a lot as we developed the show that once you take hold of the hand of violence it's impossible to let it go. That relationship to violence really interested me, not just the fact he has the ability to use it but also the cost of it.\"|source=\u2014Showrunner Steve Lightfoot on violence in ''The Punisher''<ref name=\"SFXMagazine\" />}}\nRather than show the \"beautiful\" scenes of horror that were created for ''Hannibal'', Lightfoot wanted to follow the lead of the character's fight scenes in ''Daredevil'' by not shying away from the cost of the actual actions, feeling that showing the brutal reality of Castle's actions would better convey to the audience that \"This stuff hurts, and it's not OK\" rather than glossing over the violence which he felt would have been worse.<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> He elaborated that he was unsure if the series was the most violent Marvel Netflix series, as he was simply taking the level of violence he saw depicted in ''Daredevil'' as a baseline for this series, and that it is important to remember that \"a lot of what he's doing is wrong. We have to let the audience lose him at times and let him win them back. To just wholeheartedly be behind him wouldn't be right\". Despite this, Lightfoot wanted to convey the character's feelings and thoughts to help the audience understand the character, and often used flashbacks or dreams featuring his family since Castle does not talk much and having constant flashbacks also represented how he is unable to stop thinking about them.<ref name=\"Lightfoot/FilmNov2017\" />\n\nLightfoot described Castle as a metaphor for \"the fact that we\u2019ve been sending men to war for 15 years now and then bringing them back and expecting them to just fit back in. Clearly, that isn't what happens.\" Having not served in the military himself, Lightfoot spent time with the rest of the series' writers reading first-person accounts and memoirs from real-life war veterans, and the series also had consultants from the military, the Special Forces, and the CIA including one military consultant who read every script of the series and gave notes. Noting that a vocal community of United States soldiers and veterans were fans of the Punisher character, Lightfoot and Bernthal ensured that the series was always respectful of the military and law enforcement despite Castle's actions being generally criminal; Lightfoot said it was an \"interesting thing to be respectful of the police and at the same time, the character is beyond the law.\" Feeling that it was not his place to preach about the politics of vigilantism or the [[Gun politics in the United States|United States gun control debate]], Lightfoot wanted to create a \"body of characters where you feel like all sides and issues were given a voice so the audience can decide\", from a veteran who is a \"gentle group-therapy leader\" to a \"gun nut\".<ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> When creating an original character for the series to serve as the \"tough nemesis cop\" who is hunting Castle, Lightfoot decided to \"mix the paradigm up\" by making the character female and having her be his equal. Lightfoot noted that the writer's room, which included both men and women, had \"a lot of fun\" with this idea. They also wanted the character to be of Middle Eastern descent and be as big of a patriot as Castle and an action hero in her own right. This character became Dinah Madani. Lightfoot did not want the \"spiderweb\" of supporting characters in the series to be \"sidekicks\" to Castle, and instead have \"their own narrative and their own story that was the most important thing to them\".<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher,<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /> [[Ebon Moss-Bachrach]] as [[Microchip (comics)|David Lieberman / Micro]],<ref name=\"MarvelOct2016\" /><ref name=\"MicroName\" /> [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Billy Russo]], [[Amber Rose Revah]] as Dinah Madani,<ref name=\"MarvelOct2016\" /> [[Daniel Webber (actor)|Daniel Webber]] as Lewis Wilson,<ref name=\"NewCastOct2016\" /><ref name=\"Wilson\" /> [[Paul Schulze]] as [[William Rawlins]], [[Jason R. Moore]] as [[Curtis Hoyle]], [[Michael Nathanson (actor)|Michael Nathanson]] as Sam Stein, [[Jaime Ray Newman]] as Sarah Lieberman,<ref name=\"NewCastOct2016\" /> and [[Deborah Ann Woll]] as [[Karen Page]].<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> Bernthal and Woll both reprise their roles from ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\nIn August 2017, [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]] was revealed to be portraying Farah Madani, Dinah's mother, in a recurring role for the season.<ref name=\"Aghdashloo\" /> Also recurring in the season are Jordan Mahome as Isaac Lange,<ref name=\"Mahome\" /> Kelli Barrett as [[Maria Castle]],<ref name=\"ComicBookCast\" /> Aidan Pierce Brennan as [[Frank Castle Jr.]],<ref name=\"RT12Questions\" /> [[Nicolette Pierini]] as [[Lisa Castle]],<ref name=\"CosmicBookCast\" /> Ripley Sobo as Leo Lieberman, Kobi Frumer as Zach Lieberman,<ref name=\"ComicBookCast\" /> and [[Tony Plana]] as Rafael Hernandez.<ref name=\"Plana\" /> [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]] and [[Royce Johnson]] reprise their roles from previous Marvel Netflix series as [[Turk Barrett]] and [[Brett Mahoney]], respectively.<ref name=\"Morgan\" /><ref name=\"BustleEggs\" /> [[Geoffrey Cantor (actor)|Geoffrey Cantor]] and [[Clancy Brown]] reprise their respective ''Daredevil'' roles as [[Mitchell Ellison]] and [[Ray Schoonover (comics)|Ray Schoonover]].<ref name=\"FlickeringMythCast\" />\n\nIn addition to several actors portraying war veterans, including Mahome, the series also cast real-life war veterans as extras and supporting cast for scenes such as support group meetings. Mahome, whose father served in the military, found this to be a powerful experience and helpful for his acting in the series.<ref name=\"Mahome\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky, who served as costume designer for the first seasons of ''Daredevil'', ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', and ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', had the choice between designing for ''The Defenders'' or for ''The Punisher'' due to a scheduling conflict between the two productions, and chose to work on ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"MaslanskyElite\" /> Instead, Lorraine Calvert designed the costumes for ''The Punisher'' after introducing the look of the character in the second season of ''Daredevil''; her take on the character's \"beloved\" comic-inspired costume balances the original design, Bernthal's needs as an actor and interpretation of the character, and Lightfoot's intentions for the tone of the series.<ref name=\"Calvert\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on October 3, 2016 in Brooklyn, New York,<ref name=\"PunisherFilming1\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> under the working title ''Crime''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> Locations for the production included [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]],<ref name=\"GreenpointFilming\" /> the [[Williamsburg Bridge]], [[Columbus Circle]] and [[Central Park West]], Cortlandt Alley, [[Circle Line Downtown]] cruises, the Manhattan Family Court building, [[Long Island City]], Grand Ferry Park in South [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], [[Sunnyside, Queens]], [[Pulaski Bridge]], the [[Roosevelt Island]] and its steam plant, the [[Bronx County Courthouse]], [[Newtown Creek]], [[The Roosevelt Hotel (Manhattan)|The Roosevelt Hotel]], [[Astoria Park]], [[Tudor City]], [[Hunts Point, Bronx]], the [[Forest Park Carousel]], the [[Bronx\u2013Whitestone Bridge]],<ref name=\"UntappedCities\" /> the \"[[Goodfellas|GoodFellas Diner]]\" before it was damaged in a 2018 fire and the [[Mount Zion Cemetery (New York City)|Mount Zion Cemetery]], both in [[Maspeth, Queens]],<ref name=\"GoodFellas\" /><ref name=\"UntappedCities\" /> and in [[Astoria, Queens]].<ref name=\"AstoriaFilming\" /> A car chase for the season was filmed at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] in night shoots, with Moss-Bachrach driving one of the cars.<ref name=\"Moss-BachrachRTNov2017\" /> Filming for the season [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on April 9, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingWrap\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects supervisor Greg Anderson and vendor [[FuseFX]] returned from the first season of ''Luke Cage'' to create the visual effects for ''The Punisher'', creating 855 visual effects shots across the season. Their team changed in size for each episode, but generally consisted of 15 to 20 people.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> Due to the realistic tone of the series, which does not feature any superpowers, the visual effects department had to work even harder than usual to ensure their effects were believable,<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /><ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> with a focus on creating \"gunplay, knifeplay, explosions and other real world effects.\" They preferred to augment practical effects rather than start from scratch to help with realism as well as the series' budget and schedule.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" />\n\nAs an example of the work Fuse did during fight sequences, Anderson discussed the scene where Russo and his men attack Micro's basement. Though practical prop weapons were used for the fight, Fuse had to augment the action with computer generated blood, knives, and muzzle flashes, as well as a computer generated head that is blown apart by a shotgun. The sequence was thoroughly storyboarded and pre-visualized to plan out the exact visuals required. Because the scene, like many others throughout the season, required a dark environment the visual effects team had to work with the cinematography department to decide where the low-light should be practical and where color-grading could be used to alter a more brightly-lit set given it is difficult to integrate visual effects with dark images. Conversely to this scene, a sequence such as when Russo blows up a hideout required minimal visual effects work because the explosion was shot practically, with Fuse mainly just adding some windows to the building that were removed for the explosion.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> \n\nThe most technically difficult scene of the season to create was in the first episode, where Castle shoots someone from across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. Anderson estimated that the scene was 90 percent digital, with the environment between Castle and his target created entirely by the visual effects department.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /> So that Moore could portray amputee Curtis Hoyle, Fuse had to digitally replace his leg in several shots. This involved Moore wearing a green sleeve over his leg and Fuse replacing it with a stump. The company also had to recreate the background behind Moore's actual leg which was often the most difficult part, such as when he is getting out of bed and realistic-looking digital cloth needed to match with the actual sheets that were on set.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /> Additionally, visual effects were used to augment cement in the sequence where people are thrown into it. The special effects department created a mixture to look like cement for use while filming the scene, but it ultimately did not look realistic on camera and had to be changed digitally.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn April 2017, [[Tyler Bates]] was announced as the composer for ''The Punisher'', after previously composing for Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> In order to \"get into the dark corners of the Punisher's mind,\" Bates played \"more of a broken blues\" guitar, which was augmented with talkbox effects and other \"guitar noises\", along with guitar-vol and melodica. On this style, Bates said, \"The rough edges and broken nature of [music like this] leaves a great deal of space for emotion and interesting color\u2014and a bit of an attitude. Otherwise it's not going to be an authentic expression of the idea. There's a darkness in there that I'm happy to tap into.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by [[Hollywood Records]] on November 17, 2017 in conjunction with the season's Netflix release.

The pair felt with the increased marketing of the season, it would release \"sooner rather than later\".<ref name=\"DeadlineReleaseSep2017\" /> Allison Keene of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] expressed irritation at this because she and other television journalists were unable to plan content without knowing the release date, while fans anticipating the series would watch it \"whenever it appears\" regardless of when the date is announced.<ref name=\"ColliderReleaseDate\" /> ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'}}s Susana Polo felt Marvel and Netflix would announce the date at their scheduled [[New York Comic Con]] 2017 panel in October, as the convention had been used in previous years to reveal \"breaking fall Marvel/Netflix news\".<ref name=\"PolygonReleaseDate\" /> It was soon reported that this was indeed the case, with Netflix planning a surprise \"drop\" release of the season after the New York Comic Con panel,<ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /><ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /> mimicking a strategy from the music industry where an artist's album is released \"with little or no fanfare\".<ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /> However, Marvel and Netflix decided to delay the release of the season to later in 2017 following the [[Las Vegas shooting]] and subsequent cancelling of the panel.<ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /><ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /> Two weeks later, the November 17 release was announced.<ref name=\"NovemberRelease\" />\n\nRegarding the decisions made concerning the New York Comic Con panel and the season's release, Loeb said that they were made \"specifically because it was a week after a horrible, horrible incident. It hasn't changed the television series, the show is not predominantly about gun violence, and in fact it shows you the problems that occur in that world.\"<ref name=\"LoebOct2017\" /> Bernthal and Lightfoot felt delaying the release of the season \"was the right decision\" out of respect for the victims,<ref name=\"BernthalIndieWire\" /><ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> with Lightfoot saying there was no reason to go ahead with the panel if it was going to upset \"even one person involved\" with the shooting.<ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> Moore had initially felt the season would not be released at all once the panel was cancelled.<ref name=\"Collider30ThingsS2\" /> Between the Las Vegas shooting and subsequent delaying of the season, and the eventual November 17 release, the United States experienced another [[mass shooting]] with the [[Sutherland Springs church shooting]]. Bernthal hoped that these two shootings and the release of the season would together help further the discussion on [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]], with \"all sides of this debate\" represented in ''The Punisher''.<ref name=\"BernthalIndieWire\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nBernthal and Woll appeared at New York Comic Con in October 2016 to officially announce the start of production on the series and the latter's involvement,<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> while Bernthal presented exclusive footage from the series at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2017.<ref name=\"SDCCFootage\" /> A teaser was revealed on Netflix in August 2017 after the credits of the final episode of ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"DefendersTagTeaser\" /> Also in the month, the series' [[Twitter]] account revealed the episode titles as [[Morse code]] messages.<ref name=\"EpisodeTitles\" /> In September 2017, the series' [[Instagram]] account released viral videos made to look like security footage,<ref name=\"InstagramVideos\" /> while episodic photos and a poster for the season with a redacted release date were also released.<ref name=\"DeadlineReleaseSep2017\" /> On September 20, the official trailer for the season was released. Andrew Liptak of ''[[The Verge]]'' said it \"sets up ''The Punisher'' with its own distinct tone that's different from the other Marvel Netflix shows. It wades into government conspiracies and hacking, which is reminiscent of shows like [[CBS]]'s ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'' or [[USA Network|USA]]'s ''[[Mr. Robot]]'', but with more gunfire.\"<ref name=\"VergeTrailer\" /> [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]'s Kendall Ashley called the trailer \"intense, super bloody, and has [me] INCREDIBLY pumped for the show's premiere.\" She added that \"if this trailer is any indication, ''The Punisher'' is definitely going to live up to fan expectations\". Ashley felt the inclusion of \"[[One (Metallica song)|One]]\" by [[Metallica]] in the trailer \"helps paint Frank as a badass unlike any we've seen on the Marvel Netflix shows so far.\"<ref name=\"NerdistTrailer\" /> Cooper Hood, writing for [[Screen Rant]] felt the trailer would \"only increase the fever for\" the series despite it not yet having a release date, with it more closely fitting the \"mold\" of the character than the more cryptic videos previously released. He also found it \"well-cut\" to the beat of the song, which he praised as \"amplifying the intensity\".<ref name=\"ScreenRantTrailer\" />\n\nBy the end of September, Netflix had updated their viral website for the ''New York Bulletin'' to include a profile page for Karen Page. After revealing her login credentials in a post on ''Daredevil''{{'}}s Facebook page, readers who visited Page's profile found images referencing Page's research into Castle from the second season of ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"NYBulletinViralSite\" /> Bernthal and other members of the cast were scheduled to appear at New York Comic Con 2017 to promote the season,<ref name=\"NYCC2017\" /> but the panel was cancelled after the 2017 Las Vegas Strip shooting.<ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /> Two weeks later, a second trailer was released revealing the season's release date of November 17, 2017. Tom Philip at ''[[GQ]]'' was not very enthused with the trailer, saying it was \"hard to get super jazzed about another gritty, ultra-violent, gun-loving, non-superhero show right now.\" He was critical of the \"utilitarian-sounding writing\" in the trailer, but felt the chemistry between Bernthal and Woll would be a reason to watch the series. Philip also felt the addition of Moss-Bachrach was \"curious\", and said \"at least [the series is] a swing for the fences from a TV studio that tends to play it astoundingly safe.\"<ref name=\"GQTrailer2\" /> Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted that the gun violence sequences featured were mainly \"flashbacks with military men doing military things in full fatigues or scenes of bad guys shooting at not-so-bad guys with heavy gunfire\", which was a strong contrast to the first trailer. Mendelson felt this shift in the marketing strategy could have been in response to the Las Vegas shootings.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer2\" /> [[TechCrunch]]'s Darrell Etherington agreed with Mendelson, noting how the trailer \"plays up Castle's motivations and the more human side of the story\", while still looking \"gritty and dark, [and] Bernthal's portrayal looking as strong as ever.\" Etherington also criticized the soundtrack of the trailer.<ref name=\"TechCrunchTrailer2\" /> ''The Punisher'' had its red carpet premiere on November 6, 2017, in New York City at the [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] [[AMC Loews]] theatre.<ref name=\"Premiere\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 67% approval rating with an average rating of 6.61/10 based on 78 reviews.

This extended to the repeated depictions of the death of Castle's wife, which Lightfoot did not think was in bad taste because it was about visualizing Castle's feelings, something he would not talk about; the deaths evolve through the season until they show Castle as the one killing her to signify that he blames himself for her death, which Lightfoot felt was important relationship building

Just as they were about to set off, the heavens opened and Peebles snapped: \"I can't stand the rain.\" As a professional songwriter in constant need of new material, Bryant was used to plucking resonant phrases out of the air and he liked the idea of reacting against recent R&B hits that celebrated bad weather, such as [[the Dramatics]]' \"In the Rain\" and [[Love Unlimited]]'s \"[[Walkin' in the Rain with the One I Love]]\".  So he sat down at the piano and started riffing on the theme, weaving in ideas from Peebles and local DJ Bernie Miller.

Just as they were about to set off, the heavens opened and Peebles snapped: \"I can't stand the rain.\" As a professional songwriter in constant need of new material, Bryant was used to plucking resonant phrases out of the air and he liked the idea of reacting against recent R&B hits that celebrated bad weather, such as [[the Dramatics]]' \"In the Rain\" and [[Love Unlimited]]'s \"[[Walkin' in the Rain with the One I Love]]\".  So he sat down at the piano and started riffing on the theme, weaving in ideas from Peebles and local DJ Bernie Miller. The song was finished that night and presented the next morning to Hi's studio maestro, Willie Mitchell, who used a brand new gadget, the [[timbales|electric timbale]], to create the song's distinctive raindrop riff. It really was that easy. \"We didn't go to the concert,\" Bryant remembers. \"We forgot about the concert.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/20/ann-peebles-girl-with-the-big-voice Dorian Lynskey, \"Ann Peebles: the girl with the big voice\", ''The Guardian'', 20 February 2014].

After the [[Battle of Klyuch]], some of Samuil's soldiers, who were each blinded in one eye, settled in a village on the shore of [[Lake Prespa]]. The Byzantines called the village ''Asamati''. The Byzantine meaning of this word is \"settlement of one-eyed people\". From then on, Resen was under Byzantine rule.\n\nLater, Resen became part of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], [[Serbian Empire]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], and it was the birthplace of [[Ahmed Niyazi Bey]], an [[Albanians|Albanian]] officer from a noble family of the town, who was one of the initiators and leaders of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in the region in 1908.<ref name=\"Kedourie2000\">{{cite book|last=Kedourie|first=Sylvia|title=Seventy-five years of the Turkish Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=42jWqHghlQ4C&pg=PA32|accessdate=18 February 2011|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-5042-5|page=32}}</ref> Ahmed Niyazi Bey's most famous monument in Resen is the [[Saraj (Resen)|Saraj]], a French-style estate he built.<ref>[http://exploringmacedonia.com/?ItemID=7D670A5C9473FA4BBD3C4337BB2C8227 Macedonia National Tourism Portal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115143327/http://exploringmacedonia.com/?ItemID=7D670A5C9473FA4BBD3C4337BB2C8227 |date=November 15, 2006 }}</ref> In the late 19th and early 20th century, Resen was part of the [[Manastir Vilayet]] of the Ottoman Empire. \nFrom 1929 to 1941, Resen was part of the [[Vardar Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Resen old.jpg|Resen in the early 20th century\nFile:Sarajcrop.jpg|Old picture of the [[Saraj (Resen)|Saraj]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\nIn the late Ottoman period, according to N.

The race was the fifth round of the [[2017 FIA Formula One World Championship]] and marked the forty-seventh running of the Spanish Grand Prix as a World Championship event since the inaugural season in {{F1|1950}}, and the twenty-seventh time that a World Championship round had been held at Catalunya.\n\n==Report==\n===Free practice===\nBoth of Friday's practice sessions finished with an identical top six on the timesheet, with [[Lewis Hamilton]] heading the list, his Mercedes teammate [[Valtteri Bottas]] second and the Ferraris of [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] and [[Sebastian Vettel]] third and fourth respectively. Next came the Red Bulls, with [[Max Verstappen]] fifth in both sessions and [[Daniel Ricciardo]] sixth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Formula 1 Gran Premio de Espa\u00f1a Pirelli 2017 \u2013 Practice 1|website=Formula1.com|date=12 May 2017|url=http://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2017/races/963/spain/practice-1.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Formula 1 Gran Premio de Espa\u00f1a Pirelli 2017 \u2013 Practice 2|website=Formula1.com|date=12 May 2017|url=http://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2017/races/963/spain/practice-2.html}}</ref> McLaren Honda's run of poor reliability continued, with home favourite [[Fernando Alonso]] sitting out most of the first session after his car suffered a major engine failure during his first lap.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lewis Hamilton fastest in Spain as Fernando Alonso breaks down|work=BBC Sport|date=12 May 2017|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/39894892}}</ref> Alonso was able to take part in the second session, but had to wait until almost half an hour into it while his team was completing an engine change.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lewis Hamilton top in Spanish Grand Prix practice with upgraded Mercedes|work=BBC Sport|date=12 May 2017|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/39897407}}</ref>\n\nThe third practice session, on Saturday morning, finished with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen quickest, Vettel second, and Hamilton third.<ref>{{cite web|title=Formula 1 Gran Premio de Espa\u00f1a Pirelli 2017 \u2013 Practice 3|website=Formula1.com|date=13 May 2017|url=http://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2017/races/963/spain/practice-3.html}}</ref> Bottas was fourth after his engine suffered a water leak and he was only able to run towards the end of the session, once Mercedes had changed the engine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kimi Raikkonen heads final Spanish Grand Prix practice|work=BBC Sport|date=13 May 2017|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/39907064}}</ref> The Red Bull pair of Verstappen and Ricciardo were again fifth and sixth.\n\n===Qualifying===\nLewis Hamilton claimed pole position from Sebastian Vettel by 0.051 seconds. Vettel was initially ordered to stop the car on track for an engine problem in Q1 but he questioned the decision and the problem was resolved and allowed him to continue. Valtteri Bottas and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen filled up the second row followed by the Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo. Fernando Alonso delivered a shocking result to get his underpowered McLaren into Q3 and then qualifying as the best of the rest behind Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull. The top ten was filled out by [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]], [[Felipe Massa]] and [[Esteban Ocon]].\n\n===Race===\nVettel had a better start than Hamilton and led into the first corner. Then an incident with Bottas, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Verstappen meant that both R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Verstappen retired with suspension damage and Bottas was left slightly handicapped. The incident also caused Felipe Massa to obtain a puncture, while also forcing Alonso off the track, leading them to eventually finish the race outside of the points. This left the top ten as Vettel, Hamilton, Bottas, Ricciardo, P\u00e9rez, Ocon, H\u00fclkenberg, Magnussen, Sainz and Grosjean. Hamilton stuck with Vettel for 14 laps, when Ferrari decided to cover off the undercut by pitting for softs. Hamilton meanwhile stayed out on track for 7 extra laps and rejoined around 7 seconds behind Vettel on the medium tyres. Vettel lost around 4 seconds to Hamilton trying to get past Bottas, who hadn't pitted yet, before completing a spectacular overtake on Bottas.\n\nWith just over 30 laps remaining, the McLaren of [[Stoffel Vandoorne|Vandoorne]] drove into Massa and retired with suspension damage, earning him a grid penalty at the next race. The Virtual Safety Car (VSC) was brought out so his car could be removed and this allowed Hamilton to pit for the faster soft tyres, while not losing much time to Vettel due to the limited speed. Vettel then pitted for the slower medium tyres as was required, just when the VSC had finished, resulting in Vettel coming out of the pitlane alongside Hamilton. They touched wheels and Hamilton was forced off the track and had to fall behind Vettel. Then on lap 38, the Mercedes of Bottas suffered an engine failure (from the engine he had used for all previous races) and this promoted Ricciardo into a podium place. Meanwhile, [[Pascal Wehrlein]] who was doing a one-stop, used the VSC to his advantage and came out of the pits in 8th; he then got promoted to 7th following Bottas's retirement. However, he received a five-second penalty for an error in entering the pit lane.\n\nHamilton, with faster tyres, then managed to overtake Vettel for the lead on the pit straight on lap 44 and held on to the lead to win the race, reducing Vettel's lead in the championship to 6 points and increasing Mercedes's lead in the Constructors' Championship to 8 points over Ferrari. Ricciardo finished 3rd for his first podium of the season and took the 5th place in the Championship from Verstappen. Despite new upgrades, his Red Bull was 75 seconds behind Hamilton, the furthest back they had been all season, and Ricciardo was the only other car apart from the 2 leaders to finish on the lead lap. The next to cross the line were the Force Indias of P\u00e9rez and Ocon. Then Nico H\u00fclkenberg finished in 6th place for Renault, their highest finish since returning to the sport in 2016. Wehrlein crossed the line in 7th but was demoted to 8th with his penalty, still picking up 4 valuable points for the struggling Sauber team, with the Toro Rosso of Carlos Sainz being promoted to the 7th in his stead. Kvyat and Grosjean finished 9th and 10th respectively after Kevin Magnussen, who was running in 9th, suffered a late puncture due to contact with Kvyat and fell to 14th. Fernando Alonso finished in 12th, the first time he had finished a race in the season, but he admitted he was lacking the race pace to go with his superb qualifying.<ref>{{cite

(formally known as the '''Formula 1 Gran Premio de Espa\u00f1a Pirelli 2017''') was a [[Formula One racing|Formula One motor race]] held on 14 May 2017 at the [[Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya]] in [[Montmel\u00f3]], [[Spain]]. The race was the fifth round of the [[2017 FIA Formula One World Championship]] and marked the forty-seventh running of the Spanish Grand Prix as a World Championship event since the inaugural season in {{F1|1950}}, and the twenty-seventh time that a World Championship round had been held at Catalunya.\n\n==Report==\n===Free practice===\nBoth of Friday's practice sessions finished with an identical top six on the timesheet, with [[Lewis Hamilton]] heading the list, his Mercedes teammate [[Valtteri Bottas]] second and the Ferraris of [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] and [[Sebastian Vettel]] third and fourth respectively. Next came the Red Bulls, with [[Max Verstappen]] fifth in both sessions and [[Daniel Ricciardo]] sixth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Formula 1 Gran Premio de Espa\u00f1a Pirelli 2017 \u2013 Practice 1|website=Formula1.com|date=12 May 2017|url=http://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2017/races/963/spain/practice-1.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Formula 1 Gran Premio de Espa\u00f1a Pirelli 2017 \u2013 Practice 2|website=Formula1.com|date=12 May 2017|url=http://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2017/races/963/spain/practice-2.html}}</ref> McLaren Honda's run of poor reliability continued, with home favourite [[Fernando Alonso]] sitting out most of the first session after his car suffered a major engine failure during his first lap.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lewis Hamilton fastest in Spain as Fernando Alonso breaks down|work=BBC Sport|date=12 May 2017|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/39894892}}</ref> Alonso was able to take part in the second session, but had to wait until almost half an hour into it while his team was completing an engine change.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lewis Hamilton top in Spanish Grand Prix practice with upgraded Mercedes|work=BBC Sport|date=12 May 2017|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/39897407}}</ref>\n\nThe third practice session, on Saturday morning, finished with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen quickest, Vettel second, and Hamilton third.<ref>{{cite web|title=Formula 1 Gran Premio de Espa\u00f1a Pirelli 2017 \u2013 Practice 3|website=Formula1.com|date=13 May 2017|url=http://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2017/races/963/spain/practice-3.html}}</ref> Bottas was fourth after his engine suffered a water leak and he was only able to run towards the end of the session, once Mercedes had changed the engine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kimi Raikkonen heads final Spanish Grand Prix practice|work=BBC Sport|date=13 May 2017|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/39907064}}</ref> The Red Bull pair of Verstappen and Ricciardo were again fifth and sixth.\n\n===Qualifying===\nLewis Hamilton claimed pole position from Sebastian Vettel by 0.051 seconds. Vettel was initially ordered to stop the car on track for an engine problem in Q1 but he questioned the decision and the problem was resolved and allowed him to continue. Valtteri Bottas and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen filled up the second row followed by the Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo. Fernando Alonso delivered a shocking result to get his underpowered McLaren into Q3 and then qualifying as the best of the rest behind Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull. The top ten was filled out by [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]], [[Felipe Massa]] and [[Esteban Ocon]].\n\n===Race===\nVettel had a better start than Hamilton and led into the first corner. Then an incident with Bottas, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Verstappen meant that both R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Verstappen retired with suspension damage and Bottas was left slightly handicapped. The incident also caused Felipe Massa to obtain a puncture, while also forcing Alonso off the track, leading them to eventually finish the race outside of the points. This left the top ten as Vettel, Hamilton, Bottas, Ricciardo, P\u00e9rez, Ocon, H\u00fclkenberg, Magnussen, Sainz and Grosjean. Hamilton stuck with Vettel for 14 laps, when Ferrari decided to cover off the undercut by pitting for softs. Hamilton meanwhile stayed out on track for 7 extra laps and rejoined around 7 seconds behind Vettel on the medium tyres. Vettel lost around 4 seconds to Hamilton trying to get past Bottas, who hadn't pitted yet, before completing a spectacular overtake on Bottas.\n\nWith just over 30 laps remaining, the McLaren of [[Stoffel Vandoorne|Vandoorne]] drove into Massa and retired with suspension damage, earning him a grid penalty at the next race. The Virtual Safety Car (VSC) was brought out so his car could be removed and this allowed Hamilton to pit for the faster soft tyres, while not losing much time to Vettel due to the limited speed. Vettel then pitted for the slower medium tyres as was required, just when the VSC had finished, resulting in Vettel coming out of the pitlane alongside Hamilton. They touched wheels and Hamilton was forced off the track and had to fall behind Vettel. Then on lap 38, the Mercedes of Bottas suffered an engine failure (from the engine he had used for all previous races) and this promoted Ricciardo into a podium place. Meanwhile, [[Pascal Wehrlein]] who was doing a one-stop, used the VSC to his advantage and came out of the pits in 8th; he then got promoted to 7th following Bottas's retirement. However, he received a five-second penalty for an error in entering the pit lane.\n\nHamilton, with faster tyres, then managed to overtake Vettel for the lead on the pit straight on lap 44 and held on to the lead to win the race, reducing Vettel's lead in the championship to 6 points and increasing Mercedes's lead in the Constructors' Championship to 8 points over Ferrari. Ricciardo finished 3rd for his first podium of the season and took the 5th place in the Championship from Verstappen. Despite new upgrades, his Red Bull was 75 seconds behind Hamilton, the furthest back they had been all season, and Ricciardo was the only other car apart from the 2 leaders to finish on the lead lap. The next to cross the line were the Force Indias of P\u00e9rez and Ocon. Then Nico H\u00fclkenberg finished in 6th place for Renault, their highest finish since returning to the sport in 2016. Wehrlein crossed the line in 7th but was demoted to 8th with his penalty, still picking up 4 valuable points for the struggling Sauber team, with the Toro Rosso of Carlos Sainz being promoted to the 7th in his stead. Kvyat and Grosjean finished 9th and 10th respectively after Kevin Magnussen, who was running in 9th, suffered a late puncture due to contact with Kvyat and fell to 14th. Fernando Alonso finished in 12th, the first time he had finished a race in the season, but he admitted he was lacking the race pace to go with his superb qualifying.<ref>{{cite

{"title_page": "Road signs in New Zealand", "text_new": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

language|M\u0101ori]]: '''''Waka Kotahi''''') uses a [[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway.

New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

language|M\u0101ori]]: '''''Waka Kotahi''''') uses a [[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Fry1989", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:New Zealand road sign R1-1 (40) (obsolete) + R1-8 (obsolete).svg\u2192File:New Zealand road sign R1-1 (40) + R1-8 (1987\u20132016).svgEdit file name to add years of use.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_New_Zealand"}
